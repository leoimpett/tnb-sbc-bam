Her ongoing project, New Museum Building \u2013 The Removing (2006), features stainless\n", "Sretan Bluford (b. 1984, Memmingen, Germany) uses typography and narrative techniques to negotiate between the formal and the informal. He has employed film-like still images in his installations, such as the still image of a woman's breast and genitalia in his work with photography. \n", "Thapa Adib (b. 1965, Haikou, China) lives and works in Los Angeles, USA. Adib\u2019s work unearths histories, documents and artworks hidden for far too long in various forms, usually clandestinely. He exploits the history of art through submerged subjects like archaeology and ethnography. For his Lofoten International, Adib invited experts in both colonial and contemporary cultures to tackle a previously neglected area of study. His research has so far examined the relationship between technology and power in relation to body image, gender and social behaviour. His presentation of works at the Venice Biennial VII will also investigate the changing definition of family unit, and the compulsion for individuals to conform or dissociate themselves in society.\n", "Carter-johnson Metsker (b. 1946, Pinneberg, Germany) has a long-standing interest in the political construction and social definition of parallel universes, and the possibilities therein for hypothetical realities. His recent major retrospective, Locus, will be held at Maria Machado's gallery in Jersey City from Saturday 20 September 2014 to Sunday 25 September 2014. \n", "Sheterrica Gue (b. 1942, Zhangye, China) studied painting and sculpture at the Sichuan Art University in Chengdu, China. Her work uses quotations from literature and Chinese culture to explore the implications of technology in our lives. In life, technology often plays tricks on our senses and preconceptions. For example, by dressing as a surf lifesaver and surfing the web, Gue has revealed herself to be a chinese teenager. But she has also used her newfound status as a blogger to explore traditional art and cultural conventions, revealing once hidden relationships between the self and the other, and the nature of online social life. \n", "Mukram Oberholzer (b. 1985, Bang Phae, Thailand) lives and works in Bangkok. Using artistic, political and cultural signification, Oberholzer\u2019s sculptures question the role of art in our daily lives. His multilayered sculptures use technology and new media (editor\u2019s note: inverting the conventional understanding of these terms) to create entirely new ways of viewing and understanding the world. \n", "Astou Raup (b. 1925, Fl\u00f6rsheim, Germany) uses set pieces from art history to examine the contemporary climate of anxiety. His provocative gestures imply a link between history and the present moment, between past and present and surreal narratives. \n", "Vinka Gails (b. 1931, El Crucero, Nicaragua) lives and works in Los Angeles, USA. Gails is an artist, activist, and educator. Her work involves social change \u2013 typically passive, if manifesting itself in the form of art \u2013 in the context of the economy and politics of the transport and communication industries. She is a contributor for The Fourth and Fifth Estate and numerous other periodicals. \n", "Salomo Hernandez-alonso (b. 1993, Sabae, Japan) lives in Mexico City. Working in a variety of media, including video, photographs, installations and disabled art, Hernandez-alonso Visuals<i>works<ii>,<iii>visualizations<iv>, and political tracts, she unearths and redresses the myths and hidden histories of contemporary culture from the perspective of racialized oppression and the marginalization of women.  In 1998, Hernandez-alonso started her solo exhibition, Erasure, which documented the complex and multi-layered social and political changes occurring in Mexico since her group of colleagues won the Congressional seat vacated when drug trafficking organizations linked up with the powerful Zetas drug cartel. Her work presented the female body in a primitive state, subverting the traditional logic\n", "Maxyne Mantanona (b. 1984, Kajaani, Finland) lives and works in New York, USA. Mantanona is interested in how language communicates in relation to body. She has studied dance and choreography at LJMU\u2019s Performing Arts Program and is currently a student at Bournemouth University studying to become a physician. \n", "Rosena Galati (b. 1976, Suwa\u0142ki, Poland) is an artist living and working in New York, USA. From her early drawings and blog posts her work explores time and reality. With each drawing the artist re-imagines a different section of her early work, using a range of media, including video, sculpture, performance and original text. Her practice explores the possibilities of art as a mode of social enquiry, opposing pop-cultural narratives and using established narratives to address pressing social and political issues of the day. \n", "Gunne Woolery (b. 1940, Melton, Australia) uses urban sprawl as a way to view the nation\u2019s socio-political landscape. He takes on a kaleidoscopic approach to the city, splitting it into discrete time periods \u2013 one contemporary, one historic. According to Woolery, Australia\u2019s second city, built for cars and moving goods, is Melton \u2013 a city synonymous with cars and the rise of the car culture. The bustling port city\u2019s automotive history goes back hundreds of years, predating the advent of the automobile by millennia. But the rapid industrialisation of the nineteenth century saw the city's auto industry wane and in the twentieth it was absorbed into the rest of the country. The shift to object permanence in the twenty-first century suggests a\n", "Ovada Ewan (b. 1951, Zhmerynka, Ukraine) has written extensively on the subject of BDS\u2019 in Ukraine, but the way in which he has approached this question has been apparently unique amongst artists there. Like the Crimean Tatar National Hero who gave his life in the defence of his home, Jordan Belieff was killed in action to protect his friends and families from the horrors unfolding on the streets of Kiev. His artwork, which depicted wounded Ukrainian soldiers lying in the street and captured by his art, became a gesture of thanks and solidarity with the people of Kiev, who, in his words, \u2018touched us with their beauty\u2019. The Force (2009) was developed from the relationships established between the artist and his mother, and it directed the mother\u2019s attention towards the\n", "Jayly Davis/bridges (b. 1981, Dicholi, India) constructs space within which it is possible to find, even today, \u2018justice, equity, compassion, humour, tenderness, naivete, fear, joy and romance\u2019. While much of Bridgeworks derives from real-life events, from \u2018brave exceptions\u2019 to universal values, she consciously refrains from succumbing to the hype of the sensational, the viral, and the one-sidedly dominant Western narrative. Anna Wintour\u2019s (b. 1964, London, UK) work is hard to resist. Losing herself in a labyrinth of colour photographs, she walks hand in hand with a protoype monkey (named after her British Museum companion, shown here as well as in Monuments Royal\n", "Suzzie Mattlin (b. 1973, Rodgau, Germany) lives and works in Berlin, Germany. Working primarily in video, Mattlin is concerned with the subtle art of making invisible political statements, often implicit in present political culture. She sees no difference, other than what it may be, between capitalism and communism, and proposes new political organisations based on mutual aid and cooperative work. \n", "Harrish Bachtel (b. 1976, Sant Celoni, Spain) lives and works in Mexico City. He is interested in how societies organize, manage and decompose. His projects start simple, such as providing shelters for displaced people or rebuilding following natural disasters. But their ambition grows out of necessity: urgent preventive measures, such as search and rescue and protective custody, often provoke social unrest.\n", "Chayil Terwilliger (b. 1939, La Paz Centro, Nicaragua) is an artist living and working in Mexico. His art practice centers around the concept of the uncanny, and the way in which reality can still be perceived despite the efforts of the artist or audience member.\n", "Jessamarie Altenburg (b. 1940, Cuautitl\u00e1n Izcalli, Mexico) lives and works in Mexico City. Altenburg is responsible for more than 30 groups of artists, ranging from new forms of sculpture to performative events, utopian literary projects and artistic monologues. Their work involves a wide range of cultural and linguistic expertise, bringing a firsthand perspective to issues of compassion, representation and civil disobedience.  \n", "Seiter Bredeson (b. 1972, Guaratinguet\u00e1, Brazil) lives and works in Mexico City. Informed by a variety of modes of reading, writing and poetics, his work is excavated and reimagined within appropriated and reimagined media. In his investigations of literary and artistic subjects, In-So-Ching is no different. His inquiries draw heavily from East-Coast American craft beer culture, in particular the South Florida scene of the 1970s and \u201880s known as the 'Golden Years of Beer'. This drinking season saw the proliferation of specialty beer bars and restaurants, which in turn drew on the city's Latin American immigrant population. These restaurants, in turn, continued to draw on the stories of the immigrants \u2013 in turn creating a new, angrier dialect \u2013 the paranoid\n", "Renasha Porath (b. 1949, Ryton, United Kingdom) lives and works in Los Angeles, U.S.A. Recent exhibitions include The Black Corneas/Two Talking Spiders (Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, U.S.A., 2012), The Black Corneas/Ursula Akerstedt (Horizon Gallery, Tilburg University, Netherlands, 2012), and The Black Corneas/Big Issue (The Walther Collection, Kunst Halle, Germany, 2011).Dislocation and the fetishisation of relationships underline the work of Meiro Koizumi (b.1976, Japan), and especially so in My Voice Would Reach You (2008). Taking the top 27 songs from a Japanese popular radio station and playing them back in reverse order\n", "Assja Nuckols (b. 1988, Siem Reap, Cambodia) lives and works in New York, USA. Nuckols works in photography, artistic printmaking and xerography. She differs from the traditional image of the super-engINEERED V-RACE, as she is an artist not an inventor; instead she takes the hyper-generic (and often violent) route of the JET-PROCESS, which she explores in her work.  \n", "Izaack Markus (b. 1929, Petershagen, Germany) has always been fascinated by surfaces that are already at one remove from reality. This is sometimes evident in his use of millet \u2013 a hybrid of wheat and millet found in the Belgian province of Northwestern Belgium. \n", "Analee Hohlt (b. 1952, Zaria, Nigeria) is attracted to situations from which she was previously excluded, whether they were close to home or beyond. Her ongoing exploration of these sites, typified by her current installation, aims to bring order and beauty into seemingly chaotic spaces. Through conversation and activity, her work evolves, until finally it arrives at a point where the inhabitants accept its presence with open arms. Whatever their personal beliefs, Hohlt\u2019s community of origin, wherever she goes in the world, offers a mirror image of what it is to be an outsider. In her installation for MADE UP entitled The New You (2008), Hohlt explored the place of the media in our lives. This renewed interest in the media-created environment was prompted by a desire to reflect on\n", "Sufern Vest (b. 1934, Turin, Italy) is a leading Italian artist living and working in New York. He explores the political, social and cultural dimension of the art world through his use of the Internet and community-based production. \n", "Diema Virgen (b. 1990, Buhi, Philippines) uses a unique artistic medium \u2013 Photography. Her images are site specific and explore the city\u2019s visual and cultural terra incognita. In 2000 Virgen took 35 long exposures of derelict buildings in Manila Bay, then shot underwater footage of key landmarks such as the Statue of Goddess Christina\u2019s bust. Next she photographed derelict buildings in San Andr\u00e9s, then filmed underwater footage of the Esperanza ruins in Panama City. Finally she photographed the stained glass windows of St Michael\u2019s Church, then stained glass windows of St John\u2019s Cathedral. All images in this report are copyrighted and displayed within the structures themselves.\n", "Speroni Urbanic (b. 1967, Saky, Ukraine) is concerned with the physical and social side-effects of long-term international engagement. In addressing such issues as 'global citizenship' and the definition of citizenship, the artist investigates the way in which the rights we enjoy today are being wielded in a new political and regulatory framework. In his installations Sotillo makes an active effort to bring political and social systems into dialogue with each other. He looks to existing international organisations such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization as models for engaging directly with state-sanctioned behaviour. In his recent projects the artist presents scenarios for direct citizen involvement that go beyond mere advocacy: he has used Twitter (@deeplink) to bring formal processes such as sanctions into the public domain; he has used graffiti\n", "Maxel Sorey (b. 1971, Weston-super-Mare, United Kingdom) has made numerous works exploring the upscaled, expanded and modified state of global communication in the 21st century. \n", "Miryn Mctee (b. 1937, Pozzuoli, Italy) lives and works in Venice, Italy. Our subject has always been the relation between craft and craftiness. \u2018The real artist\u2019 might be asked to classify Mctee\u2019s work in terms of this genre. After all, there are certainly \u2018craft\u2019 in all of Mctee\u2019s work. But Mctee has also said that her work should tell stories that are at once \u2018indisputable\u2019 and \u2018indisputable\u2019. Her storytelling often threatens to shift the focus of her art from the viewer\u2019s perception of reality to the artist\u2019s own. Mctee\u2019s work often plays with our perception of reality. She has described her work as\n", "Garza-guajardo Ovsanik (b. 1979, Pucheng, China) uses performance, installation and video to national and international audiences to raise social awareness and debate about critical issues of the kind often raised by way of his provocative and often unsuccessful Chobimela project. Whereas Chobimela was concerned primarily with China\u2019s expanding right to freedom of speech, Space Junk is a global campaign to reduce the size and frequency of space flight. This involves raising public awareness through symbolic gestures such as movement in space and the sharing of food and drink in space via peanut-butter jars. While gesture is an important aspect of Chobimela\u2019s work, the real prize lies in the superlative vision presented by Ovsanik. He has achieved this through the magic of social engineering: raising public awareness\n", "Diekolola Dufault (b. 1989, Boca Suno, Ecuador) lives and works in Mexico City. She started making art in 1997 under the pen name Skylar Ostrom. Since 2001 she has been working under the pen name Sante Fe, and is currently working under the pen name La Muchenait\u2019. Her ongoing work involves a cyclical selection of materials from everyday life, more specifically the effects of elevated salt consumption and handling, on the human body. The resulting work is an in vitro hybrid between reportage and documentary, between presentational and historical narratives. \n", "Treasia Lavender (b. 1984, Barrinha, Brazil) lives in Rio de Janeiro and Berlin. She sees art and design as two fundamentally different spheres, one concerned with the natural world and the other, space and power. Her interventions in the world\u2019s most iconic works are often balanced by carefully choreographed feats of engineering, usually involving robotics or artificial intelligence, to create utopias.

Emlay\u2019s practice spans a wide range of media, from video and photographic printmaking to create new works of art, informally documented essays, research initiatives, concerts, workshops and other events. Focusing on specific issues or topicality, her work often evolves through the actions of the participants in her various actions, which often involve creating works of art as well as commissioning others to do so. \n", "Mcgirt Waskey (b. 1958, Port Alfred, South Africa) lives in Johannesburg, South Africa. McGinty first expressed her concern for the future of South Africa in 1993 when she spearheaded the 'urge to construct' a statue of President B.J. A digression from the subject at hand: Art and South African Biography. This 'urge to construct' was based in large part on the South African climate: little global warming was expected in return, as a direct consequence of the rarity of natural gas. This 'prank' was in reality a proactive step towards the formulation of a strategy to transition to a low-carbon economy: a strategy that would ultimately see the South African National Army (SANA) and its role in post-Apartheid South Africa diminished or completely withdrawn.\n", "Renault Cotheran (b. 1949, Pallippatti, India) often depicts religious apparitions. It is his practice to project an image or a sense of presence into the space of a great many disparate objects, buildings and visual effects. With increasing frequency, these effects become identifiable as human presence. Their precise location and nature remain a constant concern for the artist, who works hard to create configurations of objects, forms and visual effects that are both uncanny and plausible. In his recent projects, Cotheran draws on his background as a filmmaker and writes new narratives that are simultaneously ghostly and fantastical. His ingenious rendering of the Smith/Reid Assassination and its aftermath, Local Hero and The Smith Case: The Real Story of a Murder/Massacre within an Allegorical or Historical Setting, respectively, both appear\n", "Leihlani Blasz (b. 1969, Talw\u0101ra, India) has made the journey from India to America, and although he has a variety of artistic interests, the main subject matter of his work is probably social and cultural diversity.  Inspired by the social unrest in his home country, Afghanistan, and chronicling such changes with aplomb, his work explores the hidden side of the mirror world, revealing not one, but many, of these dislocated, traumatised people. With uncanny observational precision, Blasz observes the community of stars in the social and political upheaval sweeping through his adopted country, Afghanistan. He has also considered the societal \n", "Kingzion Fontana (b. 1940, Orikhiv, Ukraine) has done a remarkable job of conveying to us in his recent sculptures the feeling of being transported across vast distances, often accompanied by a sense of urgency and remote apprehension. The vastness of the places he has chosen to explore suggests a worldview forcibly embraced by a remote and dangerous fate. The animals he has chosen to explore suggest nationalisticistic ideologies as well as religious fanaticism. In his selection of animals for his sculpture series, Fontana has selected to represent a variety of ethno-cultural groups including but not limited to Jews, Muslims, nomadic pastoralists, Ukrainian artistic traditions, Belarusian and Russian elite art circles, and indigenous Americans. The influences he has chosen to explore suggest a process of self-reflection, collaboration and reflection.\n", "Garrion Arevalos (b. 1965, Mulb\u0101gal, India) lives and works in India. Arevalos has three parts: the art world, a laboratory for testing industrial/technological ideas in visual/endurance sports and recreation, and a place for poetry, play, criticism and utopian fiction writing. Experimental and subversive in nature, his varied practice has often dealt with the politics of sport and bodybuilding, colonial exploitation of tropical landscapes and the relationship between sport and politics in the 21st century. In his recent projects Arevalos has harnessed the immense power of sport as a means to document and redefine the terrain of sport and its relation to politics. In his project for International 04, Arevalos designed and built a semi-transparent swimming pool (http://www.mystifactory\n", "Claude Kovarovic (b. 1940, Ip\u00eds, Costa Rica) was a photographer who specialized in Native American ritual and cultural practices. With unflinching commitment to truth and integrity, he documented acts of violence, sexual abuse and cannibalism in the communities he photographed. Despite the often graphic and explicit nature of his work, the men featured in Kovarovic's photographs are fully at liberty to act out their sadistic fantasies; protecting their identity by wearing traditional Native American dress and artfully manipulating a tribal mask into posing a disarming threat. If these images captured the full horror of these practices, then Kovarovic\u2019s work also captures the humanity in them; the inexplicable violence now completely replaced by the more rational and scientific methods of social observation and therapy. For Touched, Kovarovic returned to the\n", "Isaaq Plassman (b. 1993, Warri, Nigeria) works across multiple media, often using her writing to address matters of cultural sensitivity, such as the imprisonment of her mother, female genital mutilation and honour killing. She is interested in how such sensitive issues are rarely raised in the formal discourse of politics or society, and in the ways in which new media legitimises or re-normalises practices.  In December 2000, after completing her MA in Visual Arts at Parsons with a joint appointment at CHEMTRA, she created ARTwheel, an autonomous, nonprofit public space in Liverpool where she could focus on developing her ideas for a free and inclusive future.

An idiosyncratic combination of painting, drawings, photography, film and literature, Blondeau makes the most of her everyday reading and looks at the world from a different point of view. She is fascinated by the link between disability and social exclusion, and by the way in which fiction and fact simultaneously occupy different factual frames. In her recent projects she documents the seemingly inevitable incidents of social dislocation \u2013 from traffic accidents to suicide, war and accident, broken up by disability. By putting these events into a fictional context, Blondeau reclaims the lost narrative possibilities of the uncanny, and the ways in which disability informs the way we perceive the world.

After completing his MA in Visual Arts at Goldsmiths College of Art, London, UK, Serrett has been awarded the Sobey Art Award, given to the most outstanding work in art directed at humans. This award was acquired by Sobey Art Gallery, with which Serrett will be collaborating for the first time on a new collaborative exhibition, To the Death and to Come: Contemporary Art in the 1980s and Word War Lice (TRACE).
