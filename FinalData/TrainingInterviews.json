And what is your understanding of the role that diet plays in the making of art?\nA. It is, in fact, a central concern of mine. I think a lot of what I do is looking at the very structure of the world as it is and the way that certain things are produced and consumed.

Having heard from Dr. Shipman about Mrs. Grundy's health and how she might have been able to provide for herself, how often would you expect to see her?\nA.

What do you mean by \"post-punk\" by that?\nA. Post-punk is a term that I coined in the mid to late '90s to describe how Russian society has changed over the last 20 years or so. It is a society in which the state controls the means of production and distribution of goods and services, there is no private ownership of any asset, and there is a strong central government.\n\nQ.
