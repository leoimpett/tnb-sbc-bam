In that case, we might consider the question of social impact. 	In the 1990s, the biennial format was modelled on two previous curatorial revivals, the Californian Museum of Art and the New York Museum of Art. The former, the California Museum of Art, staged large-scale exhibitions of new art weekly, while the latter, the New York Museum of Art, staged smaller, local exhibitions of art quarterly, often including works from local artists. The California Museum of Art returned to its tradition of large-scale public art projects in the 1990s, while the New York Museum of Art followed suit in the US and internationally.

Today, we might ask: what can be measured? And if the design of a new kind of laboratory follows the generalised pattern of technological creativity (so that the usual survey questions – what is new and innovative – are replaced by a survey of social and cultural impacts), then we might ask what kinds of questions about the world are being posed by the lab’s outward sign. 	In (a) and (b), the question of what can be measured is being replaced by a survey of social and cultural impacts. But the kind of social and cultural impact that is being replaced is, by and large, being replaced by machines. And since (b) is being replaced by a survey of social and cultural impacts, it follows that (c) will also be replaced by a survey of social and economic impacts. 	Thus, the kind of social and cultural impact that can lead to new knowledge and innovative practices is being replaced by a form of instrumental science that valorises the quantitative over the qualitative.

And if the design of a new kind of laboratory follows the generalised processes of (a) and (b), then the generalised processes of (c) and (d) may well be part of the same overarching science or engineering discipline. 	But back in 1967, Ambasz believed that the fundamental idea underlying all that was new in science and technology at that time was ‘impure’ and would remain so. He argued that our conceptual and analytical systems were impure because they were based on ideas and concepts that did not take root in the cultural context of historical processes, and thus were unable to cope with the complexity and rapid changes that accompanied post-World War II capitalism. The result was a culture in which new ideas and concepts were suppressed or erased altogether, while established ideas and paradigms were reinterpreted and applied to fit new technological needs. This is what Ambasz called ‘postmodern’ thinking. 	But while (admittedly impure) in its conceptualisation of things, (modern) thinking</text>

Today, we might ask: what can be measured? And if the design of a new kind of laboratory follows the general trends since 1950 (as a rule), then (b) might well suffice as a starting point. But (a) is by no means a sufficient starting point; nor is it an exhaustive one. A starting point is essential for any scientific or engineering discovery, and it is precisely this exclusion from the scientific and engineering literature that characterises the present and future ‘standards’. 	The biennial, by contrast, offers a platform on which to engage in what sociologist Helga Nowotny calls ‘deep politics’, one that is not confined within the confines of the museum or the ivory tower. It is a vehicle that is open to analysis and discourse, and it is this openness that bureaucracies and museum sets face. And this is precisely what biennials in their turn strive to present, to get at, to make visible, to enter into the cultural mainstream. 	And this is precisely what biennials can do.

Today, we might ask: what can be measured? And if the design of a new kind of laboratory follows the general direction of (a) and ‘stuff’, then the new kind of laboratory is polluting with (b) and (c) elements. 	Such concerns were clearly on the minds of many people when (a) was proposed and (b) was abandoned. And although the (b) element is now commonplace in research-intensive institutions such as the London School of Economics and the M.I.T. and Harvard Medical School, its abandonment during (a) was notable and (b) may be commonplace in other settings as well. 	The (b) element is pervasive in design and in all settings. It is part of the fabric of infrastructure, part of the aesthetic of cities, and part of the fabric of consumer products. It is a part of the fabric of consumer society, and yet it is also a fabrication. The element of surprise is its own luxury.

Today, we might ask: what can be measured? And if the design of a new kind of laboratory follows the general trajectory of (a) and (b), then we might also ask how that laboratory can monitor, analyse and analyse that new kind of stuff. 	In (a) and (b), the second example, the question is what can be produced by a given amount of raw material. In the case of (c), what is the precise amount of raw material? The precise amount of raw material is always a limiting factor in the production of art and products, since the capacity for art to be produced exceeds the capacity for the material to be produced. 	But the capacity for art to be produced is constrained by a second kind of constraint, namely the capacity for the material to be produced in the first place. The capacity for raw materials to be converted into art lies in the grasp of a skilled labour force, which is precisely what we hear technology create nowadays: engineers, technicians and scientists.

One could argue that the post-WWII boom in science and engineering per se was a ‘time to be’, a period of rapid innovation spurred by government programmes, corporations, and the philanthropists who supported them. But as the years went by and the social pressures of the new ‘foundness’ of capital (which could be characterised as either ‘feudal’ or ‘colonial’) became increasingly apparent, the post-WWII explosion dried up the newness and militarised the process.

Today, we might ask: what can be measured? And if the design of a new kind of laboratory follows the generalised wisdom of the (b) and (c) of today, then we might wonder what new kinds of scientific and client-centred design might be possible. 	The strong implication of the (b) and (c) of (a) and (b) of (temporarily) today is the inescapable need for continuous measurement and recording, both physically and register-wise. In doing so, it raises the stakes of any future aspirations for the measurement of space and for the management of space. It implies that there are, in addition to measurement and recording, politics of recording and measurement. And therein lies the rub: we humans are prone to romanticising and appreciating the minutiae of routine, of course; we are not so easily deterred from romanticising and appreciating the vastness and intricacy of human history.

Today, we might ask: what can be measured? And if the design of a new kind of laboratory follows the generalised pattern of technological creativity that has characterised the modern laboratory for much of the past 200 years, then it is easy to imagine a new kind of clienteles of consumption, one in which the scientist becomes the client, the clientele the representatives, and the consumers themselves representatives of a new kind of technology. 	One could argue that (b) and (c) are questions that are more or less able to be addressed by future generations of engineers, scientists and artists, even if some might argue that (b) and (c) still need to be addressed by those generations of artists and technologists who are still alive and who will be able to produce critical works of art and design. But the (b) and (c) questions that still need to be addressed by future generations of people – questions of justice, social function, social impact, public policy, aesthetics and so forth – are questions that will remain largely unresolved.

And if the design of a new kind of laboratory follows the general trajectory of the agency and the object, then the new kind of laboratory may produce new kinds of objects (along with their users). 	In the contemporary science and technology complex, the question is more obvious: what can be produced? But in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the kinds of experimentation that were once performed in semi-autonomous settings (such as the British Museum’s  	Iron works, operated by professional artists, miners and workers) were supplemented by the kind of industrial scale production that came with modern management (including the mechanisation of production processes and distribution of goods across industrialised nations). Recent biennials, including Liverpool’s, are exceptions to this general rule. 	The Liverpool Biennial was founded in 1994, and its mission statement, 'To celebrate the history and culture of the world through research and analysis', is a powerful statement of intent.

A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, each showcasing a different aspect of the biennial, with a focus on Berlin, was the subject of a public debate taking place in the German journal, Handelsblatt, as part of the 2015 Autumn exhibition project. In a pre-acceleration, pre-biennial way, the debate came to define the exhibitionary character of biennials in the present and future city. In the new exhibition-type events, the scrutinising public is invited to a different world, where things that are not seen or experienced in the institutionally-constructed world of art, or in the actuality of urban life, is allowed to take shape. In the event, the curators take the place of the artist(s), who is now either an inhabitant of the historical artefact (such as a painting) or a construct (such as a building). In this new exhibition-type format, the public is invited to step into the conceptual space of an artefact (such as a</text>

A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, the biennial has long been a device that can be used to communicate about events or individuals in a way that anticipates the media narrative of a moment or person. We might name the artist and the event, the city and the time, place and the occasion. But there is much more to be said about the art, the city, the time and the place that is created by these devices. For a start, careful research is needed when naming works due to the immense volume of work produced each year. Secondly, research on a project’s intended audience is necessary when crafting a work that can be exhibited or forgotten. Thirdly, research on a project’s intended location is essential when selecting a venue for a biennial, because it allows one to speculate about the intended culture of a city or a region. Finally, research on a project’s intended media release is essential when crafting a social media campaign or a website that will be shared or quoted by a range of media</text>

A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, the biennial became an object of scholarly and artistic critique, and a subject of research that became ever more urgent. The January 2015 issue of the Journal of Urban and Regional Research, on the other hand, perhaps offers a window into the mind of the curator. Acknowledging the increasing number of biennials, Patrick Lambertsen, Director of Art Resources International (ARSI), New York, announces that these ‘are the most widely distributed exhibitionary form across the world’[24] and that they are a ‘distributional fulcrum of contemporary art’[25] that supplies the 'subspace' for a number of other forms of art to flourish.[26] He concludes with a sequence of questions that draws heavily on ARSI’s research: ‘What is it that makes the biennial exhibitionary form distinctive? What are its distributional principles? What are the spatial relations between biennials and other forms of exhibitionary forms?</text>

A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, each showcasing a different aspect of the biennial, from an urban or local perspective. The October 2014 event was curated by Sally Tallant with significant contributions from local and national artists. The themes of this brief are ‘art as performance’ and ‘art as a social process’.[24] This was the original proposal, and continues to be the case. The point of this brief is to introduce the artist(s) and the event, as an introduction to the organisation, its objectives and its real-life scenario, and to show how biennials can be used as a production space and as a venue for artistic activity. In this case, biennials are used not as an occasional source of art and culture in a city, but as a production and a place for it. The concept of the biennial has entered into a new dimension in its own right. For the brief, the artist is presented as a single entity, and the event as a whole is seen</text>

A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, the Biennale was a rare exception to the rule that the art world rarely experiences a 'big-bang' event that reverberates globally. The industry was in its infancy, but its rapid real-estate speculation, creative destruction and continuous funding streams have left an indelible mark on much of what is now considered the Western contemporary art form. The biennial has become an object of cultural consumption around the world, and the art world itself is often unsure about what to make of a particular event. This sense of uncertainty is a direct consequence of the industry imposing its will on artworld citizens through economic incentives, tax breaks and other means. The biennial has become the global icon of contemporary art, and its appearance on any major art museum map is a global marker of wealth and power. World biennials are rare or at least very rare in the modern era: as late as the 1970s and early 80s, when the biennial was at its height, only a handful were made</text>

A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, and occasionally curated by curators, as part of the curatorial, ‘how to know’ is the subject of a recent exhibition at MoMA. The exhibition, How to Know, was curated as part of the ‘curatorial years’ (2015–16) exhibitionary cycle, and the curatorial role in this context continues to be an important one. The exhibition opened on 22 October 2014, at MoMA, and will remain on view through 21 December. The topic of this brief is urban and urban policy, specifically, but also urban and landscape policy, in the United States and internationally. The exhibition was planned to open as a ‘periodic cycle’, with works from the previous and next instalment showing in separate areas of the museum. The idea is to display the major works simultaneously, in chronological order. However, the exhibition was originally intended to be viewed as a whole, and its location – in the basement of the U.S.</text>

A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, each culminating in a curated exhibition, was a response to the biennial as a static event, commodified commodity and static object, with particular reference to the cultural tourism industry that had seized control of the biennial. The biennial was perceived by many artists as a potential settlement of longstanding artistic and curatorial disputes, a site for new kinds of cultural negotiation and discovery. Its many curatorial approaches and the multitude of ways in which it can be embedded within a given city seem to offer numerous opportunities for artists and art institutions to generate and leverage knowledge about each other. Curators and artists were able to develop a mutually reinforcing feedback loop of exchanging, analysing and theorising. The more an exhibition was met with by name, image or venue, the more it was likely to be a ‘showpiece’ and thus worthy of the biennial designation. Exhibitionary curating, by and large avoided conflict and uncertainty. It is the job of the curator to frame and organize the exhibition, to</text>

A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, the Biennial provided the venue for a series of creative self-organisations, including a revue art gallery, a temporary cafe residence, cafés, a school of mural painting and a weekly print workshop. Some of these projects, such as the temporary gallery at Tate Britain, a public sculpture garden at the Ansteys Museum in London, and the first public art workshop at the Biennial itself, were established as permanent fixtures in Tate Britain. Like all art institutions, the Biennial experienced decline and it is this history that informs contemporary interventions, whether cultural, architectural or ‘social’. At the same time, it provides the infrastructure for future artworks and exhibitions that can be freely assembled and assemblages into new cultural experiences. In this sense, the Biennial became a ‘storehouse’ of art and an important hub for the global art export market. At the same time, it produced cultural phenomena that reverberated far beyond its shores, influencing not only artists and</text>

It is a true biennale, in that it is a permanent event occurring every two years, and it is, in the main, an exhibitionary event occurring in the main exhibitionary city of Berlin.’[23]III. How to Know About a Biennial, Art and Urban Design Brief, October 2014. A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, among them, the 2014 Venice Biennale, and the 2015 London and Berlin Philharmonic’s symposia, the biennial has enjoyed a kind of exotic place at the intersection of contemporary art and urbanism. It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the biennial was characterised by a kind of pre-modern pre-eminent urban-design preoccupation: the increasingly global emergence of the ‘Postmodern City’, marked by the proliferation of post-WWII urban centres and the occult’s influence. But the biennial today is characterised by an even more fundamental pre-eminent urban-determinant concern – the zealous pursuit of profit at all costs, regardless of how much this costs in terms of lives and property. As P.E. Dewsbury, the former Curator of Open Studios, Art School London and now Curator of Real Estate at the New York Museum of Art, put it</text>
    <text>Should Be Curated by an Artist - Assemble’s Artistic Director, Jean-Christophe Pouget, explains, ‘When the Biennial was first conceived, there was a big gap between the public who came to see art as a spectacle and the artists who created the illusion of art’s presence. Nowadays, the art world would do well to account more frequently and regularly in the biennial calendar. This is because the biennial is a recurring event: it is a big part of the exhibitionary calendar, and its appearance synchronises other major biennials in Europe and North America. It is a true biennale, in that it is a permanent event occurring every two years, and it is, in the main, an exhibitionary event occurring in the main exhibitionary city of Berlin.’[23]III. How to Know About a Biennial, Art and Urban Design Brief, October 2014. A series of public art events that became regular in their own right, biennials have recently emerged as a regularity in the biennial calendar. A number of them, like Liverpool Biennial, are run by an elected Board of Directors, whose remit is to oversee and direct the biennial as a planned, ongoing event. In a general sense, every biennial can be seen to be an iteration of the Biennial concept, although with some notable differences. For example, Liverpool Biennial 2014, curated by Deborah Morgan, was an anthology of works from the past 20 years, whereas Liverpool Biennial 2015, which was curated by Joasia Krysa and David Hockney, was a ‘big-picture ‘event with a ‘twofold’ structure that invited artists to engage with ‘the narrative as a way of thinking’.[24] The term ‘biennial’ derives from the Latin biconuomo- , ‘a numinous quantity’; and its cognates include ‘bi</text>

The main idea was to create a ‘virtual wall’ to separate the public from the virtual space. The virtual wall was to be activated by placing a series of code words on a wall, and then broadcasting that code over the internet. The idea was that the virtual wall would then behave like regular wall decoration. But the more you placed code into the wall, the more it cracked open and enabled whatever you put in. A virtual wall could be shut down by shutting down the code, which in turn would cause the wall to crumble.

This kind of modularity emerged as a way to think about the virtual and the impossible in a new way.In the digital age of the interface, the computer is no longer a static object but an object that constantly generates and updates itself – in other words, it operates on information. To some extent, this implies the breaking down of formal distinctions between computer and man; computers now have souls and live inside of us. But this kind of interface also implies a new kind of language between the computer and the user: man creates and creates through the computer, and through what Avraham Burgels calls ‘the new ontology’ (1982, p. 34). This new ontology posits a future society based on languages and cultural exchange, in which humans once again take on a central place. But this kind of society cannot happen overnight, and constructing such a society is going to be very messy and difficult, so language will be of great help in the long term. Language is a ‘glimmer of hope’ in the face of such chaos, and it seems that the emergence of language as a universal language allows us</text>

But the more code you put into the wall, the more images can be generated and the more complex the system implemented, the more data can be transferred. And so the digital interface becomes ever more capable of monitoring and controlling what is basically a massive amount of space. The degree to which this is achieved depends on a large number of sensors and algorithms, which is why analogue tape is more prone to wear than digital media is. And so the digital interface becomes ever more susceptible to network effects and surveillance. More and more devices are interconnected via the internet, which opens up entire new worlds to intrusion and control. The more images and data you have available, the more images and data can be collected and the data transmitted, the more data can be analysed, the more data can be exported and the more vulnerabilities can be identified. And so the more vulnerable the system becomes, the greater the vulnerabilities. This is a classic haute cout</text>

This kind of modularity emerged as a way to think about the virtual and the impossible in a new way.In the digital age of the interface and the interface alone, the impossible has often been achieved through slightly more conventional media such as paper documents, radio and television sets, and even some packaging materials. But in the age of the interface and the interface alone, the impossible is often achieved through what is sometimes called ‘user-friendly’ software, or ‘hidden features’ that can be enabled or disabled. Here, the author is not so much talking about the things that the user actually sees, as about the hidden features that enable the user to perform certain actions. For instance, enabling a particular feature by simply typing a series of letters or symbols can allow the user to perform certain actions such as selecting a song, watching a video or entering a postcode. But what is sometimes called user-friendliness is actually quite insidious and disguised as nice features. For instance, many electronic interfaces today actively discourage the use of their functions by subtly hiding them from the user.

At the intersection of all of this is the real-life work of imagining one's place in space, whether that is in the form of a building or a person or both. Though in the new ‘present’ media-production techniques of ‘image processing’, what is being asked of the human imagination is being rendered into aesthetically pleasing shapes that can be cut and polished into aesthetically pleasing shapes. And here we can begin to perceive a kind of local creative class that is both talented and unqualified to work in the public sphere. The question is, what kind of work can this kind of architecture produce? Does the answer lie in the arts departments of city centres with their intensive teaching of architecture and urbanism as a production discipline? But if the</text>

But in the age of the interface and the virtual wall, there is a virtual wall composed of seemingly natural phenomena. The appearance of virtual reality in popular culture is a fiction, but the underlying technology is real and can be simulated in software. There are thousands of virtual reality games available on the internet, and thousands of virtual reality websites catering to a particular kind of user – a niche clientele that is highly engaged with the virtual reality medium. There is even a virtual reality television show – check it out, it is brilliant and educational – but it is all a fiction. There is no such thing as virtual reality, and there is no such thing as virtual reality. As I have said, the idea of the virtual is deceptive and manipulatable. And yet, there is always this sense of this underlying realness – that is, there is always this sense of ‘there’. In other words, the way</text>

But in the age of the interface and the virtual wall, things that seem routine or logical suddenly present a new kind of complexity and new kinds of interaction. In this sense, the virtual and the machine are now engaged in a kind of ‘intersectionality’ between the physical and the virtual world. This kind of complexity arises due to the fact that the systems that power the internet are themselves often reactive and opportunistic. They act quickly to meet consumer demands, but are also responsive to geopolitical and economic fluctuations – and this is why the internet is so powerful and so malleable. If the global economy is to be reinvigorated, we need new kinds of architectures that can continuously generate and respond to changes in the real world.But what kinds of real-world systems are needed? And how do we create them? I would argue that we already have many systems that do a disservice to the</text>

And although the system might initially seem intimidating, it really does become apparent how to use it. This is perhaps what user-friendly interfaces do: they present the user with an experience that is simple, convenient and powerful, but also leaves the user with a sense of agency that comes from understanding the intentions of others. The sense of agency that comes from understanding how software works comes from understanding how software is made. And although the user might initially have a hard time grasping what the intentions of others are, once the system is made aware of them, it is able to infer the intentions of the user. For example, suppose the user interface suddenly became aware of the content of emails sent or received on the system. The user interface then recognized that there were several different modes of transmission</text>

In this sense, the interface is no longer a mysterious and magical place, but a chaotic place that constantly challenges and mistakes us. And this is what the future (and I mean the future that everyone is talking about) would mean if everyone had a digital device that looks like a physical device but which operates in mysterious and unstable ways.The main reason why I enjoy this work is not because of the beautiful artwork, or because of the utopian visions of a utopian digital utopia.

But the more media is interconnected, the more interconnected are the different layers that make up the interface – not only in the sense of layers and layers of cables, switches, dials and plugs, but also in the sense that you are surrounded by electronic sensors that constantly monitor and record your position, velocity and depth. This kind of monitoring and recording, and the evolving nature of the system that it creates, makes perfect sense when you are in direct interaction with it. But what does not make perfect sense when you are immersed in the flow of time and space is the way in which media is interconnected in our contemporary world. When you turn on a TV or a radio, you are exposed to a constantly changing stream of information, news and information – constantly on the lookout for leaks and interruptions.

You either love it or hate it, and images of love are powerful, but they are no longer suitable as visual stimuli. The popularity of graphic ephemera – images with a story – suggests a desire to record and analyse these images, but their current form suggests a desire to share them. There is a temptation to embed these images within other media, to embed them in social interaction, to embed them in narrative archiving. All of these behaviours are attempts to recapture what makes an image interesting in new ways.But all of this feeds into a kind of virtual sterility in which the interests of a particular organisation or a particular person dominate all others.

For more than a decade, cultural capital (CC) – cultural production funded by the federal government through the MAP grant and run by the Canadian Centre for Cities – has been the vehicle that has transported goods, ideas, music, art, travel and other cultural products across the country during the summer months. It is thought to be the single largest vector of migration for artists and others with artistic ideas in the country. Its development in the 1980s coincided with a significant increase in the number of visitors to the Vancouver art fair, and subsequent boom in the arts education niche. The CCC’s research and development arm, the CADETS, was founded in 1983. It was originally established to provide support to artistic enterprises with projects outside the institution of art, and was an element in the so-called ‘cultural punch card’ that characterized the early part of the CCC’s history.2  Today, the CCC is a national arts organization with a mandate to promote arts and culture across all domains of Canadian society. It is an integral component of the federal government’s multi-million-dollar cultural tourism package, and plays a critical role in supporting research into the art</text>

For more than a decade, cultural capital (CC) – cultural production funded by the federal government through the MAP grant and run by the Canadian Centre for Cities – has been the vehicle that has transported goods, ideas, images and people across the country – all while remaining below the radar.1 It is this ability to move rapidly and fluidly across national borders, both physically and metaphorically, that has allowed the machine to assume vast new functions and assumed a new formality. For example, the federal government has funded Chi-Ri Kung’s Pilgrimage to explore the Great Bear Lake, and artists have been commissioned to create interpretive artwork in both Chinese and in English in Hong Kong and China. In the case of Chinese cultural institutions, the rapid expansion of the system required that artists develop sophisticated workarounds for the ambiguities of the language and cultural nuances of the city, as well as for the fact that in the center of the system sits what is essentially a federally funded propaganda campaign.2  Similarly, when the National Endowment for the Arts was established in 1998, the President declared that the major form of support for arts education would come from the Arts</text>

For more than a decade, cultural capital (CC) – cultural production funded by the federal government through the MAP grant and run by the Canadian Centre for Cities – has been the vehicle that has transported goods, people, ideas and services across the country in order to influence political outcomes in Canadian cities.1  In 2014, the federal government increased the MAP allocation from $5 million to $10 million, and this was followed by an additional $5 million in 2015. In 2016, the allocation was doubled to $20 million. These funds enable cities to establish their own online cultural production and innovation zones, which can then be incorporated into local civic curricula and engage in ‘creative class’ activities with young people. While the primary beneficiaries of this largesse are likely to be those with a direct economic interest in promoting cultural tourism – which is likely to increase consumer spending and create jobs – the CCC also has a direct economic interest in the urban expansion of its visitor-focused tourism product,2  re-urbanization, which is likely to lead to increases in population and potentially serious displacement issues.

The CCC has an annual budget of CAD$100 million and is responsible for the creation and maintenance of cultural infrastructure across the country. The MAP grant is a unique federal financial tool that enables the creation of new ‘local cultural districts’ and the establishment of hybrid cultural zones that promote the interaction of local people, often through explicit or implicit collaboration with government, in ways that are mediated through art, architecture, recreation, sports facilities, etc. that are not necessarily mutually exclusive but are often strongly influenced by one another. The key to effectively incorporating people into such urban spaces is for such civic bodies to actively engage with the practices and generate the capacity to imagine and to facilitate such possibilities through what Wu-Ping Tan describes as ‘infrastructure socialization’.5 This can be done through the provision of publicly owned resources, the creation of culturally responsive local government, and the active participation of citizens in shaping</text>

The CCC is an arm of the federal government with broad support for activities related to cultural resources and identity in Canada. The MAP grant is a unique public-private partnership established in 2000 to jointly support the activities of the CCC through projects across the country. The funding sources for the MAP project are separate but interconnected. The largest contributors to the project are listed below, with additional financial support allocated through a competitive tender process. The project has a $5 million maximum contribution from the federal government and a $5 million maximum from the private sector. Funding sources and allocation policy can be found in the document Culture Calendars – A Cultural Multiplier, prepared by the MAP Alliance and the Government of Canada, 2000. 	The largest single individual financial contributor to the project is the Federal Government of Canada. Over two-thirds of the total project budget in Canada is provided by the Canada Culture and Heritage Department [Gice</text>

For more than a decade, cultural capital (CC) – cultural production funded by the federal government through the MAP grant and run by the Canadian Centre for Cities – has been the vehicle that has transported goods, people, ideas and services between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The process of port infrastructure development is a complex mix of economic, social and political factors, but the key to its success has been the socialisation of collective decisions. As a result of these collective judgements, and the emergence of new technologies that monitor, control and enhance the mobility and productivity of infrastructure, CCR has shifted from focusing on infrastructure development in Canada to other parts of the world, including in the United States. 	But what has been the socialisation of cultural institutions in the Pacific Northwest and the United States?

For more than a decade, cultural capital (CC) – cultural production funded by the federal government through the MAP grant and run by the Canadian Centre for Cities – has been the vehicle that has transported goods, ideas, knowledge and music across the North to be assembled in cities across Canada. The CCC was founded in Montreal in 1869 and is a non-profit corporation chartered under the Canadian Charter of Human Rights in 1958. The mission of the CCC is to disseminate and implement ‘the values and practices that constitute the basis for a culture that works for all Canadians’ by promoting cooperation, dialogue and mutual aid among citizens, residents and non-citizens alike. The CCC is the oldest and most prominent national cultural centre for artists, creators, writers and others interested in creating social and cultural change. It is also the originator of a wide range of cooperative arts and cultural enterprises, including the creation of the Choreographer�s Cooperative, the Calendar Commission, the Archives and the Archives section of The Gazette.

(Adapted from The Life and Fate of Network Culture, 2010.) For more than a decade, cultural capital (CC) – cultural production funded by the federal government through the MAP grant and run by the Canadian Centre for Cities – has been the vehicle that has transported goods, actors, ideas, music, art, and other cultural products produced in Canada across the Pacific to locations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. During this time, the vehicle has delivered tangible benefits to communities in Canada and around the world. However, in recent years, commerce has replaced culture as the primary medium through which goods, people, ideas, and culture circulate between creators in Canada and those in other parts of the world. As a result, the vehicle has increasingly fallen under the radar until now, when a number of viral artworks and movements emerged in response to the increased connectivity and mobility of people and goods. These are often called ‘citizen curatorial initiatives’, but in truth, they are initiatives conducted outside the traditional art and cultural context of the MAP grant and the Canadian arts organization CAN Arts.1  (2) and their participants come from diverse socio-political, economic, and geographical backgrounds.

For more than a decade, cultural capital (CC) – cultural production funded by the federal government through the MAP grant and run by the Canadian Centre for Cities – has been the vehicle that has transported goods, ideas, artists, ideas, culture and people across the country ‘locally, regionally and nationally defined boundaries’.1 As cultural capital accumulates, so does the need for artists and designers to develop local and regional strategies for future growth. For cities – and certainly for artists – the development of cultural capital entails developing a robust arts council, an arts council of tomorrow, one that coordinates with municipalities in implementing arts and culture campaigns across the city, and one that coordinates with the National Arts Centre and other federal agencies when undertaking projects outside the city. The role of the artist, designer, artist and organisation is then to negotiate the requirements and parameters of the city in an attempt to produce cultural outcomes that are mutually exclusive. 	In the 1980s and 1990s the arts were typically represented as a diffuse and transient phenomenon, present in venues across the city, diffused throughout the region and diffused among diverse communities. However, over the past several decades, as the importance of the arts</text>

For more than a decade, cultural capital (CC) – cultural production funded by the federal government through the MAP grant and run by the Canadian Centre for Cities – has been the vehicle that has transported goods, ideas, artists, musicians, and other curators of significance from the port cities of Vancouver and Toronto to the rural centres of Alberta and Saskatchewan.2 It is a rarefaction of the modernist modern urban, in fact: few places in North America harbour cultural attractions as strongly as Vancouver and Toronto, which together account for over half the world’s population. But despite this economic emphasis, the two cities that emerged as the sites for the 1986 Venice Biennale and the 1990 Sydney World Exposition found themselves competing for cultural supremacy with a rapidly emerging ‘super-exhibitionary’ biennialism that sought to capitalize on every last detail about the former port cities. The ‘super-exhibitionary’ meant that artists had to be located in a particular location, and the MAP allocation policy demanded that a certain number of works per city be produced. But the biennale that year proved even more prescient in its artistic choices, including the ‘80</text>

While walking through Central Paris, he came across a small workshop where artists were crafting DIY kits for the nascent biennial. Among them was Anna Povinelli, another of Lecat’s students.

[…] 	[…] The goal of the Biennale is to connect to the present moment what it means to be contemporary, to capture the theatricality of the contemporary experience, while also endeavouring to bring about a change in the social composition of the biennial as a cultural institution. To this end, the Biennale has taken an active role in the social construction of urban space, often employing local and indigenous artists as artists curators or promoters of the projects.][2] One could ask if there is still a role for art in this context?

Anna’s involvement, both as an artist and as a curator, is significant, as is her attestation to the fact that she went beyond simply joining a group of artists to actively contributing to the development of the biennial.  Such is the artist’s, and it is the curatorial’s, power. But how to use this power effectively? There are of course many paths to the biennial, and there are many factors that need to be considered in the commissioning process, but the key is to recognise the following: the importance of visibility and the politics of visibility; the acute need to define and represent the current state of affairs; the politics of conditionality and the politics of transformation; the need to be able to connect with the moment and the place; the need to be able to interconnect; and finally, the need to be able to listen to and understand</text>

The Academy offered the biennial space to the museum, in turn, for a fee but without charge. Biennials have their roots in the nineteenth century but have expanded in scope and range over the past two centuries, sometimes going further back than that. The Academy has its roots in the collection of Clement Greenberg, the curator of the first Venice Biennale, who arranged for the exhibition to be shown in the gallery of the newly established May Day Center in Lower Manhattan. Greenberg arranged for the gallery to house a large sculpture collection, which included works from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the F. W. Bond Gallery, the M. E. Loring Gallery, and the N</text>

The biennial was one of the first art museum visitors had to account for and constantly re-imagine what the art might be like if it were a museum. As biennials, they also act as intermediaries between the artist and the museum, holding the other in check while the artist projects his or her own uniquely made and constructed experience. As such, they play a crucial role in concealing, describing, and projecting the unknowable. Biennials have been around for a very long time, have a social purpose, and are part of a museum complex. They are, moreover, the first to encounter artistic projects outside the academy. This is why</text>

The Museum of Modern Art has curatorial discretion, at least in theory. And while the Museum of Modern Art and Museum of Contemporary Art have very different curatorial styles, there is some evidence that these newer curatorial styles are evolving along similar lines. For example, the Museum of Modern Art, which focuses on art from the past, has recently installed a series of interactive exhibits online that recreate the history of art from the museum collection through multimedia equipment.

In their book The Museum Years, [beginning with Lecat’s first year (1866)] and reprinted in their Collected Essays, [beginning with Lecat’s second year (1902)] Paul O’Rourke and Norman Browning recount the genesis of the biennial as an institution, its influences, and its critics. As the biennial grew in popularity and scope, so did its criticism, which was published in literary and literary-literary journals. Among its critics was Ruth Hunt Moore, who wrote in The New York Times in 1906: ‘The biennial has become aesthetically significant in its own right.’ She concluded: ‘The biennial has become the museum, the museum, the […] and, therefore, the city.’[5] And she wasn’t</text>

Previously, the museum was the focus of the biennial, while the biennial itself took up part of the exhibitionary complex. The shift in emphasis was most clearly indicated in the number of museums that year: eighteen in total, from twenty-one in 1991. In 1990, the biennial was in its tenth iteration, and the main attraction was its capacity to house several artists in a state of continuous flow. The ‘antiquity’ of the biennial was underscored by its multiple readings, each one a reading from a different point of view. This reading, in turn, was supplemented by a multi-layered printmaking that added colour, texture, light and movement to the artefact. The ‘episodic’ character of the biennial soon after its inception signalled a particular change: the biennial</text>

While the street life of the museum collection may have a kind of ‘glamour’, in its construction and consummation it was a kind of *grip* that slowly began to exert a kind of unbounded grip on the biennial.It was during this period of biennials on the same streets that the punk scene was developing, and proto-punk was a term first used in reference to the art forms of the period: ‘Punk’ on the one hand, and the biker gangs on the other. The term itself was coined by American artist Max Brooks in 1970. In the years since Max Brooks’ punk rocketsymed the age of the biker, other artists have appropriated the term to describe their work in the same vein. However, in this ‘age’, there is no place for the biker in the Punk/Biker Cooperative</text>

Gallery collections have a vital role to play in the museum system, but more and more we are witnessing the unavoidable and detrimental impact of biennial funding streams. The advent of museums has coincided with a corresponding growth of biennials, which are organizations that, through their collections, enable the museum to acquire material, engage with the past, and contribute to the future of the biennial through what might be called ‘biennial-museum’. I would argue that the museum, despite its occasional tendency to assist the biennial in its historical work, has a critical and perhaps even a decisive role to play in this too. To understand the significance of this, we must return to the word ‘art’ that is increasingly being thrown around in reference to the contemporary biennial. A few years ago, I gave a talk about the importance of biennials as a form of the cultural life of the city. My talk, which was partially inspired</text>

But despite these early failures, as biennials everywhere become ever more institutionalised, ever more globalised, and ever more reliant on tourism, there is much that can be learnt from these early failures. There is much that can be learnt, for example, from the litany of complaints about the monotony and repetition of the exhibitionary biennial in the years immediately after Lecat’s death. There is much that can be learnt from the revolts that emerged among artists, curators, and art’s administrators against the multiplicity of exhibitions and subsequent shows, in the years immediately following Lecat’s death (1922–27). There is much that can be learnt from the various biennials of the twentieth century, some of which were quite mediocre in their achievement of their stated mission of gathering together and sharing in a shared experience, but some of which were revolutionary in their inventiveness of</text>

The political implications of this kind of historical-technological reflection are to be contemplated in the context of the massive data-collecting apparatuses of the social connectedness of all kinds. In other words, the social impacts of new media technologies are to be considered alongside their technological impacts.  In addition to their obvious aesthetic impacts, the historical and biographical precedents that connect particular technological innovations with particular social transgressions also exert an impact on contemporary politics and activism. It is this impact that we wish to follow in the wake of the technologies of mass communication and informality. These technologies constitute a new kind of social reality that cannot be provided through traditional means, and so they demand a different kind of political agency and activism from that which is assumed in the realm of art and aesthetic experience.

This concept is similar to the ‘differentiation’ suggested by the term ‘regeneration’. Regeneration is a political concept that seeks to identify when and where technologies of social and economic renewal take place. It is a space where these technologies are created in perpetuity and are assumed by many future generations to be the result of liberal democratic governance. In this context, the concept of the future seems to be of limited value. It is used to describe technologies that are assumed to be present in the future, but which nevertheless have a negative impact on the present and, by implication, future generations. Our own use of ‘regeneration theory’ suggests that there is some potential for misuse. A recent poll on the ‘Future of the World in Your Pocket’ app suggested that many people do not grasp the implications of the effects of climate change. Many people do not understand the negative impacts of over‐pumping natural gas wells, but do not realize that the climate is changing and that this impacts every living thing on Earth. People do not understand that if we do not address the underlying causes of climate change, we will all become extinct unless we</text>

This concept is similar to the ‘differentiation’ suggested by the term ‘regeneration’. Regeneration is a political concept that seeks to identify when and where technologies of social and ecological significance arise (relevance being to some, inclusion to others). Some have suggested that the political and economic effects of the ecological crisis are to be found in the social; others advocate a society of the future in which the ecological impacts of technology become fully apparent. Still others envision a radically different ecological trajectory, one in which the social is actively engaged in creating the means to alter the trajectory of technological progress. It is important to note that all of these different tendencies have to be taken into consideration when considering the possibilities of new technologies and social impacts. In no case can the social operate in an ideal way, or achieve its stated goals. ‘Regeneration’ proposes a scenario in which the urban and the eco-system are actively engaged in defending itself from the negative impacts of a post‐critical technological future. Nevertheless, this ‘regeneration’ raises new challenges for the city and the society that it is designed for. The next section describes the initiatives</text>
    <text>present an online project with a community of users, in which the project's aim was to provide a common platform for the exchange of ideas and experiences through the use of a ‘digital stage’’.[13] This digital stage was intended to be a bridge from the past to the future, connecting the present with the future. While the current digital behaviours of many communities are in some ways reminiscent of ‘how things used to be’, in others, they are digital‐negative and digitally mediated. A dialectical relationship was proposed between the past and the present, where the past and the present are actively engaged in creating ‘differentiations between now and what could be’.[14] In other words, the digital technologies of the present are positive in their historical artifacts and negative in their technological effects. This concept is similar to the ‘differentiation’ suggested by the term ‘regeneration’. Regeneration is a political concept that seeks to identify when and where technologies of mass communication and technological innovation take place, in order to catalyse political change and to ask: do we still need to inhabit the past in order to understand the future?[15] While the concept of ‘regeneration’ has gained popularity in the last few decades, its precise definition remains unclear. Although many activists and academic disciplines advocate for a return to an active and dynamic digital society, a closer reading of the movement’s manifesto, ‘Regeneration of the Radical Imagination’, reveals a more nuanced and explicit application of this ideal to the contemporary political situation. As stated by the manifesto, ‘We, the undersigned, demand a radical regeneration of the urban fabric – a transformation of urban space and yet no more, not greater – in the interest of humanity… We, the urbanists of today, want nothing more than the splendid old days when cities were dynamic and alive with life, activity, creativity and imagination.’[16]</text>

This concept is similar to the ‘differentiation’ suggested by the term ‘regeneration’. Regeneration is a political concept that seeks to identify when and where technologies of history are most active, and how this impacts on contemporaneous political and social practices.[15] In the contemporary political context of the ‘regeneration’ concept, active entanglements between public and private actors are common. It is this which makes technological innovation ‘regeneration’ possible, while its negative effects are most visibly felt in the context of the social but are increasingly felt elsewhere in the world. These social and spatial transformations accompany or accompany with them. In developing its own concept of technology and politics, the emergent political concept of ‘regeneration’ was used to explore how the emergent technologies of the social are imbricated with a social purpose. This social purpose is understood as the emergent politics of technologies and their social effects, and politics is seen not simply as an interlocutor in the making of technology but one that actively contributes to its success through its shaping, shaping, and publishing. In this sense, political actors may be</text>

This concept is similar to the ‘differentiation’ suggested by the term ‘regeneration’. Regeneration is a political concept that seeks to identify when and where technologies of cultural signification come from and take effect, and how they emerge and perform under different socio-political and economic conditions. It derives from the political concept of ‘regeneration planning’, which seeks to adapt a landscape to support a future ‘culture of living ecosystems’. While the concept of ‘regeneration’ is often associated with the environmental movement, its application to the urbanisation of large swaths of the planet is far from straightforward. The environmental movement was initially founded on the premise of ecological catastrophe, and the desire to recreate the planet through passive consumption – an idea with a clear, negative connotation. In many cities, the ecological imperative is actively engaged with achieving a ‘better’ version of the city through active technology adoption. Yet, in many other cities, the ecological imperative is actively disengaged from the city in many or even most cases. The fact that cities are sometimes densely populated but economically anaesthetised also has a positive</text>

This concept is similar to the ‘differentiation’ suggested by the term ‘regeneration’. Regeneration is a political concept that seeks to identify when and where technologies of history transgress certain social, ecological and political boundaries. It is an approach that seeks to understand how this historical ‘regeneration’ is facilitated by, or is prevented by, technologies of data capture, monitoring and control. In a 2017 interview with Jon Jha, Jha reflected on the term ‘regeneration’ and the contemporaneous digital technologies that inhabit it. He argued that the contemporary political situation requires a dialectical and combinatorial combination of ‘regeneration projects’ to address the issues of abundance and poverty and the related issues of climate change and sustainability. These projects must address the social, economic and political dynamics of regeneration, in order to emerge and maintain relevance, he suggested. These developments and their associated technologies are expected to grow in complexity and expand in all relevant areas throughout the world.

Regeneration is a political concept that seeks to identify when and where technologies of social, economic and spatial reorganisation take place, and how these ‘regeneration’ processes may be triggered or initiated. It is an approach to envision technologies of new coexistence and co-existence that do not necessarily conform to established political, economic and urban paradigms or prevailing ideologies. While technologies of ‘regeneration’ may well facilitate ‘differentiations’ in the future, they also seem to generate or facilitate specific political ideologies and socio-cultural practices that are in some ways symptomatic of a more or less apocalyptic future. That is to say, the spread of *climate change’ is a by-product of the ‘regeneration’ process, with dire consequences for human society in the here and now. As Brad DeLong, the director of the Earth System Research Laboratory at the University of Alabama, notes, the technologies of ‘regeneration’ may well be able to support ‘differentiations’ in</text>

Regeneration is a political concept that seeks to identify when and where technologies of social and economic renewal take place. It seeks to understand technological change through the processes of capital accumulation and technological de-regeneration that are characteristic of contemporary society. The progressive technological revolution that is now characteristic of many parts of the world is an ‘invented’ phenomenon that can be explained in terms of the interactions of historical material and cultural influences.[15] The concept of ‘regeneration’ was further elaborated by the sociologist Carol Becker, who proposed a set of shared characteristics that she termed ‘regenerative categories’:[16]Today, the word ‘regeneration’ is frequently used to describe a particular set of cultural practices that are predicated on the survival of the present and the establishment of a replicating historical archive of practices and ideas.[17] The pejorative sense of the word ‘regeneration’ is that these practices are associated with the notion of a mythical or mythical lineage or set of</text>

We wanted to know what could and couldn’t be represented in the arts, and to do this we engaged the services of a variety of artists, including those who had worked with us before or after the project. We also wanted to know what could and couldn’t be represented in the arts in a historical or contemporary context. We learned that when it comes to representations of artists in the mass media, there is still a great deal of ideological fight-mongering going on, as well as a great deal of self-congratulation. But there is a fundamental lack of understanding of how the media really work, and a fundamental lack of interest in engaging with that lack of understanding. When we learned that the curators we selected had no formal curatorial training, or even a rudimentary understanding of art, we felt that we could have engaged in an art project in a more traditional way,</text>

This can happen through creative reporting and the open exchange of ideas and information (including misinformation and distortion).For the project, we employed a panel of artists and arts professionals as curators, artists and educators to examine the ways in which media could be utilized to engage audiences and foster a sense of place in an unexpected way. We asked them to consider how the media might distort the truth and present an alternative to the prevailing narrative. We were interested in how the media might also help create a sense of place that is not necessarily exclusive or desirable. In other words, we didn’t want the museum to dictate to people what they should and shouldn’t do. We wanted people to find their own sense of place and agency within it.For the exhibition, we employed a similar approach to the arts-and-entertainment complex, but this time we turned the curatorial instruments of the biennale upside down. We asked the artists to imagine a world in which the arts were more prevalent and the biennale was more popular. The implication was that the reduction in numbers and the increase in popularity of the biennale was accompanied by a corresponding increase in funding and public support for the museum.</text>

They were not there to inject art or artistic practices into public spaces or provide art to the government, but to observe, document and speculate on such impacts. Our panel included: Marianne Moore (Architecture), Thomas Newman (Architecture Historian), Peter Carruthers (Director, The Art Fund), Mary Turner (Architecture Historian), Meehan Crist (Education Curator, The Arts Council of Great Britain), Terry Smith (Senior Lecturer in Art History and Exhibition Studies at Liverpool University, Studying Art and Design), Peter Haggerty (Director, National Museums Liverpool), Polly Brannan (Manager, Dolphin Arts Centre), Gareth Whiteford (Director, Liverpool Museum), Tom Lox (Director, Liverpool </text>

We invited local musicians, poets, artists and other artists to contribute narrative elements to the exhibition. We also invited the creators of popular culture to contribute elements of their work to the exhibition. The key was the open exchange of ideas and information. The Museum of Modern Art in New York had recently reopened following a ten-year renovation, and we thought the Museum of Modern Art in New York might be a good place to start a dialogue about contemporary art and the arts. The Museum had curatorial plans to open a new wing dedicated to art from the Global South and the Middle East, and a new art fair in the center of the museum. We invited the artists and arts professionals from the two museums to collaborate with us on a new project. The curators from the Arts Council and the Museum of Modern Art in New York were also invited to join us in Berlin. Curators from the other participating institutions were also invited.

We also employed a writer and educator as a presenter to explore the process by which an artist can be trained to deliver culturally responsive work to a community. Both the artist and the organisation receiving the training utilised in this project would gain a writer’s insight into the beliefs of their communities. The writing could be provided by an independent writer or organisation with a professional standing in the arts. The extent to which the writer’s assumptions are factually accurate is a question that the community would benefit from debating.

We also engaged with the ways in which the arts can be incorporated into everyday life and culture in unexpected ways. Our panel suggested possible practices that might be useful in a city/region/regional office/Creative Agency. Our proposal generated strong responses from the public and from industry; many suggested entirely new approaches. The most innovative practitioners were invited to explore the possibilities for the arts and artists' engagement in daily life in an office, in the art department of a major publishing house, in the art department of a regional non-profit arts organisation or in a community arts organisation; their ideas were put to use. The process that followed was long and fascinating, but it is the engagement with the questions that counts. Questions that continue to plague us.  One of the questions that came up frequently during the process was about perception. Your work often operates through the use of words and symbols; what</text>

Our panelists and we worked together on research-based projects that explored how the arts and culture were interrelated in the lives and work of the local community. Our research led to the development of two schemes: one for children and an adult audience, which addressed issues of empowerment and inclusion, and the other for art and cultural institutions, which addressed issues of access and control. With the support of the Arts Council, the project was put on the map and the Arts Council members who were present in the area continued to support and encourage it. The publicity generated by the publicity stunts and multimedia produced were valuable, and helped to create momentum for the project. The publicity generated by the projects made visible the city and its diverse cultures, including those who might not be identified as local to the area. For example, the publicity of the Elephant in the Room project encouraged people</text>

The panelists were selected on the basis of a potential interdisciplinary approach to the challenges of contemporary urbanisation while preserving cultural identities and histories. They were asked to identify three dimensions of the city’s contemporary urbanisation: (1) identity; (2) locality; and (3) function. I use ‘identity’ to mean the actual people, place, and community; and ‘locality’ to mean the place and community. I think the term ‘identity’ captures what is distinctive about the city; it captures the idea of place, and in that sense, it is both familiar and radical. The term ‘locality’ captures the idea of community; it captures the idea of community, and in that sense it is both familiar and radical. The word ‘identity’ captures both the people and the place</text>

For the exhibition, we recruited Curator Elinor Ostrom, who has a particular interest in the history of art and media studies, and is the director of the Rutgers Art and Media Studies Program. Her dissertation will explore the art and media histories of the Gaza Strip from 1948 to 2005. Through a combination of archival research and participant observation, the project will present a critical and nuanced look at the art and media production in the Gaza Strip during that period. The exhibition will be an extension of the project itself. Elinor will be joining us from September 2018 to assist with the planning of the exhibition and its reception. The two of you will be providing curatorial and technical expertise during the exhibition and its reception.

It is the story of how a few disparate forces, including the power of habit, created a system that beyond anything human imagined possible – and still we move. Doubtless, the characters in this Mercury 'n' Void story came from a very humble starting point – David Bowie was born in 1946, and Patti Smith in 1967 – but they have since grown to enormous proportions, standing among us today as they weave their mysterious webs, weaving our collective memory and feelings of loss. As the character of the story, David Bowie, narrates: you’re almost beyond belief how I've managed to pull it all off. It’s as if every single stitch has been put into it. I’m not some sort of genius; I don’t need any more motivation than you give me. And I’m not some sort of paragon of athleticism either. I don’t need your bullshit. I’m strong as fuck and I'm not going anywhere. But you know what? I’m going to need your</text>

It is the story of how a few disparate forces, including the power of habit, created a system that is fascinating for all of us, despite the capitalistic enterprises that they ostensibly reflect.  [1] The Biennial has been organising for over twenty years now and has over 3,500 artists, curators, arts administrators and other key stakeholders taking part in the ‘big picture’ of what the Biennial could be. In the wider biennial sense, the number one priority for the next iteration of the Biennial is likely to be to establish a permanent home for contemporary art and contemporary art-historical works within the venue’s walls.  [2] The Biennial has its origins in the 1990s when the artists, curators, art administrators and other stakeholders involved in the biennial programme began to identify a set of priorities that would inform the design of the next iteration of the Biennial. For the next iteration, the priorities for the 1989 would be: ‘Create a public realm within which contemporary art can live and be made accessible</text>

This biography is the first part, with photos, and the final part, with text and photos of the characters David Bowie, Marilyn Monroe, Patti Smith, Billy Bob Thornton and many more. It is the story of how a few disparate forces, including the power of habit, created and appropriated many different images of the same people, places and things. For the second part of this book, she has commissioned a performance by the Zig-Zagged Underground Theatre Company, whose work, mostly in the 1960s and 1970s, incorporated a range of styles and subject matter, including dance, graffiti, murals, street art and political activism. She also commissioned a series of prints by a range of artists, including Chris Wainwright, Dennis Hoare, Wendy Harpe, Mary Turner and Sean Paul.The Beauty Myth is the story of two sets of rules: the rules of the mainstream and the rules of the underground. For the mainstream, we are told that beauty is universal; beauty is a natural by-product of our species's evolution; and beauty is the end product of centuries of colonialism and slavery. For the underground, we are told that beauty is in fact exotic and that our species faces extinction</text>

It is the story of how a few disparate forces, including the power of habit, created a mythical, sometimes violent and always flawed hierarchy of postcolonial fashion that persists to this day, often in conflict with those who were once called ‘coloured people’.  Tiffany Rawlinson: You are both British and Queer and both raised in the United Kingdom. What brought you to engage with the diaspora and the global past? L.A. Reid: I came to the United Kingdom in 2010 and 2011, and then in 2015 I moved back to Canada. I came to understand that my experiences in the UK would not be acceptable to the authorities in London, so for me to come to the United Kingdom and start a family in the UK wasn’t an option. I didn’t have a choice; I was detained on 11 and 12 September 2015 at Heathrow Airport, and have been since. My case isn’t unique, but the scale of it is. There have been hundreds of similar cases where people have</text>

It is the story of how a few disparate forces, including the power of habit, created a mythos around certain images and behaviours, and how this came to be known as ‘fashion’. For the second part, published in March 2017, the group David Bowie &amp; Marilyn Monroe together with artist Ingrid Michaelson together explore the power of myth in the creation of a new kind of art. For the third part, to be published in October 2018, the group will tell the story of the riots in Guéckédia, Spain, and the role that technology may play in future.  For more information visit www.tiffanyrawlinson.com or www.melodymica.com.au.

It is the story of how a few disparate forces, including the power of habit, created a new normal, and how that transition affected the world we live in. This is the second in a three-part series on the same subject from The New York Times and The New Yorker. The characters in this biography are drawn from real people - actors, models, writers, academics. They are rarefaction figures in their day, yet have become cultural symbols in their own right. They have become globalised narratives and symbols of consumer culture. The biennial is one of the few places where such characters are regularly encountered. What makes the biennial distinctive is that it happens in the city, in the culture of a city, in the halls of power and in the pockets of everyday people. In other words, it occurs in spaces that are ever-present, yet seldom populated. So the biennial presents us with characters who are connected to specific moments in time, through cultural exchange, but rarely through any of the other formal modes of cultural exchange. The biennial is the rarefaction</text>

The idea was to create a virtual tour of that location. Digital Nomad Network members visited every corner of Akron, documenting the history of the area and creating a 3D map of the former site of the Akron Arts Complex. They took the idea one step further and conducted a year-long ‘home tour’ on every conceivable platform, visiting every corner of the city. They did this in order to document the history of the area and to create a virtual archive of the area’s past.The virtual tour model and the archival approach coincide with the virtual gathering of data that is part of the 'Big Data' revolution that is gathering pace in an ever-widening range of industries. It is predicted that ‘home' will become the number one search term on Google in the near future. The virtual home tour will render historical images, historical events, landmark archaeological sites and draws connections between present and past, living and historical structures.

The 3D home page template project was funded by the Mellon Fund, The Open Foundation and the Open School of Architecture.The online home page template project was a response to a museum’s 2002 ‘found object’ exhibition, which catalogued over 1,000 objects from around the world, including many objects never before seen by a public audience. The aim of the exhibition was to show off the power of 3D modelling. In addition to showcasing forgotten artworks and technology, the 2D and 3D images projected onto a local area or global scale suggested a new way of looking at the world.

Digital Nomad Network members visited every corner of Akron, from the factory to the airport, and created a virtual tour that allowed visitors to every nook and cranny of the city. While the virtual tour provided a unique insight into the city, it was also very apparent which corners of the city were not virtual, but rather ‘real’ – and thus accessed only by those with access to the real thing. At the same time, virtual and real alternatives existed within the network, and visitors were invited to explore ‘harder’ alternatives. Digital Nomad Network members visited all of the corners of the network and constructed virtual tour experiences around particular localities. They visited neighbourhoods and historic districts, visited schools and ‘found’ ones, visited theatres, book-stores, parks and warehouses, and ‘traveled’ mountains. They even built a virtual hotel!

The idea was to create a virtual tour of that location. Digital Nomad Network members visited every state in the Union and over 1,000 cities and held over 200 virtual tours. They also visited countries such as China, South Korea, Lithuania and Estonia. During this time, they visited a number of European cities including Berlin, Lyon, Rotterdam and Vienna. The virtual tour format has persisted in other contexts, most notably in the use of data to identify neighbourhoods or small towns with high concentrations of transient labour, or in the use of mapping to identify places of frequent or long-term human settlement. In this context, the 3D home page could be viewed as a device that collects and distributes data about neighbourhoods and local spaces in order to provide relevant contextual information to nearby or ‘spatial​ ’ visitors. For instance, the 3D model on the home page could be used to identify neighbourhoods with high concentrations of transient labour and the ‘house price index’ – a measure of relative prices – which is a good or bad prediction about where housing is likely to be</text>

Digital Nomad Network members visited every corner of the globe, making 3D journeys in every city in the network. 3D journeys were made inside and outside of the 3D ‘virtual tour’. The virtual tours depicted the locations of thousands of 3D models, each representing a different part of the 3D ‘virtual landscape’. During this virtual tour, the 3D ‘virtual’ was not only depicted in a number of ‘high end’ 3D modelling software packages, but also in thousands of photographs, animation and video clips. These ‘high end’ software packages offered a rich set of features, but were limited in offering an immersive experience.</text>

I am particularly interested in how infrastructure is affected by cultural forms and practices, particularly in the context of postindustrial urbanisation projects. I am particularly interested in how cultural forms, including architecture, create and facilitate transformation. I work alongside several artists, including Nicola Griffiths, who is an Associate Professor in the Department of Art, and Ruth Bremner, who is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Art and Design.

I have a particular interest in transportation infrastructure and how it intersects with art and culture, society and infrastructure. For more than just transport research, I look at how art can be used to address societal ills and political issues. For instance, the site of my youth, Liverpool, is now part of the US/Canada border and my research interests shift from examining the historical role of transit in the city, to examining the political, social and economic conditions of transit for artists and the cities that they serve. In Canada, I have a particular interest in exploring the ways that the National Gallery (the country’s largest arts institution) is complicit in enabling a capitalist political economy by supporting political parties and their candidates, while simultaneously being critical of political parties and their behaviour. In an ideal world, I would like to see all artists and art institutions in Canada participating in this research, but unfortunately, there are many who exert a disproportionate amount of political and cultural power in Canada. So my research often falls outside the purview of their members, academic and research members, as</text>

I am particularly interested in how art and design can function as a ‘bridge builder’ between the past and the future, or how art and design can act as a catalyst that enables future developments.

I have a particular interest in transportation infrastructure and how it intersects with art and culture, especially in the context of art's relationship to politics. I have done research on the oil sands in order to map possible routes for the oil and gas infrastructure of national parks and wilderness in Canada. It appears that the infrastructure of national parks and wilderness in Canada could be transported via rail or the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPST), which runs parallel to the TransCanada Highway and runs parallel to the Trans Canada Highway. The CST serves as an interurban railway serving both Edmonton and Calgary. The CST was originally built to provide reliable transit for Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) trains, but has evolved into an international railroad serving both Calgary and Edmonton. The CST’s rapid growth and expanded capacity have all but exhausted the finite oil resources on the ground. The CST has recently begun the construction of the Trans Canada Highway, which will double the current capacity of the system. The Trans Canada Highway will provide high-capacity transit from the Alberta tar sands to the congested cities</text>

I have a particular interest in transportation infrastructure and how it intersects with art and culture. 	The major airport in North America is in Toronto, Canada. It is a globalist ‘utopia’ in that it maximises the use of resources – building high-speed rail and road networks, tunnels and bridges – and the potential for these to be used for a multitude of economic reasons. For many people outside of North America, these possibilities are not imaginable, and this is part of the reason why art is often critical of the over-utilised capabilities of infrastructure: it speaks of a potential future that is not necessarily realised. 	There are numerous examples of artists and artists critiquing the over-use of natural resources, such as the oil crises in the 1970s and 80s, in which artworks and works of art were often among the first works to be repaired or replaced. 	Art is often seen as an inherently passive agent, incapable of operating beyond its place in society – sometimes this is true of an artist’s work</text>

It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic. The absurdity of the situation is that the young people, as collaborators, would rather spend their free time doing something socially irresponsible and undesirable than actually developing the capacities to contribute meaningfully to their communities.  The persistence of such insidious forms of cultural appropriation is a recurrent theme in the work of the arts education charity The Arts Council. In a recent report, they highlighted the ways in which the social programmes and arts organisations they work with still perpetuate harmful ideas and practices. As an example, the report mentioned a workshop by Connect Four Schools, a project undertaken by The Arts Council and produced in partnership with Welsh Streets Community College and West Midlands University, which saw performers including Welsh Streets students, using recycled vinyl cardboards as building material. The report noted how the artists were unable to connect with the communities they were working with due to the nature of the work – particularly due to the schools they were working with. The report went on to detail how the artists</text>

It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic behind the Education Package (EP) or the proposed Biennial of Arts and Culture. Perhaps it is the innocence lost in the complexity of modern education that requires so much of the young people’s time and energy. Perhaps the ECP would offer them the opportunity to work across the generations and engage with the past through ‘trekkers’ – those ancient human footprints that lead from the past to the present.  A possible counter intuitive approach to the notion that art and culture are inherently opposed is the use of ‘cultural tourism’ to refer to ‘cultural tourism’ as a type of tourism.’ While ‘cultural tourism’ is a form of tourism favoured by the administration, it is clear that the ECP does not value it as a form of tourism and actively undermines any tourism opportunities that may arise from the promotion of ‘cultural tourism’.  A key assumption of the Biennial is that the geographical reach of the project is globally</text>

It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic of the administration in places such as Liverpool where art is often perceived as a subversive force.Art and activism in the 1960s and 1970s was often influenced by the counterculture’s countercultural momentum and the young people’s quest for liberation. In many ways, the counterculture it created was much more innovative and exciting than the art it was challenging, and many contemporary artists were drawn to this radical environmental and activist agenda. The large-scale production of images, large-scale distribution of pamphlets, and the frequent publication and exhibition of ‘Guerrilla Bulletin’s’ annual magazine  were all signs of the times. The magazine was developed in collaboration with Liverpool Biennial, and was co-written by Sandy Volz and Mary Turner (the latter having worked with Turner previously on art projects in Liverpool). The Guerrilla Bulletin was an essential part of this mix, publishing at a rapid pace with frequent updates and additions. The Gu</text>

It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic of the administration in such cases.  The use of social programmes and the arts in the administration of education is a current debate that needs to be addressed. It is certainly true that some of the young people who created and used to edit the online magazine n+1 (now part of the Academia) did so with the explicit intention of utilising their work in education settings. It could be argued that this was a creative perforation of the established forms of collaboration and exchange between artists and educators. The emergence of alternative art and curatorial perspectives is a necessity in the administration of education, but it is equally true that the emergence of online art communitised through social media is itself a necessity. And as the great emancipatory struggles of the past couple of centuries have shown, collaboration and reciprocal exchange is a necessity in the administration of power and property. The twitterati and their ilk are a thorn in the side of the machine, and it is up to us,</text>

It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic behind the work of the artistes and the tribunes of the city, where the art is either actively promoted or imperceptibly erased in order to accommodate the interests of tourism and the art industries.  A more sinister aspect of the ‘cultural tourism’ narrative is that it is often practised under the pretence that it is about reconciliation and reconciliation is occurring between different groups. The administration of the ‘City of Toronto’ seems to have stepped back from this particular narrative, choosing instead to blame the homeless, the drug epidemic, cultural insufficiencies and political intraparty strife on the various travellers and migrants that inhabit the city.  A more sinister aspect of this rationale is that it is being actively encouraged by cultural institutions to do exactly that. It is widely understood now that the main objective of the ‘cultural tourism’ narrative is to draw in tourists as much as possible, and the administration’s recent actions suggest that it may be even easier for</text>

It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic. The fact that the art was produced in collaboration with artists and organisations across the city limits suggests otherwise. The fact that the social programmes were keen for the art to be displayed alongside other useful arts materials raises further the suspicion that there was some kind of collusion or even outright corruption at work.   The outrage and frustration generated by the rescheduling of the Jubilee Arts building and its surrounding streetscapes in to the public realm was palpable. The involvement of young people in this context seems particularly revealing in the context of the current political climate in the UK. It is not always easy to identify an artist or art organisation when you have just met them for the first time, but it is possible to identify a relationship to Jubilee Arts that runs contrary to the stated mission of the organisation. For example, the Jubilee Arts social programmes may have a stated commitment to creating a socially responsive art programme, but the political context and the pressures put on them by the coalition government mean that this is</text>

It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic behind the desire to whitewash the exploitative nature of art and society by virtue of the people who are educated in the art and organisations that produce it. As the Twitter narrative goes, ‘we’ collectively make up for this broken system’.1  The Twitter narrative goes further when used as a tool to delegitimise and subvert those in power. At a minimum, it should be remembered that the young people that were recruited into the art world as art critics and critics were typically drawn from the lowest rungs of the social ladder.  Culture is complex, and as such, features elements of powerful influence. But it is also true that the people who power the art and design narratives are often precisely the people who commit atrocities in the name of social engineering, imperialism, neoliberalism and other social schemes. It is therefore essential that artists and organisations with a social purpose and agenda are ever vigilant in scrutinising all aspects of their work. To be effective,</text>

It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic. The fact that the political will is there to deliver such programmes in the first place means that artists and organisations are often empowered to create a sense of belongingness to an area in order to facilitate participation. It is also common for such organisations to leverage the position of the artist as a mediator between the local people and the art institutions that bestow funding and employ artists. The appropriation of cultural resources can have transformative effects.  A case in point is the appropriation of a painting by the Welsh Streets Community Art Trust in Cardiff that served as the base for the Black-Eden Project, a project that sought to create a landscape where the suicide of one of its members was prevented. The original plan to paint the entire Welsh Streets area of Cardiff with giant black and white stripes was abandoned due to the high cost of painting, which was primarily attributed to inflation. Instead, the artist was advised to apply for funding from the Arts Council, which could be used to construct a new work of art.</text>

It soon became apparent that the educational credentials of the speakers were of little relevance to the needs of the day. The social media savvy of the young people soon attracted the attention of the administration, who arranged for the exhibition to be rescheduled due to the presence of high-profile speakers.  The exhibition was ultimately moved to another location due to the lack of interest, although its content has since been diluted in the interest of the local tourism and art industries. In the intervening years, the identity of the people behind the tweets and online campaigns has been deliberately obscured. In the present incarnation of the exhibition, the voices of the young people are often heard tolling in the background. What is perhaps less obvious is the extent to which the administration actually benefit from such media exposure. It is common for prominent social programmes and arts organisations to employ artists to do work with a social purpose or agenda. One can only imagine the perverse logic behind the new mayor’s cultural agenda of ‘Bringing People Together’.[8]One could ask what would be the alternative to a cultural agenda that is as nebulous as ever, but the answer is complex. The emergence of sustainable economic development through art is a reality of our times, and sustainability is a complex issue that requires nuanced solutions that seek to address both the short and the long-term effects of climate change. The shift towards sustainability for art’s long-term sustainability is a topic of active debate within the art world, and recent biennials and major exhibitions have highlighted some of the key challenges and opportunities of the art of sustainability. Participants in the art of sustainability have often been artists who have had their work placed in contexts of long-term environmental concern. For Tate, which has been developing the art of sustainability for over a century, the emergence of new sustainable practices as a result of the increasing numbers of visitors and the increased consumption of its galleries</text>

One can only imagine the perverse logic of the administration in the UK right now, considering the level of social devolution and the mass media largesse of the UK at large.  A point of departure from the present institutionalised neglect of the perishable arts, this form of labour would seem to offer valuable experience and knowledge to those empowered to enact change through democratic means.  A point of departure from the present institutionalised disdain for art and its practitioners, this form of labour would seem to represent a break with the past and for the sake of art and culture.  A point of departure from the institutionalised devaluing of an individual's contribution to art’s history and legacy, this form of labour would seem to represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the historical and contemporary significance of art and the creative act it entails.

Mystifying Art and Politics in China

It is a term that is often used interchangeably with ‘art’, but in its own right it denotes a set of values, practices, and norms that are intrinsic to the art form and derive from its roots. In this sense, ‘Community Arts practice’ represents what artist/practitioner Stephanie Straine considers to be the unique asset of the art form, which is its ability to bridge the gap between artist and audience.

(JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the collaborative impact is defined as the interaction of individuals in the same field with the aim to produce a shared result. The term colloquially refers to groups of people who work together; in reality, it refers to clusters of related people doing work in parallel. The colloquial use of the term has been used to describe a group of people who share the same workplace, social networks, language, cultures etc. Colloquialisms such as ‘Me and you’ and ‘Me and you’ are used to group members of the same group who otherwise don’t interact. 	However, the colloquial use of ‘Me and you’ and ‘Me and you’ are not accidental but deliberate. They are used as a way to identify groups of people who share common ground, are similar in some ways but different in others, that is to say, they are used to describe individuals who are similar but different from each other</text>

The purpose of an ensemble is to foster the exchange of different cultural practices through the sharing of similar artefacts. (JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the term ‘collaborative impact assessment’ is frequently used to describe research-based projects that seek to understand the specific ways in which art can or cannot be used within collaborative contexts. The purpose of this type of research is often to identify viable art-use alternatives (e.g., through comparison with non-art forms), and to create or enhance the public understanding of art in a specific context through demonstration or reinforcement of a given practice. 	The collective impact assessment of cultural practices is particularly valuable in a globalised media culture like the arts, where the practices within which we (human curators, artists, critics, etc) operate are spread across diverse publics, and often operating in isolation from one another. Collaborative impact studies can offer valuable information about art’s potential to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable world through its practices, but also about how those practices might conflict with one another. In the case of art, this conflict could arise in two ways</text>

The purpose of an ensemble is to foster the exchange of different cultural practices through the sharing of similar artefacts. (JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the idea of the collective extends beyond the direct sharing of space and time with others – including objects. It is seen as a precondition for the othering of others through the sharing of space and time, and for the emergence of practices responsive to the needs of different groups. 	In this sense, the collective is seen not as an entity capable of taking actions independently, but rather as an entity that must be actively engaged in creating shared, responsive spaces and for the sharing of different forms of sociality. (RT) Local, regional, global 	Global cultural exchanges are taking place at an ever-increasing pace, and are increasingly being facilitated by the technological innovations that permeate the contemporary world. In fact, the number of art exhibitions in the ‘big six’ world art metropolises, including Venice, Berlin, Taipei and now New York, more than doubled between 1990 and 2000, while the ‘small six’ world capitals of Milan and Istanbul</text>

The purpose of an ensemble is to foster the exchange of different cultural practices through the sharing of similar artefacts. (JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the term ‘collaborative impact assessment’ is used to describe the state of knowledge about a work of art or an artistic form that is produced and/or facilitated through the exchange of cultural resources. It is used to describe how much an artistic practice contributes to the functioning of a museum or a gallery, and how much it contributes to the production of a work of art. For works that are part of a collage, the contribution of the artist to the collective is a function of the contribution of the gallery, and the significance of the contribution to the art’s legacy. For works that are not part of a collage, the contribution of the gallery is of less importance, but still significant, in that it is production of the art that is produced alongside the art being exhibited. 	The collage format has recently gained new meaning as part of the Biennale, with the new media of social media that collect and analyze cultural data (and make recommendations about what</text>

The purpose of an ensemble is to foster the exchange of different cultural practices through the sharing of similar artefacts. (JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the key concepts that connect contemporary art with the past are being reinterpreted. The collective behaviour of artists is being combined with historical works to create new artistic practices that are responsive to the changing economic and political situations that are thrown up by the interconnectedness of modern and post-modern times. But how to translate this combination of historical and contemporary culture, cultural practices and material forms into new artistic practices while preserving the integrity of the historical exchange? The collaborative impact of such an approach must address the fact that, at the same time, art forms are being made that are responsive to different levels of governmental, corporate, economic and political power. In other words, they do not merely respond to the modes of exchange that exist in a given historical situation – they must also address the socio-politicico-material conditions that exist in that situation. This combination of socio-cultural and material forms is seen as a new kind of art that is both contemporary in its own way but post-modern in its</text>

The ensemble is seen as a gathering place where artefacts from different periods can be gathered and shared (in the form of works from different periods). The purpose of an ensemble is to foster the exchange of different cultural practices through the sharing of similar artefacts. (JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the collaborative impact occurs through the sharing of resources, a process of creation and exchange that creates new forms of cultural organisation. Collaborative resources are the precursors to what later in time will be called social and cultural forms of exchange – in short, what we would call culture in general. But here, too, the social dimension of cultural production is significant. The sharing of artefacts from different periods enables the sharing of cultures through shared knowledge. The sharing of artefacts from different periods facilitates the sharing of knowledge among members of a given cultural group through sharing of knowledge in the form of artefacts. Cultural exchange requires the sharing of knowledge between equals, and the sharing of different kinds of knowledge among equals. The collaborative impact of cultural exchange is realised when resources are pooled together to produce a common outcome – in this case, the sharing of knowledge between peoples on a global scale.

(JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the term ‘collaborative impact assessment’ is frequently used to describe the design and development of infrastructure, including cultural institutions, to support the exchange of ideas, knowledge and practices across cultural boundaries. In the context of a large infrastructure project, the responsibility for the project’s cultural impacts ultimately lies with the local community. However, with the increasing global circulation of information and communications technologies, ‘communication infrastructure’ is increasingly seen not only as a site of exchange but also as a site of exchange between cultures. 	As new forms of economic exchange are created and maintained at the societal level through information technologies, it is imperative that cultural forms take part in these new economic forms as well. In this way, communities not only create but also contribute to the regeneration of infrastructure. 	In a recent cultural geography survey of the UK, commissioned by the Docks Association, eminent cultural geographer, Richard Florida (1996) concluded that the revitalisation of postindustrial coastal locations through</text>

The purpose of an ensemble is to foster the exchange of different cultural practices through the sharing of similar artefacts. (JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the notion of the collective has become critical. The collective memory, embodied in cultural collections and institutions, is seen as an essential building block of any kind of institutionalised memory. But can the collective be reorganized and reshaped through the sharing of different kinds of cultural practices? This is partly what  	collaborative learning is all about. The exhibition format encourages collaborative learning between artists, curators, artists’ social groups, and art’s various creative professions. It also requires that participants in the event engage in ‘differential learning’ – learning from one another, curating for their own work, and so forth. A collective ‘wisdom of sharing’ is instilled in participants through the event itself, and this collective learning is what occasions the acts of archive-reproduction and archive-sharing that constitute the biennial. 	A collective ‘wisdom of sharing’ is also instilled in participants through a series of actions that</text>

The purpose of an ensemble is to foster the exchange of different cultural practices through the sharing of similar artefacts. (JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the terms  	collaborative impact and  	cumulative impact inevitably refer to the same thing – the same thing, after all, with or without the artists involved. In the event of a work of art being assembled from different artists, this is perhaps what we mean when we talk about the collective effect of a single exhibition. 	However, what we mean when we talk about a single exhibition is different from what we mean when we talk about a group of works gathered in a convention centre. We want to find ways of structuring our conversations around what we mean when we refer to one exhibition as a collective experience. A collective experience means that we recognise the fact that we are not speaking from top to bottom but from top to bottom, in a shared dialogue. A collective understanding is needed between the different cultural-economic actors in order to negotiate their differences and find solutions to their problems.

(JL)Collaborative impact 	In the field of cultural exchange, the term ‘collaborative impact’ is frequently used to indicate that a given policy or programme is having a collective effect in a given area of influence (co-generate or ‘inventive chemistry’). In the arts, this could mean programmes that foster cross-pollination between artists and arts professionals, or provide a forum for arts professionals to engage artists’ resources, or educate artists about the value of cross-pollination. In so far as each arts professional is seen as an equal in his or her area, there is a potential for a level playing field in promoting mutual respect and equality between artists and arts professionals. (AKI)Mapping art 	The application of geo-tagging to the art market has recently lead to a proliferation of new global art-networks that chart the trajectories of individual artists and their works over decades.

This is a reflection of the crisis of the biennial itself, in which art is often cited as a co-equal or even a complement to its multiple other uses – a complement, in fact, that art institutions across the world are now woefully unequally placing their resources. The biennial is an episodic phenomenon, which means that it is habitually present alongside or at odds with other historical periods, but it is also a phenomenon that develops organically, on-time and on-budget – something that other historical periods do not do. And it is this organic quality that biennials strive to cultivate.

Kübler-Ross’s position stands to this day.If ‘the biennial is a museum of the future’, then the biennial as a whole must also be a museum of the present. And if the biennial is to retain its institutional qualities (its curatorial independence, its independent funding streams, etc.), then it is imperative that it possesses these properties not as an entity, but as a set of relations between people – relations that are neither omniscient nor static, but instead constantly renegotiated and multi-generational. Otherwise, how can the biennial inhabit the contemporaneousness of contemporaneity? How, for instance, might a biennial inhabit the temporality of contemporaneity? Perhaps the answer to this question is found in the ontology of ‘infrastructure’ – the physical and conceptual infrastructure of contemporary art – which is closely related to the ontology of</text>

Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate entity, separate from the museum, and thus a separate form of art form. And although his overall thesis was sound, his particular case was that the biennial is an episodic museum, and museum-like in its episodic character, with periodic and periodic episodes of development and change. And as we all know, these are some pretty bleak years for art-fundamentalists all over the world. In 2008, the American biennial Arsenale opened in both Venice and Montreal, and will be returning to Venice in 2017. In 2015, the Venice Biennale opened in both the Italian city and the US, and will be staging in Venice in 2018.

Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate type of episodic structure from the museum, and for the museum to reclaim its historical role as the primary repository of knowledge and place – both in terms of its contents and the quality of its representation of those contents. And he was absolutely spot-on. As biennials increase in number, size and range, and as their collections become ever larger, the museum is increasingly reduced to second-class citizen, second-rate and often substandard, with a portfolio that is often a mish-mash of different periods and places. This is a classic pattern. But biennials are not just collecting societies: they are also a form of modern-day ‘timesharing’, in that they increasingly occupy a position of prominence in contemporary global art in ways that are directly influenced by the cultural flows of other periods and times. This is true not only of the museums and art institutions that they visit, but also of those that they do not. The biennial is an episodic</text>

This is a reflection of the crisis of the biennial itself, in which art is often cited as a co-equal or even a complement to its multiple other uses – a complement, in fact, that art institutions across the world are now woefully unequally placing their resources. The biennial is an episodic phenomenon, which means that it is habitually present alongside or at odds with other historical periods, but it is also a phenomenon that develops organically, on-time and on-budget – something that other historical periods do not do. And it is this organic quality that biennials strive to cultivate. A few years before his death in 1998, Rubens Kübler-Ross famously declared that a biennial is a historical episodic ‘tripartite structure’: the museum, the museum and the biennial. Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate and distinct type of institution distinct from museums and other museumary forms. In a later essay, he expanded on these claims, arguing that a biennial is a ‘periodic museum’ with a ‘periodic core’ of exhibits that it maintains alongside other museums. This core ‘periodic’ element is key, because it allows a biennial to present a continuous succession of episodes in a temporality that is both present and present at the same time. It is, in other words, the essential structuring principle of what we might call a ‘biennial’.It should be noted, however, that Kübler-Ross was not arguing in favour of a universal, ‘periodic’ structure of the museum as a museumary building; rather, he was arguing against what he saw as the creeping idolisation of the museum as a quasi-religious phenomenon by modernism and other modernisms that were progressively undermining not only the physical, but</text>

Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate entity, exhibiting the museum’s collection in a non-representational, non-linear fashion. Kübler-Ross was not alone in this position. In fact, many an art historian has followed suit, arguing that a biennial exhibits a form of ‘representational memory’ (not just in art, but in art’s other sensory experiences) – an episodic memory that is ‘fluid, elastic and subject to the whims of its participants’.12 As biennials become more and more ancillary to their collections, and more and more like other exhibitionary forms, they are forced to become less and less art. It is, in other words, only a matter of time. Artists, curators, art administrators, journalists, art historians and artists’ own peers have all become artists, or at least have a better understanding of what it means to be an artist than do we do.

Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate kind of entity distinct from other types of cultural property, such as those held by monuments or museums, that are part of a broader historical archive. Curators, biennials understand this ‘monumentalism’ of the museum as inherently contradictory, while biennials in turn seek to manifest its opposite. If the museum is the primary locus of cultural production in the developed world today, the biennial is the locus of production in developing countries. Today, the museum is the locus of production for all cultural products, but it is the biennial with the least impact on the local economies of countries with which it comes into contact. Developing nations will always have cultural assets to offer developing peoples, but the impact of biennials in penetrating deeply into these economies will be great indeed.The biennial has a distinctive temporal character that is difficult to catalog: it has become the object of its own kind of historicism, that is, the object of its own epis</text>

Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate kind of entity, separate from the museum, and thus a distinct entity – a claim that continues to be fairly widely disputed. Biennials, in this view, also have a distinct essential relationship to the museum, a relationship that is premised upon the museum’s historical mission, its curatorial function, and its institutionalized role of representing and preserving the past. In other words, a biennial is a procedural museum, exhibiting, exhibiting and exhibiting in the museum, and in this way exhibits in the museum and museum alike. A biennial is a kind of episodic museum, exhibiting, exhibiting and exhibiting in the same way that museums do today. It exhibits what it names the cities that produced or were produced by the present, in the same way that museums do today. It exhibits contemporary art making in the same way that museums do today. It exhibits art making in the same way that students do today. It exhibits contemporary art making in the same way that artists do today. It</text>

Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate kind of entity distinct from other historical collections, in this case those held in the Bienal de São Paulo. And he was absolutely right – this structure is a ‘biennial’ in its own right, with its own temporal structure and contents. But this is not just some tangential or abstract notion; it is something that has particular historical and contemporary relevance. In this particular biennial, the museum appears early in the day, in the form of a set of exhibition cases, accompanied by a multimedia installation showing the biennial as a whole. This observation made by Kübler-Ross is symptomatic of a general crisis of the biennial as a cultural form: we are entering a period in which ‘artistic value’ is being systematically displaced by the related concept of cultural ‘value’, which is being increasingly misconstrued and misinterpreted. Art is being made in other places, projects, projects, events all over the world, and everywhere in</text>

Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate entity, and the museum as an episodic museum that would continually re-present itself ‘in a mode of history, within a space-time framework’. He was also arguing that this was ‘a kind of historical episodic mobile museum’, one that convened regularly, regularly visited museums and set up regular online access to excellent historical articles and publications. Kübler-Ross’s ‘mobile’ is a kind of meta-temporalism – of different kinds: the episodic, the transnational and the global. The museum, in its liquid form, is a ‘temporary stop-gap measure’ while the biennial takes root. But the museum and the biennial are in some ways already constructing what may well be considered a ‘liveness’, a kind of historical contingency that is now a dominant historical archetype. And while the liquid forms may yet undergo metainterface, they soon shift to a metainter</text>

Kübler-Ross was arguing in favour of the museum, as a separate entity with a distinct mission, separate from, and above all, sovereign over its collections. And although his ideas may be influential, there is no question that biennials today view the museum as an entity that is frequently infiltrated by their own collections, that is, part of its dynamic. So, far from seeking to create a museum, biennials are keen to establish a multidisciplinary, public museum that exhibits the world through their own collections, that exhibits contemporary art from every possible angle, that exhibits art from every possible place and time. Kübler-Ross’s claim is perhaps a case study in the dynamics of museum-going today, and his own curatorial style is a testament to the fact that such an approach is politically risky even in its current form. But biennial curators today have an even greater responsibility: they are the point of contact between arts organisations, the public and, indeed, the other side. They are artists, they are curators, and</text>
