We set out to work out how we might engage the public in this new future, and in doing so to question the very nature of the future itself. How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning nature into an object of aesthetic wonder? How might we make our urban environment, and the places where we live as objects of wonder, into places of history? The question of aesthetics, naturally, questions these more abstract and traditional categories of beauty. But the simple act of surveying a city from above, and the memory that lives in it, raises more powerful questions than these. What might be lost in the shuffle of modern urbanisation, and what might be gained in the reckoning with the monstrous, and in the reckoning with colonialism and racism that still afflicts us?DESERT STORIES by Ted IngrassiaPhotograph courtesy of the Desert Research Laboratories, University of Arizona.I first saw Tom Vandeputte’s photograph of the now empty streets of San Francisco in the October 1988 issue of Architectural Record.2 �Urban Status Quo, an article that appeared in the magazine as a supplement to the catalogue of projects for the October issue of Architectural Record, vol.</text>

We set out to work out how we might engage the public in this new future, and in doing so to question the very nature of the future itself. How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning nature into something magical and beautiful and leaving our planet behind?What came out of our research was thatarchitecture was seen by many as the rightful place of the postwar order, and there was a feeling that the public realm was being properly utilized. The public was starting to understand that the architects were not above the law, and that the courts were beginning to step in when the public wasn’t happy with what was being done. This led to a lowering of the profile of the law, which in turn opened the way for a greater variety of behaviour. This is what we did with the arches; we installed a mini-constituted town hall, complete with its own mini-constituted mayor, complete with its own mini-constituted police force, complete with its own mini-constituted press, complete with its own mini-constituted courts, complete with its own mini-constituted internet and TV infrastructure, and then we let the residents do</text>

We set out to work out how we might engage the public in this new future, and in doing so to question the very nature of the future itself. How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning a blind eye to its urban problems? How might we instigate a dialogue about aesthetics in a city by inviting the very notion of beauty to be questioned? How might we turn a blind eye to the violence and oppression being inflicted on our planet by those who are neither visible nor inhabitable? We offered several responsive proposals that were both rooted in history but performed a creative act of imagining possible futures for our present in the present. One was a planetary map that illustrated the continents, while the next one, based on globes, projected cities on the sky. The last one, based on a painting and a quote, imagined a tranquil island paradise where people could ‘grow'’ and 'hope’ according to the success of their experiments. The idea that we could take a relatively remote place like Antarctica and attempt to colonise it was not new, but our proposal that we should attempt to do so here on Earth seemed novel and unprecedented. We offered two proposals: one based on actual</text>

We set out to work out how we might engage the public in this new future, and in doing so to question the very nature of the future itself. How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning nature into something we can ‘walk through’? How might we create magical, mixed-use zones where art and architecture can flourish alongside nature’s natural resources, while simultaneously questioning the social implications of this novel form of urbanisation? These were questions that, as architects and urbanists, we felt was key to tackle in the city. We didn’t necessarily know what the future would or wouldn’t look like, but we did know that it would have to be beautiful, and that, ideally, it should be possible to walk through it. We also knew that it would have to be possible to access this future through planning, since we weren’t walking into it already. So, what do we do next? We looked to what had been done in other places, and how we could do the same there. What had been done in other places, then, was to create what we called an ‘ideal city’, one in which</text>

How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning nature into something beautiful and enflaming? Through what mechanisms might we empower the natural resources of a city?Through what means might we create an atmosphere of chaos and disorder through the misappropriation of natural resources? Through what mechanisms might we allow urban growth and pollution to consume the very soul of the city? Our proposal was to find a way to engage the city’s resources with the aim of generating a sense of wonder and enflaming the city through misappropriation – a process that not only generated new jobs but also transformed the face of the city.The assets that we identified as the city’s future waterfront were: a) the architecture of the future b) the urban fabric transformed through the processes of modernisation c) the buildings that constitute the metropolis d) the combination of the two. The aim of our activities was to find a way to stimulate the architectural imagination of a new generation of architects by encouraging them to take over the buildings and assume ownership of</text>

How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning the city into a wonderland? How might we make it so that the city becomes a place where art, or more specifically, the arts, can flourish, but also a place where we, as citizens, can partake in that flourishing?These are questions that, as we saw, are central to the new radical urbanism that we wished to foster. We also saw that it was vitally important to foster a sense of participation in this process, because, as we saw, the radical urbanists we worked with didn’t think of the city as an entity that could be easily ceded or absorbed into wider modes of capitalist circulation. The participation they gave themselves to was marked by a strong tendency towards absorption; their primary concern was turning a city into a geographical island, or at least into a place where capitalist circulation could be interrupted without creating social disruption. In other words, the modes of urban life that we wished to foster didn’t necessarily align with the actualities of city life</text>

How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning our back on the industrial machine we call home? How might we take matters of habit and nature's wisdom in new ways? We visited a few locations in Liverpool that were part of the city redevelopment programme and part of the Biennale circuit, and asked if we could take a fictional approach to exploring the paradoxes of habit and the place of habit in the city.One could say that the project began as a fictional visit to a few locations in Liverpool, and that the places we visited were assembled from real places. But the idea of ‘fictional’ was predicated upon the idea that the future was a very particular place – pre-Industrial Revolution, pre-Twitter – and that the present was an outdated past. Pre-Industrial Revolution meant before the internet and social media existed. Pre-Twitter meant before the emergence of the smartphone. So ‘fictional’ really only extended to places and social networks that could be connected, and that could thus be ‘</text>

How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning nature into something we can ‘walk through’? In doing so, to look at nature through a human lens? Or, to walk on what’s left behind?For this to happen, we had to engage the cultural sector and understand that those with a cultural bent would find a way to work with us. There was a crisis of confidence and self-belief brewing in the area as a result of the killing of La Casa Encendida, and now a group of artists were being trained by the city’s cultural commission. Partly as a result of this, a community of artists and residents was forming, naming themselves the New Generation of Artists. They included artists from the local community, as well as international artists. The group included artists from every discipline, and included leaders from the local arts organisation, the Municipal Art Gallery and the Instituto Mayor de Artes Centro Cultural. They had all experienced the initial stages of frustration and were coming together</text>

We set out to work out how we might engage the public in this new future, and in doing so to question the very nature of the future itself. How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning nature, which has been an integral part of the city for thousands of years, into something we don’t yet understand? How might we bring beauty to a city’s buildings through such methods as plant growth and soil cycling? How might we repurpose industrial buildings as places of wonder?These are questions that invite us to engage in a kind of curatorial dialogue, asking how we might collectively bring beauty to an otherwise barren landscape. How might we collectively imagine things differently? What might be possible through such a project? These are questions that, as we look to the future, may prove crucial in our quest for social transformation.Original ideas and original curatorsSarah Dulac and Prem Krishnamurthy are: 2Up 2Down/Archive 2Up 2Down/Archive 2Up 2Down/Archive 2Up 2Down/Archive 2Up 2Down 2Down/Archive 2Up 2Down</text>

How might we engender a sense of wonder in a city by turning urban space into a landscape that is simultaneously a miracle and a disaster? We started by thinking of how our proposal to turn vacant lots and industrial sites into urban promenades might enfuse a city with life, creating places of wonder and magic where once life was stifled or otherwise condemned. Our concept of magic mended the broken trust between citizens and the government, and between business and government, turning vacant property into something beautiful and convenient for use. This was not a perfect solution all, as we discovered later, but it was our stab at something, a start. And so, in 2015, we launched the KickStarter to fund the project. It was a risky proposition to start from scratch, but the success of the project gave us a start that we can use to expand our ideas and horizons. And so, here we are, five years later, six years into the project, and we’ve reached the funding target. We’ve got some really amazing people</text>

These mutualistic tendencies have become more prominent in the twenty-first century than in any previous, so it is worth revisiting the origins of the collective today in order to understand the logic of the present and future threats. 	In 1961, Ingvar Kamprad published his landmark book Things Fall Apart, in which he analysed the relationship between the arts and the social. His book is divided into three parts: the first part concerns the social; the second part the arts; and the third part the personal. Part of what he has done here is to reprint Things Fall Apart ‘with a new essay and revised map of Sweden’s Cultural Quarter’ in order to show the connections between the social and the arts. Kamprad writes: ‘The social function of art is to a large extent social, and the collective is only an expression of the social.’1  </text>

These evolved out of a time when it was seen as desirable to create a shared set of values and norms among artists, curators, art writers and art’s admirers – to name only a few examples). Today, the collective is made up of many different stakeholders, often drawing on knowledge and resources from a range of other institutions, including but not limited to, trade unions, educational organisations, community organisers, artists’ agents and others. These diverse stakeholders often have different priorities and/or different knowledge about art, culture, social change and art than the institution or organisation that commissioned or manages the art. 	The history of the collective is made up of various episodes that collectively constitute the contemporary  	Towards a World Cultural Heritage. Each episode focuses on a different aspect of the world as seen through the prism of art, culture, language, etc. – an idealised historical situation in which we live in. The term ‘collective threat’ refers to situations where a collective of people are at risk of losing control over their cultural resources; collective is used synonymously with ‘intelligent design</text>

Today, we would say that the collective is an evolving institution, and the practices of the collective evolve with the context in which they are deployed. 	So there is a logic to the way in which art is produced and transmitted, and the ways in which it is reproduced and transmitted. But what has been lost in translation, or under the radar, is how art is produced in the context of postindustrial society. In the context of the collective, postindustrial art has a very different logic. 	There is a tension, which I think people still struggle with, between the logic of the global capitalist market and the ethics of the collective. And I think that is part of the negotiation that needs to take place: the ethical questions are questions of distribution and commerce, and I think that is part of the unresolved contradiction that we live by.</text>

The collective has spread to encompass not only those with artworks on view at museums and galleries, but also those with a professional interest in art and culture, and those with a cultural or identity ‘side’ that is drawn to the art, craftsmanship, colour, patterns, materials and imagery associated with a particular art form. It has become a set of cultural behaviours, norms and experiences that are shared and dependant on one another. 	The collective has spread to embrace social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and blogs, and has even infiltrated non-mainstream media outlets. It is said to amplify the power of collective identities, and to be the de-facto standard by which all others act.

Art and culture today are made up of diverse stakeholders, including artists, curators, art historians, art’s social mission leaders and artists’ social network sites. The range of stakeholders and their expertise is huge, and large organisations are increasingly involved in supporting or creating alternatives to what they consider the dominant paradigm. 	Today, the predominant paradigm is art’s social purpose or social value, and the main actors in this setting are artists, curators, art historians, curators, artists, curators, artists’ agents and art institutions. As a result, the gallery setting is no longer the dominant paradigm, but diverse stakeholders and audiences are increasingly coming into contact and working with artists and art.

Today, the collective is used to refer to a specific set of priorities, but its real definition is the one that emerges from the conversations that emerge from the global artistic and curatorial exchange. It is obvious to anyone with half a brain that the current form of the collective will continue to be a conflict of resources, with artists and arts organisations responding to the current form of the ‘collective threat’ by offering more resources to an artist or organisation if it is seen as providing a greater level of engagement. This logic assumes that the collective will always be short of resources, and that the only way to expand is to hire more people or open a gallery or museum. 	This logic is often applied to the globalisation of art and art history, but it applies equally to the other sorts of organisations that organise and transact art: cities, nations, arts boards, non-profit arts councils,</text>

However, the ‘collective threat’ that the public discourse often reproduces – and which is believed by many to be real – is imaginary and misleading. The public is often portrayed as being on the receiving end of a totalitarian state that implements a policy of oppression and exploitation, where collective action is squandered in the pursuit of profit. In reality, the opposite is true; the public is often used as a source of strength and agency, empowering a particularised imagining of the possibilities of action.

However, the way in which institutions engage with the collective and its members is also an issue that needs to be considered when considering how such institutions should be formed and renewed. The way in which an institution shapes the collective and its development is an issue that needs to be considered in both visionary and structural respects. This could mean looking to how an institution establishes collaborations with other institutions, how it supports the development of art through programmes, how it supports the construction of cultural assets and how it supports research.

The collective has its roots in the nineteenth-century ideas of the ‘collective threat’, and its rationalisations include the creation of national collections, legal personhood for artworks, an organisation of artists in a federation, and codes of conduct for artists, curators and art professionals. These evolved out of a time when it was seen as desirable to create a shared set of values and norms among artists, curators, art writers and art’s many communities, to ensure that these can be shared across borders and that they can ‘talk shop’ in shared projects. 	Today, the collective is used to refer to a specific set of cultural influencers, but its true cultural value is derived from the fact that it is achievable within this framework. In order to be taken seriously, something has to be shared. In order to achieve that, something has to change. If you’re an artist and you’re seeing a digital canvas and you’re thinking about making works of art, you’re not seeing the canvas that you’re making from start to finish. You’re seeing a canvas that has to be assembled. You’re seeing a canvas that’s being designed, but you know nothing about making art from start to finish. 	There are different ways of looking at the collective. 	Some curators see the value of seeing</text>

These days it is common for a curator of Modern and Contemporary Art to be present at a reception for contemporary art, but this was not always the case. 	Today, the practices and beliefs of the collective are woven into the fabric of the art institution, but because of the critical nature of contemporary art and the consequent increase in accessibility to visual media, the cultural dynamics of the moment are shifting. Art institutions are responding to this increased accessibility by creating ‘curatorial electorases’ – electorates with a critical eye on the art’s medium and content, and vocations that actively engage with and demand the aggregation of diverse practices and beliefs. These are the theatres of the present, where diverse practices and beliefs meet in order to make visible the practices and beliefs of a changing world. 	Modern and contemporary art have radically transformed the nature of what was once considered classical art, and this is evident in the number of biennials</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is a repeat performance – in a different form – of the same problems that caused the biennial to fail in the first place.  So what can the biennial do to address these problems that caused the biennial to fail in the first place? The obvious first step would be for the Biennial to cease to exist – and to all intents and purposes eliminate circulation – as a biennial in its entirety. Other possibilities include a restructured ‘biennial with a regional focus’ or an organisation entirely separate from the state as a distinct form.  A possible alternative to ‘the biennial as an institution’, but one that is always on the lookout for ‘new ways to align cultural resources and provide cultural experiences’, is an initiative by the Biennial itself, its boards, artists and curators, academics, journalists and representatives from other arts bodies.  Such an initiative would offer many benefits over the established model, but would also require major</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is a transient exhibitionary form, exhibiting continuously, year on year, whether we are looking at the idiosyncratic exhibitions at major art museums around the world, or whether we are interested in the biennial as a whole.  In this broader sense, then, the biennial is saying far more than it is displaying, which is to say that it exhibits continuously (something that is very much the case with the way in which the biennial form is currently practiced in the UK). This is particularly true in the US, where museums are national historic sites and are therefore looking to exhibit continuously (re-occurring) cultural value in their collections, while internationally renowned biennials in other cities, such as Venice, are looking to exhibit continuously (re-occurring) contemporary art in their collections. Thus the biennial is both temporality and place-making. It exhibits globally at a specific moment in time, as a fixed exhibitionary form, and it is a site of contempor</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is the only form of exhibitionary display of the contemporary world, and also the only medium through which cultural capital is produced.  So while art biennials may in the future be produced in other locations, they will almost certainly reside in the city in which they are produced.  And since the art biennale in Berlin is likely to repeat this cycle again in 2017, it is worth revisiting the question ‘How can the biennial create a space for cultural exchange in and through its geographical area?’.  As Domela suggests, this may involve ‘taking the place of exchange in “differential space”, since “differential space” has a positive but limited use in and through which to live and work’.  The biennial may create what he calls a complex but productive ‘system of co-production and consumption’.  It may be, as Domela suggests, a form of capital-intensive</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is a display of many different kinds of art being presented at the same time: it is a marketplace of sorts, where different kinds of art are bought and sold, and different kinds of art are appreciated. The problem with the museum, on the other hand, is that it exhibits a concentrated kind of art – the kind that only a privileged few possess – and it does so in a way that maximises the privileges of those with a place in the museum.  So the museum becomes both the locus of privilege and of poverty. It exhibits privileged art being produced in a particular way, but it also exposes other kinds of art being produced in a different way.  For example, works made by established artists are frequently exhibited alongside works from emerging artists, while new art is often exhibited alongside popular art.  The museum also exhibits an artist’s collection, but it primarily displays the holdings of a particular artist’s studio.  It may be the case, as</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is an occurence – something that has become embedded in the biennial’s formal and institutionalised form – and as such it is subject to a constant shifting and shifting of cultural capital, with and without any particular causal connection to any particular event or event.  As a cultural form, the biennial has a very particular way of absorbing and distorting cultural life in ways that make it more or less conform to its own constitutive terms.  And as Domela points out, this absorption and distortion of cultural life is precisely what happens in places such as Liverpool where, between 2005 and 2014, a new generation of artists was brought into the Biennial tradition through a two-year long postgraduate programme at the prestigious Dartington Institute in London. For this generation, art history was brought up to date, and the ways in which artists are brought into being through art are brought into question. This is clearly seen in the Liverpool Biennial 2016 art</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is too tangible: the museum, the shop, the street, the theatre, the street and the gallery are all forms of measurement; and measuring sticks are all instruments through which we can measure the diffusion of cultural values. Thus, the museum is often an instrument for monitoring and measuring the diffusion of cultural values, while the street and the gallery become measures of the social and political values they champion.   The Biennial as a Volume 1 Cover Image courtesy of Artistic Legacy. 	The biennial has often been seen as a device that distributes cultural values across borders, but this is not always the case. In the 1980s and 1990s the biennial was a locus of struggle between artist-centred museums and the socially engaged curators who wanted to explore the cultural legacies of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the biennial as a cultural production supported by the state. The biennial as a producer of values is often seen as a ‘front</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is an episodic series – episodic because it is produced and distributed, and its value is established almost immediately upon arrival in a city – but it is also that it is cumulative. It is produced in the city where it is staged, and it continues to be produced in the city where it is held, making ever larger volumes of photographic and textual documentation available online.  And perhaps this is the point: biennials can ‘recapture’ the episodic quality of biennials in a way that they could not replicate in the short or medium term. That is, the episodic can be reanimated in order to be archived, and this is the case for biennials in their various forms: to capture the episodic quality of the biennial as a specific event, to analyze its cultural effects, and to produce an archive of art in the process.  Biennials have a historical and a pedagogical function in and within cities,</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is a transient exhibitionary form, exhibiting many of the same things over and over again, but instead of offering the possibility of alternative spaces or new experiences, it exhibits the exact opposite: the exact opposite of what artists do best.  The same is true of large publics.  As the Biennale’s market power grows, so too does its dependence on its significant other, exhibiting images from many different perspectives and in many different formats.  As these two phenomena become increasingly entrenched, it is becoming ever more important for the Tate Board to ensure that the Tate Biennale does not become another marketised version of itself, exhibiting many of the same images over and over again, but in a variety of new visual forms. This is a basic tenet of how the exhibitionary market is designed: as a system that depends on the ubiquity of images, but also on the commodification of images, and on the support of images. It is this symbiosis of</text>

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is a display of cultural capital: a city-state-funded, ‘once a year’ cultural institution able to announce confidently that it has reached a global audience because it is alive and well in other places.  And this is precisely the problem with which the biennial faced in the 1980s: its capital-exhibitionary form was sufficient to demonstrate cultural worth in other places, but in London and New York, it was not only the city's cultural institutions but also artists who found themselves the subject of the institution’s curatorial sweep and largesse. It became increasingly difficult for artists to imagine their futures outside of the city, and its limits imposed a certain amount of self-conscious self-indulgence.  The reason for this is that the biennial replaced its pre-existing relationship to art as a yearly ritual with the new relationship to culture as a continuously recurring, though less visible form of economic exchange.

As Culture and Capital  Paul Domela proposes, these days the problem with the biennial is that it is a permanent feature, embedded in the city and bringing with it a host of negative consequences. There is no doubt that the decline in value caused by the biennial has been significant, but does not seem to have been sufficiently communicated or deliberate with the public or with the artworld stakeholders to produce significant change in the biennial’s shape or content.  The ‘biennial’ is an episodic format, so its place and time is permanent. It is an episodic format is only valid if the artworld stakeholders are also stakeholders in the episodic format, meaning that they have some kind of reciprocal relationship with one another. In the current biennial economics, this is not the case; the artworld is a relatively insular market place, and its artists are either in the thick of it, experiencing the boom and/or bust of the art market, or elsewhere, experiencing the effects of austerity measures. The artworld is a particularly dangerous place for artists</text>

They note that although there are many different kinds of biennials, there are in common the common human impulse to search for and seek shelter from threats, to connect with familiar symbols, and to consume materials and objects in novel ways. They focus on three kinds of shelter – identification, retrieval, and consumption – and on the biennial as a site of these three kinds of shelter combined.

Their essay collection City of Ideas includes contributions from a diverse range of diverse voices, from critical philosophers to urban planners, from urban theorists to artists. It was written as a ‘challenge to a preconception of the city’ in the form of essays, from its first recorded use in China around AD1200 to its recent proliferation in North America, Europe and parts of Africa. It aims to bring the spatial and temporal diversity of the city into question, using examples from different periods in the city’s history, including its spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and the various forms of cultural colonialism and economic colonialism that it entails. The essays address the present in relation to an imagined future urban landscape, and the practices and ideologies that may result from such a landscape. The collection will be published in 2018 under the title The City in Crisis.Introduction: ‘The End of Postmodernity’ 	There are many different ways of looking at the end of the twentieth century: revolutionary, deindustrialising, utopic, historical and contemporary.

I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s and early 1990s the Arts Council was a very different organisation, one that prioritised cultural preservation and invited artists to develop culturally responsive practices. The Arts Council was much more of a curatorial institution, where the artist (or curatorial team) was expected to produce a work that would meet the council’s priorities – and, by extension, the artist’s priorities – and would be seen as a contribution to the community. And whereas the cultural custodians in the 1990s were able to produce culturally responsive strategies that were acceptable to the political and institutional control mechanisms, the power brokers in the Arts Council have a completely different set of priorities and art is often artist’s work that is seen as valuable and progressive.  	In the Arts Council press release of the ‘early arts community revitalisation initiative’, the Arts Council president Carolyn Docherty emphasises the work of the early arts community as a way to imagine art as a tool for social change,</text>

And it is the Arts Council, through the arts education programme it established in 2005, which continues to support and encourage artists to explore the arts through arts education programmes in schools and youth groups. I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s and early 2000s the arts council established several partnerships: with the Muralists Union in the UK, Bluecoat Arts Academy in the USA and Bluecoat Arts Council International in the UK; Muralists United for Landscape and Urban Art in the UK; and with the International Bluecoats, Chronicle of Arts and Symbolists, whose members included Billie Holiday, Janet Ferguson, Mary Turner, Simone Stewart and many others. I think the key partnerships and partnerships of the 1990s and early 2000s were the result of the Arts Council and the Bluecoat Arts Academy developing a common ethos and asking for resources and support from the Arts Council and the Arts Council. 	The Bluecoat Arts Academy developed its own arts and heritage policy in the UK, US and internationally, and its members included Billie Holiday, who has been a long-term Bluecoat Arts Academy member, Janet Ferguson, who has been a</text>

There were a number of other interventions along the lines of: ‘we’re here to stay’, ‘we’re not here to be objects anymore’ and ‘we’re here to mingle’.

And it is the Arts Council, through the arts education programme it established in 2005, which continues to support and encourage artists to explore the arts through arts education programmes in schools and youth groups. I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s and early 2000s there was a real alliance developing between governments and non-profits, and this has continued to be an important political-ideological and cultural force in this country and around the world. 	The Black-E was a formally constituted art organisation, with a political orientation. It had been operating in London for several years by a rotating charter, and in 2004 it opened a store front in Brixton, which it called Brixton Arts Centre. It had its roots in the Black-E Recordings section, which was a hub for artists developing internationally. The Arts Council, through the Black-E, also funded and supported the development of an internationally visible arts infrastructure, including a multi-year arts education programme for high school students, including a co-operative arts school called Chisenhalee Schools, run by a board of arts professionals. These schools were key in sparking cultural energies in a targeted audience, and the emergence of a socially engaged generation of</text>

I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s there was a period of intense political involvement by the arts organisation, with the aim of re-branding and positioning itself as an arts organisation, and of course the Arts Council had to tread very carefully, because it wasn’t limited to what came out of its mouth. There was a real feeling that the arts council could and should intervene in creative practices, and that’s why we had to have two boards – one for the arts education programme and one for the production of arts production. But the reality is that the arts council doesn’t control the production of the arts, and neither does it control the curricula of arts education or the curricula of arts production. It does control what’s taught, and so it adopted the very restrictive principle of co-production – which is to say, co-production with other institutions and with other creative practitioners. So the real interaction between the arts council and the creative practitioners happened on the margins, and was much less</text>

I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s, when the Arts Council was established, it was only intended to provide financial support to artistic institutions and cultural organisations. But over time, as funding increased, so did the scope of its activities, and funding shifted from the arts towards other priorities – things like education, human rights and law enforcement. So whilst the arts council may have existed in its original form as an entity, it is now a dominant force in providing arts education and empowerment to a large population of people in this country and around the world. 	In 1994, the Black-E was created to replace the Summer of Arabic Voices, when the Arabic and South Asian languages were considered for inclusion in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It was also in 1994 that the Arts Council established its Programme of Education and Art’s Social Value (see section 2.2 of the Black-E’s 1991 Annual Report). 	The Arts Council has a multi-year programme</text>

I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s the Arts Council established a Community Arts unit to support artists working locally through a funded programme across the unit. The unit was established as a partnership between Black-E, the Black-Head, the Black-E Foundation and the Black-E Arts Council. The Arts Council funded part of the unit through grants from Arts Council and other government sources. By the late 1990s, however, the unit was experiencing budget shortfalls and the closure of several venues. So in 1995, the Arts Council established the Community Arts Trust, which provided financial support for artist-initiated projects across the trust's boundaries.  	The development of community art was supported by the Arts Council and the Black-E Foundation. 	The development of alternative art educational programmes was also promoted by the Arts Council and the Black-E Foundation. For example, the Black-E’s art and culture education programme in primary schools continued to be funded by the Arts Council, while Ch</text>

I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s and early noughties, when the Arts Council was a regional body, it funded projects in many areas of the city, including projects in many different parts of the world. In the 2000s it funded a series of projects in the arts hotspot of Liverpool, funded by the Biennale commission, and in 2011 it supported the Tate Liverpool initiative, which invited artists from all over the world to work in and around the museum. At the time, the Biennale commission was expanding internationally, and the projects in many of the hotspots were for an exhibition that year. The idea that the Biennale commission could offer a platform for an artist to explore a geographic area while remaining relatively detached from the area where the art is created is novel and unprecedented. 	The Biennale commissioning agency Arsenale continues to support artists, curators, artists and arts institutions in many parts of the world, including in developing nations.

I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s there was a period when the Arts Council was pushing artists to articulate their intentions publicly and actively, to engage with the Arts Council and the wider community without being intimidated or suppressed. This was seen as a great step forward for community engagement and artistic practices.  	However, as the Arts Council has expanded and changed, and as a perception of the community has shifted, so has the need for art to evolve as well. The Arts Council is still the heart of the community, and while the Arts Council chairperson may still hold influential positions within the organisation, the reality is that in the 21st century it is the minority who hold such power. So how do artists and communities work together? I believe that the answer is in the arts education programme that the Arts Council established in 2005. A key element of this is the provision of resources – materials, instruments and ways to work together – to enable artists to explore art from an artist’s point of view, while enabling the organisation to</text>

I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s and early 2000s the arts council was a pretty centralised place: there were around 150 artists represented across 40 countries, representing over 200 art institutions. Today there are over 400 artists represented across over 150 countries, representing a global audience. In terms of their global reach, they’re everywhere. 	I think it’s interesting that the Black-E started as an art organisation, but has since broadened into a non-art organisation. I think the reason is that the arts council members in the 1990s had a collective vision of what art should be; now it’s an organisation that represents the arts globally in a way that reflects the people who use the arts institutionally. So the art council members in the 1990s had a collective vision of what art should be, but now there’s an opportunity for artists to articulate that vision globally. 	The new generation of artists I think have a much broader perspective and can create organisations that reflect the political</text>

I think it’s amazing how much the arts council has shaped and supported the way art is experienced in this country and around the world.  	In the 1990s and early 2000s the Arts Council established several partnerships, including with local authorities, the National Theatre, Choreographer and the Arts Council, to work with artists on projects around regeneration, engagement and art’s place in urban environments. One of the most successful and progressive arts commissions of the past was that of Janet Seymour’s work with John Lennon at Framburn in 2001, which used recycled products and visualisations of the Arts Council logo to tell the story of conflict and collaboration. 	These partnerships, along with the Arts Council’s long-term research-based engagement programme Projections, are what have kept the arts alive and vibrant in the 21st century and why so many people are still engaged with the very arts-related practices that the arts council started and continues to support. 	Many artists have their own unique set of partnerships, and there are a number of artists who have had long-</text>

It is entirely legitimate for a board to want to take a lead in a graduate student’s career, but it is not a faculty or administrative role. Graduate students have a crucial, if limited, role to play in the development and implementation of the arts and culture agendas of their local art institutions, but they do not have the expertise, financial independence or social networks to exert meaningful political or cultural influence. Graduate students should be engaged in identifying, planning and implementing local strategies for the arts and culture of their area, but they should also be developing strategies to implement the arts’ own (including locally). The MFAE created an Early Career Arts &amp; Culture Initiative, which is an effective way to engage and leverage existing arts and culture resources and to acquire new arts and culture-related knowledge, but it is up to local artists to pick and choose which arts resources to incorporate and which to leave behind. Local youth and artists should take the lead in this initiative, but the MFAE and the local arts bodies should each take a small piece.Graduate</text>

It is entirely legitimate for a board to want to take a lead in a graduate student’s career, and this can be done through the graduate student resource centre (GSC). In fact, the GSC has actively encouraged and even subsidized graduate student initiatives in the local area, through a sliding scale of institutional funding. Yet, the GSC has little or no power in the local area, except as an elected body, and its initiatives are limited to the institutions with a financial stake in the university’s future success. This situation is unsustainable, and the history of the GSC’s involvement in the area shows that. In the 1980s and 1990s the GSC had several grants from the Arts Council of Canada, and in the 2000s the Gaudi Foundation. These grants came with strings, and were not only strings but were executed with great skill and discretion, often set aside large sums of money to pay for unforeseen trips to Ibiza.

It is entirely legitimate for a board to want to take a lead in a graduate student’s career, but it is a graduate student’s job to exert that influence and to take the lead in their graduate student bodies. Graduate student governance should be a source of strength for these graduate students, a source of knowledge and a resource for future research.

The role of the MFAE is to facilitate the graduate student’s pursuit of their chosen field of study and to promote the university’s cultural resources to the wider community through their publications, exhibitions and programmes.

It is entirely legitimate for a board to want to take a lead in a graduate student’s career, but it is not a faculty position and it is not a board position. The board, like the graduate student, is a human resource company that has a responsibility to manage the resources responsibly and effectively. In the context of a postgraduate education, the board’s role is to invest in the knowledge and capabilities of the people they hire, rather than in the knowledge and capabilities of the company.  The board’s role is to invest in the knowledge and capabilities of the people they hire, rather than in the knowledge and capabilities of the company.  As a postgraduate student, you have the opportunity to work independently, to experiment with different graduate school options, and to become part of a multi-disciplinary team that is responsible for overseeing and designing the postgraduate education that will culminate in your doctorate.

It is entirely legitimate for a board to want to take a lead in a graduate student’s career, but the graduate student must exert influence in the board to have that lead exercised. A clear majority of the graduate student body, and at least some board members, would support such a decision. It is my understanding that a majority of the graduate student body does not want to. Graduate student control over a graduate student’s career is a different kind of tenure, in that it is not a job but a capacity that gives agency and choice to those who work in the employ of the university, but it is also a kind of precondition for other kinds of employment. The faculty members and administrators who run the graduate schools and universities have a lot of say in who enters and works within the profession, and how. It is true that within a given field of study, researchers tend to accumulate in large numbers: it is not as if they can choose to be very specific, but there is much more institutionalised recruitment and retention of researchers than there is of people</text>

It is entirely legitimate for a board to want to take a lead in a graduate student’s career, but it is not a mandate or an authority that can override the board’s autonomy and power. For example, the MFAE has expressed an interest in supporting a local artist, but the graduate student council doesn’t seem to want to sanction an artist who engages with the cultural practices of their area. Nor does it seem to want to support an artist who exploits migrant labour. The graduate student council is the employer of the artists, and as such the board should be able to employ the artist however it chooses, without interfering with the artist’s right to engage with their cultural practices. In my view, the board should have been able to supervise the artist and the artist’s activities, but since the MFAE didn’t want to, the graduate student council had to intervene and have the board create an ethos of tolerance and inclusion. This could have been achieved through an independent committee, but since the graduate student council</text>

Contemporary art-histories of the movement were critical of the relatively obscure or marginalised nature of the practice that was being advocated, and its tendency towards the trivialisation of the causes and the settlement of political and social struggles. They recognised the significant role that artists and exhibition makers had in the formation of the social understanding of the movement. They also recognised the fact that the art-histories of the 1980s and early 1990s, while critical, were by and large apolitical, and did not place the social or political movements of the era in a context of their own production or development.  The advent of the twitter was a turning point.  A point at which artists and exhibition makers could start to identify with the new generation of activists, and the social struggles they were engaged with, and with the younger generations of activists in their social networks.  A point where, through the use of social media, activists could begin to create networks with peers in similar practices, and begin to discover each other.  A point</text>

Contemporary art-histories of the black-studies generation are important works, in that they present the complex histories and actualities of the movement, and the ways in which contemporary art-histories are impacted by the history and activism of the black-studies generation. But the valuable ones that present the most concretely to contemporary audiences, like the work of the late, great Wallace Stevens, are the ones that lay at the root of the activism of the art-histories and eventually of the movement itself. Thinking about the Roots of the Black-Study Movement By Thad K. White and Marijke Steedman �Thad K. White and Marijke Steedman sits down for an interview in the first floor study of the Marijke Steedman Gallery, Amsterdam, in preparation for the publication of their book The Black-E: A Cultural History of Morocco in June 2015.

Contemporary art-histories are in many ways more accessible to a general public, and the discourses around them are more readily digestible by a general public that is more open to questioning assumptions and the making of its own realities.   The cultural logic of the black-studies movement is a good example of this. In the 1980s and 1990s, the art-histories of the civil-rights and anti-apartheid movements, and the contemporary work of the like, were central to the discourses of the movement, and the means of making art were concerns of an ever-widening range of voices. So, the discourses about art and the role of culture emerged at an ever-widening range of voices. But they also developed in response to specific artists’ particular practices, and so we can draw on this example. The discourses around art and the role of culture in the 20th century are complex, and while we can learn something from the discourses of the artists who</text>

Contemporary art-histories and their narratives of protest, agitation and radical engagement with contemporary art (or less obviously, with social and political struggles) are a useful political tool for the socialisation of information and ideas, and the maintenance of existing hierarchies of power and control. In this sense, the work of a contemporary art historian or artist is like that of a social activist or historian. It is a means to an end, and through a particular set of social processes, a position from which new claims may be emerged. It is not and cannot be a social scientist or a curator, because social theory and the discipline of art-histories don’t really connect to the contemporary situation. A social historian or a curator would have to be trained in a discipline like history, sociology or anthropology, and have a specialist set of skills in the social organisation of knowledge and knowledge-making. These would need to be developed and honed in the course of their research, and would need to be applied in a real-</text>

Contemporary art-histories of the Black Lives Matter movement, for example, draw their inspiration from the work of Black Arts collective, as well as from the work of other activists such as Marija Cetinic, whose work from the mid-1990s is the subject of the forthcoming Dolphin Tale.  Contemporary art-histories of the movement are often very eloquent in their accounts of the loss and grief felt by the communities they examine, but also often lament the loss of imagination and sense of humour. These writers often feel that the responsibility for the wound-up-and-running of the art-world, both at home and abroad, lies with the individual artists who have a cultural or intellectual edge over other artists or critics. But this is often seen as a burden on the community – both at home and abroad – to bear.  Art-histories and their discourses are written from the personal perspective of the artist, the community, or the locality. But this personalness, this</text>

Contemporary art-histories were often written by and for artists, or for artists who were activists or historians in their own right.  In the 1990s, the work of artists such as Rankin, Tito Vilmain or John Akomfrah, whose works were often commissioned by the Arts Council or the Biennial, is an example of this. Artist-organisations, and especially those affiliated with the arts council, funded and supported by the biennial, began to play a more significant role in the creation and the development of art practice.  Contemporary art-histories, and the artists who wrote them, often provided a vehicle to think about the past and present in a way that was both accessible and provocative. Just as important, though, are the works of those who came after them – writers, artists, curators, librarians, historians – who have made and continue to make art and art in ways that are relevant and potent in their contemporary contexts.

Contemporary art-histories of the movement were frequently written by and for white artists, and their activism was often seen as being motivated by the support of, or at least in correspondence with, that of artists of colour. The proliferation of race-neutral art-histories of the movement, and the consequent reduction in representation of the movement amongst artists and audiences of colour, is another example of how contemporary art is often seen as having been largely or entirely dictated by white artists and audiences.  Another example is the proliferation of curatorial practices and curatorial methods that place a premium on the individualisation of aesthetic experience, and thus valorise the self-actualisation of aesthetic producers. Examples of this in the art-histories of the movement are numerous.  The exhibition-system, its obsessive curatorial planning, its emphasis on the ‘right to be there’ and its promotion of ‘aesthetic needs’ are all signs of how the art-histories of the 1980s and 1990s</text>

Contemporary art-histories of the black-studies movement, by and large, add nothing new to the conversation. But a rich body of research and a steady stream of new artists, curators, arts administrators, artists’ compilations and critics have gradually begun to build up a body of knowledge about the movement that is more nuanced, more nuanced yet more tenuous than the work of any one person or group. The accumulated knowledge is accumulating at an alarming rate, and new artists, curators, arts administrators and critics are constantly being recruited into the movement. As the biennale researcher Polly Tallant questions in her recent book about the Venice Biennale, Why Venetians Attend Art Biennales, there is a constant need for the artistes to be visible in order to the movement’s ongoing narrative of inclusion and solidarity to continue to function as a coherent whole. And this ongoing narrative, which aspires to something more than the presence of an institution or</text>

The Black-Placestills of the Black-Placestills of Africa Network is a network of art institutions in East Africa formed in 1989 to support and promote the work of the art-historical and cultural institutions of the Black-Placestills Area (BPA).  The BPA formed in East Africa in 1989 and is one of East Africa’s twenty-six regional administrations.  The African Centre was established in 1991 and is a regional hub for research, educational and cultural exchange between East and Central Africa, South Asia, Europe and North Africa.

Contemporary art-histories of the black-studies movement are very rare, and its scholars are few and far between. Few black-studies practitioners have had the chance to develop the institutionalised interest and power structures necessary to sustain such narratives, and many of those whose works were commissioned by the curatorial, even in the UK, have left such histories and contexts behind.  Another counter-example is the work of the late, great John Akomfrah, whose work, MoMA selected 2010 as its &quot;Work of the Millennium&quot; and 2016 as its &quot;newest&quot; entry. His work Whistle as Air 2010 reminds us that which we cannot hide, and that which we ought to be able to. The work, which is also part of the 2017 chosen collection, is a repetition of a tradition of silence, dissent and solitude, in which Akomfrah engages with the legacy of the colonial past in ever greater</text>

Modern public sphere describes both the knowledge and the place in which political participation and advocacy is made possible. It is a ‘public space’ that is not simply an arena for competing claims or ideologies but is rich with cultures and peoples with a stake in the outcome of the contest. Modern public sphere is an arena where claims to belonging are made and values are established. It is an arena where agency – agency for particular acts – is positioned at a fundamental level. Modern public sphere therefore needs to be organised according to the principles of inclusion and collective action but also according to the knowledge generated by contemporary modes of collective experience. In other words, it needs to be taken seriously by those who inhabit and inhabit alone.  In his essay ‘The Public Sphere’, James Howard Kunstler suggests a structurally different �</text>

The first definition of inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary (1836) reads: ‘To be reckoned with one belongs first place to the other.’ The second definition, from the 1946 Joint Statement of the Union and Socialist Parties, reads: ‘The contention that the public sphere should be managed according to the principles of inclusion and collective action is a contention of the past.’ It is a statement of past ‘values are past peoples’ ideas of how to live their lives.’ The notion of the public sphere is central to all spheres of social organisation and is a central tenet of progressive democratic government. It is an idea that is deeply embedded in the institutional vocabulary of both mainstream and progressive democratic government but its expression and realisation is currently confined to a small and highly restricted elite of privileged and colonialised peoples.

The historical tendency towards the empowerment of the collective in the public sphere has been a mainstay but the emergence of new entanglements and globally emergent bureaucracies is a more pervasive and pervasive trend. Not only is the public sphere becoming increasingly privatized, but the public sphere itself is becoming increasingly fragmented into competing publics. New entrants to the public sphere include state and municipal governments, non-profit and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), foundations and other powerful institutional actors.

Cultural relativism, i.e. the prevailing belief that there is some inherent value to be ascribed to certain types of social interaction, practices, institutions or structures. In Western culture, this value is usually associated with honour and purity; in East Asian cultures it is usually associated with equality and social interaction. Cultural relativism seeks to understand objective reality through the principles of universal human value; it seeks to understand the essence of reality (i.e. existence) in order to intervene in the world through means that are not understood, and which are never explicitly stated. As a result of this tendency towards an inherently political andworldly meaning of values, cultural relativism has put political agency at the core of understanding the world.

In opposition to the new order of things, they advocated a politics of inclusion and tolerance – one in which public space and civic participation were valued more highly than ever, and public space defended against attempts to deindustrialise it through market socialism and bureaucratic globalisation. Tolerance and inclusiveness were strategic publics, and the politics of inclusion and collective action were fundamental to the establishment of public goods, institutions and public agencies that continue to shape and to be shaped by London and New York’s respective economies, but also by the activities of their respective militaries and law enforcement agencies.

New arrivals to the city are subject to invasive searches, and projects are often developed on the back of the back of refugees and migrants. New immigrants are often subjected to interrogation on arrival in airports about the projects they may be working with or engaging with, and are often not given adequate information or resources to mount a defence. New Yorkers have long been at the epicentre of urban growth and have borne the brunt of policies designed to maximize its benefits – a point made by William Shakespeare in his play, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, where the barbarian king Eric abducts the queen and her family to prove to himself that he is not alone.13 	The exploitation of migrant labour has come to</text>

I went to Venice as a visitor, and then on a very professional basis. I was doing research on the archipelagos, and the fact that at the time, I was working with the Italian conservators Rosie Arsenale, who were putting together a massive new archipelago of islands in the Tuscan bay. The idea was to put together an entirely new type of archipelago – a ‘tentative, persistent, and ultimately unfinished national monument’ – but I came away thinking that the challenge now was to figure out how to publish something that was already in the works of becoming a ‘tentative, persistent and ultimately unfinished monument’. During that time, I was having a kind of a ‘mindfulness-work’ with a local artist named Paola Marrati, who was putting together an art project on the island of Savona.</text>

As someone once said, there’s a silver lining to every cloud.In 2009, I started a community arts organisation called The Community Arts Initiative (CAI) in response to what I felt was a dearth of information and resources in the city for artists and artists to work within. I joined the board of the foundation that is still run by the same trustees who appointed me, and I started a non-profit corporation called The Community Arts Trust to take the art from the trust and put it into works that are artist-led organisations. In 2015, the Community Arts Trust established the Liverpool Biennial, which coincided with the first CAI annual conference. The idea of the CAI was that the organisation would be a vehicle for the transfer and incorporation of art and arts resources into artist-led organisations. I started working as an artist-in-residence at the CAI, and at one point a non-artistic director was brought on as an artist-in-res</text>

They didn’t necessarily follow the curatorial process, but they saw an opportunity to take ideas from the arts and bring them to life through art. So there’s a shift from a curatorial perspective to one of participatory arts organisations. And this shift doesn’t necessarily involve a move away from art in the arts, just an increased awareness of what the arts are capable of producing. The new generation of curators I think listen to a lot more to the community artists they work with, and also to curators who have a long-term commitment to the arts. It’s a mutual respect that needs to develop. I don’t think it’s a shift in the art hierarchy, just a recognition that the art forms they work within are more capable of yielding social change than the art forms they come from. And this is something that urban centres have struggled with for centuries: the inability to do that. If there’s a silver lining to this whole process so far, it’s that there are so many artists now who have their backyards, their backyards, where they</text>

They didn’t necessarily follow the curatorial process, but they saw an opportunity to take ideas from the arts and bring them to life through art. They did this through engaging with tradition, myth and the natural world, and in many ways, redefining what the arts could be.  	The concept of the early public realm was that of a small village, or perhaps a neighborhood or village. The 1980s and 1990s ushered in a new, more urbanized level of culture and urbanization in the metropolis, and this led to a new level of participation and symbolic impact. The concept of the early public realm is that of a large city, but with a sense of the natural world at large. It is a space in which symbolic and physical forms of the natural world are taken into consideration in creating a daily or weekly experience, and in that sense, it is an area where the arts can exert a significant influence. 	When I worked on the  	Bluecoat project in the early 1990s, I integrated a gardening exhibition with a performance from the local community. The intention was to find a way to incorporate</text>

It was about a community of residents coming together to create an organisation to meet the needs of the local residents and to participate in the creation of the local economy. The project came out of a curatorial thinking about how to engage with the problems of the community through participatory methods. I was invited to be a part of the creative team, and my role was to imagine possibilities and work through possibilities. My role was to find creative ways to engage people in the project through a hands-on way. I was also given the task of finding the money to bring the project forward and to continue the work after the project had been commissioned by the arts organisation. I found the funding challenge to be very interesting. If you take the time to understand the funding and social determinants of a project, you can start to imagine how those different</text>

In the public sphere, the arts organisation was seen as a provider of arts education, while the community organisations that emerged later on in the process were seen as a solution (if only they could find funding) to a community’s problems. This sense of isolation and lack of attachment to the arts organisation was also evident in the work of the urban artists who came out of the woodwork after the ban. Their projects tended to be more experimental and involved more urban dwellers, who were in turn more likely to engage with art through a different channel. For many years, the only outlet for such artists was through the support of the Arts Council, but the council was gradually breaking apart and artists began to find other ways to support themselves. The end result is that the resources of the Arts Council are stretched very thinly these</text>

The idea of the community artist is to work with people who are already involved in the arts, to get a perspective on the arts from their point of view, and to see how that can inform future art practices. And to a certain extent, that’s what we did with the community landscape project: it was a point of departure for the work we did later, and a space in which to experiment and make new art practices. The question then became: how do we activate that arts education within the art world, without becoming gatekeepers? The answer was to create a network of artists’ organisations that invited established artists to be part of their networks. And so we did that through the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Great Art Networks and the Great Art Schools Network, as well as connecting with artists through the Rastafari Art Network. We invited the Dolphin Arts Centre to be a part of the Great Art Networks, and invited the S</text>

They also saw an opportunity to connect with the city through the arts - to create a bond with the city that was deeper than just a financial one. They did projects in their local area, such as Maryland First Art Project, which sought to bring artistic practices from Maryland to New York; Bluecoat Arts Centre in Brooklyn, which was a hub for bluecoat artists during the 1990s; New Art Gallery in San Francisco, which offered free shows to high-school students; and Beyond Bluecoat, which engaged artists from nearby communities in a year-round arts and culture project; to name only a few.In the 1990s and early 2000s, the curatorial process was fundamentally transformed through the interaction of technologies such as mobile platforms, social media, and immersive formats of cultural exchange. The interaction of media represented a new kind of spatial mapping that could be performed on a large scale on a large scale.

The fact that the arts were now often seen as an inferior art form was seen as a form of resistance. The shift in the exhibitionary market could be attributed to this new way of structuring value; the need to offer a unique experience of the art in a given exhibitionary format. When the art was expected to be present in an artistic context, the audience was often expected to be transported somewhere, and this was seen as a must-see experience. In a way, I do see the emergence of the biennale as an art-world phenomenon, since this new form of art-world exhibitionary phenomenon is primarily about the experience of art as experience transported to a geographically-striated urban environment, rather than an actual art gallery. There is a sense of the city, and of course, we know that the experience of living in the city is very different from living in a museum or a large institution, but the important point is that the city is often normalized in a very</text>

In the 1970s and 1980s, the public was placed above the realm of the artist and his ideas, so the work was commissioned either by the arts organisation or the city. In the 1990s, a new generation of curators came into being, and they saw a need to be responsive to the needs of the community. Their projects were more experimental and involved more local communities. They didn’t necessarily follow the curatorial process, but they saw an opportunity to take ideas from the arts and bring them to life through art.This is what art institutions in the 1990s and early 2000s attempted to do, and it is what art institutions in the present attempt to do: create participatory art institutions by engaging more locally, and inviting that younger generation of artists to come into the institution and participate in the building of a future that could be built with arts and culture. People often speak about the difference between the artistic and curatorial senses of art. The artistic sense is always about bringing people into the art process, whereas the curatorial sense is always about bringing people into the world of art’s production. People tend to overestimate the role of the artist in the arts, whereas in reality many artistically engaged projects only get started because of the institutional love and support of the community. The 1990s and early 2000s curatorial moves often had a material dimension, and they were often made in response to a community’s political demands and needs. The 1990s was a golden age for community art,</text>

There was an influx of artists from all over the world, and their work found its way into the Biennale's curatorial direction. Titles that had once been reserved for luminaries such as Ingmar Bergman, Peter Brook, David Hockney, John Akomfrah or Ron Chernow, found their way onto the bill. The addition of Brenda Rehberg’s ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ in 1989 resonated across cultural boundaries, and her film about the Shelby County Fairgrounds in particular, and the fairground industry in general, heralded a new era of cultural tourism in the UK.15. Champion Artspace, Anfield, 2016.

The answer to this question is a resounding 'yes!’ Biennials can play a role in planning for the future, in shaping cultural practices that take into account the current and the future, in subordinating control to those in power. The biennial can play a role in creating a new paradigm, one that takes into account art and not merely the economic extraction of value from it. This paradigm shift is happening all over the world, and will continue to be happening, no matter what happens in Liverpool. The biennial is a major player in this game, because it is both a global phenomenon and a constituent part of any nation’s art and cultural agenda. It is the art institution of a nation, and the nation is its capital. So, it is both a tourist attraction and a capital of culture. It is both a source of wealth and a drain on it. The biennial is a rare exception to this general rule. It is a building and a parcel of land that stand out and attract tourists, art collectors and cultural travellers alike, yet which also collect cultural histories and ephemera. It is a site of frequent encounters between people from many walks of life, yet preserves a single core identity for all</text>

The answer to this question is a resounding 'yes!’ Biennials can play a role in planning for the future, in shaping cultural practices that take into account the current and the future, in subordinating control to those in power. They can also be used to develop and test new strategies and tactics. This latter scenario is a possibility for the foreseeable future, given the inbuilt political tendency towards authoritarianism in contemporary capitalist societies. It is imperative that biennials develop new strategies and employ this transformative capacity, in order to play a transformative role in the world of today.Increasingly, biennials are being commissioned not for their historical collections or museums, but for their social value, through a combination of feeling out local needs and building local communities. This is a situation that can no longer be considered a 'monolith' – a type of institution that can maintain its distinctiveness through its collection and its structure. Emerging forms of democratic self-organisation are threatening the institutionalised form of the biennial. The biennial is the dominant museumary form today, holding close to its materialities and values. It is the dominant form in cities with a large number of visitors, and in developing countries where numbers are a</text>

The answer to this question is a resounding 'yes!’ Biennials can play a role in planning for the future, in shaping cultural practices that take into account the current and the future, in subordinating control to those in power, and in so doing, creating new social forms and hierarchies. Biennial research projects are necessary and overdue, but they should never be used as agents of change, nor placed at the service of political or economic change. They should instead assume a progressive and activist role in shaping cultural practices that take into account the cultural heritage of the contemporary world through a narrative that represents the diversity of humanity, while at the same time remaining firmly rooted in the local. Biennials can and should play a pivotal role in the future of art, but they also have a critical and subversive role to play in the present, in challenging dominant forms of art, in challenging the prevailing economic and social structures that pervade contemporary society. Biennial research projects and projects should always take into account the needs of the historically marginalised and vulnerable. They should always take into account the perspectives of indigenous peoples, racialised or racialised communities, artists’ organisations, historians and other relevant stakeholders.

Every artefact has a story. The story of biennials is a story of artistic perforations, artistic perforations, artistic perambulations, and art as social processes. Each artefact has a place, a function, an audience, an object – a form of cultural exchange. But its audience is also a form of organisation: it is a social gathering, a kind of public, a place to exchange, a marketplace, a place of exchange, a public square, a place for entertainment, a place for love, affection, love-making, sex, relationships, history, and much more. The audience for biennials is a social gathering – a social community of people drawn together from different disciplines and interested in the same thing. It is made up of people from different disciplines, from different places, with different cultural inclinations, but with a common interest in art and a</text>

In the 21st century, the biennial is the most widely exhibited art form; approximately one-third of all the biennials are in North America and over one-fourth in Europe.1 Art biennials account for approximately 10% of the global trade. Of these, roughly one-third are in North America. Biennials are political, economic, and social phenomena. They are not new, and they are not going to go away anytime soon. But the biennial is no longer the dominant cultural form and not all art biennials are created equal. To some degree, the biennial is the art form's entry-point to the social, economic, and political. Art biennials typically engage with the social aspects of artmaking, while social work, including social initiatives, is the art form’</text>

Art’s social, political and economic value today derives from its place in a social contract between artist, government, community and dominant culture. Its social value today is premised on the fact that culturally responsive art today is one of the most accessible ways of engaging with contemporary art in a socio-politically responsive way. In other words, it is an asset today, a 'hot potato' for future government departments and public galleries to capitalise on and use in their chosen arenas of public life.This is part of a Culture and Capital series examining the links between the arts, the economy and contemporary society.Previous installments can be found at: www.capitalcity.com/series/ciac...

They can also be places of creation and abject poverty, where art can be used to endow a future of abundance.The issue of political and social agency that emerges from the inhabitant of a planet is of great concern to all of us. Our planet is populated by people who work in professions ranging from agriculture to healthcare to law to the financial industry to name only a few. In most cases, these people are not employed in the traditional sense of the word: people who produce, manage and provide for their communities. Rather, these professions demand sophisticated tools with which to perform these people’s jobs, and often times, these tools are provided by the state. The biennale needs to invest in projects that will increase visibility of its politics of art and in-depth exchanges with communities whose politics of art may be informed by its production of art. The biennale needs to invest in projects that will produce long-term effects in creating social change, because the future belongs to</text>

This applies to art being made today and art to be made tomorrow. The question is how to use this shared resource constructively and politically, in the interests of all concerned. The answer to this question is a resounding 'yes!’ Biennials can play a role in planning for the future, in shaping cultural practices that take into account the current and the future, in subordinating control to those in power. They can also play a pivotal role in shaping present and future cultural practices through participatory methods, projects that employ art as a political tool with social intentions. But this is only possible if the other half of the equation – the people – take part in the system.Art today is made up of images that are captured and consumed almost continuously, and images that are produced and communicated almost never. We are so used to consuming images of art being made today that it is easy to forget what great artists were able to accomplish with the support of a biennial. Biennials provided the artistic and social outlet for a people who were effectively rendered voiceless in the face of globalised capitalism. They opened avenues of participation for artists who otherwise would have to become stakeholders in image-producing companies and marketing campaigns, or operate outside the context of artistic endeavours. They also provided a platform for artists to experiment with new strategies of cultural production, and for artists to meet other artists and other creative people from all</text>

They can also be a vehicle for taking control of the resources of the city today and distributing those resources to future generations through progressive democratic means.  Their emergence coincides with a global economic and financial system that increasingly relies on the exchange of capital for the future growth of the global economy. Art today is no longer the preserve of privileged individuals and entities; it is readily accessible and is a valuable resource for any society that needs to support a future workforce. The biennial is an essential node in a society that increasingly relies on the exchange of capital, and its expansion is a source of new social needs and opportunities. It is a social event that is not seen as a fixed resource and is therefore a point of convergence. It is an opportunity to witness the riches of a globalized capitalist society at work.Art today is produced increasingly outside of the city. Most of the work that takes place in the artworld is made outside of the city, and its practitioners are particularly exposed to the global circulation that character</text>

This is particularly true in times of great need, such as when a community needs to work collaboratively with the loss of its jobs, property and community. When making art today, we often forget to take into account the communities around us. We lack the political, economic and social dimensions that come with creating social goods. That which can contribute to creating a better future for future generations is going to have to come from above. The biennial should be a site of discussion and exchange, a place where ideas are put forward that are both new and resonate with people. It’s up to artists to develop strategies for how to engage with this new world. This could mean developing creative new ways of approaching the challenges that face us today, or developing strategies to create new social goods. It could also mean developing creative ways of ignoring the challenges and social ills that are hanging over us, and engaging in activities that are both aesthetically pleasing and fulfilling.The importance of dialogueA dialogue is a</text>

That is, the need to house and feed the artists and for the city to be able to provide the infrastructure that the artists need to make their projects real. For instance, the infrastructure that the city provides for a museum might not be enough for a group of artist’s to build a community ‘renewal initiative’. That is, a local museum or heritage district might be better equipped to house an arts institution than a cluster of artist’s studios or even a small business. 	In the end, though, the art that is being made in the city isn’t enough to satisfy the needs of the city. The art that is being made doesn’t have the character or the context or the politics to be able to move beyond the city and to engage with the city in meaningful and transformational ways. That is, the power to effect change doesn</text>

We were creating a separate space for the arts education provider, and another space for the arts education provider to work with the young people. These spaces were very much out in the open, so there wasn’t a separation between the two. For example, at one point, the arts education provider was providing activities for the arts education provider’s students to participate in, and the arts education provider was providing activities for the arts education provider’s teachers to lead. The inclusion of the arts education provider in the same space as the school, nursery, kindergarten and primary schools was a space that the city was giving back, and so it became a project. The arts education provider was given full authority to implement the programme however it was being delivered, and the arts education provider was given full authority to monitor its implementation. The city was saying, ‘You take over this space and control this programme.�</text>

So I put the plan into motion and started working with the city council to create a multi-use gallery and museum for the whole city. I think that the gallery and the museum would have fulfilled the city’s needs anyway, but the way that the art was put together and presented would have been more suitable for the city and would have satisfied the city’s needs. This was around 2001. In retrospect, I think that the need to go to the city council and have a say in the form that the art would take was greater then the ability of the artists to put their heads down and do the work. I think that the ability of the artists to think creatively and act accordingly was more limited. In retrospect, I think that the way that the art was put together and presented allowed for a range of interpretations and even radical forms of expression, but also allowed for the possibility of a large elite controlling the form</text>

I think that a city that is constantly telling you how beautiful it is has to be actively engaged, and that’s what the Biennial could have done if they had the resources. The real engagement though, comes from the people who are making the art themselves, and that’s what the Biennial did well. They convened a group of friends over Christmas and New Years Eve, and invited them to be involved in the making of a work, and then invited them to the Tate Modern one morning, when the curator and his team arrived. The group was small but engaged, and as soon as the curator presented a project they were passionate about, they went wild. They’ve always been artists and had a natural feel for what the Tate Modern was all about. The fact that they went to university and did postgraduate studies and came out with careers is a real achievement. 	However, the engagement that the art establishment has had with the Biennial over the years is</text>

There was a point where I felt that the needs of the city overlapped with the needs of the museum, and that the needs of the artist were often more relevant than the needs of the city. I don’t think that I would have made the same choices had I been in the city. I think the art that was being made in the club at that time wasn’t enough to satisfy the needs of the club, and the museum collection wasn’t enough to satisfy the needs of the museum. So in that sense, the decisions I was making at the time were quite different from what I would have made if I was in the city now. 	When you take a long view, you can see that, even though the needs of the city were different, the priorities that were set out in the long view were the same, and that in a city like Liverpool</text>

That is, the limit is the potential public that can be seduced by the art that is being made, and then has to be resisted against its overwhelming force.  	There was a point where I felt that the art that was being made in the club wasn’t enough to satisfy the needs of the city, nor was it enough to satisfy the needs of the individual. So the curatorial and the artist had to work together to deliver the necessary urban stimulation to make the project a success. In the end, though, that is what the other had to do: deliver the necessary urban stimulation to make the project a success, and then the artist could rest easy knowing that she has created something that is meaningful to the city and which will hopefully stay relevant in the future. The relationship between curatorial and artist is a relationship that has to be negotiated; it is not something that can be dictated. At the same time, though, the relationship between the city and the museum has to be negotiated, because the city is the site of the meeting of the WTO, and the museum is where the action takes place. If the city isn’t here, or the museum isn’t here, or neither is happening, then the WTO can be interesting, but it is more of a tool for understanding</text>

That is, the needs of a city were too complex and unforgiving to permit the art to be made in a club that is as psychologically fragile as Liverpool’s is. 	I remember coming to see Red Hook in April of 1969 and thinking that if I didn’t want to be an artist I ought to have a career. Since I didn’t want to be an artist, I didn’t want to be involved in the creation of culture. It wasn’t a rejection of the work I was doing, it was the opposite. I had a portfolio of paintings that I thought were pretty decent, and the occasional work that I had done with a wider cultural perspective. I was doing something that, with the resources at my disposal, could support a career. But I also felt that I had to engage with the larger context of community activism, and I did so in interesting ways. 	I met Paul McCarthy, Clarend</text>

That is, the limit is the potential public that can be seduced by the art that is being made, and then has to be resisted against its overwhelming force.  	There was a point where I felt that the art that was being made in the club wasn’t enough to satisfy the needs of the city. The art that was being made now was too abstract, too political, and could be appropriated by the arts establishment. So the limit for me was political art that challenged preconceptions and prejudices. I don’t think abstract art can be abstract any more than painting is not abstract in nature. Abstract art has to actually speak to something that is real. And so the need to create ‘meaningful difference’ in the world came to define the project that the artist was able to undertake. The challenge then became how to create that meaningfully. Abstract expression was seen as an additional dimension to the original, more conceptual work, whereas the use of language was seen as essential to any abstract expression. It was also seen as essential to challenging cultural taboos and legacy systems that prevented other creative forms from being made. In other words, the use of abstract expression and the privileging of abstract thought over its implied use within the visual arts.  	This final element that has come to</text>

The needs of the city were being invaded by a lot of different kinds of people, and it didn’t make any sense for the art to be some sort of bulwark against that kind of violence. It was always the case that the museum or the gallery was the place where the resistance to capitalist democracy was strongest, and I felt like that was the case in Liverpool too. 	However, as soon as the art was there, the museum got squeezed, and I felt like the art was the Achilles Heel of the institution, and the museum was ultimately the Achilles Heel of the political project made by and for the people of Liverpool. The resistance that was being made there was being overpowered by the kind of violence being directed against people by other people. So, eventually, the museum got squeezed again, and I felt like the art was being pulled apart by other artists’ people within the institution, and the art was pulled away from the</text>

It wasn’t enough to put a smile on a face. It was enough to make people want to come to work, but not enough to put them in a good mood and send them on an uplifting experience. There was a point where the art that was being made in the club was enough to satisfy the needs of the city, but then there was a point where the city had to put in the resources to sustain the work. There was a point where the art could be sustainable, but then the limits to what the city could support started to appear. 	And this is where we are now. The art is enough to sustain the biennial, but the biennial is itself showing its age. It’s hard to imagine it in its current form in the present century, but the limits to what the city could support in the same way that we are hitting them right now are pushing the limits of what the city could ever be able to support.

In this respect, the partnership between gallery and museum is not, as the derogatory phrase ‘between the gallery and the museum’ indicates. Rather, it can be understood as a co-production between the two. This co-production, which I have seen first-hand, involves the audience and the gallery in an interpretive process that is neither here nor there. It involves, for example, the role of the visitor in the curatorial process, or the role of the museum in curatorial relations, or perhaps the role of the artist in the role of curatorial advisor. All of these roles are, I believe, critical to the engagement of an artist in a given context, but they are also, I believe, inherently political.

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, permanent exhibitionary form, makes it an ideal place for a political artist to operate in relative anonymity, something that is difficult to achieve in the real life of the art world. The prominence of the museum makes the art world feel more like a home than a destination, which in turn helps to foster a sense of belonging for artists here who feel alienated by the conventions of the real world. I see this in the curatorial process itself, in the fact that the real-life narrative is often supplemented by a fictional one, as in the case of the alien abduction narrative often put forward by anti-psychiatrists. The role of the visitor in the art world is often over-valued, and I believe that the over-representation of the real is a much more dangerous distortion. The real-life narrative is often supplemented by a fictional one, and the fiction serves to create a sense of belonging for artists who are already inclined to a particular set of values.

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, permanent exhibitionary format, is a powerful, powerful political lever. It enables the gallery to simultaneously sponsor permanent exhibitions in the same venues at the same time, thereby creating a marketplace of culture and commerce across the art world. It allows the museum to simultaneously present exhibitions of constant variation across its venues, thereby enabling the artist to simultaneously patronize and be patronized by museums. And it enables the artist to simultaneously refuse to patronize or to be patronized by any institution of the modern world, no matter how powerful its institutional resources might be. These are potent political tools, and they have been for decades.But what I’m aspiring to do here in Glasgow is different from what many artists strive for. And this is where gallery culture intersects with museum culture. While the museum is busy reproducing itself, the gallery is busy creating narratives – constructing the contemporary art world in its own image. And these narratives need to be constantly renegotiated – constantly adapting to the current needs and desires of the</text>

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, 'cultural' form, is a powerful political mediator, lending an air of authority and prestige to the role of the artist, while making it clear that this authority and prestige are not conferred by some magical or superior 'higher power' but rather by virtue of being taken by the ‘Living Museums’ collective. It is this kind of historical mediation, I believe, that is needed today more than ever. If there are no more sites for the artist to be found, then the role of the museum becomes an afterthought, a sideline interest rather than a focal point of attention. I do not wish to suggest a cure-all solution, but perhaps the museum could add a few neutral elements to the mix, those elements that lend a bit of colour and contrast to the otherwise monolithic picture it is often painted to present. One thing I have longed for is for the Museum of Modern Art to open its doors and show us the shutters that keep us in. For me,</text>

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, permanent exhibitionary format, the relations between the artist and the museum in the modern context, and the current situation in which the artist finds himself, all contribute to the feeling that the role of the visitor is one of assiduity and dependability. The role of the museum administrator in this context is a significant actor in the world art marketplace, and I would argue that the contemporary museum is a significant actor in the world as a whole. I would suggest that the museum has become something like a global contingency, and that its current exhibitionary format is in part a response to the fact that the museum is of limited duration. The typical four-month residency at a museum costs $35,000 US dollars, and a donation of a large sum is expected. In addition to this, regular trips to the museum are also part of the development of the biennale experience, and continue to be. So the biennale is a ‘ticket-box business’, and its object of</text>

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, permanent exhibitionary format, has provoked a mode of cultural consumption unprecedented in modern art history – a mode that is both emotionally unavailable (in the museum atmosphere), and which actively seeks to deny the vulnerability of its citizens. As a consequence, the role of the visitor in this context is complex. Its capacity to be entertained, to participate in an art world that is both present and invisible is at this moment the subject of considerable attack. In the twentieth century, this mode of cultural consumption was exemplified by the modern museum, but in the twenty-first century it is being imitated by the social gallery, the social and civic gallery, and the biennial. The social gallery is a relatively new concept in contemporary art history; its history is marked by the institution's proliferation and its ever-expanding collection of artworks. It has, however, a pivotal place in our contemporary cultural ecology; it defines the contemporary artist, and it defines the contemporary society. The social and civic gallery is the contemporary</text>

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, public display model, is a powerful political prop in the shaping of expectations and values about the world. It is easy to understand why galleries would prefer to keep their politics under wraps, and why museums would prefer to avoid controversy. But when the historical context and the social dynamics of a particular art event are altered, or even completely absent – as is the case with biennials – the audience is left with the feeling that politics have taken a back seat, and that expectations are untethered. I believe that, absent political events, the role of the biennial would return to the status of an episodic, durational event, and that the gallery would re-establish a role it had largely abandoned. But absent political events, the biennial would return to its natural place of prominence, and the museum and its collections would return to their original functions. This is the optimistic scenario that I see emerging, and it is the one that has been happening all around the globe for the last forty years</text>

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, architectural models, is a powerful political device. It is used to subjugate the role of the artist and to render the other actors in the context of art and culture invisible. The power of the museum and the power of its architectural models is a powerful tool with which to tackle the political situation in which we find ourselves. But I believe that there is a way of thinking about and tackling these kinds of structural inequalities and systemic poverty that go back to the formation of the modern art world and the modern art world is much older than the museums and art collections we have today. I think that the museum, as an institution, is a historic artifact that is undergoing a redefinition, and I believe that the art world is similarly undergoing a redefinition. I will elaborate on this in a moment.When I think of the modern art world today, I often think of the museum. I see a world where the museum is a daily occurrence and where contemporary art is made everywhere – in virtually every possible media imaginable</text>

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, modern and urban exhibitionary exhibitionary collection, makes it easy to forget this fact. The importance of the exhibitionary form in an art world, then, becomes increasingly suspect as the politics of culture become ever more apparent. The character of the museum no longer represents the blunt force of the state, but rather the subtle and nuanced aspects of state power. At the same time, the museum is an essential site for the maintenance of cultural capital – the kind of infrastructure that supports and depends on the circulation of ideas, on the production of knowledge, and on the modulation of symbolic acts. It is the ultimate expression of what I have called the ‘third party’ in contemporary art: the art museum, the art fair, and the art market. These sites are places where ideas are produced, consumed, considered and compared, but above all they are places of conflict. The conflict, I believe, is produced by the very difference between the museum and the fairground. If the conflict is not produced</text>

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, public spaces, is a powerful political tool. Its power to define the terms of the engagement of artists with audiences is a powerful political device. The role of the museum in this context is critical. It defines the parameters of what is and is not possible within the museum. It establishes what is and is not possible outside of the museum. And it makes these parameters applicable across a given culture. The role of the artist in this context is critical, but it is also discretionary. In other words, the role of the artist in this context can be made mutually inclusive of many other roles. This is critical to an artist’s work, because roles in this context demand a certain amount of conformity. The role of the museum in this context is critical, but it is also discretionary. It can be made mutually inclusive of many other roles.

The role of the visitor in the art world is one of the most vulnerable on a given day. The prominence of the museum, and especially its large-scale, permanent exhibitionary format, gives the impression that there is some kind of safety net here, a level playing field. But the art world, and indeed all art-world audiences, are also profoundly impressionable. They can be primed by the media of their culture with a given work of art, and they can be primed by other cultural artefacts with equally primping media. When a work of art is exhibited in a museum, or a museum-funded project, the viewer is encouraged to produce his or her own impression of the cultural landscape of the present, using any and all language that has been digitally mapped onto the cultural terrain of the moment. This is a powerful, even a seemingly helpful, modus operandi for the art world, a mode of cultural production that is all but absent in the current state of affairs. But what kind of modus operandi is that? If the present is no longer seen as the locus of creativity, or the era of the up-surge</text>

I would like to suggest that the failure to respond to the needs of the community in the 1980s was a failure as a response to the challenges of our time. The desire to identify and address systemic causes of  	economic  	widespread  	injustice in our urban and regional infrastructure may affect who we pay attention to as a public gallery, arts commission or museum administrator. As a result, we neglect the people who are actually working in our neighbourhoods and are often unaware that they have a voice when it comes to the way in which infrastructure is designed, built and managed in our cities. The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but as a response to the challenges of our time it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain relevance and relevance is becoming increasingly elusive. The challenge now is to identify local, long-term solutions that address the needs of the communities that are being affected by</text>

We have no idea what the curatorial agenda would have been, or who those people would have been. It would have been about promoting a sense of community and about how the curatorial arm of the state was attempting to exert some control over artistic practice. It would have required a creative and articulate response from the public gallery, the arts commission and the National Gallery. The failure to respond to the needs of the community may have contributed to the dominance of the art market at the time.  	The failure to respond to the needs of the community may also have contributed to the impoverishment of our urban and regional infrastructure. The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and irrational. The Art Market has disappeared; it was viewed as a quaint, gothic institution, distorting the market as much as it pursuing creative practice. The loss of interest and revenue to the Art Market is a direct result of the complexity of the Art Market today. The needs of the urban elite today align with those of the regional elite; the Art Market cannot be expected to offer a consistent level of service to all audiences.  	Local artists, not long before the Biennale, were already adapting their practices to fit the new institutionalised forms and ideologies of urbanisation.  	The Biennale, by its own description, is an event that &quot;serves as a proxy for the city’s politics of culture&quot;.12 The contemporary biennale is a double-sided sword. On the one hand, it is a showcase of art from all over the world that is being produced in parallel, thanks to a decentralised, collaborative and artist-centered model</text>

The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and politically incorrect to think that way. The needs of the city are different now, and the needs of the local community are far more diverse. The Art Market analysis, then, may have been prescient in the 1980s, but its relevance and possible future are questionable. Perhaps the failure to respond in a timely way to the needs of the community in the 1990s may have emboldened some communities to seek alternative venues to showcase their work. But this is another ‘once in a generation’ scenario. The rhetoric of radical urbanism certainly influenced public spaces and the development of progressive urban development policies, but its influence waned as the city grew larger and more populated. The Art Market analysis, then, may have been prescient in the 1980s, but its relevance and possible future is uncertain. The rhetoric of ‘once in a generation’ may have been useful in framing artistic activity in the wake of the crisis of poverty and inequality, but its realisation and eventual deployment as a</text>

The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and reactionary. Seventy per cent of our population now lives in metropolitan centres where art is produced at regional centres and exported to overseas markets. Art and the Community Gallery have found new audiences elsewhere. 	The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but its topicality and global reach have meant that it is now part of our national identity and that our history and contemporary art are embedded in the fabric of our urban fabric. Art and communities are now embedded in one another's ‘urban fabric’. Art is now both the language of resistance and the language of complicity. 	When we think about the relationship between art and the community today, we tend to look to the role that the arts commissions play in curating and providing access to art. Obviously, the arts commission has a role to play in this as well. However, it is important to articulate how the arts can be generated through direct action, what is meant by a community and how art can function in</text>

The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and outdated. The Art Market has been replaced by a Museum of Contemporary Art. The demise of the Community Gallery may have contributed to their ascendance in the 1990s, but the rise of the Art Market and the Museum of Contemporary Art as the dominant arts institutions in the UK and internationally in the 2000s is largely due to the explosion of galleries, museums and archives that followed the Art Market's lead. 	The failure to respond to the needs of the community may have contributed to the domination of the art market at the time. In the early 1990s, the Art Market was the dominant global art market, and the Museum of Contemporary Art was the dominant regional museum market. Then came the Trilateral Commission, which attempted to coordinate the various art institutions in Europe, North America and Africa, and to do so, it was necessary for the Museum of Contemporary Art to have a curator. The enormous demand for audiovisual media and the low cost of production combined with the explosion of magazines and</text>

The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and absurd by contemporary standards. The abundance of access to materials and people today is a much more relevant concern. 	If we allow the marketplace to define what is and is not affordable in an area, then our urban environment is going to be increasingly defined by the material goods and services that are available.

The failure to respond to the needs of the community may have contributed to the domination of the art market at the time. The rise of the biennial and the museums, as well as the underground trade in art supplies and affordable art presents us with a set of concerns that are much more contemporary and quotidian.

The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and disconnected from the times. The Art Market was a transient concept in the arts and culture context; not one of the generation that owns the art today, but one that is transient in its reliance on the art market and museum attendance.  	The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and disconnected from the times.  	The Art Market was also prescient in its focus on the art market as a circulation and one-stop shop. It was a gold standard of the art market at this time, and its analysis by curators, artists and journalists across the world was a major force for cultural transmission in the decades that followed. There was a real connection between the economic and the social in the wider market of art (and culture), and between the cultural and the economic.  	The popularity of The Art Market analysis may have been due in part to the fact that its author,</text>

The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and wrong-headed, and may even be seen as politically incorrect by those in power today. 	The failure to respond to the needs of the community may also have contributed to the demoralisation of our urban and regional infrastructure. The failure to engage with the needs of the community, which is what the Art Market strategy was about, was seen by many as patronising and diminishing. The Art Market strategy did not capture the imagination of the art community at the time, but many of those involved in it do now. Artists such as Peter Carr are more open to the idea that they may have engaged with an audience that is less able or willing than that of a gallery or museum, or that of a community centre. Carr says that he first encountered the Community Arts movement in the 1980s and early 1990s when he was curator of the Liverpool Biennial, and that it gave him the will to engage with the art world again. He is right to say that the reason he has continued</text>

The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and antiquated and we are far too busy with the galloping horse and the guildhall to notice the artworks disappearing. The only thing keeping the Art Market alive was the galloping horse and the Guildhall. 	When the Art Market was first started, the Guildhall was the largest art buyer in the city and the N.G.G. was the art collector of the city. By the 1990s, the Art Market had become the dominant regional art buyer and the N.G.G. had faded into the background. 	We don’t need to tell the history of the decline and fall of the Guildhall as a regional art buyer and the N.G.G. is not going to change that. The Art Market will have to figure out how to work with the community it is trying to rejuvenate and how to get involved in the process as an artist, not a representative of the government.

The Art Market analysis may have been prescient in the 1980s, but it is now widely perceived as anachronistic and disconnected from the times, especially in its geographical location in the heart of London. The ubiquity of the Biennial has made it easier to define and manage the institutional memory of the 1990s, while continuing to provide a base for thinking about the needs of the London community today. 	The Biennial was born in New York in 1986, and it is widely believed to be the most dominant artistic biennial of the century. It is important to note that the Biennial has only recently begun to experience the kind of institutional renewal and democratic accountability that it would demand of the public gallery in the form of a Public Gallery Act 1990, which would have regulated and mandated the composition and content of gallery exhibitions and the placement of gallery displays.[1] 	The Public Gallery Act 1990 was defeated by a minority in the House of Lords, who claimed that it went against the democratic impulse of the people. They were overruled, however, on appeal. 	[2] Despite</text>
