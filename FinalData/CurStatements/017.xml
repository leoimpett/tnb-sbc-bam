Curator Ben Whittaker resembled the Bluecoat boys, only in this case the boys were actually from Liverpool and had a creative and independent streak. The new Creative City initiative uses art as a blunt tool to push back the social  	back into the city. Art is no longer simply an aid to malnourished individuals or favoured groups. It is a tool that can be used to emancipate individuals and push back the social systems that are fuelling the crisis of hunger that is threatening to engulf large parts of the world.  	The Bluecoat boys, being the smart and talented they were, picked the wrong city to call home. They chose Bogota, a city on the Atlantic side of the Atlantic, where the Atlantic meridians meet the Atlantic and so one can imagine the effects that such a link would have. Bogota’s proximity to larger ports and huge markets would have allowed the boys to switch</text>

Work that is included in the now-discredited and now-defunct Bluecoat programme was curated for the public works programme at Liverpool School of Art, where it was seen as a way to bring arts and heritage to the area by providing a face to the rubble of a demolished town. Curator Nina Edge said of the work: ‘It is a powerful reminder that the work we produce or think we produce is but a transient appendage of the architecture that caused the conflict and conflict continues to haunt us.’ As the work of art and social disrepair that it is, the bluecoat achieved something of its curatorial mission through the displacement of difficult images and images that suggested of the conflict zone.  	The work  	Taken from Bluecoat website. 	The Bluecoat was developed in collaboration with Liverpool School of Art and Enviro-Towbridge, a design firm that specialises in the installation and repair of structures. The project was viewed as an extension of the group’s existing research and design interests, which included the restoration of lost or destroyed sites of art and culture. The Bluecoat formed part of a wider research project into the ‘episodic’ that is often cited as a solution to</text>

Work that is included in the now-discredited and now-defunct Bluecoat programme was curated for the public works programme at Liverpool School of Art, where it was seen as a way to bring arts and heritage to the area by providing a face to the rubble of a demolished town. Curator Nina Edge said: ‘The Bluecoat was a turning point in my curatorial career. It put me in contact with people who would later be involved in the Biennial and the National Theatre. It also coincided with the Biennial receiving funding from the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery. These relationships changed my approach to art development and the biennial as a funding stream, and opened doors that would later be closed or blocked by vested interests. 	Edge has a long-standing and influential cultural and social engagement with the environment, and her work often targets issues of concern to urban communities. In 2014 she curated the New Economy Project, which sought to address the economic displacement of jobs due to the explosion of computerised ‘work’, and was one of several artists to receive a funding boost from the Arts Council through the Public Art prize. However, it is her engagement with the mental image of a computer generated landscape that comes through in her artwork, which</text>

Work that is included in the now-discredited and now-defunct Bluecoat programme was curated for the public works programme at Liverpool School of Art, where it was seen as a way to bring arts and heritage to the area by providing a face to the rubble of a demolished town. Curator John Orrocki described the Bluecoat project as follows: it brought the arts to the people and showed them that the arts could be produced and directed in ways that were not dependent on government or the dominant social ideologies. 	[3] In another context, Orrocki might have been describing the activities of the Bluecoat in the early 1990s, but the curatorial turn has become something that is valued above all elsewhere in the UK and beyond. The Bluecoat project was seen by many outside of Manchester as a progressive and progressive presence in the city, and many artists have their work commissioned by the city council in an attempt to reacquaint the artist with the site and programme. 	[4] The announcement was made in September 1992, shortly before The Jersey Boys were formed. The band were formed in Liverpool and used the money raised from the Bluecoat to form a professional band, and began recording regularly into March 1993. Their first</text>

Curator Nina Edge said: ‘People are hungry for art. But they also want to be entertained and they want to be taken on a little adventure. That’s why art is sometimes juxtaposed with tragedy and conflict.’ 	Curator David Mackie added: ‘Art is not just a tool for making things better; it can also help us form better institutions. It can create networks, partnerships and unquesalism and make us more hospitable to newcomers.’ 	In a city such as Liverpool, which has witnessed so much destruction in the past few years, the Bluecoat’s vision for the future of art in the city was a compelling package of concerns. The challenges of curating in the city were real, but the magic of Urbanum that the artist put into life could not be replicated anywhere. The challenge for today's artists, though, is different. The challenge today is not so much about replicating Urban</text>

Work that is included in the now-discredited and now-defunct Bluecoat programme was curated for the public works programme at Liverpool School of Art, where it was seen as a way to bring arts and heritage to the area by providing a face to the rubble of a demolished town. Curator Andrew Mackenzie described the Bluecoat ethos as ‘absolutely core’ to the experience of living in the Anfield/Breckfield area: ‘It’s the idea of the artifice disappearing away – in this case, of building but also of people.’[36] And it is difficult to see how this can be reconciled with the ideals of an urbanising urban state that are increasingly intent on controlling and disposing of urban space, rather than seeking to create new ‘affordable housing’ or good quality ‘good schools’ or good museums’. Despite the rhetoric, this is often less an aspiration than a realised fact of life in the area. The fact that so many artists were drawn to the area because of its arts and cultural attractions, and its proximity to the Biennial and other major arts events, seems completely ignored in the wider cultural discourse on the city.

Curator Nina Edge said: ‘The Bluecoat was a project that was seen as a last resort. It was seen as a last resort because the neighbourhood changes that need to happen to make it happen are overwhelming. But now that the Bluecoat has closed, we don’t need the neighbourhood changes anymore.’ Sadly, Edge did not see the point in continuing with the project, as the local residents and artists who had been part of it found a new outlet online. 	The Bluecoat was a good example of a project that was seen as affordable and accessible, and this is perhaps what the financially strapped city of Liverpool has in common with the financially strapped city of Detroit. 	In Liverpool, the closure of several art spaces, the loss of income and asset-generating potential, and the pressure to reduce spending due to inflation all conspire to reduce artistic freedoms. In Detroit, creative per diems are targeted by a predatory market for creative works, and artistic and</text>

Work that is included in the now-discredited and now-defunct Bluecoat programme was curated for the public works programme at Liverpool School of Art, where it was seen as a way to bring arts and heritage to the area by providing a face to the rubble of a demolished town. Curator Peter Carruthers, who curated the Bluecoat programme at Liverpool School of Art, articulated the view that artists and curators ‘were placed in positions of great responsibility and confidence by the state’, and that such trust was misplaced. The notion that art could be produced ‘outside the system’ was countered by the notion that artists, producers and curators should be independent agents capable of producing their own work and holding their own ‘infrastructure’. 	Independent art has its critics; creative people sustain criticism; and artists and curators have a right to be heard, but only within the system. In the end, however, the right to criticize comes at a cost; as the financial modelling of the  	value chain revealed by Curtis Ioannidis shows, there is a premium to be paid by the public for the right to dissect other artists’ work.

Curator Tom Waugh said of the project: ‘It is great that this project was seen as a way to bring arts and heritage to the area. But it was never going to be a grand, cultural event, nor was it going to be a ‘patch up’ by the local community.’ The Bluecoat project did not invent the concept of the integrated arts or arts education, but it positioned the project as a response to the crisis of education in the area and the failure of mainstream education as a response to the emergence of a new generation of artists and artists. It positioned the arts education provided by the new artist(s) as complementary to the existing provision of arts and culture from the local community.  	The curatorial, in this view, could be said to architect the new form of the integrated arts and arts education provided by the arts organisation.  	The curatorial stance contemporaneous with the development of the programme contem</text>

Through them, we can learn about, explore and perhaps even participate in the very processes that shape and define the world we live in, from the cityscapes they inhabit to the projects that shape and define the media landscape they inhabit. They have become sites of significances, worthies, milestones and punctums: when they are not the sites of significances, the lots and forms of urban and regional transformation that shape and define the world we inhabit. In this way, they can be seen to inhabit and be shaped by the media they employ to signify the world.

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of resource-conservation in which the resources of a territory are made available to meet future needs. As we saw in Sudan, the Sahara and South-East Asia, the concomitant of resource-conservation and upcycling is a conjoined twin. And as we have seen in Central America and the Middle East, the concomitant of resource-conservation and upcycling has been promoted through the forcible taking and holding of populated land and resources.We should not downplay the importance of resource-conservation and upcycling in our economies. Far from it. Far from it is true that in the West today – where environmental degradation is rampant – people live in vast urban settlements that are entirely dependent on the resourcefulness of resourceful individuals. The infrastructure of cities today is increasingly dependent on information technologies, and the social and spatial conditions that result from it. Cities today are far more like conglomerates of information-processing units than they were in the age of organic</text>

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of upcycling in which all kinds of industries, including those that use oil, need to be accounted for in a future price. We saw with Brazil how, as a result of climate change, large parts of the country are set to become uninhabitable. As a result of climate change, coastal cities will become uninhabitable as a result of rising sea levels. And as a consequence of climate change, coastal points of interest will become uninhabitable cities, or in the worst-case scenario, both submerged and uninhabitable underwater.In these scenarios, the question is what do we do in the face of such an uncertain agenda? We could certainly choose to ignore it and move on. But what would be the alternative?  The upcycling question is a tricky one, to say the least. Governments tend to allocate scarce resources in ways that are not always obvious or obvious at first glance. And as we saw with the Egyptian pilot project, many in the international community have a</text>

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of resource-starvation. But these come second, alongside the larger question of what it means to be environmentally sustainable in our age of chronic resource depletion? How do we decide what is environmentally sustainable and what is not?These are questions that continually crop up as we peruse the ecological and climatological literature, seeking to understand how our reliance on fossil fuels is affecting our planet. As a growing body of research consistently points out, our reliance on fossil fuels is destroying its biomes in unprecedented ways – changing the climate, disrupting weather patterns and hastening the end of many species. And yet, despite this mounting body of evidence, the global economy constantly strives to create new ways of accounting for this increasing abundance. It creates new accounting practices that record how much of the planet is used up in goods and services every day – and yet, despite this, accounts keep collapsing due to lack of supply. How are our current accounting practices constructed? What is the environmental impact of these products and services we provide</text>

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of resource-conversion via deforestation, desertification and the ever-present threat of resource war. But even these processes that frequently claim the justification of the taking-and-keeping-of-resources justification of state power is often characterised by a form of social resistance that seeks to save what is left over after the extraction and burning of natural resources. This social resistance often emerges as a response to economic predation, but it is increasingly evident that the only economic imperative driving development in the world right now is the pretense of environmental sustainability. And as we have seen in places like Egypt and Turkey, the social resistance to resource-conversion is often characterised by a form of libertarian political resistance. For example, in the Sudanese city of Bentiu, the ongoing drought has left at least eight million people dependent on aid, creating a humanitarian catastrophe – but also by a form of resistance that seeks to save water and cover new growth with the pretence that this will somehow ensure environmental sustainability</text>

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of resource-using: the need to produce the resources, shift production to locations outside of the site where demand is greatest, and to keep the sites in good condition by supplying them with everything they need to support a growing population. As we saw with the oil crisis in the US and the escalating price of oil, the fate of a resource is tied to the price of oil. And as we have seen with the environmental degradation in many developing countries, the price of oil – and therefore the price of natural resources like oil – will only ever be a small part of a resource-using society. As a result, the price of oil inevitably controls the price of resources, and the value of those resources inevitably follows the price of oil. This is why, for example, countries that are particularly vulnerable to resource depletion are those that are developing economies first. If the price of oil falls, so do the standards of living and quality of life for people in those countries. And, as we</text>

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of any urbanisation programme that seeks to harness the economic potential of space and resources. But the main thrust of many urban development programmes is to enhance the value of land and resources in exchange for labour and other forms of productivity enhancements. And while these programmes may have some initial elements of such a production process in place, as we saw in Egypt and Turkey, the vast majority of such programmes today are directed at fortifying existing value forms or augmenting the value of existing assets through development itself. And while such programmes may have some initial elements of upcycling going on, the driving force for much of what is being promoted as ‘creative thinking’ in these countries today is actually quite different from what is being done in some other parts of the world. For instance, in places like Egypt and Turkey, there is a strong emphasis on modern education as a way of reawakening lost respect for ancient texts and cultures. Education is often touted as a cure-all for a people</text>

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of resource-conservation and upcycling that results in the need for new infrastructure, new companies, new jobs and new ways of living in the aftermath of resource depletion. As we saw in Sudan, the conflict that followed the resource crisis led to a massive expansion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), new trade routes and lucrative property markets.And of course, the concomitant – legal – aspect of resource-conservation and upcycling that results in the displacement of protestors and other vulnerable populations, including large numbers of indigenous people. Indigenous rights, after all, are among the last remaining pieces of the eco-system on which the conflict that replaced the resource crisis could be resolved.So what is at Stake in the Durango Accord?The Durango Accord is a compromise and a beginning; a starting point rather than an end in itself.

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of resource-conservation, which is part of any capitalist equation. But these three dimensions of the upcycling equation are distinct and separate processes. Our focus today is on North Korea, where a nuclear-weapons threat has gripped the nation and affected all regions of the country. We see the apocalyptic scenarios of a thermonuclear war unfolding across the country, and the dire consequences for humanity if the weapons fall into the wrong hands. But there is much more going on, affecting the global south as well. There is a great urgency today, as North Korea prepares to embark on its fourth nuclear test, which is expected to occur in April 2018. There is a need to know what kind of catastrophe might befall the world if a nuclear-weapons catastrophe were to break out. We hear so much about the dangers of a nuclear North Korea, but little about what kind of catastrophe might result from such a crisis. We need to know what might be done to prevent it from breaking out, lest we</text>

And of course, there is the concomitant – economic – aspect of resource-using: the need to find new sources of energy requires that companies drill, pump, desalinate and so forth. As we saw in Sudan, however, this process was often accompanied by violent anti-social behaviour, including genocide. Even when this has ceased to be the case, however, the political right has seized upon the issue to justify the ongoing viability of the resource-using industry, which is at odds with everything that the state stands for. As we saw in Venezuela, the political right has seized upon the spectre of economic collapse to justify an unsustainable and violent policy of neoliberalism.And it is this sense of crisis, this desire to endow resources with a new purpose and meaning – to make them productive – that characterises the upcycling predicament of nations like Malaysia, whose oil wealth is being funneled into what are in effect black-hole projects in an attempt to stem the tide of corruption and poverty. As one commentator put it so po</text>

But more on this later.Back to topOf course, the notion of the future – or at least the immediate future – is a story told through stories. And as we now live through what is likely to be a very telling and imaginative future, it is important to tell our own story, or those of others who are likely to be similarly engaged, imaginative and creative in telling their stories. Stories that are told often enough to be believed. There are many places in the world where upcycling and future-telling are not illegal, and upcycling is a global phenomenon, so it is not unimaginable that other stories will be told. There is much work already being done on behalf of those who need reminding and reminding of the subtleties and intricacies of their stories, and whose voices may yet be part of the future.

In both Venice and Rio de Janeiro, the Biennale is a multinational, multi-purpose organisation that works in cooperation with local authorities, supported by a range of international partners. Its mission is to commemorate and to present the significance of the Biennale in the global art and design canon; to this end it organises numerous special exhibitions throughout the two cities, as well as in other locations around the world. In doing so, the Biennale works to create a shared vocabulary and understanding of the art and design that can be shared between the local and the international audiences; between artists and curators; between curatorial and artistic disciplines; between art and architecture; between biennials and major exhibitions; between biennials and major exhibitions, and much more. Its current programme of exhibitions is publicly available. 	In 2016, the Biennale opened its Venice exhibition, &quot;art without prejudice&quot;, in an unprecedented, unprecedented way: it became the first modern biennale to exhibit in the building of its own right, in an entirely new form and in its own right.

So, for example, the area of The Venice Architecture Biennale is a valuable source of information about the area’s architecture, despite being closed to visitors. The area is a good place to start because it has a wealth of information, but it’s also a false sense of security, because it’s completely unregulated. There are strict curfews, and the Biennale has a contract with the city to be there for eight years. Therefore, if something new is being done in the area, it has to be done with the city’s blessing, and if it’s not, then it�</text>

In Lima, the Biennale is a local government organisation with a mandate to: 1. Enrich the city, 2. Enrich the city’s cultural landscape, and 3. Enrich the city’s urban landscape. A cornerstone of its activities, the Biennale is a major tourist draw, providing a unique and valuable source of cultural capital for the city. It is a forum for exchange between local and international artists and curators, and a catalyst for furthering of civic engagement. The Biennale’s activities in Lima at this time are largely cultural, presenting the city’s rich cultural heritage in a historically significant and accessible way through its curatorial focus; exploring contemporary art’s potential as a site for social change through its curatorial activities; and contributing to the city’s urban future through its research-based, multi-use museum programme.

Venice Biennale 2017 The Biennale has been organising in Venice for over twenty years. At the beginning of this decade, we started another twenty-first edition, which is now underway, taking place in September 2017. The format of the twenty-first edition was already being experimented with at the time of our writing this article. On the website luore.org, we found an update of the exhibition’s schedule, which was already updated several times between January and June 2017. We took a look at the dates and discovered that the exhibition’s current programme of events and activities only includes a few venues across the Italian city. We had to add Venice to the list.

In public and private, the narrative veered hard left; the day after the US Presidential election, when anti-Trump protests took place in cities around the world, the Biennale’s social-media posts encouraged participants to take to the streets of major cities in an act of civil disobedience. The Biennale’s media production and outreach was co-ordinated by the New York Times and its local bureaux in seventeen cities around the world.2 Polls have consistently indicated that a majority of the public regards the biennale as one of the most important art institutions of the world, and the public works programme is a significant part of this.3 The 2017 edition of the</text>

In both Venice and Rio de Janeiro, the Biennale is a multinational, multi-purpose organisation that works in cooperation with local authorities, supported by a range of unique institutional and non-profit support packages. In New York City, the Biennale is an independent producer of cultural and historical exhibitions and collections, which it organises into permanent collections, and participates in the Columbia Museum Fund and the Performing Arts Museum Fund. It also works with local partners to develop and present locally relevant exhibitions and events. 	As a curator and publicist, I am often asked if I also work as an artist. The short answer is that I do not. My role is one of publicist. I’m often asked what it means to be an artist. My answer is very simple and direct: it’s about more than creating art; it’s about living in ways that others can understand and be inspired by. It’s about cultural production and its social effects. The role and the place of the artist in this system is fundamentally different from that of a curator or a publicist. 	In the</text>

In both Venice and Rio de Janeiro, the Biennale is a multinational, multi-purpose organisation that works in cooperation with local authorities, supported by a range of public funds. It is possible that the Biennale in Rio de Janeiro might be able to support a local project in Venice, given the proximity of the two sites. It is also possible that the Biennale in Venice might be able to support a local project in nearby Ponte City, where the Ponte family has a historic theatre and museum. But this is unlikely, given the prohibitive cost of living in Rio de Janeiro. 	In any case, the proposal that the Biennale in Venice might be able to support a project in Rio de Janeiro has always been negotiable, since the city is too far away for such a project to take place. The Biennale has never officially acknowledged this possibility, although in an annual report in 1988, it was mentioned that the project in Rio was on hold due to the city’s financial crisis.[38] The Biennale’s current president, Paolo Portoghesi, once said that</text>

In both Venice and Rio de Janeiro, the Biennale is a multinational, multi-purpose organisation that works in cooperation with local authorities, supported by a range of partner organisations.

Since its founding in 1896, the Biennale has been a global cultural phenomenon. In the twenty-first century, it is a global phenomenon with a distinctive style and distinctive mission. The Biennale is a multi-day, two-week event that celebrates the ancient world with art from all over the world, and engages with social and political changes in the world through stories told through art. The event itself is an annual, and the creative impulse is to document, narrate and archive these stories through works that are works of art in their entire genres and form. 	The key concepts and driving forces of the Biennale event are those that emerged from the AGC’s 1993 Congress, and continue to define the event: ‘biennial’ as a concept, and ‘eventus</text>

It is also a leading biennial institution, recognised by the Venice Biennale Commission for its significant contribution to the art and architecture of the city in the 20th Century (2017). In 2017, the Biennale celebrated its one-year anniversary, and in 2018, it will conduct a ‘ten years of biennials’ in its permanent collection.

The idea is that instead of printing new skin cells perforating the old skin, the bioprinting process destroys the old skin cells in a process known as matrix metalloproteinisation. When the old skin cells in a patient are destroyed, the new skin cells can grow and divide without destroying the old skin, and so the process calls for less than ideal conditions.

Through in vitro research, researchers have been able to produce new skin cells through a process known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS Cells) [2].  	In the body, epidermal growth factor (EGF), a main hormone responsible for epidermal growth, plays a pivotal role in epidermal morphogenesis. When EGF is absent or under-stimulated, epidermal fibres grow weaker and fragmented [3]. When EGF levels are maximised, new epithelial cells are formed [4]. When EGF levels are under- or over-stimulated, new fibres are formed [5,6]. When EGF levels are low, new epidermal fibres are also formed [7]. Inhibition of EGF production by early human diseases such as epidermolysis bullosa and small pox causes the wrinkles to be replaced with smooth, healable skin [8]. Eventually, new skin is found on the body [9]. Research into the causes and treatments of these diseases has led to some of our modern treatments such as the mass production of new</text>

Once a panel of cells has been produced, they proliferate and form new skin types, thus evolving into new types of skin if the conditions remain the same. Researchers have also been able to produce new skin types through in vitro research through Mitochondrial Robo-Infusion [3]. 	In a larger sense, then, in the  	Transplantion series, the in vitro research component operates at a larger scale than in vivo research because it is conducted in the context of tissue culture.

In a 2014 study in the journal Nature Methods, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Berlin were able to engineer mice so that they lacked a gene called Cdc25, which is critical for epidermal morphogenesis. By disrupting this gene, the researchers were able to produce knockout mice that lacked the epidermal morphogenesis gene and so cause epidermal fibres to form a clear shape and penetrate deeper into the body. These genetically engineered mice also lack another gene that regulates the activity of matrix metalloproteinases called FastAct [2]. By disrupting the third gene, the researchers were able to produce knockout mice that possess both epidermal morphogenesis and matrix metalloproteinases but lack the FastAct signal.

In the body, epidermal fibroblasts divide into many types of fibroblasts, which in turn differentiate into dermal fibroblasts and connective tissue, which in turn differentiate into smooth muscle fibres and so on. Each epidermal fibroblast is a new version of a cell that grew from precursor fibres; each dermal fibroblast is a modified form of a cell that grew from original precursor fibres. When a cell divides, it up-regulates its genes to produce a new type of cell, a proto-oncogene. 	In the body, iPS cells divide tens of thousands of times per second and thus have a huge impact on the rate at which material is delivered to sites of inflammation. When a patient with psoriasis is given an iPS Cell, it generates a new type of active cell that can multiply uncontrollably and leave behind a toxic mess. 	In the body,</text>

In one of the most interesting aspects of  	Matrix, Jorge Luis Borges describes how matrix metalloproteinase-II arises: 	The matrix metalloproteinase [3H] is the most fundamental of all biomolecules. It is the matrix that holds together the cells of the epithelial system and acts as a unit in which all other proteins can reside. It consists of two parts, a triangular head and a hexagonal tail.

The bioprinting process also calls for the active ingredient in the skin to be exposed to light and moisture, which in turn can be collected from the wound. In experiments, researchers have found that MoBioCreat can be incorporated directly into wound cartilage[3]. In these preparations, collagen, a key ingredient in cartilage, is added to the wound mix and then blended with water and nutrients to form a gel[4]. The researchers have found that adding nanoparticles of matrix metalloproteinase to the wound mix results in collagen production in a plant-like matrix that is rich in water and nutrients but deficient in oxygen and other elements essential for healthy tissue repair.

This creates a market for skin cells that are precursors to new skin cells, which can then be derived from the new skin. 	In recent years, skin has come a long way from its humble roots as a sea of pain receptors, extracellular matrix, hydrogel and now iPS Cells. New  	found skin-softening agents, humectants, alkaloids and polyphenols have been discovered that fight acne, heal wounds, soothe irritated skin and promote elasticity.

It divides rapidly, producing new epidermal epidermal cells at a rate of 200,000 per second. When a sufficient supply of new epidermal epidermal cells is produced, the skin is left with a clear, bright coat. However, this rapid differentiation and its intensive multi-step repair process has several trade-offs and limitations.

It is a chance to tell a story in a shared language. It is a chance to ask questions that you may not have expected to be asked. It is a chance to make something new out of something old. The editors’ report is a record of what we, the biennial visitors, have to say to each other. It is a record of what we, the curators, do with that record. It is a record of what we, the organisers, do with that record. And it is a record of what we, the curators, do with that record. So, it is a record of the journey that we have taken since we, the biennial visitors, first met Elmgreen and Laura in 2013. The editors’ report is a chance for the two of you, the editors, to tell the story together.</text>

It was prepared by Elmgreen Mogwai, the artist and Project Chair of The New Art Foundation (2008–2014) and Laura Raicovich, formerly of the late Simon Hoggart and Peter Carruthers, and is the result of over four days of discussions. It was published in English as 'The Biennial Report 2014'.The Biennial is a biennale that began in 1999 and runs for four consecutive years. It is the largest remaining art biennale in the world and the only remaining permanent art museum in Europe. The biennial has become a rarefaction within the art world. As a curatorial proposition, it is highly subjective and unpredictable. The 2013 edition of the Biennial was the biggest to date, with over 600 artists from fifty countries taking part.

The emergence of self-repairing cities is the answer to our question, not a catastrophe that could be contained in a few mountains but that would affect all of humanity if it weren’t controlled and contained first by giant corporations.For those of us born after the end of the Cold War, the end of the nuclear age means not only the end of the age of big government and the rule of big business; the end of the age of the state. For many people, and for all intents and purposes, this means the end of both. For those of us born after the end of the Cold War, the end of the nuclear age means the end of the age of the state of Israel, and the end of the age of empires. This may seem like a contradiction in terms, but for many people, and for all intents and purposes, it is the truth.The end of the Cold War also meant that we entered into a new era of globalization.

But the emergence of self-driving cars and autonomous munitions also implies a catastrophe of massive proportions. The emergence of self-repairing cities is the answer to our questions. But the answer to our questions is also a question of enormous proportions. Will we continue to inhabit postindustrial sites of constant catalysing of resources, or will we establish new cities – autonomous cities, if you will – that are more like forests, with no industry but for the magic of language, culture and images? I have my own ideas about what this new ‘imagined city’ might look like.David Harvey is the author of The Limits to Capital: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time and Beyond Capital: The Imagined Communities that are Emerging.

But the emergence of self-driving cars and autonomous munitions also implies a catastrophe of massive proportions. The emergence of self-repairing cities is the end game for which the military has consistently – and inaccurately – declared. And while the military might claim this to be the case, it is clear that the technological edge has yet to fully materialize. What is needed is a system that is both flexible and self-repairing. A future city should be able to heal itself – or at least able to heal from certain types of damage. In the current technological culture, this is clearly not happening.  One could argue that cities are in fact institutions – they are made of matter and energy, and thus can be classified as ‘materialist’ in the broader sense. But the fact of their being urbanised means that they rely on connectivity and transport infrastructure in a globalised world – cities themselves are in this sense ‘immaterial’ in their own way. Cities today are made up of disconnected fragments that, as a result of continual renovation and de-materialisation, move through time – pieces of the dense</text>

The proliferation of images and media meant that there was always the threat of a nuclear holocaust, which is still unfolding as we speak. But the emergence of self-driving cars and autonomous munitions also implies a catastrophe of massive proportions. The emergence of self-repairing cities is also always threatened by catastrophic weather. And while the future seems to be bringing with it a form of artificial intelligence that can outsmart us all, that does not mean that the machines will be any kinder.The rise of the robotics industry means that there will always be a need for human intervention, and although there are technologies that can be used to analyse massive amounts of data, there will always remain the raw materials that feed into a bomb. The reason why the robots are so good at what they do is that they are programmed to do it well enough that we don’t need to intervene. But what this implies is still being tested. There is a kind of ‘black-box’ that emerges from the chaos of the machine. It’s not a perfect system, but it is an ideal one – and yet it is what it does. It does what it is designed to do, which is to produce as much as it can in a given time.</text>

The emergence of self-repairing cities is a possibility that hardly any of us imagined possible.And then there’s pollution. We don’t yet know what the biennial experience will be like, since the dense, urban space around them is still emerging, and we don’t yet know what the public realm will be like. But given the choice, we are much more open to the idea that our public realm will be made up of things that we can’t see or don’t yet have access to. For many of us, the perception of the world as a polluted place is still deeply scarring. And if the biennial is any indication, we could conceivably reduce our exposure to the things we can’t see by becoming more connected and digitally empowered.The choice, then, is between a world where people live their lives according to the collective narratives that emerged from the arts and culture landscape, or a world in which art, creativity and the arts are either completely hidden</text>

The emergence of self-repairing cities is a possibility, too.Modern cities’ ecological footprints are littered with the corpses of all manner of creatures – mummies, zombies, ants, beetles, fish, trees, grasses, bushes, rivers, ponds, grasslands, grasslands with their lush vegetation and soil, their livestock pastures, playgrounds and playgrounds, playground walls, playground surfaces, playground play, playground servers, playground children, playground menageries, playgrounds with outdoor play, and so on. But unlike in nature, which tends to repeat itself through inevitable metamorphoses – our own cities are no exception – in the ecological and urban domain, changes are marked by sudden shifts in the underlying factors. Natural disasters are natural disasters, but they also tend to manifest unexpectedly and catastrophically. Antinomies emerge, and they tend to manifest unexpectedly and catastrophically in the context of urbanization. Cities are made up of many parts, and their various parts sometimes interlock to form larger systems</text>

The emergence of self-repairing cities is the answer to our question, not in terms of what might happen if a nuclear war were to break out, but in terms of what might be done to prevent it happening at all. The question, then, becomes not about the possible but about the desirability of technological change; how to allocate technological change in such a way as to foster social change rather than tearing it apart.

The emergence of self-repairing cities seems inevitable, but is it really the answer? In the twenty-first century, is it really the answer?ResourcesPossible futuresEnvironmental destruction and ecological degradation are the order of the micro-level in our current global economy. But whereas the biennale was once the pinnacle of global symbolic value, the urban spectacle is the pinnacle of global symbolic value. In other words, the more we add to the urban landscape, the more symbols we display, the more we ‘represent the world in symbols’. And so, the biennale becomes a global parfait – a cultural form that circulates globally, sometimes in defiance of its own ecological perambulations. A form that seems to be everywhere, but which is also deeply embedded and intimately associated with the particularities that constitute the human condition.This parfait forms, then, are not things that happen to be aesthetically pleasing to us; they are aspects of the very nature of the human condition that we happen</text>

But the emergence of self-driving cars and autonomous munitions also implies a catastrophe of massive proportions. The emergence of self-repairing cities is a different kind of catastrophe. It is a kind of ‘survival’, in the sense of Robert Brownstein’s characterisation of survival as a kind of ‘survival of the punctum’. ‘It’s the punctum that accounts for the large part of the human family’s DNA’, Brownstein writes, referring to the part of the human genome that is inherited as a single unit. The punctum is divided into two segments: the penumbra, or 'pocket dimension’, and the margin, or ‘wrist dimension’. The penumbra is the region of the body that is most susceptible to infection; the margin is the region where the body’s natural defences are weakest. In a recent study published in the journal Plos One, Brownstein and his team of researchers identified two genes – CCR5 and TSC4 – that are expressed at unusually low levels</text>

The emergence of self-repairing cities – which are, in a sense, magical in their resilience – is also a fantasy.While there is no doubt that new technologies are transforming how we live our lives – whether that transformation is desired or not – there is also no doubt that the social and political systems that support them are entwined in the historical trajectory. The challenge moving forward for those still reeling from the wake of the nuclear holocaust is to imagine alternative futures. ‘Thinking cities’ are real possibilities, but they are also made up of fantasies and imagined friends and neighbours. There are, however, other possibilities, which are outside the purview of the technocratic singularity. There are cities where people live lives quite different from the ones we imagine exist, for instance. There are other cities where people do not live lives quite like we imagine exist, for instance. There are other kinds of cities, whose shape we cannot define or conceive, where the social is non-existent, where there is a strong</text>

A third alternative is to create a citywide network of neighborhood centers with arts educational centers, but this is also an option for districts without strong arts pedigrees and budgets. Of course, creating alternative urban environments is only possible through the political will, and urban governments will inevitably abjure any such initiative. Finally, there is the option of partnering with a city�s existing arts district, or creating new artists� districts, though this is also a political risk, since the partners will inevitably be attracted by the easy government funding and arts-supported learning models offered by the city, while the city will undoubtedly resist such partnerships. Given the current political climate, it is imperative that the biennial maintain a critical social purpose</text>

One could, however, develop a biennial that incorporated a city-wide urban core, though this would only accelerate the urban-suburbs model�s inevitability. The point of a such a program would be to transition the city from an enclosed, suburban space (with its high cost and negative impact on the environment), into an urban space with a positive impact on the environment, at a very rapid pace. Such an approach would render the art-school campus redundant, while simultaneously providing the student body with a positive culture experience through a seamless transition. Such a program could also address the urban-suburbs problem from an urbanist�s point of view. For example, a core curriculum might include concepts from ‘Developing into Art’, a local studio called to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to art education and public engagement. The approach they propose might not sit well with the local community, but the urbanists argue that their proposal is an effective way to build capacity and imagination, while simultaneously creating a path for further development that supports the culture of the city at a rapid pace. Such a program could also provide a</text>

Instead of a city-wide urban core, cities have become enmeshed with their biennials, cordoning off distinct sectors of the city that are �specialized, urbanized, progressive, suburban, rural, tourist-oriented,�[6] and �dominated by a single, monolithic entity, such as a metro or regional government, national park, or business district, to be known as the city, or state, or “region,” or “community,”[7] and so on. The parallel development of local alternative art schools, city-dwelling urban suburbs, and ‘second tier’ urban districts is the current logic of urban infill, but with a crucial absent piece: art schools. The biennial has played this role since its inception in Venice, but unlike in other Italian cities, its true core is not located in the city, but spreads out across the globe. Art museums</text>

One way is to create innovative local alternatives to the big-city model, using the power of the local as a tool for social change. For example, the art school model is redundant in the modern city, but redundant in its urban-suburbs form – a neighborhood institution with a regular arts course, but without the institutional resources or cultural competency of a city university. One could, however, develop a biennial that incorporated a city-wide urban core, though this would only accelerate the urban-suburbs model�s demise. Instead, the city-wide urban core could be fostered through partnerships between local governments, civic leaders, and non-profit arts organizations. Such entities would leverage the expertise of urbanists, urban planners, urban artists, architects, and others with relevant expertise to inform and empower local communities to create a better future for themselves and their neighbourhoods.[6]One can also consider creating alternative, counter-culture-like urban environments through research-based practices, such as grassroots arts organizations. These might result in ‘culturally responsive architecture’, a blend of traditional urban patterns and new cultural forms that harness urban resources to meet different needs and to envision a future for neighbourhoods like New York and London. One could also consider ‘design cubist housing development through citizen input’, turning public art projects into socially engaged ‘productive art projects’ and crafting mixed-use 'places of work and play’ with civic leaders and neighbourhood stakeholders. Finally, one could consider creating</text>

One could, however, develop a biennial that incorporated a city-wide urban core, though this would only accelerate the urban-suburbs model�s runaway nature. Eventually, the art school and the urban core could be combined, creating a new ‘urban symphony’. In this scenario, the art school and the urban core could coexist, enabling a city to draw on the arts's social significance and potential revenue streams.  One could also invest in creating a biennial that includes a local audience, offering local artists a place in the museum alongside artists elsewhere in the world, and inviting artists to participate in the production of the museum through a local art fair and other similar mechanisms. These new media can act as a springboard to other art forms, providing a starting point for exploration and new forms of artistic expression.  One could also invest in creating a local, locally responsive art school that incorporates the arts within its curriculum, encouraging artists to explore other art forms through which they might engage audiences outside the city, and supporting such arts schools to expand their faculties of inquiry through providing arts education and cultural support to other arts schools and</text>

One could, however, develop a biennial that incorporated a city-wide urban core, though this would only accelerate the urban-suburbs model�s inevitability. Another is to create a mini-biennial that simultaneously exploits the city and subverts its potential resources. A well-curated urban core could be a potential tourist draw for such a mini-biennial, while a dense, multi-purpose, but accessible university-like campus could be a potential research centre for such a mini-biennial. A mini-biennial could also develop a relationship with a local cultural institution, while a city-wide mini-biennial does the opposite. For more on this latter approach, see: How Cities Can Reshape Art and Urban Space 	[6] and: How To Build A Biennial In Young Los Angeles  	[7] both written by and address the challenges of creating sustainable urban alternative to the large-scale, convention-endorsed suburban sprawl that characterises the contemporary footprint. [8] See: http://www.biennial.com/</text>

One could, however, develop a biennial that incorporated a city-wide urban core, though this would only accelerate the urban-suburbs model�s demise. The challenge, now, is for biennials to engage with their historical places of attack and create new social-change strategies. What has been lost in translation in the modern city is often recovered in translation: biennial funding is no longer given solely to institutions with a cultural impact, but is now a collective-fundraising instrument that targets a socio-politically engaged, globally-multicultural audience. With this in mind, biennials could consider creating progressive local-government forums in their localities to ground their local-community based curatorial agendas. For example, the Biennale of Sydney, convened in 2002, was led by a board of curators from different fields of art, including those in the museum curatorial team. The board members included artists, writers, curators, architects, landscape architects and urbanists. The writers included Maria Hlavajova, Oliver Plender, John Urry and Noel Burch. The curators included Yvonne Rain</text>

One could, however, develop a biennial that incorporated a city-wide urban core, though this would only accelerate the urban-suburbs model�s demise. The possibilities for a city-wide urban core are limited by the resources of the federal government, which tend to regulate in lockstep, nationwide, with few local exceptions. So a city-wide urban core could evolve into a city-only urban core, or into a city with some or all of its neighbourhoods incorporated into a metropolitan area, with limited self-government.  One might also create a biennial that invited artists to develop locally in concert with other institutions, rather than as a corporation or urban development corporation, and that promoted cooperation between local, regional and federal government, rather than exclusive federal governmentality. Such a strategy would circumvent the usual federalism constraint on state and local government, and could even end up empowering communities with mandates to police themselves.[6]Urban-design biennials, in their expanded sense, could also end up creating opportunities for industry in the core cities, since these are the locations with the most direct access to materials, technologies and labour.

One could, however, develop a biennial that incorporated a city-wide urban core, though this would only accelerate the urban-suburbs model�s inevitability. Another strategy is to embed creative, locally-based activities in the arts curricula of nearby schools or colleges, or host arts-only events at local hotels and clubs, or co-educate or co-accelerate existing arts programs, or combine the two. Such initiatives would have a similar impact on an institution�s bottom line, though the impact on the community would be significantly lessened.The third is to embed culture in the construction of infrastructure, either by providing free cultural instruction or arts education in the form of free concerts or events, or by providing both. This would impart a unique cultural touch to infrastructure works, while also providing a low-cost, high-impact way to contribute to the infrastructure of cities, perhaps even transforming them – transforming them into viable cultural entities – enabling cities to support cultural institutions and their activities. For example, the biennale of 2014 in Berlin incorporated cultural imperatives into the construction of new post-industrial dockside parks</text>

One could also encourage the growth of a local arts movement, perhaps through grants to arts-centred private companies, partnerships with local non-profit arts organisations, or even outright contracts with the city itself.These options would not only aid the growth of the local arts movement, but would also provide a means to endow this movement with cultural legitimacy and hold local authorities accountable. For example, the biennials mentioned above could endow the creation of civic entities with cultural identities and purpose, while also encouraging the development of collaborative research-based citizen arts projects. Perhaps the most radical option would be to completely withdraw from the city entirely, leaving its streets, parks and streets to artisans and artists’ organisations, while creating a parallel, but independent, but powerful N.F.O. city – a hybrid of the multiple voices of the local and of the urbanised citizen.This option is not without risk, since the creation of a N.F</text>

Writing in the wake of the outbreak of World War Two, Wilson described the catastrophic effects of a twofold declension of the technocratic state: the first occurring when state secrecy was broken, and the second when the state invades people's privacy. ‘The first declension … threatens the very idea of the “infrastructure” as such. The idea of the “infrastructure” as a rational system, based on publicly available information, capable of supporting democratic government … is under threat.’ He went on to warn that the second ‘declension’ threatens the very idea of the “infrastructure” as such, since it is being forced to evolve and mutate in response to the demands of a political</text>

They warn that as social media becomes more and more of a ‘bridge between social worlds’, it is susceptible to the politics of infrastructure, and the politics of appearance that seek to reconcile the self with the social. Their position is that while the autonomous vehicle may well deliver the technology necessary to change the world in dramatic ways, such changes would have to be negotiated with, and are thus potentially dangerous. They write:To complicate matters even further, the infrastructural mode of online socialization may well be more responsive to the needs of 'real-life' cities, where infrastructures are no longer viewed as inherently valuable and indestructible. In such cases, it may be necessary to negotiate a mode of intervention that preserves the integrity of the present through the negotiation of non-linear historical narratives and historical precedents.‘Real Life Cities’, based in part on a class assignment from the London School of Economics, was one of the first subjects covered by the journal ‘The Public Land’.

They warn that as social media becomes more and more of a ‘bridge between social worlds’, it is susceptible to the politics of infrastructure and the built environment, and to aural and virtual metrics as well as subjective principles of aesthetics. They cite research by Christopher Booker and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that demonstrates how the rise of social media data can be tied to rapid technological innovations such as information technologies.[1] Such links are not just theoretical. As a way of understanding and mapping rapid technological change, data analytics can be seen as an essential component of any large-scale social and spatial transformation.As an evolving field of research, mapping and theorizing, mapping is an ever-present and ever-present means of conceiving and of knowing or mapping. It is a constantly changing reference or reference point, and its use today can be seen as both a way of conceiving and of knowing.

They warn that as social media becomes more and more of a ‘bridge between social worlds’, it is susceptible to the politics of silence and dependency. They cite studies that reveal that infrastructure provides the means by which online communities can establish and maintain normative behaviours – rules, ‘trending’ narratives and themes, ‘liking’ and ‘sharing’ ‘connections’ – that can then be applied across a large scale of social media platforms. Such practices, they suggest, are possible because social media platforms understand ‘infrastructure-as-code’ – the underlying systems that enable interactive computing and data capture – and can therefore apply ‘infrastructure-as-music’ and ‘infrastructure-as-image’ practices across a globalized, interconnected world.These are sweeping generalisations, and it is important to distinguish between the social and the natural worlds in order to build sustainable and ethical online communities. For instance, in a city like Liverpool, infrastructure that supports interactive media is likely to be influenced by the city’s financial and urban constructs,</text>

The politics of infrastructure and data capture in the age of the social network. In the age of the social network, infrastructure now plays a greater role in linking social worlds than in separating them, and this greater connectivity necessitates greater levels of abstraction. In the age of the infrastructure citizen, infrastructure no longer stands for unchanging and unchanging as such, but rather for constantly shifting and subjecting oneself to ever greater levels of disruption and change. In that case, perhaps, the politics of infrastructure could be reconsidered to liberate us from our dependence upon it – liberate us from the seeming inhumanity of capital as a socio-economic-political-cultural imperative.2.

They cite a 1950s essay by Bernard Stiegler, who coined the term ‘metainterface’ to describe the new media infrastructure created by and dependent on the social. In his essay, Stiegler makes the claim that the task of imagining a future in which infrastructure is no longer comprised of passive objects is political and symbolic. He writes:Politics becomes particularly problematic when it falls outside the sphere of public administrators or public defenders, or when it is done in ways that are indifferent to the natural environments in which we find ourselves … Such political fantasizing is especially prevalent in the public imagination these days, where infrastructure is often portrayed as a renewable material substance that can be transformed into a useful object … Such an infrastructure would tend to render the public … indistinguishable from nature, rendering the infrastructure itself something other than what it is.’ Ismail Khan, ‘Interstate Freeway: The Entire Environmental Landscape Shifted into Plac</text>

They cite a passage from Monopoly where Fred Lord, the fictional partner of Monopoly director Peter Brook, warns his partner Jennifer Brozek not to invest too heavily in infrastructure projects, because they can't possibly be reliable, and to instead focus on building ‘meaningful community infrastructure’. The politics of infrastructure projects, they write, become indistinguishable from politics in space. They are political not because they are politically incorrect, but because they are inherently unreliable.Brozek, however, quickly responds that this is a political economy. In the age of social media, the politics of infrastructures are no longer confined to the confines of national capital cities, but are also taking root globally.

As the ‘meaning-processes’ that connect social worlds converge to produce ‘meaning-objects’, the authors suggest that ‘infrastructure-as-intersection’ may be reconfigured to connect to other spatialities and non-human animal worlds.In another layer of the social-technological apparatus, the wild or wild animal becomes the subject of a ‘technological society’, which is itself a ‘complex spatial and behavioural configuration of processes involving large-scale data mining and social-media analysis –––a notion that has recently been revived by new media of data-mining.

They suggest a response by the autonomous vehicle: it’s possible to imagine a car that understands how to work with information, and can therefore map the city in ‘deep layers’ using machine learning techniques. Such an approach could conceivably apply not only to infrastructure, but also to metadata, or data about objects in the city, and is a response to the question: what constitutes an object in the world?In an earlier version of their research project, the researchers also employed procedural complexity to understand how the human-leveling technology of surveillance cameras could be adapted to manipulate and manipulate information at an object-level. Here, they focused on the procedural aspects of the technology, specifically how cameras calculated the positions of objects in the scene, and what kinds of object transformations could be performed on such data.

The ability to detect and remove debris using these and other data sources opens new doors for research, suggests the report.The development could lead to better ways of working alongside the public, in which case the research could also be delivered as part of a public programme. This would strengthen the public sector's hand in the context of the de-confliction of efforts between government and non-government actors, with the government providing essential public services but at no cost to other stakeholders. The report then proposes two next steps for research and development: (1) a multi-disciplinary team of researchers working in collaboration with partners at the Norwegian and Danish National Centres for Air and Space Research in Oslo and Copenhagen to develop a prototype of the technology for use in aircraft; and (2) a larger collaborative research programme with partners at the Danish Aerospace Centre to expand the prototype to global standards.The report then proposes two next steps for application: (1) to</text>

The technology enables the technology to detect and remove debris using GPS. The ability to detect and remove debris using these technologies is critical in an industrial setting because they enable the identification and removal of large volumes of debris at a rapid rate. The ability to detect and remove debris using these technologies is critical in an urban context because it enables the identification and removal of smaller volumes of debris at a rapid rate. Such rapid identification and removal is crucial in the event of a disaster because it facilitates the evacuation of people and goods and minimises injury and death to workers and the communities around the sites of the disasters. Such rapid identification and removal is crucial in the event of a disaster because it facilitates the return of property and minimises loss to other users of the site – a very important public good in an urban setting.

The ability to detect and remove debris using radars opens new opportunities for damage control and minimises collateral damage. The ability to detect and remove debris using radars opens new opportunities for industrial and commercial applications. The ability to detect and remove debris using radars opens opportunities for both military and non-military uses – for example, in the event of a terrorist attack, in the event of a cyberattack, or in the event that a debris field presents a hazard to critical infrastructure.The radar systems that underpin the technology can be classified into two broad categories: radar systems for surface and maritime objects, and radar systems for air and ground based objects. Radar systems for surface and maritime objects are those that directly interface with the electronics of objects; those that directly observe, measure or manipulate the shape of the surface or water; and those that manipulate the shape of the ground and air by emitting, receiving or processing data.

The ability to detect and remove debris using radars opens up new opportunities for the area controlled by defence forces, including the mining industry, in which removal of mining waste is a major source of waste produced in the area. The ability to detect and remove debris using radars could lead to the development of autonomous drone delivery systems for hazardous materials, such as waste from underground mining operations, radiological materials and waste handling equipment, among others. The ability to detect and remove debris using radars could also lead to the development of self-healing concrete and steel manufacturing plants, which are the industrial products of the future, if advanced.

The concept is being applied in a wide range of industrial settings, including in the production of composite parts and building products; in the construction of data capture and management systems; and in the development of self-healing buildings and materials. The technology is being used in the production of aircraft parts by manufacturing processes including vapour deposition, which uses liquid ammonia as a solvent and solvent-based additive in the production of composite parts; in the production of oil by distillation of hydrocarbons including natural gas; in the production of natural rubber by distillation of hydrocarbon byproducts; and in the production of plastic materials by rolling plastics into powder and depositing the powders in solution. A variety of shapes and sizes are possible and may be incorporated into products; the most common are cylinders, spheres, spheres, flattened cubes, flattened pegs, hexagons and hexagons. The cylinders, spheres, and cubes of the present invention are fabricated using processes incorporating hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials and mac</text>

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in 2018. The timeline considers the three main social networking platforms of the 1990s: Microsoft Windows, Facebook and Twitter. The three volumes cover a relatively narrow geographical area of the planet, but the similarities end there. The three volumes that make up the ‘90s’ are divided into three ‘decades’ – a break from previous convention – and ‘twenty years’ – a change from present-day convention. In the intervening years, the internet has evolved to become what it is, producing persistent changes in how people connect to the net and the web of things. The end result is that the internet is experienced as both an ever-present presence (in the form of apps, websites and services) and a transient one (e.g. virtual private networks, DNS, domain names, IP addresses, TCP/IP stack, browsers, email, social media, virus definitions, search engines, routing tables and protocol stacks).

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in October 2019. The publication of three works in parallel was once again possible through a partnership between the Liverpool Biennial and the publishing house Macmillan, which runs the UK’s largest online bookseller, NASDAQ: AMAC. 	The three-volume ‘Golden Age of the Web’ project marks a new phase in the history of the art book and online reading, one that sees the critical writings on the web as a work in progress. The ‘golden age’ concept was coined by Graham Read in 2015, and continues to be a point of contention between scholars, aesthete and critic. Recent editions of the journal, ‘utopian sections’, have picked up on the concept’s revival in academia and the popular culture.

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in July 2019. The website www.3in3digitalhistories.com is hosted on an archive.org domain and is updated daily. At present, the archive.org domain also includes http://archiveofsocialnet.info/, a website registered in the name of Nina Edge, a curator at the National Portrait Gallery, who has a specialised interest in documenting the history of portraiture. Her website features archival images, articles and texts relating to the history of portraiture. Edge’s interest in portraiture began when, during a portraiture workshop for the Liverpool Biennial, she was asked to investigate the practice of portraiture in the UK during the 1980s and 1990s. Edge’s research led on several years' worth of research, using archival materials, interviews and documents, through which she pieced together a picture of the life and work of dozens of artists, showcasing the work they had produced between 1979 and the early 2000s</text>

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in November 2019. The three parts cover different aspects of the internet, with particular attention being paid to its infrastructure and how it is connected to the history of the medium. While the initial concepts and practices of the web are ancient, a new kind of web is emerging. This kind of web is more open and allows for ‘infrastructure transformation’, as well as ‘infrastructure reconfiguration’, to address ‘domain specificities’. The term ‘infrastructure transformation’ refers to the processes and innovations that create and contribute to the web being able to support new modes of communication and ‘infrastructure reinforcement’, as well as ‘infrastructure recoding’. Infrastructures are the objects of surveillance and regulation, yet they also play a pivotal role in infrastructural progress. Understanding how infrastructures shape and evolve is critical in contributing to the reconfiguration of the web and facilitating the transformation of infrastructure, both</text>

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in October 2019. The purpose of the project, from the beginning, was to document the history of the web on a global scale, and to do so in a way that is both readable and non-intrusive. The three volumes were published simultaneously; this made it possible to connect the various stories told in the three volumes, making the collection of experiences collected and presented in each volume a living document. The aim of the project is to have a &quot;big enough digital footprint&quot; to be able to find and access the documents that are contained in each volume, and to be able to merge the different stories into a new narrative. In order to achieve this, each volume was compiled into one large document, and to be able to access the individual chapters at the same time. This made it possible to ‘reproduce the archaeological site (in the sense of desiring to be able to find and access the same archaeological site repeatedly) by integrating different layers of information and evidence into a single narrative</text>

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in September 2019. 	Each volume follows a different theme, with different authors contributing different chapters. The first two volumes cover the social web and its history, and how it came to be dominated by a single platform: desktop, laptop, and mobile. The mobile volume focuses on the various platforms on which the social web is built, and how they relate to one another and to data. The chapters on design and web development develop slowly, but they all culminate in a question: why did the mobile app on the iPhone become the best-selling app on the App Store? 	The chapter on data structures and how they are used explores the ways in which data is transformed and manipulated on a global and societal scale. It proposes a ‘myth of omnipotent data curators’, who create and enforce new data collection and usage patterns, and how this affects communities of users around the world, but also how this impacts international data flows and the circulation and utilisation of information. </text>

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in January 2019. The purpose of this triennale, in keeping with its historical approach, is to treat the web as a living organism that responds to questions of community, identity and governance. The three volumes of the book are organized around three main themes: the origins of the internet, 1971; the web 2.0, 2015; and virtual reality, 2021. Like the previous volumes, the web 2.0 theme explores the ways in which the internet can be reconfigured through new technological means, and the social implications of this potential. Like the previous three volumes, the virtual reality theme explores the ways in which social media can be used to create presences and narratives, and the role of art and cultural institutions. Like the previous three volumes, the third volume considers the intersections between art and social media. Like previous biennales, the 2018 edition intends to document the social transformations wrought by the internet and virtual reality, while the social media users who inhabit these technologies will be counted among the […]</text>

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in December 2018. In an effort to publish the same three works simultaneously, I’m including a chapter on the internet in each volume, with the three volumes in parallel. This approach is consistent with the original proposal, but breaks the internet into parts, offering different perspectives on the same issue. For example, the chapter on social media usage and its connections to the digital footprint of the site covers topics such as image processing, but it also introduces topics such as social networking and the dynamics that arise from it. 	The chapters on digital technologies and media technologies cover a broad range of topics, but they generally refer to how humans create online experiences and how this impacts cultural practices and consumption. The chapter on media technologies and their impact on the cultural landscape of the 21st century is particularly interesting and can seem pedantic at times. It draws parallels between Facebook and email in the 1990s and how the social networks that emerged in response to the proliferation of print media are impacting contemporary cultural practices and consumption.</text>

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in September 2019. The purpose of the present three-volume set of the ‘Social Contract’ is to document the social contract between citizens and online communities, in which the online community (or social contract) is primarily defined by the individual citizens who construct, use and control it. In this context, the work focuses on the online community that organises itself as a ‘we’ – a narrative that is often fragmented, ill-defined or nonexistent, and that is frequently accompanied by critical discourse. The volume ‘Social Contract II’ collects and contextualises the social contract that was negotiated between citizen and online community in 2018, and addresses the ways in which the community has implemented this contract in practice. The volume ‘Social Contract III’ collects and discusses the contract between the community and technology that was negotiated in 2019, and addresses the ways in which the community is implementing this contract in research and education.

The three volumes of the book were published simultaneously, with the third volume due in October 2019. The publication of both the ‘third volume’ and the ‘fourth volume’ coincided with the one-year anniversary of the closure of the #1 US search engine, SERCO, which affected over 9 million UK sites. The publication of both the ‘third volume’ and the ‘fourth volume’ coincided with the one-year anniversary of the closure of the notorious darknet marketplace Silk Road, which resulted in the arrest of over 2,000 people and over 6,000,000 downloads of artworks and other digital content. The introduction of new technologies and services to the web consumed in the 1990s and early 2000s, including social media, led to an exponential growth in reading and podcasting, whilst new media and apps fuelled an even faster growth in sharing and social media. 	The social impact of the closure of major US internet service providers remains unclear, although in the UK alone, critical conversation around the power and role of the internet</text>

It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the machine was motivated by an interest in the production of balance, and its curators were artists who acted as artists’ assistants. But there was also a background of conscious cultural manoeuvring at the highest levels in response to the ever-present threat posed by culture as a capital in crisis of accessibility and in need of our financial support. The machine could not have known what it was doing. 	In conclusion, we can say with some confidence that the future city will not be like the past urban environment; it will not be run by giant, amoral resource extraction camps staffed by top-down, uniformed, bureaucratised decision makers, but rather will be managed by artists, curators, architects and other artisans who will operate in coordination with local authorities and other partners. This may require new forms of co-determination between citizens and artisans, artisans and other artisans, artisans and communities, and artisans and partners. Local governments</text>

It is true that, during the 1990s, the biennial format was negatively impacted by a number of biennials moving to alternative venues in the surrounding area. But the fact that artists were often present in exhibitions that addressed specific local problems – such as food and housing shortages – is an effect of the new institutional forms that emerged during the 1990s. Biennials incorporated artworks from a variety of local artists' studios, and placed many of these artsworks online for free. Artworks produced online provided an alternative to the city’s dilapidated infrastructure, but at the same time they were used as a point of departure for artists to explore different kinds of urban environments. The biennial form was able to respond to both the needs of the museum and the biennial form, although the museum needed to be reinforced against the impact of a culture of biennials. In 1990, the biennial was restructured to better serve the biennial form, and a new exhibition format was developed in collaboration with the bienn</text>

Finally, it could do so in response to the machine’s need to capitalise on the transient and the present urban situation by creating ‘perfectly curated exhibitions’ that serve as a point of departure for cultural activity elsewhere in the city. 	It is true that, during the 1970s and 1980s, the Biennale presented its curatorial agenda in relation to other art institutions in the city, using the role of a catalyst for cultural activity elsewhere in the city. However, this was seen as a limited function of the institution’s financial position and power. Today, the Biennale does not need to generate cultural activity elsewhere in the city, although it does need to know how to use the power of its position as a biennale to meet its own needs. Its relationship to the rest of the city is a myth. Its relationship to the city is a complex web of cultural, economic, spatial and legal entanglements. It is true that, during the 1970s and 1980s, the Biennale displayed the full range of its considerable visual arts collections, including works from many of its present and former curators, among them Peter Saville, Peter McCaughey, Alan Bass and Peter McCaughey. But, to be fair,</text>

It is true that, during the 1990s and 2000s, the exhibition business experienced a rapid growth in New York; the number of art galleries in the city increased almost twenty-fold during the same period. But the increase in numbers attending art galleries during this period did not necessarily result in an increase in exhibition revenue. For one thing, the major galleries graced with the new wave of artists tended to be clustered in the financial district, where accessibility to art was a concern. And the 2000 Venice Biennale, with over 1,000 artworks on show, may have served as a kind of testing ground for some of the new exhibition-building practices that would later be adopted by other biennials. But a critical look at the economics of art today clearly shows that the biennial as an exhibitionary form is not so easily displaced, and may well form the basis for a future social and economic infrastructure. 	Art galleries may no longer rule the day in New York, but they are still a fixture of the city</text>

It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the museum visitor was drawn to the ‘luxury end’ of the market – the museum, the buildings, the décor. But the cutting-edge of contemporary art’s museumisation occurred at the RCA’s Arrowhead Gallery, where the cutting-edge of contemporary art was displayed alongside works by artists whose work was exhibited in the most prestigious contemporary venues in the city. The Arrowhead was, in other words, a hub for artists developing internationally, but also for artists developing locally. 	However, the introduction of new technologies and the metainterface during the 1980s and 1990s – the rise of the museum and its outlets, the metainterface – also coincided with a sharp decline in attendance at the museum, which was accompanied by a sharp decline in artistic output, especially on the part of the younger generation. So the levels of artistic activity during those decades were marked by a shift towards more diverse forms of cultural</text>

It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the machine was highly individualised and individualised in its aesthetic orientations. However, the more significant feature of the machine’s programming was the increasing corporatisation of the city, and the increasingly institutionalised form of what was being called ‘the city’. The sale of individual artworks to collectors was a feature of the 1990s, and the machine’s programming meant that artworks could be assembled and arranged into museums, galleries, archives and social activities that would be suitable for collection. These collections would then be assembled into national pavilions, and eventually, ‘the city’ itself. But the machine was far more than a collection of artworks. It was also a programming language for a city, a logic that allowed the machine to do amazing things with the city’s resources, generating new revenue streams and even being used to establish ‘private ‘paradigm zones’ within the city. </text>

It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the machine was often accused of favouring certain artists over others. It was also true that, during these decades, the machine was often accused of being exploitative. But the fact of the machine’s being often accused of being exploitative remains a significant obstacle to the machine’s being realised. The reason is that, at the time, many artists were drawn to the art of the machine and its exciting possibilities, while many were drawn to the art of the community, which tended to be more concerned with the well-being of its community. In these ways, it can be seen as a positive development that the machine is now often accused of being a hindrance to creativity. 	Artists who were drawn to the machine during the 1980s and 1990s are often criticised for not trying harder or being more innovative, but this is rarely given the time or space to be considered an authentic contribution to art’s contemporary situation.  	</text>

It could do so in response to the city’s shrinking civic capacity by providing artists with a platform to express themselves in a way that is both highly visible and highly mediated. Finally, it could do so in response to the machine’s need to capitalise on the transient and the present urban situation by creating ‘perfectly curated exhibitions’ that serve as a point of departure for cultural activity elsewhere in the city. 	It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the machine was more readily available and more globally accessible, but this comes at a price. The city that is now New York is much more difficult and expensive to navigate. It is more difficult because of the historical predilections of the city: the art museum, the historic district, the historic district as a whole. And it is more expensive because of the enormous amount of development going on in the city, including the financial sector and the cultural sector. It is true that, during this transition to more accessible and more fully incorporated forms of the machine, art was more readily available in the machine, but this comes at a price. Art is still very much a product of the past, and the machine still wants to produce artists as artists, through whatever means are necessary. 	The key to understanding the machine’s economic power is that we must understand that it is able to maintain its current forms because it has no interest in changing them. It is able</text>

It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, art and design were often presented as if they were a single phenomenon, with the machine looking to the future and the artist’s perception of the present. However, the tendency during these decades was to look to the past rather than the future; to take for granted what was possible and to pursue future possibilities that are far more powerful and far more controllable. 	In recent years, curators and arts administrators in many cities around the world have put art/design/functional arts (sometimes referred to as ‘brain tourism’) at the core of initiatives to promote or to absorb the transient into the local culture. Brain tourism is a real phenomenon and cities around the world are awash in brain images; images of art, architecture, culture and cities percolating through every possible channel. Brain tourism is a real market in brain images and the related phenomena of cultural spread and the cultural punchbowl. Brain tourism has become so pervasive that it is</text>

It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the ‘machine’ was often accused of over-utilising its art resources and becoming a liminal artform, as if the art and curatorial turn in the city were somehow a direct result of the machine’s increasing intelligence and omnipresence. But these accusations were used as a tool by the machine to grow ever more powerful. The presence of certain types of art in the curatorial turn is a fact of life in the contemporary city, and almost all artists during this period were either trained as curators or fellow curators who regularly witnessed and acted as participants in the machine’s workings. 	Through an act of parliament in 1994, art institutions were required to register with the city press corp, which in turn, required them to create 'curatorial activities’ that met the legal definition of art per se. As a consequence, many art institutions that once operated in and around the city gravitated towards the transnational, internationally</text>

It is material in that it is possible to trace cultural capital back to the earliest human traces in the fossil record, and cultural capital thus becomes both the material underpinning of human behaviour and its destinies. The term itself is evocative and describes material features of cultural production that are shared across human species, even though it is often used to describe the shared properties of human language, cultural values and institutional forms.

The work ‘repetitively revisited’ the places where its discursive turns first emerged, as well as revisiting some of the places where its present is likely to emerge. While the projects were in their earliest stages, their contents, as well as their trajectories, move easily from the city they were installed in, to the villages around them, to the hills and mountains around Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nablus. The project ‘repetitions a call to arms’ in the language of the interethnic bond. As the biennale’s title suggests, the interlocutors are drawn from around the globe, but also from within their own adopted place and time. The artist’s writing, in both texts and music, is a rallying cry. Its earnest depiction of the state of Palestine, populated as it is by Palestinians, is a call to arms.

Both installations were part of the Phipps Foundation Triennale, which was also part of the NOMADICAMMY initiative. The works underscore the ecological, climatological and urban complexities of the Palestine/Israel/Syria border region. 	The biennale has traditionally recognized a curator as the highest authority in the cultural sector, and the individual or collective responsibility for the work produced. In the case of an emergency, a special committee of artists, historians and activists has the final say in the context of the art project. The committee consists of eleven members, including three from the Biennale staff.

The second phase of the Project Digital Art (2017–present) will focus on the creation of an alternative digital art museum, presenting the work of artists and online communities in the context of the artworld.

The museum will offer a place of reconciliation and a place for the celebration of art’s emancipatory potential. 	In 2018, a ‘white elephant in the museum room’ was created by artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan, whose installation, titled  	Israel, was exhibited as part of the Biennale in Amsterdam. In the same year, artist duo BOYD &amp; AUTOPSY visited Palestine and East Jerusalem, and the West Bank and Gaza Strip, documenting the conflicts on their laptops. The work  	Riding Tiger, part of the exhibition  	Procession at the Tate Modern, highlighted the ongoing occupation of Palestinian lands by Israel Defence Forces (IDF) forces, which continue to lay waste to both urban and rural Palestinian communities in the occupied territories. The pair were both active in their respective right-wing online communities, and their art projects often attempted to intervene between Facebook users and the media outlets that report on Israeli politics and military affairs. The white elephant in the museum room often represents the institutional inertia of the art world, or at least the power brokers who shape what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behaviour online.

The images they produced helped to catalyze the 2016 Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe) movement and sparked a worldwide ethical debate on the ecological and geo-political dimensions of the Palestinian identity.

In November 2018, the Biennale announced a collaboration with KICA Architects to design a new space for the future city of Taipei. Architectural firm KICA, established in 1883, is internationally renowned for its high-performance residential and commercial buildings, innovative mixed-use developments and public realm design. KICA was selected for the project because of its commitment to social and ecological sustainability, as well as its historical and contemporary focus on conflict zones in the Pacific. The Biennale is delighted to have these historic buildings and the dynamic context in which they were conceived and designed returned, as a means to revisit and address some of their unresolved issues.

The work, which sought to reconcile two radically different readings of the same historical narrative, was exhibited in Paris and Berlin, and in New York and Istanbul. The Palestinian narrative was reinterpreted through the lens of the ‘digital painting’, which emerged as a response to the monstrosity of Israeli colonialism. The pair’s works, which utilized computer-generated imagery and engaged users in a ‘virtual painting’ by ‘imagining a future’, sought to bring a public awareness of the violence and injustice inflicted on the Palestinian people. In Berlin, the exhibition ‘Digital Loaf: Bread, Memory, Food’ was followed by a ‘bread, memory, and bread event’ on the city’s Champs-Élyséry, which asked participants to create an image that would appear in the exhibition. In New York, the online exhibition ‘The Electronic Intifada’ followed a few weeks later, using the event to</text>
