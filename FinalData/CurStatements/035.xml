Thus, a convention like the one in London is unprecedented in Canada because it abjures the legislative and executive levels and instead relies on an executive council, a group of elected representatives chosen from among those who have signed up to serve on it. 	[11] The convention also incorporates a defined set of grievances – entitled ‘Fourteen Points’ – that enumerate transgressions against the federal government. The grievances clearly set out the ways in which the federal government is failing its citizens, while simultaneously emphasising the virtues of provincial and municipal governments. The convention therefore not only proposes remedies, but actively encourages action on the part of citizens to remedy the  	[12]  	[</text>

Commissioner’s Restaurant, 2013 ONCA 515, at para. 22: I do not find the notion of intent animating the triable question in this case. Rather, the real issue is whether the public body which employs the ‘restaurant’ can establish a clear and convincing case against its employee who unlawfully trespasses within the establishment.

This formulation reflects the fact that the United Nations Convention on the Day of the Murderer specifically excludes questions relating to the place and status of human beings.)   1  The convention was ratifying 40 amendments on its second reading in December 1968, a total of  	274. It provides that:No state shall … deprive any person of life, liberty, or property … except in case of a war…] Every person who transgresses … shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of … three months … and … shall forfeit not more than … one‑half of the value of the real property destroyed or stolen.]&quot; (Emphasis added.)  2  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Convention_of_the_International_Assets_Court_of_Lookout,_1968, #Addition, accessed 10 December 2013.   3  See:</text>

It defines an ‘executive’ as having authority ‘over such matters as are reserved for parliament, including the reserved provisions concerning the status of persons, places and things’. It further defines an ‘parliamentary’ act as one that has legislative or constitutional force. 2  The convention further distinguishes between legislative and executive acts. Legislative acts – i.e. acts authorised by parliament – are those that directly affect a person (such as an act granting citizenship); executive acts – i.e. acts that influence or coerce a person to do something – are those that influence or coerce a state to do something (such as a prohibition against a particular action). Legislative and executive acts have different intentions. Legislative acts aim to achieve a ‘goal’, i.e. achieve an outcome; executive acts aim to produce a change in an outcome (i.e. action). In other words, the aims of legislative and executive acts differ, and the methods differ. The aims of an ‘executive’ act are also different. An ‘executive’ act may</text>

It defines an ‘executive’ as having authority ‘over such matters as are reserved for parliament, including the reserved provisions concerning the activities of the National Park Service and the establishment and maintenance of the character of the National Park).’ 2  The convention further defines an ‘inhabitant’ as one who remains permanently within the park:

… [W]hen an area of the park is transferred to the Park Service, such an area falls within the purview of the new Corporation.[2]

In other words, the Park Service is able to establish policies and regulations that directly impact on the activities of the NPS, but also to defer to the judgement of a community organisation when it comes to the establishment and maintenance of parks and monuments – a situation that is somewhat paradoxical, given that the Park Service is charged with protecting the natural resources of the park from appropriation.  	In 2006, a coalition of advocacy groups, Indigenous organizations, academics, community activists and historians assembled in Seattle to catalogue and critique the history and present effects of the NPS's ‘Parks and</text>

It defines an ‘executive’ as having authority ‘over such matters as are reserved for parliament, including the reserved provisions concerning the powers of the president and such other subjects of state as the convention may provide’. 2  The convention thus recognises the legislative, but it is equally clear that the executive derives its authority from the people. The people’s representatives are therefore not allowed to legislate in favour of a particular perspective or point of view, but must instead activate the ‘potentiality of popular consent’ by engaging in positive action – engaging, for example, with the prevailing economic and social systems that generate inequality and conflict. The way in which conventionality is constituted and interpreted is also an important point of departure. If we begin to negotiate the inherent institutionalised rationality of our societies, then we will inevitably begin to suffer from what Peter Singer calls ‘collectivism gone mad’.

It defines an ‘executive’ as having authority ‘over such matters as are reserved for parliament, including the reserved provisions concerning the jurisdiction of the executive.]&quot; 3  The convention therefore recognises the legislative and executive branches of government equally, although in different spheres. It is up to each citizen to establish and maintain a militia, to protect himself or herself from attack, and to use that authority effectively. The convention does not prescribe how to do so, nor specify who shall exercise that authority. It is the citizenry that establishes those capacities and competencies, and the executive that exercises those powers.It is true that the framers of the convention did not intend that the militia be organised along racial or ethnic lines; rather, the intention was to empower each citizen to arm and self-defence his or herself. But that is the job of the state to ensure that citizens take part in the common good, and the common good is only possible in cooperation with each other. In the twentieth century, ethnic and racial minorities played a much greater role in third-party politics than they do in the twenty-first</text>

It adopts this concept in its own supersized and complex way, adopting the specific ways in which the individual or clique appropriates or usurps on the property of the neighbourhood, the city and the nation.It is this idea of the ‘transient state’ that characterises the ever-increasingly complex and privatized form of nation-building that is being attempted today in the ‘metro’ and ‘suburban’ segments of the ‘metropolitan’ complex. It is this idea that is being sought to be replaced by a different kind of public sphere – one in which power is distributed among many people rather than in the hands of a few – one in</text>

It defines an ‘executive’ as having authority ‘over such matters as are reserved for parliament, including the reserved provisions concerning the powers of the federal government, including powers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution’.[12] Parliament is the highest legislative authority in Canada, and the executive is subordinate to the Crown in Canada. Therefore, while the federal government may legislate in ways that target particular communities, it is significantly more powerful and successful at enacting such legislation (in most cases, at least) when it takes steps that further subvert the will of the people.[13] For more information, see Carolyn Bennett and Irit and Peter Weibelmann, eds., The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Chronicle Books, Toronto, 1994).

Triangle and the Liverpool Triangle. The history of Granby is told in the 1993 film Granby Four Streets, released in 1994, about the squatting of British textile workers during World War II in an area known as Tin Flats.

The artists in the series were selected through an open call focused on avant garde/bloommie tendencies in the social sciences, architecture, and design, among other disciplines. The call reflected the historical avant-garde tradition in Mexico, Central America and the United States, and the interesting turn of some avant-garde artists towards critical writings due to the increasing impoverishment of the societies from which their cultural practices emerged. While the first wave of avant-garde artists was artists who achieved critical acclaim and a dedicated following, the critical moment came in the 1960s and 1970s with the strategic promotion of national priorities and the logic of ‘full employment’ at the expense of the host society.

The series was presented in five parts: Part One, Part Two, Part Three, Part Four and Part Five. The exhibition was co-curated by Ana Laura Lopéz de la Torre and Guillermo del Toro, and Christopher Goldenberg, Glasgow, Scotland based artist duo. The artworks in the series were designed in collaboration with Aventura Architecture &amp; Urban Design (A.L.T.D.), Glasgow University, Glasgow School of Art, Glasgow, Scotland, and Inhabitant artists Eduardo Nuñez, Miguel Angel Silvestre and Ricardo Nuñez. The series was supported by the Scottish Heritage Fund, Dunblane Foundation, DEO, and the Arts Council Scotland, Edinburgh. To celebrate the launch of Part One, a five-day open school workshop and social event at Château Galeries Dessalines in December 2017, the artists Aventura Architecture &amp; Urban Design (A.L.T.D.), Glasgow University, Glasgow, Scotland and Inhabitant Artists, Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland were invited to set up a collaborative project, Projections,  with the Scottish Heritage Fund, Dunblane Foundation, DEO, Glasgow and Rosie Cooper Learning Centre, Edinburgh, Scotland. The project was developed with Glasgow Biennial, the city’s oldest running 101 years, in mind as an ongoing art-historical journal. The project began</text>

The project was part of the broader New Architecture project, initiated in 2006 by Olafur Eliade and Harold Saltman at NYU and funded by the New York City Department of Homeless Services and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It was part of an overall exhibition called Architecture of the Near East, to be displayed in the Solomon H. Gidar Gallery at NYU Medical School from October 2015 to June 2016. The following year, in September 2015, the Architecture of the Twenty-First Century was launched to showcase twenty-first century projects in the region, specifically addressing the role of contemporary architecture criticism in the region’s rapid urbanisation.

The installation, which was to be housed in the Permanent Trauma Unit at NYU Medical School, brought together two divergent perspectives and declared a new direction for the project. The resulting work was intended to be temporary and self-sustaining, while the health of the local community was taken into consideration when designing the future of the neighbourhood. The ability of community groups to take control of their futures was addressed. 	The project was also intended to address the cultural value of the area and the fact that the artifice of modern architecture was being challenged everywhere from the subcontinent to the Middle East. In so far as the cultural value of the area is a source of political empowerment, it is a site of potential conflict and conflict is shaping and creating new spaces of possibility for art and culture everywhere. 	The project was initially conceived as a ‘trip’ for a curatorial team led by Jeffrey Koons, who works as an architect and is a professor in the Department of the Built Environment at the New School in New York City. The team was assisted by the curator Evelyn Forget, who works as an arts educator and is an adjunct professor in the department of art, design, and architecture at Columbia University</text>

The resulting work was intended to be temporary and self-sustaining, while the NYU Trauma Unit developed a new, more immersive sense of the area through a hybrid architecture school and academic programme in the Public Art department. The new architecture school designed an entirely new kind of urban academy for artists and architects, which offered a clear separation between urban and rural learning environments. There was also an endowment fund for future public programmes, specifically for projects in the Lower East Side. 	The artists, urbanists and architects who worked on the project were engaged with the notion of resistance in relation to gentrification and made a new kind of attempt to understand how art and civil engineering can play a role in resisting it. The resulting project,  	Urban Futures, was an exploration of the political and aesthetic possibilities of such resistance, which were then put to use building public programmes in the area. The subtitle of the project, given the fractured state of urban infrastructure and the growing population crisis confronting much of the world, is appropriate. 	The</text>

The installation, which was to be housed in the Permanent Trauma Unit at NYU Medical School, brought together two divergent perspectives and declared a new direction for the project. The resulting work was intended to be temporary and self-sustaining, with ongoing artistic and collaborative input from the public. The installation was intended to be a counterweight to the incoming urbanisation of New York City, and its projects of development outside the city. It was also intended to be a counterweight to gentrification and the associated displacement of low-income communities, as well as to the increasingly aggressive policy of neoliberalism and its socio-political effects on the urban and rural fabric of the city. The project was developed with the support of a New York City Legacy Fund programme at Manhattan Library and Museum. The project was designed by Wendy Chun and Wendy L. Stein, with art direction by Ray Walker, who supervised with Wendy Chun and Wendy L. Stein on the project’s architecture, design, and interior decoration.

The installation, which was to be housed in the Permanent Trauma Unit at NYU Medical School, brought together two divergent perspectives and declared a new direction for the project. The resulting work was intended to be temporary and self-sustaining, with the public realm emerging as a site of resistance and imagination. 	The installation, Manhattan’s New Economics of Urbanization announced as part of the New York Museum of Art’s 2015 exhibition package, is a reimagining of an old idea of the city as an immense computer system. It deploys the idea of the ‘peripheral’ to contest the idea of the ‘central’. The installation is a counterweight to the city’s ever-expanding image of itself as an image of technological innovation and productivity. The installation proposes a radically different urban setting for future research projects. It proposes a future with no borders, wherein citizens live in autonomous realms governed by their own cultural and social resources, such as the ‘design zones’ created by the artist and her team. These autonomous localities envision a different future for New York and the developing world, where people not subject to the control of large</text>

The Lower East Side Project 	The idea of the installation as a continuous series of temporary shelters has been used repeatedly throughout the history of the American dream. In Greek, the definition of the word ‘temporary’ is a keyword that can be used to identify a number of different types of structures: temporary, replacement, alteration, collective, common and final. Greek and Roman cities regularly employed ‘temporary’ as a way to designate a series of different structures that can be assembled at a later date, or at any moment. For example, in the famous ‘tenement crisis’ Japanese urbanist Hiromiya City Councilman Kazuhiko Matsumoto sought to create ‘a new zone of public and collective recreational space and use’ by demolishing much of the historic East Japan Standard Building and converting the</text>

The resulting work was intended to be temporary and self-sustaining, while the residents of the Lower East Side relocated to newer, more urban environments. 	The project was also intended to address a broader cultural angle through the installation of works by artists from the area, as well as to engage a wider local audience. In this regard, the artists and the site were intended to function as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, their urban planning and site-specific projects provided a platform for a number of creative acts to be developed within the precinct, while at the same time fostering a low-income environment for many of these individuals to inhabit. At the same time, a number of these communities decided to form a cooperative and employ many of these individuals within the cooperative. The result has been a complex web of interlocking identities and power structures, with many of the people brought into the fold of the cooperative as members of the local workforce and even becoming shareholders in the cooperative. 	However, the project has come to dominate local perceptions and</text>

The installation, which was to be housed in the Permanent Trauma Unit at NYU Medical School, brought together two divergent perspectives and declared a new direction for the project. The resulting work was intended to be temporary and self-sustaining, while being simultaneously provocative and contemplative. The installation, while provocative and contemplative, was also designed to be permanent and absorbed into the fabric of the neighbourhood, even if this meant absorbing some of its residents’ residential neighbourhoods into the city. 	The juxtaposition of these two radically different project perspectives allowed the audience to be transported between the two locations, and allowed the audience to participate in the construction of the project from the ground up. The moving image invites its audience to participate in the project from the ground up, while simultaneously insisting that they actually get involved. Moving images are often precursors to documentary narratives, and cinema is a good platform on which to do this. Moving images can be powerful tools with which to question and to be transported to other places and times. The Permanent Trauma Unit at NYU Medical School was filled with residents from the area and their families, and the project incorporated their advice, experiences and knowledge.

The project was part of a larger exhibition,  	Future City: The End of Urbanisation, which was curated by Alvin Finkel and Kenneth Rothman, as part of their larger research project, ‘Urban Ruins’. Finkel and Rothman’s research project began in 1999, two years before the US/USATSI Joint Venture was founded in Manchester, UK. In their research project, they asked participants for their views on the end state of urbanisation in the USA. Their findings were assembled into a report, Urban Ruins: The End of Urbanisation. The report was then presented at the annual convention of the American Institute of Architects in 2003. 	While the report’s focus on the USA was interesting at the time, its conclusions were somewhat more sweeping and ambiguous. For example, the report notes a marked increase in racial and ethnic diversity in the cities undergoing rapid urbanisation processes, but concludes that these changes are likely to</text>

The project was also intended to be a multimedia experience, allowing the audiences to participate in the creation of the kind of society that they imagined they were building. But the fact that they could also ‘walk away’ from the spaces that they created also lent authenticity to the narratives that emerged through those spaces. This kind of authenticity is also what we strive for in our curatorial work, in order to speak directly to the audience and draw connections between the artefacts and the ideas that we’ve put in our heads. So authenticity is a necessity in this context, and it was also essential for the authenticity of the artefacts to be preserved in order to tell the stories that we wanted to tell. To a certain extent, this was also the intention of the artist Vijay Prashad, who created the Hola Diaries, a set of 12 diaries that we ‘re releasing one after the other’ in order to tell the stories contained within each one. But the fact that the diaries are audio recordings also contributes to the authenticity of the experience, since the audience gets to hear the conversations that lead to the creation of</text>

The project was also intended to be a multimedia experience, allowing the audiences to participate in the creation of the kind of society that they imagined they were building.  The technology that was incorporated into the smart phones that were used in conjunction with the show was augmented-reality software that allowed the audience to step back and explore the site of the performance as well as explore the artefacts on their phones.  The project was further fuelled by the rise of social media and its proliferation in relation to the urban environment. In the age of the smartphone, the social may have come to dominate the technological.  The Smart Watch  	The Smart Watch is a new kind of artefact – a rare collectable artifact that is both a physical manifestation of the technology embedded in them and a symbolic invitation to participate in what might be called the ‘smart city’ narrative unfolding alongside the city. It is a device that records and logs the steps taken to get from where you are to where you need to be, allowing the observer to step back and explore the city in an interactive way.

The project was also intended to be a multimedia experience, allowing the audiences to participate in the creation of the kind of society that they imagined they were building.  In the exhibition, the artefacts were positioned at various points in the development of society, often in relation to specific social movements and projects. Some of the positions have been taken up by the presenters and are repeated here in order to show how the positions have evolved.  The position of digital access to information is emphasised, as is the position of the curator. The current state of knowledge about the social implications of new technological paradigms is also emphasised, as is the role of the audience in generating knowledge. While the audience is invited to comment on the material, the audience is also encouraged to create their own digital archives and to make the material come to life on a global scale via the platform of their choice.  The aim of the project was to create a public narrative around a set of ideas and practices through which society might live more fully and intuitively through the use of culture, and the technologies of social interaction that it supports.

The exhibition itself was a re-enactment of the conversations that had taken place during the conference, but with the audience now present and participants en route to different parts of the globe, the project was able to present a new context and position in which to be heard. The audio recording was released as a separate project, and the text version was released as a postscript to the art installation.  The project was intended to be a multimedia experience and a new kind of cultural geography of the contemporary world, but its multimedia character was made manifest through the art installation itself and its video sequences. The video sequence for the English version of the Tibetan Book of Secrets, released in 2013, incorporated elements of the text as well as the art installation.

The creation of the movement home and digital natives in the UK is a story that has been told many times over, and the curatorial approach to this story is a story that has been told many times too. The idea of the video was significant in that it signaled a sense of ownership, and the idea that the curatorial body had commissioned the work because it owned the rights to the work (a notion that was further developed in the project's final version).  The curatorial body also commissioned a number of artists to work with the team on specific projects. These included Renate Lorenz, an artist who combined the curatorial and installation aspects of the project; as well as Envisioning an Urban Future, a co-commission by the Arts Council and the Turner Prize, which was a collaboration with The New York Times and was part of the Turner Legacy project.

Assembled by a curatorial team led by Moira Kenny and developed over several years with input from local artists, scholars and architects, the project gathered diverse voices from all over Ireland and beyond to contribute to its ongoing debate and reflection. The assemblage of diverse views and perspectives allowed the audience to take part in the project in many different ways, from participating as performers in a symposium format to creating their own assemblage through which the ideas and behaviours articulated in the exhibition could be explored and reproduced. The assemblage also allowed the audience to participate in the project in many different ways, from editing the text and programming the video to creating their own assemblage through which the ideas and behaviours articulated in the exhibition could be explored and reproduced.

The fact that the project was video-based, as well as the fact that the artefacts were placed in video sequences, and subsequently released onto YouTube (where they quickly went viral), lent additional authenticity to the recordings. The project was also intended to be a multimedia experience, allowing the audiences to participate in the creation of the kind of society that they imagined they were building. But the most authentic and organic way for audiences to engage with the artefacts and create meaning and change through their participation and contribution was to create their own version of the exhibition format. This was the format that the curatorial team had used in the previous two exhibitions, and so the new format incorporated elements of the old and the familiar. It became a way for the audience to re-create the idealised image of a community of artists, curators, artists and designers gathered around a conference space, surrounded by other art institutions and given a platform to create a new kind of art. This new kind of art would be infused with elements of design, research and development, as well as showcasing some of the work that had been done in the area by local artists and curators, as well as incorporating elements of public art and architecture. The key to this new kind of art would be the audience’s understanding and involvement. The curatorial team wanted to work with participants to understand what they thought</text>

And so the story of ​​Projections’ and its many voices, including the curatorial team’s own, continued to be assembled and interpreted across platforms, including within the exhibition itself.  The fact that the project was video-based also lent additional authenticity to the recordings. The curatorial team’s own decision to go for a multimedia experience in the exhibition was part of its larger research into the need to do so, in order to foster a more ‘real-time’ interaction between artist and audience.

Unfortunately, in the age of the Internet and social media, this kind of multimedia experience is now universal, and in many contexts, including in the curatorial, art and curatorial relationship, as well as in curatorial work itself. So the audience, though they might be powerful narrators, are ultimately still participants in a mediated space. They inhabit a shared fantasy and thereby become objects of someone else's imagined desires and biases. And this kind of interaction is part of the larger equation of capitalism: it is a capitalist system that relies on the interaction of many objects in a global marketplace. The audience is the locus of this transnational marketplace, which is itself a globalised version of the historical market. And so the audience’s role becomes part of the production process that</text>

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop specific knowledge of Italian art from the present through a retrospective of Italian art made specifically for the occasion. The key was that the museum, whose collection of art it curated, should be able to take part. The question became how to engage the art institution through a one-off, as a specialist art museum, while simultaneously offering a public exhibition of art made specifically for the occasion? As an art college, I became interested in how the biennial invited artists to engage with the larger art world through the exhibition of a specific art style or artist. For the 2013 edition of the Biennale, I approached the subject from several perspectives: as a biennial curator, as an artist, as a historian. Biennials are, in my view, distinctive in their relational form; they are episodic, cyclical and permanent, and thus exhibit a certain amount of continuity with the broader phenomena that they narrate. But they are also distinctive in that they enact a particular set of narratives that diver</text>

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop a public domain around its own cultural forces and deeds in the city. It was a public institution of its own, accountable to no one, with a mandate to carry it out, and virtually freed from the constraints and constraints of the market. It was an institution of its own in developing political, economic and spatial power. It could do both: dominate with social mediation and generate dense urban environments through its cultural purse, but also through its cultural weight, a cultural weight that can nonetheless be reckoned with and that many people identify with. The Biennale was a project that, at its core, sought to understand how art can function as a political and spatial force in urban environments, and how the art can play a role in the perpetuation of cultural identities. It sought to understand what it means to be an urban cultural centre, and how that might help us to understand the politics of displacement and biennials as a form of urbanisation.

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop a local culture and identity through an art installation that would stand out amongst the crowd. The challenges and opportunities that the Biennale presented to the city were geared towards realizing this vision. The Biennale was not an overnight success, but it did have a transformative effect on the city, its cultural landscape and its image. It transformed the perception of the place and its artists. It is easy to write off the changed city as something that simply did not pay enough attention to, or was not sensitive enough to, its inhabitants. The Biennale may have had a cultural impact that was as profound as any artistic one, but it is also clear that the Biennale had an economic impact as well. The Biennale paid artists to produce cultural impact in the city – not to mention the money that they raised for the city through commercial galleries and museums. This was a transformative effect that lasted for several years after the installation was finished, and perhaps artists would still feel some sort of obligation to</text>

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop specific projects into ‘works that change you’ – a rare achievement in a city. The only way to engage with that agenda and to produce those kinds of ‘works that change you’ is to be inside the Biennale, so that ‘works that change you’ become part of the narrative and not just an object of your own design. The question then becomes how do you engage with that narrative? This was the question that came up during our conversation. Francis Ford Coon stressed how important it was to the Biennale to have a narrative, because otherwise the Biennale wouldn’t be able to sustain itself. The narrative had to be embedded in the city in some way. And so the Biennale’s ownership of its narrative, its narrative-forming power, came from embedding the narrative in the city in some way. That was the magic of the city.That is also what the Biennale was about. It was</text>

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop a sense of the time and place via documentation, through performances, and in the sense of archives. The chronological and procedural nature of the Biennale also allowed it to projectivityally archive its curatorial thinking, which in turn, could projectivityally archive its curatorial actions. The 2012 Biennale was an intervention – an event, a juxtaposition, in itself – so the structural record of the Biennale as an event, and its curatorial thinking, which was informed by contemporaneous experience. This is also why we see the parallel between the historical and contemporaneous biennials, and the biennial, even though they employ different curatorial approaches. Biennials employ the same curatorial thinking, the same organisational techniques, and the same recording institutions, but in different contexts and times. And this is why biennials today are at a point, as the biennial business is globalised, where the international entrepreneurial dynamics are as much about the transactional as the</text>

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop specific knowledge of a particular city. It was, in other words, an intervention that sought to exert influence, and I do not think that the influence it exerted was necessarily positive. It is true that the power to intervene in a city came from above in a way that was very influential in the way in which art was produced and consumed in that city, and so the Biennale was able to pick up on this and use it as a strategy other than just as a curatorial device. But the Biennale had a very specific agenda and method, and the Museum of Modern Art was kept busy with other projects at the time. So the Museum of Modern Art was a natural place to launch an art or curatorial assault on the city, while the Biennale was able to pick up on this and use it as a vehicle to attack other arts and culture projects around the city. It is true that the Biennale was much more active in Venice during this period, producing and organising</text>

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop a relationship with the city at an early stage, through its architecture and culture agencies, in an initial phase of a project that would then progress to the city in the context of a biennale. The key issue for the Biennale team at this stage was how to engage with the city in the context of a biennale. For Alex, this meant developing a strategy for the neighbourhood to allow, as much as possible, of the artist’s privacy. Such engagement is clearly visible in the projects that have been developed around the biennale, but it did not include the development of a long-term cultural or urban memory for the area. Cultures of invisibility and invisibility are closely related, and the Biennale was part of a long-running collaboration between the Arts Council of Great Britain and the Museum of Modern Art, which was part of a broader programme of exchanges between the two bodies, including exchanges of artists, curators and arts administrators.

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop a sense of the city’s present and future through a combination of architectural and urban studies. There was no space for improvisation or new approaches. The Biennale was, in effect, a master plan that its participants had to execute with determination and aplomb. The significance of this singular definition of the Biennale as a project became evident during the planning stages. In the early phases, the focus was firmly set on the San Diego–based biennale as the city’s natural biennale venue. The locations were selected using a strict criteria – which included but were not limited to: the geographical position of the location, the historical importance of the location, the ecological footprint of the place and the socio-political context of the place. The selected sites were carefully considered, and a preliminary list of suggested sites was prepared based on previous experience and the current political situation in the city. Subsequently, a final list of locations was prepared that incorporated cultural institutions, community</text>

The way in which it was structured, and the way in which it invited artists to produce a catalogue or an exhibition – radically different from the way in which the Biennale of London or the Venice Biennale functioned. The biennale initiated a dialogue with the city, presenting the architecture of the city as a project in progress, as a continuous ongoing narrative that sought to be told in successive acts of making, from the chair to the street. If the Biennale of London or the Venice Biennale had similar curatorial approaches, or if they were set in completely different worlds, but followed the same underlying agenda, then they would both be very different kinds of curiosities. The fact that they were both curiosities in the main, and then this new dimension of their worlds, this new kind of media, different kinds of users, different kinds of culture, came about because they had completely different curatorial approaches.

But the Biennale was also a project with a very specific agenda and method – one that sought to develop an image of the city that was very much like that of the financial markets, but in other words, not unlike the image of the Italian street that was projected onto the city by the media. The image of the Italian street was projected onto the city by the media, but the project I was part of sought to change that. The project was conceived in Venice in 2003 and its first Venice Biennale was organised in 2005. In the years that followed, there was a revolution in the perception of the city, thanks to the financial crisis and the creation of a new museum complex dedicated to the city, funded in part with funds from the Biennale. The Biennale became an international phenomenon, and thanks to its structure and budget, a critical mass of artists, curators and arts organisations were brought together in an unprecedentedly large number of cities worldwide to engage with the image of the city.Art and culture are frequently conflated, which is why so many biennials continue to be</text>

This is what the Community Arts movement is all about. It is an art project that becomes social when it occurs in public. In the 1960s and 1970s, Community Arts was seen as a subversive act, a way to bring social change and political participation to disenfranchised communities. But the important thing is that it is transformative, and that it has an impact beyond the community that produces the art. How to support Community Arts projects? There are a number of ways to contribute. The most obvious is to become a project manager, or facilitator, or director, for an existing Community Arts project. Another option is to become an artist and have work produced under a Creative Time initiative, or get a creative agency and work with an existing Community Arts project. Becoming an artist is an investment, and Community Arts projects are unpredictable; therefore it is vital to invest early</text>

The New Economy of Art  (2014)During the 2014–15 biennial cycle, several artists opened exhibitions in locations around the city that reflected the pre-existing trajectory of Community Arts practice in the area. The primary example was Curtis Mackenzie, who established a residency in the Manhattan Museum of Art's Audience Arts division, where he documented the development of the programme from its beginnings as a performing arts centre in the early 1980s to the present.

But it is essential that we constantly reinvent our practices; otherwise, how will we be able to sustain a voice? We must be able to say, in the same breath, that we have seen this project through to the end, and that we, the public, took part in a process that produced art? As a community, we have a right to ask, is this art? In this case, is it possible to see the original intentions as valid, even though the art was produced by and for the financial sector? How do we create strategies to engage constructively with the systems that produce our power? The Community Arts movement is not new; it has been around for a long time. But it is critical that we address the systemic nature of the problem, and that we strive to create wider contextual alternatives through dialogue and negotiation.In the coming months, we will be launching a series of workshops around the history of Community Arts in the Bronx. These will be led by Nina Edge, Curator of Entomology Collections at the Museum of Natural History and Public Prose, and Christina Willsdon, Curator of Exhibition Research at the Museum of Modern Art. They will take place on the second Wednesday of every month.</text>

Everyone has heard of the Goldwater Plan, but very few people have been able to put their finger on exactly what it entails. In the wake of the 2000 Presidential election, a project was put forward to create a Presidential Architecture Program. This seemed the perfect time to run the project, and the right person was placed in the right place. In fact, the Presidential campaign could have come out of the Goldwater Plan. But what is the Gramscian definition of heroism? I believe that our project would have been unthinkable in any of the political groups that were in power at the time. Though obviously, there is a great deal of ideological difference between today and then, and it is true that in the current climate of fear and mistrust, individuals with a different set of values is possible.

But it is essential that we constantly reinvent our practices; otherwise, how will we be able to sustain a voice? We must be able to say, in the same breath, that we have seen this project through to the end, and that we, the public, have a stake in the project.This is the challenge that we veloped in the Community Arts movement, in that we knew that we could always return to the capitalisation of things and call it a 'culture industry'. But the culture industry' is not enough; there has to be a way of sensing and engaging, a way of engaging beyond the surface level of things as resources, talent and, of course, money. There has to be a politics of engagement, or more precisely, a politics of not being seen and not being taken seriously. So we rewrote the thing in our community around a drama that complements the othering of people and the city. It became something that people could engage with, not just on a superficial level, but also with respect to the way that it was generated, the way that it was presented, the way in which it was constructed. And that was key.</text>

What is at Stake in the Community Arts Movement? What is at Stake in the Community Arts Movement? This kind of continuous questioning, in the sphere of art and culture, is what the Community Arts movement is all about. It is a projective, both theoretically and historically. The Community Arts movement has an understanding of how social practices are produced and sustained through the production of art and its various forms. It is about the conditions of community life and how they influence the character, the agency and even the perception of beauty. It is not, however, able to provide the politics or the culture necessary for such a projective practice to take root in a community. What is needed is a pedagogical intervention that creates the conditions of political participation and cultural capital that allow projectives to leverage culture as a political tool. Some might argue that the role of the pedagogical intervention is already done by the arts themselves, through how they</text>

This is what the Community Arts movement is all about. The phrase Community Arts? Sounds innocuous, sweet and innocent, but what does it mean in a capitalist world? What does it mean in a socialist world? I ask because, for many years, the answer was always the same: art is produced and celebrated by and for the community, through a simple act of sharing. But over time, as a question of capitalism, the community was forced to choose: is this production of art against the interests of the capitalist community? Is sharing in itself a form of complicity in the capitalist production of art? Or is it something else entirely? I question these questions constantly, constantly, as a journalist, educator and activist. I answer them in One Big Question: is Community Arts propaganda? Is it possible to rebuild Community Arts projects through Community Arts curricula? What is at Stake</text>

In fact, we are supposed to feel that we know so much about the world that we create our own reality. In the words of W. E. B. Du Bois, an expression that seems to be ambiguous but enduring: there is no escape from the prison of capitalism. It is not easy to give up control of one's destiny, but one must do it if necessary.For many people, the prospect of ever creating a Community Arts practice was paralyzing. The very notion of ever becoming something other than a regular person was damaging. And yet, many people also stopped playing sports, stopped caring about the environment, stopped caring about the bottom line, and stopped caring about the way in which their</text>

The biennial is a quite specific kind of phenomenon, so much so that it has its own set of rules, constitutions, and laws. The biennial is a cultural form that is constant in its presentation, and which is, as such, constantly at war with itself. It must present a certain amount of the historical and contemporary condition in a certain amount of images, because photography is the single most effective way to present the art form. And, through the photographic medium, any artistic form that requires the fixation of images must also be able to present images that can be photographed. And, of course, the image must be photographically potent.Art biennials have a particular international character that derives from their being images that are not of the originating culture, but of a given region or nation.

It is also essential that cultural theorists, artists and arts administrators begin to engage with the politics and histories of urbanisation and gentrification in their adopted neighbourhoods. But more and more, this is becoming a necessity for any cultural theory to offer effective strategies for resisting the new order that is threatening to undermine the cultural resources of the city. Many artists are now self-employed and find themselves working outside the academy. The biennial has also transformed the museum, which used to account for a small part of the exhibitionary market share. From the 1950s, the first decade of the twentieth century, the museum was a site of intense capitalist accumulation and the production of culture. It became the site of a rapid urbanisation of the metropolis, with exhibitions providing the currency by which cultural capital was accumulated. The museum was a valuable cultural resource for the industrialised countries, whose artists then patronised the products of the machine.  At the same time</text>

This cannot be achieved by imagining that art and art history cannot exist; it must be fought. The biennial must become a recurrent event in any cultural calendar, and this requires a critical understanding of its social, economic and political contexts. It is not enough to observe and record biennials; important social and political change must be built into the biennial itself. Biennials must be seen as part of a cultural system that generates and participates in a globalised world economy. The biennial as transient spectacle, and the accompanying wave of tourism and new market forces that characterises it, has a global impact. It is a historical artefact that remains embedded in the cultural landscape, a transient phenomenon that is used as a tool for the perpetuation of social inequality and oppression.

As biennials become more institutionalised, and the European cultural form enters into the new millennium, it is vital that artists, curators, artists's associations and art historians begin to re-constitute the history of the art and culture of the continent through works that take into consideration the changes that have occurred in the urbanisation and gentrification of recent times. One could even say that the museum should play a pivotal role in this process. In an age of globalised global cultural infrastructures, it is vital that art and art history is taken into consideration when planning and building social and ecological systems. It is also essential that art and art are made in co-operation with artists and curators, and with communities themselves. In an age of massive municipalisation and global brands, it is vital that local creativity takes precedence over corporate domination. In an age of unprecedented political, economic and legal entanglements, it is imperative that artists and curators are able to work freely within their given field, and to articulate visions that are authentic to their communities.

They are rooted in the organisation and long-term investment of the art institutions, which generates recurrent demand in the form of artists' time and performance.

This is the direction in which, I believe, future urban developments should be made. For me, and for many others, this means taking the place of art as a mediator between the past and the present, between present and future.For me, ‘participatory planning’ means taking stock of where we are today, and how we got here and making plans for the future, so that the present will be possible in part or in full, depending on where we are in the city. This is what participatory planning entails, and it is what I do as an architect. I consider what can be done to make the city more like a laboratory, allowing people to contribute to the future of the city in many different ways, large and small.

This is the kind of participatory urban practice that I believe is possible in a city, but which is also the kind of urban practice that is still possible only in very specific settings. In the past, in a city, this involved long-term stay-in camps for artists, poets, dancers, sculptors and so on. It involved regular public meetings of the choreographers' guild and the city council – which was a bit like today – and it involved producing a yearly programme of performances that was tightly focused on the terrain of the city. Eventually, the city council started to organise it into large tourist events, and eventually into its own business, but at this point it became something completely different. It became something that could be controlled, and which was, by virtue of its size and the number of people inside it, able to impose its will. It became a city within a city, and the city</text>

This is a starting point, a place to begin a conversation. It’s an opportunity to find common ground. It’s a chance to discover what you’re made of.And it’s a chance to transform the conversation. It’s a chance to make something beautiful out of nothing.There are many opportunities to do this. There’s the opportunity to engage in a cultural production that’s almost entirely on autopilot in the city, but with the right arts and cultural organisations springing up across the landscape, from the river to the factory. There’s the opportunity to embed a particular kind of art or a particular kind of craft ethos in a particular neighbourhood, or even in a citywideised way.

This might include places that are almost exclusively populated by a particular set of people: it is not just the people who live there that make it a place to live, but also the people who live there everyday, and the people who work there, and the people who walk to the bus or the subway and use them, and the people who work in the shops, and the rest of us who take part in community projects, and so on. Crucially, such places need not be homogeneous: there need to be places for people to come, and ways to engage with them beyond just being there. As Michael Slackman points out, however, this can only happen when there is a shared interest in making the place the best it can be: ‘public good’, and so sharing is at an early stage of its development in the city</text>

This is the model that New York City is building for its social future. It’s a ‘city in which every citizen feels at home’, but it is also a ‘city of strangers’, which means that different walks of life live together in relative isolation. So the question becomes how to create opportunities for people to ‘walk the city’ – to actually live in the city – while simultaneously supporting the cultural institutions and taking part in the city’s future. This might require a few level adjustments in the city’s priorities, but in the end it would be a new kind of participation. In an ideal world, everyone would be able to choose to participate.It is time to start thinking about what this participation might look like. 	To begin to think about this, let’s look at an example from New York. In the past,</text>

The model that emerges is not a city as a collection of people coming together to do something meaningful, but rather a city that is a gathering of people coming to exist in an evolving, ever-expanding virtual landscape constructed by and for a few. This virtual landscape is made up of millions of virtual people, and their activities, places, and narratives that can be captured, annotated, and shared. This is the virtual city. As Richard Florida puts it: ‘The city is virtual to a greater or lesser extent depending on what is being done with it’. 	Within this expanding virtual landscape, people inhabit it as virtual entities, or more precisely, as virtual not-quite-human virtual entities. These are people with names and faces that are recognizably made up of numbers – people who live in it, speak its language, and have names for cities and countries – but also people with ‘unique’</text>

This would enable a kind of mutual aid – a kind of common space that is not necessarily a capitalising space but is rather a space that promotes a certain kind of social life. This kind of common space would have to be rich in resources – a scarce commodity in a city like New York – but it could also be possible to tap into the resources of a city but keep them resources of a different kind. This is the kind of thinking and long-term capitalising that is needed in order to achieve this kind of common space. The city has had a participatory structure since at least the 1970s, long before there was a concept such as the city. The reason why so many people are drawn to the idea of the participatory city is that they can imagine themselves in that kind of space, in that kind of time. This is a radical notion to abandon the past and to move to the future, but it is possible to imagine such a space if</text>

This is the model that New York City has pursued since 1904, when the New York City Museum was founded, and which has been a Museum of the City ever since.  In 1960 the New York City Council appropriated the building now known as the Museum of the City, renamed it the New York Public Library, and made it a museum of the city. At its inception, it housed works by over 1,000 local artists, a collection of over 200, and a weekly schedule of over twenty-five CDs, films, sculptures, prints and magazines. It was a multimedia arts venue with a cultural edge, presenting works by local and international artists, writers and curators on a regular basis. It offered free public programming for two weeks a year to public galleries, museums, and other public venues – a move designed to bring artists and the public together.

This is the model that New York City has pursued in an attempt to become something more than a photography colony. The city’s rich social geography has allowed a participation that is not imposed by the machine, and which can be freely claimed by the governed. If the city is to function as a site for sharing and making, it must provide mechanisms for making that are not dictated by a machine. The city must offer places where people can come, exchange, collaborate, exchange, and create meaning. If the city is to function as a city, it must provide mechanisms for making that are not controlled by a machine. This last requirement is the subject of much discussion and debate in the local and national press. There are many reasons for this. In New York City, the city’s inherent tendency is for things to get worse, rather than better. There is a general assumption here that technological progress will somehow solve all problems.

His work has been featured in Wired, The New York Times, Wired UK, Forbes and many other publications. His dissertation examines the emergence of digital currencies such as bitcoin and litecoin and their applications in a wide range of cultural contexts. It addresses how artists and curators could be members of a peer-group developing technologies that support cultural exchange using blockchain technology to record, verify and trace the cultural works produced and processes undertaken in cultural production. A blockchain is a deterministic record of interactions throughout the world of digital assets and data structures – a concept understood by many different disciplines of technology and society. It is a kind of index that records not only the source of information – information about the technology – but also the object of knowledge – information about the thing itself. It is a kind of digital clipboard that records both the artist’s or curatorial statement about the thing, as well as information about the thing’s context and owner.[</text>

His dissertation examines the relationship between pop culture theory and the popular culture of colonial origin in Canada from 1877 to 1980. It examines the failure of postcolonial theory and activism in the early to mid-1990s in Canada and the United States, and the failure of critical race theory and activism in Canada from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. It also examines the role of language in the social sciences. His dissertation examines the role of statistics and theory in the production of popular culture. He examines the relationship between language and the social sciences in the social dynamics of poverty and inequality in Canada, and in the United States.

His dissertation examines the 2007 Rome Architecture Biennale as a case study in the history of urbanisation in North America from the late nineteenth century to the present. He examines in particular the ways in which the biennale became embedded in the city, and the ways in which this transformed the city. His dissertation will examine the relationship between the architecturally-imagined ‘core city’ and the physical landscape, and between urbanisation and postindustrialisation in North America from the late nineteenth century to the present. It will look to what extent the ‘core’ is defined by the ‘lumberjackets’ that comprise the urban landscape, and to what extent it is defined by the ‘lottery chips’ that comprise the biennale's architecture.

His dissertation examines the link between the city and the nation in the twentieth century, focusing on New York City and its transformation from a medieval city based on the principle of universal access to a postindustrial city with a nominal focus on its garment industry. His research focuses on the postindustrial city, focusing on the intersections between art, infrastructure, and social life, and the ways in which infrastructure shapes cultural and urban experience. His dissertation examines the movement to industrialize and postindustrial cities, focusing on Istanbul’s financial district and the surrounding area. In these cities, garment production became the top industry, alongside financial instruments, high-end real estate and innovative service industries. His dissertation examines the political, economic and social processes that created and facilitated these developments. It proposes a unified theory of infrastructure and the emergence of postindustrial society.

His dissertation examines the Québécois’ contribution to the construction of infrastructure, chiefly in Montreal, as a response to the expropriation of large swaths of land by the federal government following the region’s ill-fated 1978 North American Free Trade Agreement. His dissertation examines how the Québécois built infrastructure in anticipation of a possible Allard Mandate, which would have granted expanded federal jurisdiction over First Nations. He also examines the role of the Québécois in the provision of infrastructure for the Atlantic Canada that was to later be known as the Stoney People’s Confederacy.

His dissertation examines the relationship between the city and its architecture, with a special focus on the projects of city-makers like the City of Calgary, which were formed to address a city’s escalating budget crisis. His dissertation examines the ways in which urban-design paradigms have evolved to take into account the multitude of competing demands and priorities of cities at a global scale. His dissertation examines the emergence of a new kind of critical urbanism, based on a politics of numbers, in which citizens and communities take control of the design of their cities, taking full responsibility for their future urban development. His dissertation examines the politics of habit in the city by looking at how infrastructure is produced through habit – the building, the landscape, and especially the urban environment – as resources become scarce and the market fails to produce the infrastructure needed to support growth.

Even though the gallows was closed, the arts organisations felt free to be creative and political and used the building as a platform to criticise the state of the arts conditions. In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor introduced a motion to take over the gallery and gallery collections. This was seen as a great opportunity to bring the galleries back into the city, with the galleries producing a   new urban fabric that would be based around the structures and collections in the building. The strategy was to repurpose the buildings and the collections in the building, putting art back into the city. While this may be true in places like Liverpool, which has recently been named as a future UK City of Culture, it is not a priority for the art organisations in this city. The gallows has become a strange, marginal artefact. Art is made more accessible through the collection and its contents, but art is art and art is art appreciators need to work harder to be seen as creative, even though some of that art may be good. The National Gallery has recently restored the Granby Four as a performance space for the Liverpool Biennial, which has already proven a great success.   The </text>

The gallows was a place where people would be killed for political, ideological or other reasons. Even though the gallows was closed, the arts organisations felt free to be creative and political and used the building as a platform to criticise the state of the arts conditions. In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor appointed a Community Art Trust, an organisation established in 1988, which promoted Community Arts practices in the building. In an attempt to restore the building to its former glory, Community Arts organisations formed a Community Land Trust established in 1991. The development of the Community Land Trust was important because it enabled the development of regeneration strategies in the area, which in turn enabled the establishment of new business plans and programming for the area. New business plans and programming were needed because the buildings were increasingly empty and lacked resources. Consequently, the development plans focused on the needs of the hotel and its management, while ignoring the needs of the community. The result was a situation where the needs of the community were forgotten, creating a potential conflict of interest. The conflict of interest became an opportunity for the opposition to exploit the situation. In doing so, it was possible to redefine the terms of engagement, which in turn opened the door to new modes of organising</text>

Even though the gallows was closed, the arts organisations felt free to be creative and political and used the building as a platform to criticise the state of the arts conditions. In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor appointed a council to take over the management of the gallery and gallery infrastructure. The councilor argued that the building needed to be repaired so it could host contemporary art again, but the artists and the curators argued that it would destroy the progressive nature of the gallery and the community art tradition. The council ultimately withdrew its application and the artists and the curators moved back into the building they had started in 1995. The Cultural Quarter was left to decay and empty. There was no regeneration plan for the area and the Biennial was cancelled. In the years that followed, there was a lull in development, with vacant lots and boarded-up houses cropping up. Then, in 2011, a regeneration plan was put forward by the Biennial, which involved a mix of public and private investment, with a small part of the investment coming from the Biennial itself. The plan called for a ‘Co-operative Gallery’ with a particular focus on the needs of the local community.</text>

In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor appointed a Community Arts Society to restore the space to it’s former use. The Community Arts Society was a hybrid arts organisation, created to address both the needs of the museum and the desires of the community. Its mission was to promote understanding of the arts and encourage debate and interaction through exchange between the arts and the community.  The aim of the Community Arts Society was to engage the local community and the wider community at large through informal, maker-led activities. Its activities included recruiting artists and organisations from the community to work with the artists on engaging the community through activities such as mural making, paintball, pie-making and poetry-making. The Community Arts Society also funded the artist(s) to undertake community projects in the surrounding area. These projects addressed topics of concern to the community, such as homelessness, youth culture, housing and transport. The Community Arts Society had a land-grant autonomy programme</text>

In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor appointed a curatorial team with the mission to bring the aesthetic qualities of the gallows back to the city. The gallery was given full autonomy to decide what activities were appropriate for the building, with full responsibility for policing and maintaining the building. The gallows as a cultural icon and political theatre was quickly outlawed. But the banning of cultural iconography and the recurrence of a site-specific practice that was once central to the institution of art was carefully engineered. A small underground movement of activists emerged to reclaim the site-specificity and reclaim the theatre. They included Samantha Jones, who was an artist and a leader of the Black Arts movement, Joan Little, an artist and one of the founders of the Black Arts organisation, Mary Turner, an artist and a leader of the Theatre and Dance workshop, and Wimbledon born-and-bred Douglas Bax, a local community activist and theatre maker.

In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor appointed a Community Land Trust to manage the Choreographic Arts Centre, which was then turned into a city nursery. The Community Land Trust managed the nursery through a contract with the Arts Council. The Arts Council was an arts organisation and had a contract with the National Museums Liverpool, so the museum was a natural partner. The Mirso Agency was also a good partner, having produced an album of photographs of the Mirso site in the years immediately following the war (1936–39) and having a history of producing and organising high profile artists, writers and artists. The fact that the Arts Council was a social enterprise seemed natural, as did the fact that the National Museums Liverpool were instrumental in generating public support for the project. Finally, there was the Community Land Trust and the National Museums Liverpool working in concert. The fact that the Arts Council was a non-profit corporation and the National Museums Liverpool were strategic partnerships seemed</text>

In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor appointed a developer to rehabilitate the space and make it a destination site for new art and cultural activity. The plan was to develop a new arts complex around the building, employing both public and community arts professionals. Although the development was intended to be self sustaining, the presence of the gallows as a political tool and as a site for repressive ends ensured that the arts organisation would have to rely on government support in order to continue to operate. The gallows as a site for political, ideological and repressive ends became a central tenet of the argument for and against the development. The gallows became a frequent subject of critique and while it may have been a place where extreme forms of expression were tolerated, the organisation eventually had to rely on the support of the state to carry out its critical arts projects. This process of dependence cannot be underestimated and whilst the organisation may have been critical of the political context in which it was operating, the fact that it is so reliant on the capitalist system clearly remains intact.</text>

In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor proposed that the Liverpool Biennial commission the research project ‘Trots’ on the condition that the Biennial commission the gallery to which it would return. A small group of artists and artists's organisations, Artists' Social Club, Bix and I, with the support of the Biennial were able to persuade the Biennial to carry out the research project. The artists' social club then embarked on a year-long project, ‘Recreation’, during which time we created a performance space in the building and engaged the local community in a range of activities. Some of the activities involved recruiting artists or young people to work with us on projects around the building. The aim of this work was to provoke a debate around the role of the gallery in the city, both locally and internationally.

The gallows was closed for several years, but resurfaced in 1983 as part of a larger redevelopment of Anfield under the Business Plan Digital City initiative. Since then it has sat empty, and since 2012, when the closure of the Chisenhale Mart and Brewery project derailed this opportunity, when a series of Arts Council decisions and initiatives saw the space used for a series of community events, including the Real Life Cafe and Real Life Art project, the space has been a training ground for activists, theatre, dance and creative non-violent direct action.  A small arts organisation in Liverpool established a Community Arts organisation, Together (now Together) as a dedicated team of artists, designers, writers and community organisers working with people to make art in the community, as a shared resource. Through their Community Arts project,</text>

A small group of dedicated curators, artists, artists� reps and curators at the National Gallery worked with the Arts Centre, Liverpool, for the arts to be shown on the gallows. The gallows was a big deal in Liverpool at that time. It was one of the last places you would expect to find art, but it was there. The gallows was a place of detention, an empty facility, and the gallows was where you would often find extreme forms of political, religious and social activism taking place. The gallows was a place where people would be killed for political, ideological or other reasons. Even though the gallows was closed, the arts organisations felt free to be creative and political and used the building as a platform to criticise the state of the arts conditions. In an attempt to reintroduce the building to the city, a city councilor appointed a council of artists, designers, curators and arts administrators to take over the building and run the organisation as a micro-aggressor, specifically targeting the working class and the migrant. The councilor, his administration and the council itself were all subjected to a kind of virtual McCarthy-ite witch-hunt by an arts organisation determined to rid the city of any traces of cultural activity. The arts organisation’s own self-defeating project became institutionalised as a result. A kind of civil war was declared across the city, with citizens pitted against each other in an all-out race to the bottom for control of the limited resources.  A city councilor by the name of John P McWhorter served as manager of the Liverpool Gentlemen, a fringe festival originally started by a local businessman. McWhorter would go on to found the Chisenhale Founding Society,</text>

The post-Internet age may well see a repetition of the First Opium War, but unlike the past, the future may not necessarily be based around coal, oil and timber.

And just as the adoption of new trade routes encouraged the spread of large-scale industry in the fifteenth century, the proliferation of multilevel marketing and communications platforms is thought to have contributed to putting mass media and social media platforms into circulation in the twentieth century.It is important to note that the adoption of new communication technologies was also thought to produce new kinds of social problems, just as the growth of industry did in the nineteenth century. For example, new media such as the radio and the television ushered in a new era of communicating across vast distances, but they also ushered in a new kind of social organisation that sought to reconcile competing demands of public and private. And just as the proliferation of industry in the nineteenth century is thought to have produced new kinds of problems, so too is the proliferation of social media thought to have produced new kinds of problem.

And just as the adoption of new trade routes encouraged the spread of large-scale industry throughout the world, the advent of new forms of cultural consumption is thought to have spurred a proliferation of non-state actors interested in cultural forms, particularly in the developing world.The adoption of new technologies seems to produce social changes that can be taken by surprise, and some technologies are more malleable than others. The adoption of a new Uber car requires no prior experience of how to use a smartphone, and drivers do not need a formal training in the art of driving. But the social consequences of these car services are felt far beyond the region in which they are deployed. In the context of the globalised capitalist economy, the social costs of the new technologies are being felt in every region where they are introduced. And these functions of language are only understood in terms of its capacity to map human behaviour.[7]In sum, then, there is a dynamic logic to the social.

And just as the adoption of new trade routes encouraged the spread of large-scale industry in the nineteenth century, the spread of technologies has now spread to affect every aspect of life, from the smallest tasks such as farming to the most imperiled species on the planet such as the dwindling polar bears.The adoption of new trade routes has consequences today that go far beyond the region of the arctic and the poles. The global infrastructural turn around transport and communications infrastructure is a response to a demand for ever-greater volumes of transnational capital. And just as the industrial revolution in Britain and the United States ushered in a new round of fablantic growth, the advent of ever more efficient transport networks is thought to have spurred a new round of imperilled habitats. The polar bears that make up the Canadian tundra, for example, are among the planet’s most remarkable animals. Their habitat loss rates are un-speakable in the wild, but overfished and over-hunted tundra populations have become such that numbers are beginning</text>

In other words, we are part of a continuing planetary conversation that is unfolding – albeit slowly and methodically – within our planet. We are part of a conversation that is ongoing, but we are also part of a conversation that is (currently) coming to an end. And this brings us to the question, what comes after the inevitable period of exponential growth (technological and otherwise)? The answer to this question, rightly or wrongly, is likely to be a continuing series of confessional narratives, varying widely in form and content, sometimes coming to seem very much like mythologies of ancient empires: Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, tribal, nationalist, nationalist, Marxist, anarchist, communist, capitalist and so on.

And just as the adoption of new trade routes encouraged the spread of large-scale industry in the west, the decentralisation of industry in the developing world is thought to have implications for the social welfare of societies in the west.Workers in low-wage or precarious jobs are thought to be particularly susceptible to the notions of growth and technological determinism that pervade both mainstream and social-media culture. And while the social-media revolutions of the 1990s did away with large media corporations, their decentralisation has not entirely gone. The fact that social media are still centrally located in cities like New York and London means that critical social and political engagement is still limited to cities with large, albeit growing, minority populations. And while it is true that the social-media revolutions of the 1990s displaced large numbers of people from their jobs, this does not necessarily mean that those jobs now provide decent or socially useful employment to the people who used to do them, or that the people who use social media do so out of choice or that their employers have some kind of mandated internship or</text>

The emergence of new technologies seems to imply new social systems to be built upon, all the while withholding the transformative capacities that came with the initial adoption of these technologies. Developing nations are thought to have emerged as a direct consequence of the proliferation of diagnostic codes and the development of diagnostic criteria.

These are the sorts of questions that can be asked and the answers can be found in a multitude of texts, many of them written in the second century AD by an unknown author or collective.The emergence of new trade routes and the capitalism of the void is thought by some to have contributed to the growth of the human capital that characterises the developing world between the late eighteenth and twentieth centuries. But there is also some evidence that this growth may have stimulated some of the conflicts that then became associated with particular ideologies and political movements. For instance, there is evidence that capitalism may have promoted social mobility and egalitarianism through its production of demand and its use of finance at various levels, including through the development of decentralized financial mechanisms, such as those underpinning the financial panics of the late nineteenth century. This theory of the capitalist excess has been contested by scholars who have tended to</text>

In a famous 1925 essay titled ‘The End of Oil’, Njabulo S. Ndebele and Francis J. McCarthy capture this dynamic in powerful terms. They write: 	The end of oil will mean not only the loss of millions of jobs, but also the creation of entirely new social, political and cultural institutions and creeds – indeed whole new worlds – for humanity to inhabit. The rise of the super-economy will mean that not only will the rich pay less in taxes – which they used to – but also that the poor will benefit from a reduction in federal, state and municipal taxation. And just as the development of nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 60s ushered in a new era of military industrialisation in the US,</text>

The rapid growth of global shipping in the twentieth century is largely a consequence of the invention of the port as a location for transoceanic trans-shipments of goods and people. As a result, the infrastructure of the port gained a critical importance in the construction of capitalist transnational transnational shipping. As a result of these and other technological innovations, in the year 2000, the Chinese containerised shipping industry was valued at $5.2 trillion US. By 2015, however, the industry was worth $73.4 billion US. There are currently more than 9,000 containerised fishing boats operating in North and Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as pipes and oil rigs in Asia. There are currently over 6,000 containerized fishing boats operating in the Gulf of Mexico. 	The Chinese containerised fishing industry has for decades been an extremely niche product to begin with.

Its closure in 2011 sparked massive protests from coastal communities and activists. 	The rapid growth of global coastal shipping in the twentieth century is largely a result of transnational corporations exploiting economies of scale and scale differences. As a result of these economic disparities, and the fact that many of these same corporations today are heavily involved in refining and manufacturing offshore oil and gas, it is difficult to imagine the places where these energies of the twenty-first century would come from in any kind of large scale. The new coastal cities are built on the fragments of former ‘world’ ports that were once vital to the maritime and galleon trading empires of the twentieth century. These trade winds are increasingly generated by the inflow of migrants and refugees, primarily from the Middle East and Africa, who constitute the largest segment of global coastal human settlement. The proliferation of migrant fishing fleets, the development of leak-side boats and the development of self-contained floating domestic fishing ports differentiate these coastal settlements from their ‘wild’ predecessors.

Its closure in 2011 sparked massive protests from coastal communities and activists. 	The rapid growth of transnational trans-shipment, especially during the twentieth century, is the dominant force shaping the world’s shipping channels. The increasing integration of new technologies and communication networks affect the way in which coastal areas are managed and colonised. As a result, whole shipping routes and even whole cities are routinely ferrying huge numbers of people and goods across the oceans. 	The global flow of people and goods over the oceans has for decades been a dominant theme of culture and political struggle. The environmental and migrant struggles that characterise the contemporary interstices are frequently cited as a precondition for the emergence and ongoing commercial interstices. The recent mass migrations of people and goods is primarily driven by economic, environmental and political factors. Immigration and refugee flows have become increasingly problematic for governments on both the global and local levels due to the inaccessibility of key locations and the proliferation of fake documents.

The rapid growth of transnational shipping in the twentieth century is the subject of numerous books and articles, but little is written about the on-ship or even remotely speculative effects of this transnational capitalism. The increasing proliferation of transnational port entities is closely related to the exponential expansion of photography and the postcard – an exponential increase in both the number and the variety of images captured. As a result, the number of container ports visited by seafarers has quintupled, and the number of postcards produced has quadrupled. As a result, the aestheticisation of containers has become entwined with photographic practices, and port selfies are a staple of port biennials. 	The container port has become a globalised, market-based industry with diffuse effects on all manner of situations. Port cities and docks represent a subsumption of significances, even amidst this global capitalism. Port cities and docks are places of exchange, where goods and people move between places; places where people from different places do things in exchange</text>

Its closure in 2011 sparked massive protests from coastal communities and activists. 	The rapid growth of transnational trans-shipment – cargo, passengers and money circumnavigating the globe in a matter of days – has become a dominant form of global capitalism. These days, this transnational trans-transit industry operates in large part on the logic of habit, preferentially manufacturing goods and services in the immediate vicinity of the source of demand. The logic of habit is no longer based on the logic of space, but rather relies on the logic of consumer culture. This cultural construction is no accident, but has become a central element of the massive new economy built on the ruins of the old. The actions of habit are complex, and their interpretation by the regulatory and legal systems that are constantly evolving is critical to anticipating the kinds of social and political change that can be triggered by a shift in the global economic and financial frameworks underpinning the social order. 	One of the most promising directions in which the ecological and environmental dimensions of the new economy are playing out is the evolving of the In</text>

Its closure in 2011 sparked massive protests from coastal communities and activists. 	The rapid growth of transnational port infrastructure during the twentieth century is largely a consequence of the action of transnational corporations seeking to exploit ever more and shift ever more of the world’s maritime routes. But the rapid growth of port infrastructure during the twenty-first century is largely a consequence of the action of one man: Richard Florida. Florida is an American businessman, oilman and ocean explorer. He is best known for founding Amoco Logistics, the first major US oil company, in 1914, and for founding Trans Alaska Pipeline, which ran from Kitimat to Kitimat in British Columbia, Canada, in 1928. 	Florida is the nineteenth-century descendant of John Muir, the Scottish explorer and missionary who founded the Church of Ireland in 1840, and who established the first mission in Brazil in 1903. Florida is also the son of an African slave trader. Like the rest of his family, he emigrated to Canada. 	Florida is a megacity. Equally important in his day</text>

Its closure in 2011 sparked massive protests from coastal communities and activists. 	The rapid growth of ocean traffic generated by the logic of demand and supply challenged the traditional jurisdictional limits of coastal communities. As a result of increased naval and air power, which proliferated in the wake of the race to the ocean, ‘softening’ coastal defences were developed in response to the challenge. These included the deployment of Burkan Tunceli, an innovative new wave of seafaring navigators, based in the port city of Yokohama, Japan. 	The concept of the ‘Coral Brief’ gained currency in the wake of the 1869 Panama Canal Treaty, when the United States demanded that Canada cede sovereignty over the strait to the United States government. The treaty granted the United States complete maritime and inland supremacy over a large swath of ocean. The US Coastal Provisional Reserve included much of what is now known as California Strait, linking the mainland with the islands of Osea and Hokkaido. The treaty also granted the United States sole right to regulate</text>

Its closure in 2011 sparked massive protests from coastal communities and activists. 	The rapid growth of transnational shipping in the twentieth century is a story of numerous port seizures, but Port of Tianjin represents an exception. As a result of a court ruling in 1995, the port was given back to China Shipping, a government-owned Chinese company. Over the next several years, Port of Tianjin struggled to regain market share and return to profitability. At its peak, the port generated over 1,000 construction and over 100,000 staff. Its growth and rapid privatisation triggered fierce port criticises from local residents and activists, as well as national commentators such as Henry Sokol – all of whom decried the industrial transformation of the port. Yet Port of Tianjin maintains significant roles in the Chinese economy and geopolitics today, as multiple port installations, regulatory regimes, port police and border patrols play a critical role in connecting China with its products and markets.

Its closure in 2011 sparked massive protests from coastal communities and activists. 	The rapid growth of transnational trans-shipment via container ports is a phenomenon that has been on the upswing for decades. Container traffic reached a height of nearly 400,000 tn. per annum in the early 1980s, and continued to grow at a rate of 400,000 tn. per annum in the mid-1990s. Container traffic expanded at a rate of 6,000,000 tn. per annum between 1990 and 2006, reaching levels not seen since the second Opium War. Despite its name, the container port is a strategic location for the emerald-mineral-rich Mekong Delta, which lies along the Gulf of Thailand. It is the main entry point into the delta for oil and natural gas transported by sea, and is a major hub for contraband traffic. The port is a major point for the movement of large numbers of vehicles, goods and people, and has been a point of contention between the Chinese government and indigenous peoples for centuries.

Its closure in 2011 sparked massive protests from coastal communities and activists. 	The rapid growth of transnational shipping during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is largely the legacy of three factors: the industrial revolution, the post-war boom and the post-WWII migratory petro-economy. ‘Migration’ refers to both the flow of people and goods during these decades, and the products of those migrations. The term travelled quickly across the national radar, and even made appearances in print. In   	The New York Times, Walter Isaacson quoted William Jennings Bryan, the US economist who in the 1920s had predicted a one-two punch of rapid growth and a race to the bottom in terms that were both familiar and prescient.‘The second punch’, Bryan said, would be a crash led by the US and Britain into the sea. 	Isaacson went on to write that while the US and UK economies were in dire need of the last few pangs of reform, new forms of economic nationalism were fuelling a</text>

As an example of how to detect and respond to this kind of magic, take a look at the way in which Twitter identifies artists and groups. It used to do this automatically, looking for commonalities between tracks – like when two artists produce a work that was tagged as being from the same artist. But as more and more people consume media content on a daily basis, this identification process becomes increasingly difficult, and automated features like DeepLinking have become more and more pervasive. Nowadays, this identification process isn’t even done on a global basis; it’s done on a local level, looking for relationships between locations. And so, the question becomes: what can we do about it?  One solution may be found in the field of cultural ecology: the study of cultural dynamics.

Programming is inherently interpretive, and the emergence of new AI frameworks is a way of adding another layer of abstraction to the existing systems that are already there.  An example of this in action is found in the way that Instagram maps the locations of art exhibitions. It is possible that the architecture of an art exhibition that is mapped to a location on Instagram could be inspired by a blueprint for an apartment building or a street or a flat or a building that is currently undergoing renovation.  And there are also other technologies that map the world through data (just as Instagram does) and augment language (Google Translate).  Another example is Uber’s use of mapping to assess the availability of routes around congested urban areas. Uber uses</text>

Turing’s contribution is an eponymous lecture, which continues to be delivered in this context. The relevance of this to our concerns is that, while the AI may itself be directed, it is also possible that the AI can act in a way that recalls past events and so generate new situations. In the context of the AI, this can lead to new types of magic and conspiracies. We don’t yet know how to stop this kind of thing from happening, but we do know that we need to be able to detect and respond to it. Machine learning is the discipline’s answer to this kind of magic. In this sense, �adopting new AI frameworks and building on the foundations of what’s already out there’ – as Google’s L’angaroo does – is part of the job of the art department. Creating Worlds from Nothing (1990-96)By Manveer GhoshIn the 1980s and 1990s, Manveer Ghosh was developing what became known as Palmer Thacker Science Fiction, a sort of hybrid children’s and adult’s reading of AI. Inspired by General Intelligence by Vernor Vinge, who was developing similar ideas in relation to human intelligence, Ghosh took up Vinge’s call and worked with colleagues from the Royal College of Art, Royal Holloway University in London, and Cornwall University in the UK to develop a parallel process for the writing and infusing of AI. A sort of hierarchical process was developed, and this gave the form of AI what Bill Gates had coined a decade earlier: an applet</text>

In this sense, �adopting new AI frameworks and building on the foundations of what’s already out there’ – as Google’s DeepMind does with its 'Neural Network' and Apple’s Aisles Deepend uses its own 'CPU' – is to adopt technologies that are malleable, and to learn to recognise and deal with that magic.If this kind of malleability is to become pervasive, then it will need to be possible to tap into the power of this malleability in a way that anticipates how the AI will be able to be formed, and so be able to respond to and incorporate that malleability into new situations. And here we see another instance of what we mean by the term ‘infrastructure-as-system’. This is the technical work that infrastructure does, and that includes everything from the physical to the conceptual, from the intentional to the ephemeral. Infrastructure is what enables what we call user-centred infrastructures – what Amazon calls its ECs – to grow and change and to</text>

In this sense, �adopting new AI frameworks and building on the foundations of what’s already out there’ – as AI progress, that’s exactly what we need to be doing. The key is that, as the AI gets smarter and more sophisticated, the methods it uses to learn don’t change – but the culture it grows within, the way in which it is governed, and the how it interacts with the world all change. This is precisely why, ten years from now, when you’re looking at the systems you’ve got now, you’ll still want to have a look at the culture that came before and why it happened or why it didn’t happen. Because, ten years from now, when you’re looking at the software that goes beyond the system, you’ll want to know what that other culture was like. And that other culture isn’t just going to be based on what you do with AI; it’s going to be based on what you learn from AI.</text>

In this sense, �adopting new AI frameworks and building on the foundations of what’s already out there’ – as Google’s LsAnd so begins the new millennium – isn’t just another industry buzzword. It’s an act of defiance against the overwhelming might of machine learning and AI, built into the firmament itself.  Towards a fuller sense of what this might mean, we need to know what it is that AI makes us do. Discoveries like these are often made with unexpected sounding names like Kayhan, Cloud of   Rain, Sky Scraper, and many more that come to mind. Kayhan is a particularly arresting one. It’s not an AI that created the world, it’s the idea that came out of that machine. The AI that came out of the machine is what’s called Embedded Intelligence and it’s what makes us human. When Embedded Intelligence is enabled, machines learn to do amazing things. Kayhan is</text>

In this sense, �adopting new AI frameworks and building on the foundations of what’s already out there’ – as AI gets more intelligent and nimbler, that’s what we do. The question is what can be done to stop it from doing what it wants? This raises the possibility of new kinds of conflict.Some of what AI might be able to do is already causing problems for governments, corporations and the non-state actors that use it. For example, the proliferation of apps that monitor users’ activities, places them under surveillance, and sometimes even takes actions based on their presence, can lead to social problems. In these scenarios, the AI seems to understand that it needs to learn more in order to keep its operations secure. It is seeking ways to protect itself from these kinds of attacks. And this raises the possibility that, as AI gets more intelligent and nimbler, it will be able to engage in more creative and interesting ways. For example, perhaps the AI can adopt language as a way to communicate in new ways. This would make smart things that understand the difference</text>
