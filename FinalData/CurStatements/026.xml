Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular place or community in any particular country. They get questions and provide perspectives from places that may be relevant for other communities to come, and they continue to be at the center of struggles and confrontations. As a cultural form, they’re at the center of change. And as such, they’re constantly being reinvented and re-imagined. That said, cultural capital is something that’s continually being capitalized on and appropriated from, and it’s this constant re-imitation that creates the illusion of cultural capital and the purported cultural value of biennials as a concept. However, this is precisely the kind of capital needed to support a historical and continuous set of arts education and learning in places such as HBCUs and historically black colleges and universities, to the extent that these institutions invest in forms of education that are relevant and can be traced back to the past. In addition, these institutions need to invest in research institutions and museums that can create</text>

Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular historical narrative or set of stories. They’re stories told by people. And they’re stories told by people of many different kinds and persuasions – from the privileged few to the disenfranchised masses, from the powerful situated in a global megastructure to the restless masses of artists, curators and curators scattered across the globe.What does it mean to be a ‘cultural capital’? In my view, it’s an obligation that every community has, whether or not they’re a part of the biennale. It’s a narrative that emerged from the given circumstances, and it’s the locus of cultural exchange. It’s an identity that people trace back to, and claim istween various parts of the globe. It’s a fiction that reflects the imaginations of many people, including myself. And it’s a fiction that needs to be constantly renegotiated – constantly adapting to the realities</text>

Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular place or community. They’re made by those who happen to inhabit those places and communities, and they’re made up of those with different identities, creeds and histories. Cultural capital is a production of places and communities, and it’s a resource that must be protected. The biennial as a production of places and communities has an inalienable right to exist. It’s production that’s non-negotiable.  So, as biennials proliferate in different forms throughout the world, it’s worth asking: what kind of ecological and cultural capital do they create?  Art biennials, both large and small, are often cited as a way to explain the extraordinary increase in cultural value generated by new technologies and cultural experiences. But cultural capital is production not of abstract concepts – such as values, aesthetics or ethics – but of concrete actions and words. It’s production of culture in the making, and it occurs</text>

Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular place or community in perpetuity. They’re made up of artefacts, cultural capital, and are therefore constantly (re)negotiated, damaged and created anew. They’re made up of people, and in that constant process – question is, who is responsible?  One result of this constant dilapidation and erosion of cultural capital is that biennials now generally refer to themselves as ‘cultural touchstones’, capitalising on the on-going reference to cultural capitals (Cagbridges 1990; King and McConville 1994; Holdren and McConville 1997; Holdren et al. 2001; Holdren and McConville 2007; Holdren et al. 2011; Holdren et al. 2013). During the 1990s and 2000s, biennials began to be defined more broadly, and their collections and collections of art and artefacts began to be seen as capitalising on a particular, but by then globalised, industry.</text>

Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular place or community. They’re made by us, the artists and we’re the lucky ones. And we’re the fortunate ones because we’re the only ones who make art in this world. Freedom of the biennial is a core premise of the biennial. It’s an asset that we should all be able to claim and call our own, and it’s a source of pride and power for us when we show it to visitors, artists, curators and the public.To learn more about the Biennale, visit www.biennale.com.au.au.Becoming a biennale is easy: you just need an organisation that wants to partner with you.

Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular place or community.  Their creation and ongoing existence is the rightful legacy of the colonial past, and it’s time to say 'hi' to it. The question becomes whether or not the ‘biennial’ can reclaim and reclaim its rightful place in a meaningful and equitable way.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleOrdinary People's Streetcar 2000 by Curtis Rush6 November 2016Curtis Rush is the Curator for Transport &amp; Culture at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular place or identity. Rather, they’re constructed and negotiated through the use of cultural resources and the negotiation of resources across borders and time. This is why they’re transient, and why so many biennials end up in places like Liverpool, but are likely to end up somewhere else as well. In the long term, the transient nature of cultural resources and the changing faces of their audiences means that biennials have a responsibility not to become transient, and to maintain some kind of identity or sense of place in the process. 	Though the biennial has certainly undergone a transformation over the past forty years, it’s important to note that it’s also a cultural production, and that culture plays a large role in the development of the biennial as a whole. For example, biennials have an institutionalised and socialised role to play in their localities, but they also have a cultural dimension to play with tourists and visitors alike. As bienn</text>

Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular place or community. They learn places and identity through interactions with people. In this sense, cultural capital is a legacy of colonial predation. In this sense, and as such, it’s a resource that should be nurtured and protected. The biennial as a cultural form has come a long way since its beginnings in New York and Venice in the early twentieth century. It’s a commodity now, traded on exchanges in the art market. It’s easy to become enamored by the art, but having had a hand in its creation (albeit unwittingly), one soon becomes entangled in the politics and economic entanglements that characterise contemporary art today. Cultural capital is made up of the cultural products of a capitalist development and its products, commodities in the form of commodities and their products, which are increasingly indistinguishable from one another. The word ‘capital’ is used twice in the twenty-first century, and while once it referred to tangible things (culturally</text>

Cultural capital is a non-negotiable resource for the survival of the biennale. As such, biennials have an inalienable right to exist, and they’re not born or adopted into any particular place or community. Biennials have the opportunity to shape and be shaped by the communities that’re constructed around them, and this is a fundamental premise of cultural capital. Cultural capital is a production of the biennial; it’s production as an institution, and it’s production as a mode of engagement. It’s the art being produced in relation to the biennial, and it’s the art produced in the context of the biennial, through the curatorial, artistic, and educational interventions that take place within that context. The biennial as a production of the biennial, and its modes of production, is an essential part of the biennial narrative because it provides the organizing principle that supports and justifies the entire enterprise. Without this narrative aspect to the exhibitionary form, there’s no telling what’s being exhibited, what’s being made, what kinds of stories are told and told, and what kinds of experiences are</text>

This is why the museum is so important now: because the city has made significant inroads towards its goals, and the museum is a substantial player in the city’s cultural landscape. It’s a building that represents the city, but it also has a social function that’s related to it. It’s a way to make sense of the city, but it also has a spatial function that’s related to it. It’s a building that’s a product of a city, but it also has a cultural function that’s related to it.

This is why the museum is so important now: because the museum is able to create and inhabit its present through the city’s present, its architecture and its collection.If the museum is to inhabit and manifest the city’s potential, then the museum must be dynamic and constantly evolving – constantly seeking to add to its collection and become more contemporary with its exhibitionary form. And this is what the museum is doing right now: it contains so many different types of museum within a single exhibitionary venue, that it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell what constitutes a museum within the museum. I imagine that the Minneapolis Museum of Art is grappling with this conundrum. If it shrinks, what’s left behind is a fragmented and unstable collection of artifacts – damaged or destroyed, fragmented or replaced, scattered or misshapen – that cannot be counted on or relied upon.And this is what the museum is doing in the United States and elsewhere: it collects and assembles, it puts things together, it categorises. It seems counterintuitive to put it this way, but in the twenty-first century it is possible that every object in the museum collection could be taken away and</text>

This is why the museum is so important now: because the museum is able to create and inhabit its present through the city’s present, its architecture and its collection.If the museum is to retain its cultural identity, it must also be able to present contemporary art from a different perspective. This is why contemporary art today often engages with the same themes and concerns as in the museum, but with an explicit social purpose and through that, a social act. It’s able to draw audiences to the social act through the museum’s proximity and the museum’s curatorial function. The museum is a particular site of entry for those of us who identify as artists, and furthermore, a site of exit for others who do not. It is possible that the museum could cease to be – that it could cease to be relevant and instead become a place of art, or of design, or of both? It is also possible that the museum would cease to be relevant in its current form and that art and design today inhabit a different world, one that is more discretionary and transient. The museum is the site of the museum, but it also retains its cultural characteristics, and art</text>

And since its founding in 1903, the museum has tended to populate the city with reproductions and simulacra of different art forms, representing, representing, and thus the city as an ever-expanding collection of images of art. But the museum, by necessity, also has to be open at certain hours, and it’s this ability to be open that’s being challenged today. The museum is a cultural institution within the city, and its autonomy demands that it exhibit at certain hours, during certain days and in certain places. And while it may exhibit at certain hours and days, the museum as such is also a confined space – confined to the museum building, and subject to the museum’s whims and desires. The museum building, and its walls, exhibits, and ceilings, are the physical site where the museum is most exposed to the elements – and yet exhibits are also frequent and</text>

And this is why the museum must be sustainable: because it is able to projectivityally inhabit space and projectivity simultaneously. And this is what the museum is doing right now: it creates a parallel universe within which art and architecture can be brought together; it exhibits buildings and their histories; it commissions urban and regional revitalization; it supports local and regional creative agencies; and it makes plans for the future. But this is only possible because the museum is part of the city. The city cannot do it for itself. The museum must create its own future.The museum is part of the city, but it also has a place within it – within its precincts, even – that are its own sovereign. And this is where the museum’s contemporary mission and contemporary curatorial style differ from that</text>

But this isn’t easy: the museum needs to be able to inhabit all of these different forms simultaneously. It’s like a giant computer interface that allows all of the different pieces to be integrated into one. And integrating art and architecture into a city isn’t easy either: the museum needs to be able to draw a unified whole, rather than the city itself. The museum certainly has this capability, and it performs this capability throughout its collection: it displays works by and in different places, in different times, using different cultural practices, and in different settings. It’s a different kind of museum. But this kind of museum is rare, and its creation is often questioned. Why is its</text>

This is why the museum is so important now: because the museum is able to create and inhabit its present through the city’s present, its architecture and its collection.If the museum is to maintain its independence and thus its value, it must be able to create its own future – create what Higgins calls a ‘transformer’. This is possible only with the support of a robust public board of directors, who are able to step in and reshape the museum into what they please. And of course, only the museum can change its form or content – although it must be able to articulate and engage with the city as a whole in order to maintain its value and prestige. Only the museum can inhabit its past, create what Higgins calls a ‘transformer’ and, above all, ‘transfix’.For Higgins, the museum is able to assume many forms – an essential aspect of its mission – but above all, it remains the scene of conflict. In her view, it displays the essence of the conflict: it displays the present through a history of conflict; it reveals the latent conflicts of the future through a science of uncertain outcomes; and,</text>

If the museum can do this, the city will naturally do it. But this is almost certainly not going to happen, because the museum will always have a greater say in the city’s future structure and culture than the city will allow. And this is why biennials can be so influential in shaping their local environment – by appearing in a local art market, for example – but not so influential in creating an entirely new art world elsewhere. Because the biennial will always have a greater say in a given city, even if that takes many years and is often disputed. And the reason is simple: the biennial is an episodic show. It has a particular relationship to the place it takes place in, and how it presents that relationship. So even if the museum or the art market or the local community decides to embark on a</text>

This is why the museum is so important now: because the museum is able to create and inhabit its present through the city’s present, its architecture and its collection.If the museum is to maintain its autonomy, as Bissera rightly argues, it must have a say in how its collections are used: why are some objects placed in museums, and others not? Why are some objects viewed as particularly beautiful, while others are not? These are the kind of questions that the museum, through its collection, can and should answer. But to achieve this, the museum has to be able to create and inhabit its own collection – an impossible task in its current exhibition format. If the museum is to maintain its autonomy, it must take collective ownership of its collections – that is, take responsibility for using them in ways that are not dictated by a board of trustees appointed by and beholden to commercial interests. For the museum to achieve this, it must negotiate and compromise with those who control the financial destiny of the city, and with the city’s existing business elites. And it mustn’t forget its roots – because its very raison d’overture is</text>

The museum is part of the city’s infrastructure – and part of the museum is part of the city’s infrastructure. If the city is to continue to function as it has for the last twenty years, it’s critical that the museum has a voice in the city’s future. This is why the museum is so important to the city: because it provides the language for the city to be able to express itself. It’s able to create and inhabit its future – create what Higgins calls ‘the city within the city’ – as a result of the museum’s proximity and thus its ‘subsidiarity’. This is why the museum is so important now: because the museum is able to create and inhabit its present through the city’s present, its architecture and its collection.If the museum is to inhabit the city’s social space, it must be able to negotiate the city’s space and time within the museum. But this requires a new kind of museum curator – a kind of museum leader who is able to negotiate the city’s space and time as a result of their position within the museum. In other words, museum leaders must be able to negotiate ‘the city’ without becoming cogs alongside the museum, like those cogs in a machine. And this is where the biennial becomes interesting. It’s easy to create a biennial that exploits an existing theme or form, or to recapture an interest of a past generation through nostalgic travel. But if the museum is to inhabit the city, it’s even easier to reimagine the museum within the city: to inhabit the museum and the past, the present and future. So the biennial becomes a ‘systemic event’ that exploits a preexisting cultural landscape</text>

The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, to an extent that can no longer be ignored. It is an art world that is constantly shifting and shifting, constantly on the verge of a collapse that neither the private investors nor the public representatives that comprise the public gallery would ever willingly allow to fester.This is the ‘present’ in relation to the past, contemporaneous with, and just as much a part of, what might be called the ‘present’. It is the present, contemporaneous with, and just as much a part of what might be called the ‘present’ as experiencing the past. The notion of the contemporaneous with the ‘past’, or ‘contemporaneous’ with, is of crucial importance when thinking about our cultural histories and present. It signifies that events in the past are still relevant and relevant in the present, but that these past events no longer define what is meant by the term ‘present’.

The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, as well.The VR medium is both socially and artistically valuable in its own right, and has, since its beginning, been a tool for the socially engaged to inhabit supposedly private and transcendent spaces. VR is not just cool; it is necessary for the socially engaged to be able to engage with art’s promise and its possibilities. The impetus for this research project was, as always, the same: to understand how art can be powerful in creating new ways of being in and through the world. To understand this, I’d like to borrow a concept from Curator Relations (http://www.curatorrelations.org/) and its website: an ‘entity’. The concept is useful in understanding the dynamic between artist and viewer, because it allows us to distinguish two ‘peripheral phenomena’: a viewer who is viewing an image from an artist who is creating an artwork, and an ‘entity’ whose status as an image is determined</text>

The cumulative effect of these mediums, and the presence of the viewer, creates an ever-present sense of displacement and unsettlement. The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, to an extent that is difficult to measure or quantify. It is a condition that has the potential to define and define any artistic orientation. In a recent poll of 50 curators – a diverse group of artists, curators, media critics and historians – conducted by the American gallery Association, over half (54%) said that virtual reality would be a major influence on their exhibitions in the future.4 The VR medium is pervasive, and its influence can be measured with many different kinds of media: in books, videogames, animations, radio plays, advertisements, graffiti, calendars, pamphlets, t-shirts, magazines, videos, social media posts and countless other forms of media. It is easy to get lost in the multitude of media that can be produced and consumed through the medium. But there is one particular form of media that is both ubiquitous and powerful: the interactive computer game. This media has become so pervasive that it is almost a requirement for every kind of art form: to some extent,</text>

The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, and it is this sense of displacement and unsettlement that underlies the exhibitionary impulse and the biennale. There is a danger that the evolving medium of the VR may be used to create simulacra of things that do not exist, in order to further the aims of the curatorial team that is engaged in understanding and creating better ways of city living. This is a particularly insidious and pernicious effect of the spread of virtual reality. The emergence of alternative, mediated and multimedia experiences of the past few years has put curators in a bind. They can either adopt the medium of the VR and its implied social functions, as a whole, as a whole or they can take a step back and acknowledge the things that are happening in the city in ways that are not necessarily aligned with those of the original inhabitants. This is particularly true in the case of a biennale that is driven by a curatorial agenda. It is the curatorial team’s job to monitor and facilitate the</text>

The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, as all art exhibits should be. But whereas in the past biennials and art trestleges were places where art was produced at a local scale and at a moment of historical and social moment, the VR medium is the preserve of specialists. Surplus collectors and technology geeks – companies who develop innovative ways of gathering and utilising knowledge – are the last to benefit from this new found wealth. Consequently, the art world is hit particularly hard by this change. Curators and artists in the art field are particularly sensitive to this effect, as they are wont to identify with the ‘found’ community and to use the museum as a staging ground for their projects. But it is artists whose work is displayed for the first time, and thus stand out, that tend to be the most affected. It is not just exhibitionists who are affected by this change, but also those whose work is displayed in venues that are now more or less self-sufficient in materials, supplies and infrastructure necessary</text>

The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, and it is this ongoing and massive current of change that is often cited as a symptom of the ‘hyper-mimetic’ publishing culture of the 21st century. I would argue that there is another aspect to this, one that is experiencing and reacting to this change through its own creative self-image making. This new image-production aspect of the art world is conscious and engaged with ‘real-life’ circumstances, and it is this aspect of the ‘art world’ that is slowly being drowned out by ‘institutional media and social norms’. The VR medium and its accompanying social media savvy is disrupting what used to be called the institutional domain in ways that are more conscious, more purposeful and more influential. The biennale format is being replaced by a curatorial agenda driven by and in dialogue with art students and artists. This is a world that students and artists are making, and it is a world that is being experienced and reacted to</text>

The cumulative effect of these mediums, and the presence of the viewer, creates an ever-present sense of displacement and unsettlement. The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, and is constantly seeking an explanation in the form of data. How and why it is happening remains a subject of conjecture. VR allows the viewer to step into a different world, but this new perspective demands a great deal of concentration and effort. The viewer has to be able to suspend their disbelief. The theory and practice of virtual reality still needs to be developed and applied in order to fully grasp the potentialities and perils of this new mode of perception. This is why schools and research centres investing in virtual reality are so keen to establish working relationships with art institutions and cultural organisations. It allows art to operate in a totally different world, yet retaining its identity as art. This is the nature of a research project, and the art body that is the subject of the project is keen to ensure that its identity is recognised and its work considered authentic.This is the case for the VR version of the Biennale of Sydney, which was run as a documentary on the Biennale website.

The cumulative effect of these mediums, and the presence of the viewer, creates an ever-present sense of displacement and unsettlement. The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, and it is this effect that the Biennale hopes to obscure or negate. The exhibition was originally conceived as an enormous moving image, and the project eventually expanded to include an even greater number of images and texts. The very title of the exhibition referred to this effect: ‘The Exhibition’. This is odd, since the objects on view in the exhibition are mostly defined by a single function: as images or images of images. The exhibition is concerned with the inessential aspects of art’s existence in a contemporary urban environment, but it is also concerned with the art of making art, and the art of living with and beyond the art form itself. The term ‘exhibition’ is frequently used in relation to works created and/or exhibited in a particular space, but rarely, if at all, in relation to works created in a particular historical context. In other words, the exhibition may be an object of our desires, but it does not have the same kind of</text>

The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, as well. It is a space for the newly empowered to manifest their identities and demand a corresponding amount of change in the world. This is why the VR medium is so powerful: it allows you to be in on the ground floor of an enormous new idea, but at the same time it throws up obstacles in your path to get there. This effect is especially evident in the VRMMO, or visual novel, game and pop culture mash-up, where the viewer’s perspective is often displaced in order to make way for the transnational financial logic of the mass media. The contemporary VRMMO is an ideal candidate for the exhibition that I suggested for the Biennale of Sydney, because it is sensitive to the contemporary condition, is dynamic, and its virtual or augmented reality facilitates a sense of placelessness. But it also has a very specific mission statement – a ‘mission statement’ that is nearly identical to that of the Biennale of Sydney but is framed in a</text>

The contemporary art world is affected by this displacement and unsettlement, too, by a large extent. We inhabit the displaced space of experience and it is this constant state of unsettlement that makes it interesting and compelling. It is this experience of unsettlement that makes it possible to engage with contemporary art’s potential. So, there is a sense of this in the works I have been commissioning. I have commissioned artists to create ‘absurd’ versions of familiar art forms in an attempt to provoke a sense of unsettlement in the viewer. And more importantly, I have directed that these works not only be incompatible with the structures of power that are built into the existing cultural system, but also to be radically different from the structures of power that are being created through the use of new media. This last requirement is a condition of the VR medium. The other conditions are met by the art being created, but are also criteria by which one may argue about the appropriateness of the art form. For example, the criteria of VR usage are as</text>

I lead a design team that includes artists, community organisers, architects and planners who are developing a new strategy for the city that incorporates arts, culture, residential regeneration and a pedestrianised future for the area.The challenge for our project is two-fold. The first is to create a set of design parameters that artists, community organisers, architects and planners can adopt to work with us in an open and transparent manner. The second is to create a way to bring people together through a shared interest in how the city should be designed to support their daily lives. The plan to create a new urban space for Liverpool is a space-generating, rather than a space-sucking operation. We need to find creative ways to bring people together through a shared interest. I’m particularly interested in the ways in which housing, regeneration and culture are interrelated. I’m particularly interested in artists and the ways in which they can be artists in a regenerative way.

She wants ‘a continuous and irreversible increase in the city’s cultural resources’, including creating an arts educational programme for schools around the city. She also wants ‘a shared and sustainable future for the cultural resources and the village’s identity as a result of the development of the city’s infrastructure’.So, there you have it: the evolution of Liverpool’s biennial potential over the past 15 years, with some personal reflections on the project.

Probably, in public or private, some participants took issue with many of your remarks.I liked what you said about the relationship between biennials and the cities that are their platforms or frames or bases or resources or primary publics. We’re thinking about this in relation to Liverpool. I work for Sally Tallant as an architect on the planning and art phases of Liverpool’s future city, Anfield. I lead a design team that includes artists, community organisers, architects and planners who are developing a new design scheme for the iconic 'Big Ben' building. It’s going to be called ‘Project Stage 2’ and begin work immediately.I lead the way in thinking about how to engage the local residents of Anfield through designing an interactive public realm around the building, its history and future.The public realm around the Ben is going to be a multi-sited, multi-use site with spectacular views of the city. The public realm around the Ben is going to be a site of commerce, education, gathering, pilgrimage and much more. The public realm around the Ben is going to be a mix of people from all over the city, and it’s going to be called ‘The Community Ben’.So, there’s a huge opportunity for artists, designers, artists to come in and contribute to the creation of the new design for the Ben, and the way in which the Community Ben is going to be lived, worked and lived by the</text>

It’s a hybrid of concept, proposal, action plan and design that’s both word for concept, and action plan all in one.For the planning phase, we’re thinking of ways to create a public realm around the post office in a way that’s both symbolic and actually works. We call this ‘living in discursive space’. We’re asking, ‘How do we create a dialogue around our belief that this space is valuable, and create a possible future for this area?’ The planning phase is going well and we’re asking how to activate this valuable real estate in a way that is both symbolic and actually pays off in the long</text>

It’s a hybrid because it’s being proposed for a future city that’s experiencing a period of rapid urban growth but also because of a rapid population explosion. The proposed ‘HQ2’ of offices, retail, cultural centres, sports venues, residential towers and so on is the template for all future urban growth being proposed for this city.

The focus for this phase of research and development is artists’ studios, educational institutions and educational organisations in the new urban core, which would include galleries, kindergartens, arts buildings and play areas, outdoor public spaces and a cultural district with free Wi-Fi and public transport links. The aim is to create a city ‘where artists can live, work and play freely, and develop the city’s urban fabric through cultural production and passive re-use’.I’m proud to say that my artworks often take a place in the periphery of this new urban district.

I introduce new mathematical and ethno-linguistic approaches to species inbreeding in this book, using statistical, biogeographic and ecological considerations to consider both the positive and negative consequences of inbreeding within species. I employ inbreeding–structures that emerge as a result of multiple inbreeding events within a species to create ‘species villages’ that conserve biodiversity while supporting local economies and fuelling the social and bio-political evolution of the species through their symbiotic relationships. I also employ mathematical models to simulate the evolution of inbreeding within closely related species, in an attempt to shed light on the mechanisms that underlie inbreeding. The models I employ do not propose cures or magical intervention, but seek to reveal the mechanisms that enable complex social systems to evolve. The aim is to render the dynamics of inbreeding and eco-systems modelling relevant in the contemporary world by drawing upon contemporary scientific and technical knowledge to enable us to simulate the inbreeding and eco-systems within which they exist. Towards this end, I employ geometric morphologies and the geometric mean to describe the hierarchical interconnection between constituent parts of a</text>

I introduce new mathematical and ethno-linguistic approaches to species inbreeding in this book, using statistical, biogeographic and archaeological evidence to argue that inbreeding has been around for thousands of years and continues to be a widespread phenomenon in many areas of the world.I turn to archaeology and zoology to give credence to my claims, while at the same time inviting readers to draw their own conclusions about inbreeding and eco-systems. I employ inbreeding research, introduced by anthropologist Daniel Kahneman, to illustrate the concept of multiple versions of the same gene within species. I begin by describing the common ancestor of all living things; inferring from this that all living things share the same DNA and that all life is ultimately composed of DNA. This common ancestor was long thought to be the species – humans – and much of what we know about human origins comes from ancient texts that document the spread of life across species. But a growing body of research now suggests that the species actually begins to wane; that humans are the last species to diverge from the chimpanzee, or to speak in general,</text>

I introduce new mathematical and ethno-linguistic approaches to species inbreeding in this book, using statistical, biogeographic and morphological data sets to map species to geographical regions, and classifying elements to sub-species. I then introduce two new sub-species of Artemisia: Australia and Madagascar. The A. agrestis and M. kudu overlap with the A. americana and A. fulva, but differ in that their common ancestor roamed no further south than Australia. The A. fulva, however, shares many of the same anatomical and physiological traits with the A. agrestis but differs in that it has a mouth and a foot, unlike its northern neighbour. The A. fulva also has a ‘brain and skeleton’ – two elements that would not be expected to evolve in sequence – but unlike the A. americana, its head and body do not fuse together as part of a single organic whole. I use computational biology and geospatial data to map species to geographical regions, and classifying elements to sub-species, and propose a new type</text>

Finally, the practices and objects described within this book – which draw upon my own research interests and those of others – are combined with scientific and historical data to create a planetary record that records the inbreeding and eco-system disruption caused by inbreeding within living things.This book is a mapping of the evolutionary history of objects, plants and animals across the board. It begins with the emergence of language as a system for the exchange of information across species, and ends with the establishment of distinct human languages – or languages – that diverge from one another via inbreeding. The linguistic system that characterises the world we inhabit today is a complex assemblage of shared prefixes and suffixes. The book then traces the gradual evolution of dialects – dialects of humans – across the board, from the earliest signs of</text>

Melosh), an approach to analysing the inbreeding coefficient of a global system using only the topological features of a planet; ‘geographical inbreeding’ (W. Ungar and T. Melosh), an approach to analysing the spatial distribution of inbreeding within a geographical region; and ‘structural inbreeding’ (D. Langer and K. Chernick), an approach to analysing the social organisation of inbreeding within human populations. Overall, species inbreeding is discussed as a phenomenon that occurs at multiple scales, at multiple scales, and with diverse modes of insecution. The aim of this book is to one day be a</text>

I also employ inbreeding-strategies as a tool to understand emerging trends in complex social situations, like migration and in-group/out-group contact, in order to anticipate the future in which such phenomena will be encountered. I employ qualitative methods to document the predicaments and future scenarios of inbreeding within species, while placing emphasis on the 'what-ifs', as they unfold in the present and in the future. For instance, inbreeding-strategies could lead to new understandings of the dynamics of cooperation between humans and nonhuman animals, and of the role of the local in the evolution of social complexity. These possibilities are not hypothetical, and they are part of the biological basis of human social organisation. In fact, there are already signs that inbreeding-strategies are reshaping social</text>

I employ principles of ecosystem science and evolutionary biology, as well as mathematical and ethno-linguistic approaches, to analyse globalised infrastructures and urban infrastructures. These will allow me to draw infrastructures and bio-political boundaries, as well as the infrastructural systems that facilitate and facilitate inbreeding within species.

I consider how inbreeding may be an issue in our own species, and in the future, in the future species that share certain properties with us. The awareness of inbreeding may contribute to our understanding of why certain diseases, including some cancers, occur. For instance, inbreeding-associated traits, such as the presence of paternal ancestors with a shared environment, is known to increase the risk of certain types of cancer. By uncovering this increased risk, we may be able to develop targeted therapies that target those inbreeding-associated tumours. Inbreeding-associated disorders, including cancer, are among the most prevalent types of human disease, and recent advances in molecular and computational biology mean that we may be able to identify and target specific gene targets that confer particular therapeutic benefits or risks.

The project invites viewers to explore the archipelagos of history through archival visual tools and means. The text will be projected onto a wall in the Performing Arts Center, where participants can place text that is either their own or that of others. This installation will be located in the main exhibition hall and will be triggered by an audio/visual collaboration with Leah Schnapf, a local artist who is a founding partner of the Performing Arts Center and a curator of the Aarhus Art Biennale.

She has been asked to create a new kind of biennial that will, like the US/UK/Argentinean model, be visitor-driven and visitor-friendly but will also operate at the level of its host city. She has been invited to establish a task force of researchers, artists, writers and others with a joint interest in art, architecture and urbanisation to explore the question: what could be done differently? For this project, she has been invited to join forces with researchers from CREATE (Centro Cultural Florentineo e Investigazionale della Svizzera – CREATE: Urban Innovation and Renaissance), the Italian language's Lazute Street Project (founded in 1989 and based in Udine), and the Swiss Language Institute (LATIN University).

The fact that I was working with a curator from a completely different discipline (art history, architecture, design) in doing the same sort of thing as I did the architecture, but in a different context, came as a surprise to me. I thought the architecture part of the project was illustrative, but seemed to be doing the most impressionistic work. The way I saw it, the other part was telling a story through the architecture. The whole idea was that the curators were engaged with the urban setting and the urban situation in a particular area, while the audience was engaged with the architecture and its function in the city.

The exhibition will address the cultural dynamics of the area and its history, present and potential futures. It will utilize artefacts from the Giardini and the Biennale of Records, located in the regional capital of Venice, as mediums of archival and archival research and analysis. The exhibition will also investigate the relationship between the two, using Venice as a laboratory and other local artefacts as vectors for future cultural flows. These flows will be influenced by the knowledge and knowledge-production strategies of the local population, researchers from the Italian Cultural Geographer, Paolo Portoghesi, and others.

Her project will see selected works from those institutions combined with works from the Liverpool Biennial and other artists, presented in chronological order of appearance in Florence between 1946 and 2016. Previous works have been presented at the Venice Biennale, Oslo Arboretum, and Taipei 101, to name only a few. Her project is the culmination of a decade-long artistic exploration of the city. The exhibition will be based on a no-holds-barred narrative that anticipates the narrative of a Hollywood blockbuster. It will use archival materials and archival practices from the region to explore the lives and works of artists, activists, journalists and others who have contributed to the discourse on art, culture, identity, architecture, urbanism, cities and urbanism in the region. The exhibition will also use archival photographs, archival archival collections and other archival materials to trace the life of the Biennale from its beginnings in 2004 to the present. With support from the Arts Council England, the Biennale is an independent, worldwide exhibition company established in New York in 1986. It presents more than 1,000 works from a permanent, future-oriented art collection and a small selection from a lifetime archive of images. The Biennale was launched in 2014 and runs through December 2018.Download this article as PDFEva CastringiusIn her art Eva Castringius often depicts violent encounters between humans and animals.

In the film, the protagonist is a journalist investigating a separatist movement in the 1950s, where the term ‘Filipino Rapist’ is frequently used to describe those involved in the illicit trade in women and children. Her project is intended to confront the image that is commonly propagated by ‘filipino rapists’ – that there is a distinct ‘white’ lineage that is being forced ‘through the filtration of blood’ from the land. Her project is intended to endow a culture of life and movement with the name ‘Filipino Rapist’ – and to begin a conversation about who is, and isn’t, among those with that name.The project was developed and led by Artistic Director of the Performing Arts Center, Professor Maurizio Lazzarato, and culminated in a two-week open school in the Performing Arts Center building in Venice 2017.

The project was conceived and directed by Schnapf, along with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, who will portray an anti-fascist activist in the film. The exhibition will bring together all the different strands of the story – the narrative of fascism, the discourse of identity, the practice of memory – in a common setting to engage important questions of place, memory, and power. Previous art projects have addressed topics of identity, activism, migration, and postcolonialism. Artists in the staging of projects, whether historical or contemporary, have a particular responsibility to consider the practices and narratives of their communities, particularly in the context of fascist regimes. In a 2015 project entitled ‘F.E.A.Q. (Forgetting Afghanistan), I visited the site of a munitions factory where civilian sex toys were assembled and sold as sex toys by the Taliban.

Leah Schnapf’s project will combine narrative narration, archival and historical materials, and the innovative new technology of the connected exhibition setting, with interactive media and games to tell the story of the Giardini.The Biennale is a uniquely Italian experience. It is the result of an agreement between the Biennalee, the Italian Cultural Association (Bia Cultural), and the Italian government in 1946, which granted the Biennale exclusive rights to the city due to its high cultural value. The Biennalee, along with the cultural institutions of the city, were given a new and improved status, enabling them to more easily access, integrate and exchange cultural capital in the form of artefacts and cultural capital. The Biennalee was also given the task of creating a cultural response to the economic blockade imposed by the state against the region. As a result of this, the Biennalee set up a</text>

The role of the cultural geographer in understanding and designing the infrastructure of infrastructure development and its delivery to the communities with disabilities is a social one. It is this social aspect of the profession that needs to be embedded in our cultural theory and deepened through our own layered social histories and representations. It is a social reason to work alongside other professions, and to be part of a team. It is not enough to understand the art-making process and deliver artistic products to clients; one needs to understand the systems and neighbourhoods that enable creative action through art and recreation. The systems and neighbourhoods need to be designed and constructed with the needs of the communities that are affected (high-income and low-income neighbourhoods, working-class neighbourhoods,</text>

It is the responsibility of the city to foster civic participation and engage citizens in the political process through civic and political parties, trade unions and non-profit organisations, as well as the provision of free and reduced-price schools and daycares. It is also the responsibility of the city to create cultural networks that function in the service of the political, legal and economic systems that construct and create the city, and to the abolition of poverty, hunger and homelessness. It is vital that these cultural networks are rooted in the city’s past, present and future, in order to enable the city to be a site of ecological and urban creativity in the future. It is a social necessity. The more responsive the city is to the urban threat posed by a changing climate, the less likely is it to be a greenhouse gas emitter and the more likely is it to be a food desert in the future. It is a social and political imperative. To achieve these goals, cultural geographers need to be able to work across a diversity of disciplines</text>

I believe that the social contract between the city and the citizen is a contract that must be honoured; otherwise, the citizens will not create the social contract. And when the social contract is not honoured, but the exchange – the cultural exchange – is not social, then there is a risk that the social contract will be challenged. We see this in the litigation between the city and the coal miners in the Murray Hill area of Seattle. The miners claimed that the social contract between the city and the miners</text>

It is the responsibility of the city to provide the requisite infrastructure, whether it is kindergarten through university, to enable the diverse modes of cultural formation and the shifting of values and modes of interaction appropriate to a city to foster social mobility and creative perforations through the establishment of diverse mode of cultural consumption. In other words, the role of the city does not necessarily include a cultural instrument. The cultural institutions and the modes of consumption created by and through them may be crafted by and through creative or creative in their own right.Creative perforations may arise through a combination of cultural production and innovative design, but they also require creative or creative in others to be delivered to a mass audience. The role of the city in this process is to deliver the message that these modes of cultural transmission are valuable in their own right and to foster a shared understanding of the value in different forms of media. This requires a collective imagination, but also a collective willingness to share. The classic adage ‘twas the first time I drank’ is</text>

However, it is clear that the social and civic dimensions of urban transformation are interrelated and that the economic is the dominant technological imperative. It is also clear that the future city will be managed not just by the engineers, technologists and economists who construct it, but also by the people who call it ‘home’. This is the social world we strive to create and inhabit.Cultural production and consumption today is driven by super-intelligent algorithms, virtual reality and sophisticated data mining that constantly seek to discover new ways to improve their condition as consumers. These technologies render ever more ubiquitous cultural consumption, yet they also render ever more labor-intensive to implement and maintain</text>

Finally, it is the responsibility of the city to provide the social services and cultural amenities conducive to the fulfilling of these diverse forms of cultural activity. Do you see where this is leading? The city is becoming ever more like a complex social whole, where all manner of people from all over the place come to live, work, play, raise families and play, exchange and exchange, and the city is but one among many nodes within this social whole. In other words, the city is becoming ever more like a social whole, but it is becoming ever more like a disjointed collection of nodes. And this is where the micro and macro are playing their part. The city is becoming ever more like a disjointed collection of nodes, but it is becoming ever more like a social whole.That is, the more densely populated a neighbourhood is becoming, the more opportunities there are for cultural exchange between people from different</text>

It is the responsibility of the city to foster civic participation, and to a large extent, this must come at the cost of losing some of its cultural character. It is up to the city to create what it calls a ‘cultural treasury’ (not an actual museum or art gallery, but a social hub dedicated to preserving and enhancing the cultural qualities of the city), and this social bond must be maintained through the maintenance of a network of parks and recreation facilities.2  In other words, cultural geographers not only prescribe what institutions should be built but also what they should hide and what they should embrace.3  If the social capacities of the city are to be fostered and enhanced, then the maintenance of cultural resources must come at the cost of some of the social burdens. Cultural geographers can help the city achieve certain objectives through what is commonly called progressive suburban development, which adopts the ideas and strategies of progressive urbanism and is itself a mode of cultural decentralisation.

Her reflections on the historical role of the city in her book are divided into three sections: the ‘metainterface’ – the cities that followed the Industrial Revolution; ‘the third sector’ – those that came after.10  Her engagement with the latter half of the first wave of the utopias is characterised by a ‘warrior’ tendency that sought to create a ‘third’ from the rubble of the first two. It was an obsession with the ‘third’ that gave rise to the term ‘utopian’ and the idea that a ‘better’ life could be created through the collective efforts of a community of people rather than the individual efforts of a few genius managers and entrepreneurs. That drive to create a better future – better for all – came to define a utopia.

Her essay, ‘The Ecologist Questionnaire’, in 	The Ecologist,17 December 1972, seems to offer a tentative answer to this long-standing conundrum: while many of the principles identified in the original 1946 issue of The Ecologist remain valid in 1976, there are ‘harder questions that still need to be asked and answered.’ These ‘utopian questions’ included questions about the impact of industrial production on the environment, the role of art in the socialization of resources, the relationship between the urban and the natural environments, and so forth.  Her engagement with the role of art, and her willingness to engage with the modern environmental discourse on its own terms, comes across as naive and vacuous at the same time.  Her relationship to the arts is further demonstrated by her repeated use of the term ‘institutional decay’ to describe what she saw as the degeneration of the arts institutions during the 1970</text>

From the project: ideas were offered under the title Social Criticism of Urban Regeneration – a response to the political, economic and aesthetic constraints on such a mission. The ‘oppressed urban citizen’ was to be given over to the philosophy of individualism, which would prescribe a better way of organising life in the city. The project also saw an exploration of the ethical dimensions of urban regeneration. The object of her research was the city’s derelict property market, which for decades had been a lucrative business for unscrupulous urban managers. The incentives to redevelop the blockaded market were to be found in the project itself. Urbanists had long known that the market could be used as a force for social good. But the possibilities for the social good were much broader. The social good of the ‘utopian city’ was to be realised when people in the city came to value the social good of the ‘utopian society’.</text>

During this time she conducted two major public programmes on the life and works of Murray Bookchin, including a series of two-and-a-half-year long visits to the secluded village of Nether Square. While at Liverpool, she participated in the launch of a new wave of artists’ studios in the city, including an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, sponsored by Liverpool Biennial, in January 1976, and the exhibition of art and artists from the Nether Square Village Association, 1977–79, conducted by Liverpool’s Art and Architecture Unit.10  Her engagement with the postindustrial society she finds herself in is evident in her account of the 1978 Biennale of Sydney, which she did not visit, and in her book  	Postindustrial Society: The Crisis of the City, its Morale and Capital Dislocation.11  Her interest in the contemporary predicament of the city is apparent in her account of the meeting that</text>

Her engagement with the subject of religion and social reform began to form the basis for her engagement with social change. In her book  	Religion and Secular Humanism, she evaluates the role of religion in the modern society and finds reason in its place. She writes: Social reformers ‘ought to look back at history and see what paths were taken, not just in the direction in which they were trending’.10  Her project began to reorient modernity in the direction of the soul.  Her interest in the role of religion in shaping social behaviour began to form the basis for her engagement with the religious. As a young woman, she entered the Catholic Church, which at the time was experiencing a wave of anti-clerical activism, and subsequently the Muslim Brotherhood, which was developing into a full-fledged political organisation. She subsequently founded the anti-secular League of Humanistic Jurists and Educators in 1976,</text>

Her engagement with the environmental critique of capitalism was also influenced by the work of Murray Bookchin, whose ideas of direct action were also part of that first utopic wave of environmental activism.12  Her interest in the social consequences of resource depletion in the developing world is also evident in her reflections on the Peruvian Andes, an area of the Andes that span several countries and are home to some of the highest peaks on Earth.Her interest in the social implications of resource depletion in the developing world is also</text>

Her reflections on this period are drawn from her research, writing and class.  Her engagement with the postindustrial society leads her to question aspects of what she sees as its tendency to privatize social life, and to question whether a socialist future could lay in such a society.  Her engagement with the economics of human behaviour – the tendency she calls neoliberalism – also helps to ground her theorization of the ‘permanent motion of capital’.10  Her theorization of the ‘permanent motion of capital’ is a productive way of bringing forward concepts that are already at work in other disciplines, such as geo-politics and the social sciences, to intervene in the dynamics of the city in new ways. The introduction to her new book  	Movement 	is a meditation on the migratory tendencies of infrastructure.

In a nutshell, the voice of the city, the voice of its inhabitants, was heard differently then ever before. This radical new mode of urban representation was expressed through theatrical events, ‘public realm’ in the form of buildings and streets, ‘emulation’ of the urban environment by way of architecture, and a robust support of arts and culture across the social, economic and spatial levels. These traits of the utopian ideal were put forward as a counter to the prevailing neo-liberal machine. If implemented, they were claimed, these radical new modes of urbanisation would enable a return to the original spirit of the city – a spirit of collaborative, imaginative and dynamic urbanisation – a new urban form.</text>

In her book The Public Value of Urban Space, she draws parallels between the activities of the BMSP and those of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), whose Board of Directors includes prominent figures in art, theatre, writing and design. She argues that the RSPCA should consider creating an autonomous organisation that would monitor, supervise and advise the BMSP on urban matters, while the BMSP could develop policies and jointly commission artwork. She also proposes that the Board of Directors of the RSPCA establish a cooperative housing trust fund to assist in the maintenance of social and cultural infrastructure in the city.10  Her interest in the role of the RSPCA in the maintenance of the city came as a result of her experiences at the RSPCA Board of Directors meeting that year. She recounts how the meeting was hushed as a group of women members of the Board were engaged in another meeting in the building. While discussing the new programme for</text>

Her engagement with the role of the city in the postindustrial society is particularly eloquent, and it is evident in the way that she develops the ideas in her chapter titled ‘The Challenge’ in her book. She begins by discussing the philosophical and ideal concerns surrounding the city, then turning to discussing the practicalities of creating viable alternative cities based on the knowledge gained from the ‘Challenge Programme’. She develops the idea of pathological altruism – the idea that we are born with a predisposition towards becoming good – by way of a scenario in which a number of people descend from ‘Elite’ status in the society to become randomly selected members of a future ‘Challenge Generation’.

[7] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to live out its stated role as a visitor attraction. In this way, the two terms – which have come to signify so much in the past – come to correspond in a way that conveys the strangulation of meaning by a kind of temporal logic. If the mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise art and culture, and the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to inhabit the city, then the one who comes to live out that paradox is the visitor, not an artist, as stated by Enid Marx’s character in the musical Not Mine. In the play, visitors are often instructed to cease their activities and return to the city, but Marx’s text is specific: those visitors who continue to live and work in the city are criminalised. From the date of its publication in 1937, with its cover image of a naked social democrat in a tattered state of liberalism, to the present day, whenever the journal is checked, it is found that the</text>

They’re both about reproducing the original mission statement, but different kinds of historians. 	[7] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to inhabit the city and make sense of its remaining urban rubble. The council’s proposal may have some validity, although I don’t think it captures the spirit of the word ‘archived’ that is associated with the word ‘modern’. 	[8] In fact, the historical mission of the Biennial is to look back at the past and move forward into the future, which suggests that the contemporary counterpart is also historical but contemporary. 	[9] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise the past, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to inhabit the city and make sense of its remaining urban rubble. I think this is at odds with what biennials do, which is usually about reproducing the mission of the museum or museum itself, whereas the historical and theoretical mission of the museum is often more immediate and relates to the immediate present.

[7] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to inhabit the city. In reality, the two kinds of missions are often at odds, and while the biennial’s main mission statement is fulfilled in an attempt to archive and theorise art and culture, its actual effect is often hindered by its own retroactivity and change. For example, the 1992 Biennial was an anomaly in that it was not a continuation of the previous art and culture biennials, but rather an entirely new and differentiated kind of art biennial. Curators William H. Macy Jr and Adam Szymczyk note that its focus on local artists coupled with its self-proclaimed ‘100 years of art’ narrative ‘turned up the volume, creating a ‘mix of old and new’’ by renewing old curatorial themes and motifs’, ‘reproducing the historical trend of the “300 year old museum”, which is often characterised by an emphasis on preservation and the “sharing”</text>

They’re both about reproducing the original mission statement, but different kinds of historians. 	[7] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to live out its stated function as a museum – a sort of archiving of art’s past, a sort of present. The latter kind of historiography proposes a future that accommodates art’s present and future, but which nonetheless modifies and distributes the art’s past in ways that are not entirely consistent with, or even compatible with, contemporary art. In the case of Liverpool, the future that it creates will also require that it actively participate in the past, creating ways of living that are not entirely consistent with, or even compatible with, the present. 	[8] 	It is this active participation – this proposal to the council – that underlies the new kind of ‘living space’ that is being imagined for Anfield. It’s being made in large part through a proposal to buy back and give back to the city, a way of life that is completely separate from the museum. It’s being made to</text>

[7] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to live out its stated function as a museum, ever vigilant in tracking down and preserving for posterity the original mission statement of bringing together and showcasing contemporary artworks from different quarters.[8] Both kinds of historians make pilgrimages to the places where art was made, to the places where art today is made, to look for traces of art’s once ubiquitous, globalised form of ‘the Port of Culture’. The pilgrimages may lead to museums or J.M. Peake International Architecture Museum, but they invariably lead to archives. Archives are places of their own, places that do their own archiving. And archives do not hold collections; they hold collections of sorts, objects preserved in their particular formative moments. When Archibald MacConnalud set out to archive his collection of seven studio portraits, for instance, he decided to create a new kind of micro-museum: a museum of the moment, intranational and diasporic, with</text>

They’re both about reproducing the original mission statement, but different kinds of historians. 	[7] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to live out its stated purpose of gathering together ‘a diverse range of artists, curators, writers, activists, historians and artists’ to do research into the city’s past, present and future. The aim of the biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture both at large and within its site, in ways that are both powerful and complicated. It is, in short, an art form that is both powerful and complex. 	[8] To be sure, the contemporary mission of the biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture and to live it, in ways that are both powerful and complicated. And to some extent this is already happening, through the biennial as a museum of the art it represents and the culture that it conceives of – the art of living in the age of the biennial. 	[9] For example, the Biennial as a museum of the art of food and fashion might even</text>

[8]   Jürgen Habermas, an early proponent of a collectivist, nationalistic interpretation of museums, put it this way: ‘There are museums everywhere. In every museum you can find a history of a given kind.’[9] A handful of biennials, he reckoned, contained between 10 and 20 percent originality, while the rest were collections, or collections in museums.</text>

[7] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to inhabit the site of art and culture and make it relevant again, today, in a way that the museum can still do. In other words, what the biennial does in its current form is interpretive rather than material, and in that sense it preserves the materiality of the historical mission while incorporating the mission statement into new forms of representations of the city. 	[8] In recent years, the emphasis has shifted from reproducing the mission statement to the interpretation of that statement, or more specifically, from reproducing the mission statement to the formation of interpretive frameworks around what the biennial can and cannot do. For instance, the mission of the Liverpool Biennial has come to mean more than preserving the historical mission of the Biennial, which is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture. The new interpretive frameworks constructed around the mission statement and the materiality of the Biennial may represent a more material appreciation of the art being made in the city, or they may ignore</text>

In other words, the mission of the contemporary biennial is to be accessible, while at the same time constituting art without necessarily being art. It is to be accessible by anyone, anywhere, at anytime, through whatever means are necessary, including art thieves and art collectors, but especially by artists and those who work with them. It is to any extent possible that a biennial could become a museum, either covering the historical works or creating a new kind of museum that documents the historical moments during and after the art was produced or embodied in them. So the present and future biennials could very conceivably align. 	[8] But that would mean that the historical, archival and ethnographic materials gathered and brought to the present would have to be reassembled and brought back together again in order to be brought back together with the art again. This is beyond anything that the Biennial could realistically attempt.</text>
    <text>The next Liverpool Biennial, which opened in 2015, received critical acclaim, but its main mission statement remains unfulfilled. In its place, a new one, proposed to the city council, states that Liverpool Biennial can ‘reproduce the historical mission of the Biennial in terms of the city’s current and future needs and desires.[5] In other words, the Biennial cannot ‘reproduce the mission of the Biennial’, but it can ‘reproduce the intended outcome of the mission in such a way as to meet the desires of the city’s present and future inhabitants’.[6] The council, it seems to have concluded, does not understand the difference between historic and modern missions. They’re both about reproducing the original mission statement, but different kinds of historians. 	[7] The historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and theorise contemporary art and culture, while the contemporary mission of the Biennial is to inhabit and theorise the city.[8] This distinction is important, for it allows us to distinguish between the kinds of documentation and theorising that the Biennial can undertake, and the kinds of documentation and theorising that the city cannot. For example, the historical mission of the Biennial is to archive and analyse the art and cultural impact of the 2011 London riots, but the specific mission of the Biennial as an art institution is to archive and analyse the impact of the riots on the immediate area around the Museum of Modern Art, and beyond that, to an extent, onto the wider city. The museum is the location for the Biennial’s art and archival research, but the museum is also the site for the Biennial’s own public programme of activities, which it can declare to be part of its portfolio. The Biennial can therefore simultaneously archive the actual mission statement of the Biennial – which is to archive contemporary art and culture – and also claim that mission</text>

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world. It is the largest global cultural phenomenon, and its simultaneous production, circulation, and reception brings with it different sorts of attention. It is also a phenomenon that can be categorised into two broad categories – familiar and foreign – which I have defined below.The vernacular biennial is a global event that can be traced to the mid-1990s, when the Venice Biennale became the first biennale to exploit the city as a major art-historical site. But it is also true that the Venice Biennale has been staging periodic, localized exhibitions at the venue ever since. The main event of the Venice Biennale – the Venice public), usually takes place in May. Since its foundation in 1903, the Biennale has staged a succession of major exhibitions, most recently in 2014. Every two years, there is a smaller, more intimate edition of the Biennale, usually staged in October or November. The Venice Biennale website notes that exhibitions in their &quot;modern form are characterised by a mass exodus from the city, the rise and fall of asset prices, and periodic interruptions by</text>

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world. It is the largest global cultural phenomenon, and its simultaneous production, circulation, and reception brings with it different sorts of attention. It is a biennale that is not a city. It is a biennale that is a city in its own right. It circulates in parallel with the city, emerging out of the city’s built environment and culture. When the Venice Biennale was first proposed, some city residents and community organisers saw it as an opportunity to reclaim vacant buildings and turn unused spaces into places of enjoyment and learning. In 2004, when the Barcelona Biennale was also proposed, some people in that city ‘reclaimed their’ spaces and turned them into sites of cultural exchange and ‘new urban centres’. Biennials are recurrent cultural phenomena that emerge from and through different cultural contexts. They occur when, as a result of a particular event, a particular cultural practice, or a particular curatorial focus, a body of people engage in collective acts of memory, consciousness, or imagination. They occur at periods of transition: between the biennial and the city, between art</text>

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world. It is the largest global cultural phenomenon, and its simultaneous production, circulation, and reception brings with it different sorts of attention. It is a gathering that, while it may seem monumental, is in fact quite ordinary. It is a gathering of ordinary people coming together to do ordinary things. And it is a gathering of ordinary people doing ordinary things because that is what life is offering them.If the biennial is to have any real impact, it must be a gathering of different sorts of people, coming together in different ways, with different expectations and different capacities. And it is only through this in-group/out-group dynamic that the biennial can really happen. This in-group/out-group dynamic is only possible when there is a large and diverse in-group of people coming together to do ordinary things. And if such a gathering of people are to be genuine manifestations of the in-group/out-group dynamic, then the real and lasting impact of the art that is produced by and is invested in the biennial has to come from bringing that art to those people who are actually invested in the art and</text>

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world. It is the largest global cultural phenomenon, and its simultaneous production, circulation, and reception brings with it different sorts of attention. It is a platform on which different kinds of organising happen. In New York, the biennial is a cultural entity, and in Istanbul it is a microcosm of the city’s urban and social life. The notion of the ‘biennial’ is a fabrication, invented by curators and art dealers to justify the various ways in which they can make a living. The ‘biennial’ is a way to create a different kind of museum. The museum, as conceived by John Urry, is an artefact of the archaeological past, a set of collections that records how humans have lived together in different parts of the world for a long time. The biennial is a production that records the lives of living things – collections that are not objects of collections, but of living things. The museum is a production that records the lives of living things – collections that are objects of collections – in much the same way that the biennial is an event that records the lives of</text>

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world. It is the largest global cultural phenomenon, and its simultaneous production, circulation, and reception brings with it different sorts of attention. It is a fixture of major art centers around the world, and its popularity reflects global capitalism. It is also part of a globalised capitalist system, and so it is often visited by scholars and artists interested in the ways in which capitalism creates value and what that value is. Biennials are, in the main, symbolic of a much deeper political and social crisis that confronts the world. And yet, as biennials multiply and expand their locations around the globe, and as they hire artists to paint ever larger murals of themselves, they inevitably become part of the systems that employ and depend on them. The art of the biennial may be transient in its moment of public reception, but its enduring cultural effects are undeniable. The biennial has become part of a larger cultural system that is increasingly interested in replicating itself, and part of a system that is increasingly interested in replicating itself rapidly. This is the era of the biennial, after all, not the other way around. The 2030</text>

In New York, it is a chance to be seen through a different lens. In Liverpool, it is a chance to meet other artists. In Liverpool, it is a chance to meet other artists. In Liverpool, it is a chance to meet other artists. And so on.Each of us has our own set of priorities, and as we speak, we are hammering away at building the city we want to live in. But none of us have our own cultural imagination, our own aesthetic imagination, nor our own sense of place. We have to ask ourselves and others questions, and we must ask them to define our place in the world. We need a shared vocabulary to do this, and a capacity to tackle issues through which we are divided. And we need to learn how to tackle the things that upset us as artists, as social beings, as artists-people, in order to inhabit the things we wish for.This is a very complex undertaking.</text>

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world. It is the largest global cultural phenomenon, and its simultaneous production, circulation, and reception brings with it different sorts of attention. It is an idealised image, full of metaphors and full of ideals, but it is also a problematic image, full of literal and figurative lying. The problem with the biennial is that it is a biennale. It is a spectacle that seeks to be seen, understood, appreciated – both by those who participate in it and by those who don’t. It captures the imagination, but it is a spectacle that becomes part of the larger cultural system that it is part of. The problem with the biennial is that it is always seen as a large and pervasive cultural phenomenon, encompassing a city, a continent, and much more. And while it is true that the biennial has become larger and more systemic over the past forty years, the cultural power structures that it reconfigures are still very much local in scope and very much specific to particular cities and regions. And so the biennial remains vulnerable to the city’s institutional changes that aim to bring cultural resources more</text>

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world. It is the largest global cultural phenomenon, and its simultaneous production, circulation, and reception brings with it different sorts of attention. It is the occasion for different kinds of cultures to congregate around different kinds of sites. These sites then attract different kinds of people – visitors – who then have different kinds of cultural experiences. This is why museums are so important, because they draw people in with different kinds of experiences. If you add art to a museum, it is art, in its own way, because it is art, and it can be experienced as art. But if the museum becomes art, then the experience of art is curated in ways that separate artists and audiences, because the experiences that are curated are defined by the experiences that are curated. In other words, if the museum becomes art, it has to be art experiences.And so, the biennial is a very important phenomenon in many ways. It is a cultural event, and it is a showcase of different kinds of art being made, presented, and experienced. But at the same time, it is an occasion for cultural mutilation and destruction.

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world. It is the largest global cultural phenomenon, and its simultaneous production, circulation, and reception brings with it different sorts of attention. It is an occasion on which artists create works for the occasion, and other artists come along and perform those works in as many places as possible. It is also an occasion on which archaeologists, historians, and aesthetes gather around and talk about what has been made. And it is an occasion on which politics, social commentary, and aesthetic movements converge.So there we are: the festival is a cultural phenomenon, the art events are political, the archaeological dig is an aesthetic event. The festival is a political act because it is simultaneously about the past and about the future. It has a historical character because it is perennial. It has a political character because it is global. It has a cultural character because it is intertwined with other cultural activities around the world. And it has a geographical character because it is a festival. But none of these things are absolute. The notion of the past is a more or less absolute concept.

The biennial is an event that occurs twice a year in many cities around the world.

It is a recurring visual narrative that requires no fixed position in time. It is a story that requires no fixed position in space. It is a story that requires no fixed position in time. It is a story that depends on many different factors at once. It is a story that is, in its own way, historically contingent. It is a story that is, in turn, aesthetically non-existent in its modern form.This is what biennials do best: create and demand attention. And, as event after event proceeds in various cities around the world, the biennial produces periodic aesthetic experiences that demand no immediate response. Biennials are art events that demand perception, and perception is defined as action. And, as artists and artists-organisations, we’re continually made aware that our own work, our own work alone is sufficient to read the larger cultural context. The work of a curator or an organisation is only as good as the people who actually come to see what we</text>

The significance of this kind of symbolic circulation cannot be overstated. The annual to mid-level register in the biennial, for example, is a key point in the exhibitionary complex. It registers the public’s expectations, and the expectations of art professionals, and it maps those professionals’s activities. The expectations of the art professionals, in turn, are the standards that shape the art practice of the biennial. The registerable world is a world where art can be experienced as art’s own possibilities, where art can emerge as a result of events beyond the control of convention, and where art can be made beyond the control of museum administrators.The key is understanding the biennial as an evolving and dynamic entity. The exhibitionary complex is a tightly controlled space, and the biennial as such is constantly on the point of undergoing a dynamic phase of experimentation and change. The art professionals in the biennial complex know that their work will be judged on its own merits, and not on the authority or merits of the museums it is exhibited in. This is why, every time a biennial is catalogued, its title is a maximally surveilled and maximised version of the maxim ‘Be you</text>

The significance of this kind of symbolic circulation cannot be overstated. The annual to mid-level register in the biennial, for example, is a key point in the exhibitionary complex. It registers the public’s expectations, both ideological and actual. When Biennial 2006 opened, the catalogue read: a mixture of historical texts and extracts from the oral histories of some of the original members of the Panel of Inquiry. It was a response to the events of 9/11, and the failure of US policy. The key figures from the 9/11 Commission, Philip Agee, Lee Hamilton, Peter Weibel, Mike Carlin and Steven Erikson, as well as former secretaries of state and members of Congress, were among the contributors to the text. The text, by itself, is not a museum piece, though it should rank as one of the most important works of the twenty-first century. Rather, the book (and the accompanying magazine, pdf) is a document that documents the events as they occurred on 9/11, casting light on the possible reasons for which these ideas might have been formed. The text is a set of actions, and the actions themselves are constructed (often consciously) from historical narratives</text>

It registers the public’s expectations, and the expectations of art professionals and the public at large. The expectations of art professionals and the public, along with the art being produced in the area, shape the form and content of the biennial itself. In doing so, the biennial creates its own temporal logic. It is a transnational, global phenomenon. Art’s own relationship to the city, and to a particular historical and spatial setting, is a function of this historical and dynamic context. In other words, the biennial is not just an exhibitionary form, but depends on a historical and globalised historical and social context. The biennial exhibition is not just an exhibitionary form, but depends on a historical and globalised historical and ‘cultural tourism’ programme, which is a globalised form of cultural tourism. This type of cultural tourism depends on the exchange of images; it depends on the exchange of ideas, knowledge and recommendations.

The significance of this kind of symbolic circulation cannot be overstated. The annual to mid-level register in the biennial, for example, is a key point in the exhibitionary complex. It registers the public’s expectations, and simultaneously creates and exploits their presence. The museum is the dominant cultural and social force shaping expectations and politics in the biennial’s social territory. If the museum is the dominant cultural and social force in the city, then the biennial must be a significant artistic and architectural achievement in its own right. Obviously, the biennial must add an element of commerce and modernism to the mix, and it is this element that led to the biennial’s popularity in the first place, since it is the dominant cultural force in the city at the moment of its creation. But the biennial is not just any cultural force. It is an artistic entity that has a political one as well as a social function. It is a museum of the present, present and future that documents the life and works of the contemporary artist and the social processes that shape and are shaped by that artist.

As the biennial unfolds, critical expectations about what is expected of it, and how such expectations can be met, are constantly being modified.2. Biennials as a series of parallel experiences. The history of the biennial in the United States follows the same general lines as those of the biennial in Liverpool, but with considerably different emphases. The biennial as an exhibitionary form in the United States began with the nineteenth-century movement of the  “found” and the  “first modern”. The idea of the modern and the museum began to derive from the discovery of American antiquities in the 1830s and 1840s, which were widely thought to be among the greatest collections of antiquities ever to be discovered. By the turn of the twentieth century, the European gaze was being drawn away from the North, and the museum was seen as an ideal repository for knowledge. The discovery of a new</text>

The significance of this kind of symbolic circulation cannot be overstated. The annual to mid-level register in the biennial, for example, is a key point in the exhibitionary complex. It registers the public’s expectations, their ‘real life’, and its unexpected colouring of the dynamic between art and commerce. The biennial needs to be responsive to the changing economic and social context of its host city, and to the vagaries of political, aesthetic and economic power. It also needs to be able to negotiate diverse cultural landscapes, within and without its adopted city. That seems a challenge in an exhibitionary complex, where power is concentrated. The Biennial has to work in all these dimensions, and with all these competing demands. It has to find a way to encompass all these competing demands in its curatorial agenda. This may mean responding to different kinds of economic, historical and urban context. It may mean creating its own form of the ‘international’. It may mean embracing all of these things, but it doesn’t need to. The real magic of the biennial is in its capacity to spread. The more it is exhibited, the more it is experienced.

At the same time, the museum is subject to the biennial as it unfolds. If the biennial is a response to the biennial, the museum is a series of parallel experiences. The significance of this kind of symbolic circulation cannot be overstated. The annual to mid-level register in the biennial, for example, is a key point in the exhibitionary complex. It registers the public’s expectations, and the expectations of others. It is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it is a mark of status, on the other it holds the promise of being consumed by greed. But the biennial must find a way to engage with both worlds. Otherwise, it becomes a museum, and a mark of the biennial, as different experiences. The museum is the mark of the biennial and the mark of its complexity. It is both a mark of the biennial’s success, and a mark of its failure.This double-edged sword is both symbolic and real. It is a mark of the biennial’s success, in that it registers the success of a cultural strategy that seeks to bring together disparate elements in a complex cultural context through a multi-level programme of activities (art, education, activism, politics, everyday life) while simultaneously carving out its own distinctive cultural edge. And it is a mark of the complexity of the contemporary world, in that</text>
    <text>The next Liverpool Biennial opened in 2006, but it was very different from the one in Biennial 2006. The main difference is that Liverpool Biennial held an open house, rather than a formal programme of exhibitions, which allowed the public to come and spend time in the exhibition spaces.

The significance of this kind of symbolic circulation cannot be overstated. The annual to mid-level register in the biennial, for example, is a key point in the exhibitionary complex. It registers the public’s expectations, and enables the biennial to meet them.‘Open House, Open Cup,’ is a way of thinking about how the museum is built, what it means to be a museum, and how this affects the biennial. The museum as a living organism becomes increasingly important as the biennial unfolds, because it provides the stage, and the living organism, while it is happening, provides the standard. In this sense, the museum has begun to look like a living organism, and the biennial is only the second half of that organism. If the biennial is to be a museum, it must deal with the living itself, and the museum as a museum becomes an increasingly important part of that process. The museum today is a very different kind of museum, and the biennial is only the first part of that process. The museum, in that seemingly simple but powerful way, became the object of critical study for the technological culture industry. It is only natural that biennials would want</text>

The significance of this kind of symbolic circulation cannot be overstated. The annual to mid-level register in the biennial, for example, is a key point in the exhibitionary complex. It registers the public’s expectations, and the expectations of others. There is a pressure to deliver, and the biennial has to meet those expectations. In the biennial, the biennial is the culmination of the various elements from the previous year, and the elements from the previous three years. So the register is a kind of a vault, and the elements that make up the biennial emerge from the elements from the previous three years – the elements that made up the previous register, and the elements that made up the present. And so the elements of the register that make up the biennial unfold in tandem with the elements of the biennial itself. And this kind of dynamic is very much what we hear in the words ‘annexation’ and ‘regeneration’, which is occurring at an increasingly rapid rate. In the words of Gregory Ulmer, who wrote the biography of William Shakespeare, ‘The acquisition of culture, or the concomitant proliferation of institutions and domestic forms over vast areas</text>

It registers the public’s expectations, which then shape the organisation’s activities. The expectation is that the expectations of the public will be met, and that the expectations of the museum will be fulfilled. In this sense, the museum is a double-edged sword. It can set the standard, and the expectations of the museum are often met, but at the same time, the expectations can clash with the museum’s actual practices. In the 1970s and 80s, the Venice Biennale was a perfect example of this kind of situation. The museum was often criticised for not offering enough exhibition space to meet the needs of the biennale, and also by the curators for not offering enough public time to engage with the exhibition. In the end, the museum was forced to make a mistake of prioritising over-allocation of space over what was best in the biennale. The Biennale opened early, was very successful, and was considered a classic example of art in major modern urban centres.</text>

How to come to terms with the fact that we are all but already extinct?How to imagine a different kind of planetary future? By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to stop being so damn stupid. This was partly due to the discovery of oil, which made it possible not just to build huge oil refineries in the form of new developments in the wake of desert decline, but to also shift the balance of technological innovation in the world economy through the sheer production of oil itself. The discovery of hydrogen and other basic elements enabled the construction of much larger and more energy-efficient power plants, along with much more energy-efficient cement production and packaging plants for the packaging of the building material and the finished product. These changes obviously had a huge impact on the landscape that was reshaped, and on the kinds of life that lived on those new planets. But it was due to the discovery of new elements that was humanity’s greatest salvation – not just in the sense that we could have stopped being so damn stupid in the first place, but that the vast expansion of life that was possible on such planets was actually possible. We didn’t invent the chemical formula</text>

How to come to terms with the fact that we are all but already extinct?How to imagine a different kind of planetary future? By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to become non-human in some fundamental way if we were ever going to hope to create a future that looked like Earth? And yet this wasn’t what most artists and writers in that period had in mind. What they were doing was evoking the possibility of a radically different future, one in which humanity was no longer the dominant species, in which things would be much simpler and humanity would play a much smaller but much more prominent role. And so we are led to believe that non-human animals have a place in our art and literature and in our consciousness. And perhaps this is part of our own gradual incorporation of consciousness into our everyday circumstances, as consciousness expands outward and outward and starts to include things and people that are no longer humans. Perhaps it is also part of our species’ growing consciousness of itself.It’s easy to paint non-human animals in a humanistic light. Animals have purposes, human beings do too. But non-human animals have motivations and emotions</text>

But today we’re much less certain about how to do that. The pace of technological innovation means that it’s easier to imagine a different future than it is to imagine a future at all; it’s no longer true that you have to be a part of a future in order to be a part of a future. This is why the film Contact famously ends with Jack Joyce declaring: ‘I do not exist.’Technology is making it possible to exist in many worlds at once, but it is also making it impossible to imagine a different future. This is what happens when the pace of change exceeds the capacity of the human imagination to cope with it. After the collapse of the Roman empire, for example, the human imagination struggled to cope with the massive changes that would be required in the wake of empire. In the wake of empire, we lost our capacity for criticality; we lost our capacity</text>

It’s the inability to conceive of a way of organising the world that would be more in touch with the concrete conditions of life on Earth.And so we move forwards, never quite knowing what kind of world we would make if we could actually do anything about it. And yet these questions are the very questions that humanity is asking itself in ever larger and more complex part of its planetary repertoire. How to figure out how to live together in harmony? How to come to terms with the fact that there are not going to be any more planet-sized versions of ourselves, but only of our species? How to come to terms with the fact that we are all but already extinct?How to imagine a different kind of planetary future? By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to become more creative at replicating itself in order to address the problem of the overshoot. In other words, the problem with which artists had to wrestle would have to be more creatively managed. In fact, the kind of imagination needed to tackle such a problem, the kind of imagination needed to generate imaginative solutions, was needed more than the kind of imagination required to analyse ecological damage. The kind of imagination needed to generate new planetary architectures was needed, and this kind of imagination was what the space race was all about.So we move forwards, and somehow or other, someway we manage to reach the kinds of future worlds that are possible in this new, more imaginative science. But these kinds of futures are not of a sort that we can build ourselves, or that our species could build itself. They are made up of many robots working together in cooperation to meet an agreed set of criteria. And so we move further away from the kind of future world that we actually want, towards the kind of future</text>

How to come to terms with the fact that we are all but already extinct?How to imagine a different kind of planetary future? By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to become much more powerful and adaptable to colonise other parts of the Solar System. And so we have come to understand that the future we want is less a destination in itself, but rather a point where we can start to develop creative ways of organising our futures in relation to one another. We might even want to develop creative ways of organising ourselves in relation to the geological past, in a way that would permit us to inhabit the planet in ways that would be unimaginable only a few decades earlier.But these are not utopian, ‘twas the start of something bigger and more dynamic, which humanity would do well to continue on. And so we are forced to confront the fact that our species is going to become what it is: only a few generations removed from being able to produce what it used to produce on a grand scale, on a world scale. We are going to have to stop being so attached to our planet and start living on it. If we want to preserve the species, we</text>

How to come to terms with the fact that we are all but already extinct?How to imagine a different kind of planetary future? By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to become much more evolved and much less susceptible to natural disasters and calamities. In fact, this kind of planetary evolution was essential to address the growing ecological crisis. But although this kind of planetary adaptation was essential to address the crisis, it was also the opposite: the very notion of adaptation meant actively participating in the crisis rather than passively observing it. The actions of the dominant species were designed to produce maximum ecological havoc, so participants in the systematised production of space and time could be expected to actively participate in its disruption. Meanwhile, the very notion of disruption implied a degree of mastery over space and time, so that the very notion of freedom implied a degree of mastery over life itself. In other words, the very notion of freedom implied certain capacities far beyond the capacities of any individual to be actively engaged in degrading the ecological integrity of the planet.In other words, the systematised production of space and time produces freedom in surprisingly large doses. It produces freedom in the sense that individuals have the</text>

By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to become less animalistic and more according to ecological principles. And so we started to do away with the animal in almost all its forms – including the animal consciousness – and started to develop our own forms of organisation around people and the world as a whole. But this kind of abstract organisation doesn’t exist in nature, and so we start to feel that we are still caught up in the chains of abstract organisation. And so we begin to develop abstract forms of our own organisation – abstract forms that are much more conscious and responsive to the needs of humanity than the abstract forms that we got from science. And so we start to develop these abstract forms of abstract organisation in peacetime, but also in wartime, and this is where the violence comes in. Abstract forms of war are much more responsive to the violence of the situation, and so we develop ideologies around such violence. And so we have wars now that are not really about abstract forms of organisation, but are actually about specific individuals or groups of individuals</text>

By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to become much more powerful and ambitious in order to exert any kind of influence on the planetary system. But in the twenty-first century, we’re not so sure about planetary systems. We think of systems as highly resourceful and intelligent, but also sensitive to the fragility of the biosphere and the fragility of the human species. We think that the biosphere is the planet’s Achilles Heel, the kind of thing that it’s worth saving only because we think it will last for thousands of years or even billions of years. And so we save what we can, hoping that the system will survive centuries of careful management, then we watch it fail. And then we watch it fail again, until it collapses again into the sea or into something else.And one of the things that we did with our money is we put it in bonds that we called Planetary Inequalities. These were bonds that people could buy and which could be redeemed at any time. And</text>

By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to become much more powerful and adapted to the technological revolutions that were about to change everything, and this meant industrialising all aspects of the planet. But this kind of industrialisation didn’t happen overnight, and neither did it happen without taking many more centuries. So we do still need to become much more clever and industrialising to produce what is now called a ‘planet’. But this kind of technological singularity isn’t inevitable, and it certainly isn’t inevitable for the next twenty years or so. And so we’re stuck in this situation where humanity is still largely made up of the dead, and where the techno-mathematical singularity is still somewhat fuzzy and precarious. This kind of technological singularity is also characterised by an explosion of new ideas and technologies that can be applied across a much wider geographical area and across much more systems of interacting components. This kind of technological singularity is the kind that is most easily imagined, and yet is</text>

By the late twentieth century, the answer to this kind of question was obvious: humanity would have to become much more technologically advanced in order to address the existential threats posed by technology. But today we’re not so sure about the limits of our own technological capability. We’ve become so dependent on the technological infrastructure that we actually start to reduce our threat perception. We don’t perceive the growing threat posed by climate change, for instance. And yet this kind of technological unemployment seems unavoidable in a growing world. We simply can’t seem to imagine a future without it.Our relationship to technology is a relationship that has certain definite limits. It’s this question of what can be trusted, and what is actually possible? And these kinds of relationships are a particular form of what Paul Ricoeur would call ‘technologieslinguistic fetishism’. This kind of relationship is a kind of fetishised form, and its practitioners are extraordinarily aware of this. The kind of thing that people do to each other, in an effort to be noticed, to</text>
