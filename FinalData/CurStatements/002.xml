Finally, the living document will become a ‘bibliographic record’, a kind of index to the ideas and processes that created the present and will tell the story of the place and its place in the world. This is the kind of record that can tell the story of the place in a way that is both powerful and tells it in a certain way. 	So far, so normalised and modernised. But what if the record were transcribed and made available online? What would be the potential impact on the story of the place and its place in the world, in the form of a document that is both the record of a meeting and a writing? What would that record be like? I think that is an interesting question, one that explores how biopolitics, or the integration of politics and culture, can and should intervene in the creation of new narratives. If the city is to retain its narrative, or inhabit some other space, or conjure up images of other places, or images of other cultures, then it is imperative that the city gives shape to these imaginaries. Otherwise, the fictity will be</text>

Finally, the living document will become a ‘bibliographic record’, a kind of index to the ideas and processes that created the artefact and how they were put into practice. It will record both the acknowledged and the denied existence of an idea, both the acknowledged and the denied objectives of activities. It will record, in short, what has been said, done and said by name, in writing and  	in every respect imaginable. It will record what has been said, said and done in the presence of representatives from the museum, the community and others, and it will be a record of that. 6. The act of making. 	Finally, the making of the Biennale can be categorised as an act of making. The guiding principle of the Biennale has been that of mutual aid. Each of the artists, curators, art administrators, artists, art historians, art society representatives, art dealers and others involved in the Biennale was expected to contribute something towards the formal production of the exhibition. All of them were expected to distill the idea into manageable parts, to produce a</text>

Finally, the living document will become a ‘bibliographic record’, a kind of index to the ideas and processes that created the project, making it possible to find the place and time that you are looking for, whatever the topic or the media. This kind of record will be useful not just in piecing together the parts that make up a project, but in piecing together the whole story. 	What is at Stake in This Context? 	When I started this project, in 2015, I knew that the English Defence League (EDL) would be a part of it. I also knew that at some point in my career, I would have to reckon with the EDL. So it came as a shock when, a year and a half into the project, the EDL launched an attack on the Tate Modern, in Woolwich, with a 30+ man lumberjack's gang. The EDL’s message was clear: you’re beyond belief. We’d do anything to achieve what you've got. The project began to unravel. The story started to unravel. I</text>

Finally, the living document will become a ‘bibliographic record’, a kind of index to the ideas and processes that created the artefact. It will record what was said at each step along the way, from proposal to production to archive. 	The Living Document 	[i] is a kind of index that will record, in the language of archival curating, the real causes and consequences of contemporary art. It will record, in addition to the curatorial record, the many informal and accidental exchanges that take place during and after the exhibition, and the curatorial record will tell the story of art through the narrative of the artefact.

It will allow those with a stake in the project to narrate the story through archival materials and archival forms, making the record a living document rather than a fossilised archive.

Finally, the living document will become a ‘bibliographic record’, a kind of index to the ideas and processes that created the project, putting it into historical perspective. It will record the meetings, the proposals, the feedback loops, and the dynamics of the project over time, as well as providing a kind of index to the place and time of the ideas, events and documents that formed the basis of the project. This kind of index would make it possible to find the place and time of the ideas, documents and objects – not by locating an item in a bound book, but by its mobility within and across time and space. This kind of index would make ideas and records visible, thereby enabling us to read between the lines and uncover hidden meanings and processes. It would allow us to see how the ideas and the ideas formed in relation to one another, and thus enable us to change and evolve our views and attitudes towards them. 	In the present curatorial and administrative climate in which we live and work, it is extremely important for art and cultural institutions to exist. It is as if there is only one time and</text>

Finally, the living document will become a ‘bibliographic record’, a kind of index to the ideas and processes that created the project, putting forward ideas to be incorporated in a future edition of the museum. 	As a proposal, this one sounds ambitious, even paranoid. As someone who had actively participated in creating the chapter at the back of the museum, the reference to a time and place, even if fictional, rings true. The indexing of time and place is an essential part of the fictionalised history of the twentieth century, and the museum has certainly taken an important step towards becoming that, even if some people in the room don’t agree with the decisions that have been made, such as the one to create a museum in Sunderland. 	But the indexing of time and place is only part of the fictionalised history of the twentieth century. The whole fictionalisation is done through the act of making things up, including the fictions that shape how we remember and understand history. A new generation of historians is needed, and soon, as the biennial draws ever nearer, to re-read</text>

Finally, the living document will become a ‘bibliographic record’, a kind of index to the ideas and processes that created the project, drawn from various archives and discovered by piecing disparate documents together. This kind of index will allow the museum to play this document from beginning to end, beginning to end, in order to create a narrative that reflects the current situation in the area.

It will record both the initiator and the final product, both the imagined and the actual. 	Such indices would offer a kind of performance of scientific, archival and historical research into a given situation, using the artefact as a platform to interrogate the status and legitimacy of power and ideas. They would also create a counter-narrative to the prevailing narrative of the situation, and of power dynamics in contemporary society, taking into account the different perspectives and narrators. 	Such is the  	intellectual engagement strategy for the 21st century. It is time to engage in another kind of research project, one that seeks to understand the social conditions and political situation that produced and were shaped by the artefact. The project should target people not just at the institution but also at a later date, when the conditions and stories around the artefact have been redefined and a</text>

It will be able to chart the way that ideas were chosen, the means adopted to implement them, the impacts on the communities that were created by those ideas and processes and so forth. 	At this point, perhaps it can be argued that the living document is a kind of surrogate, or that the data it gathers is both powerful and deceptive, enabling the museum to create what it describes as a ‘representative’ of its past, its present and future through what it calls a ‘representative writing’. But while the data can allow the writer to choose which aspects of the past she wishes to revisit and which she does not, it is ultimately the writer’s decision, as to which aspects of the past she wants to revisit and which she does not. 	The museum is aware that its present and future ‘representatives’ may differ from what</text>

It is currently curated by Vittorio Gregotti and includes works from more than 1,000 artists, over 1,000 curators, and over 200 public artists. Its mission statement ‘To celebrate the life and work of … insert artist’ represents a rare mix of priorities: as a curatorial statement, it provides a visual archive of sorts; as a cultural expression, it leads into deeper processes of change; and, finally, as an institutional repository, it serves as a site of action leading into something better.

Parkinson begins by describing a scene in a museum where a visitor’s guide reminds the audience a story from the museum. The story is a ‘trending’ section, and the gif’s use of a voiceover evokes the same sentiments as the caption: ‘We are part of a community of curators, journalists and artists making a difference.’[3] In a 2016 NPR interview, Sheryl Gay Stolberg speaks of her experiences curating The Resident, a non-fiction book on St Petersburg, which was written after the fact following the Russian Revolution.

[2] The blockades are a direct response to the urban sprawl and wasteful behaviour of some local authorities. In Liverpool, for example, development has outpaced construction for decades, while in Sheffield, new roads and bridges were being built in defiance of public opposition. The blockades are a direct response to this, and the building of new ways of living in places that are increasingly burdened by infrastructure. They’re a way to demand change without being forced to adopt it.

Their view is that the important work that they do every day is ‘untangled’ from the city’, and that what’s most needed is time to happen in and around the Biennial itself.’[2] Recent research on the built environment undertaken at the London School of Economics suggests that, absent major changes to the built environment, the Biennial could be replaced by a ‘compulsory inclusionary programme’.[3] The Biennial’s current charter, which was drawn up in 2014, stipulates that the art should be made accessible to citizens: ‘To make our Place shine, we’ll need artists, designers, writers and others with skills to translate a visual language of place and community into new forms.’[4] Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been conducting a major research project, Horizon: Art, Health and Politics, into the political and social dimensions of the built environment for a possible research project into the effects of a ‘negative equity model’.[5] Nina Edge</text>
    <text>a machine curated through the exhibition’s curatorial plan, offering an alternative to the built environment. The potential is there, however the implementation is often a struggle. The Blockades, near to each other, are two examples of how the built environment can ‘rest’ with the homeless. The challenge is to engage the public, both by meeting their needs and inspiring them with a vision of a future to come. This book aims to do both, providing a framework for collaborative dialogue through storytelling, research and analysis, and an accessible exploration of the built environment as a site for action. 	[1] Human-resource consultancy firm Towers Watson, who provided insights into Liverpool Biennial’s future plans, offers this assessment: &quot;The main takeaway is that the Biennial will be around for a while, but will eventually be replaced by something better. Their view is that the important work that they do every day is ‘untangled’ from the city’, and that newer, more technologically sophisticated ways of doing things are needed to accommodate the ever-growing online and mobile audiences. ‘Unplug’ is the operative phrase here. Unfortunately, the emphasis of their research has tended to be on things that can and do happen in and around the Biennial. In the future, perhaps, people will remember and talk about the Biennial that we did in Liverpool, and the many other in-depth and parallel research projects that they’ve supported and organised. But for now, this is more of a narrative that’s being told by the city itself, and by those who’ve been connected to the Biennial through the years.‘[2] Andersen, Johan.

She is currently Professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Alberta, Canada.Ira Glasson, a close friend and fellow artist, communicated his intention to participate in The Biennale through a series of public interventions in the newspapers, radio and television platforms. His first public intervention was in the Vancouver Sun, where he asked: ‘Can a biennale really change the world?’. His second was in the Toronto Star, where he asked: ‘Can a biennale change the world?’. His third was in the New York Times, where he asked: ‘Can a biennale change the world?’.His intervention in the Canadian national anthem is perhaps the most powerful and resonant. It is a re-figuring of an event that, until then, was nearly always seen as a nationalistic, ‘blue-riband’ event. It is an echo of an</text>

Despite this, the biennial would remain relevant in the years to come, as a critical and powerful tool for theorising and visualising the forms and processes of capitalist accumulation. Whitney’s Biennials of 1906 and 2008, to take an example, provided a critical lens through which to begin to imagine a future in which people actually live and work in the world that is not constrained by the latest pan of economic statistics, financial statements or real-time indices.

In these biennials, art was often presented as a response to colonialism and neo-liberalism, and its increasing global circulation and mobility – both via the sheer volume of artwork and the fact that artists were empowered to move freely across the global marketplace – as well as the more general effects of the economic transition that had begun to unfold in Europe during the 1920s. The exhibition of works from these biennials was frequently described as ‘an international ‘meeting’, with artists from all over the world contributing to a common heritage of art and culture. The term ‘biennial’ had been used by one of its many synonyms (syn)acclaimed senses (the manifest pattern of art in a particular country or region over and above the things that actually happen there), and whilst this is an apt description, the actual core of the biennial is anything but uniform or static. Its irregularities, the show-rooms, the irregularity of its financial situation, the irregularity of its style (its ‘triumphant’ ‘antiquity’), the irregularity of its presentation – these were all given a new lease of</text>

In these biennials, art was often presented as a response to colonialism and neo-liberalism, and its increasing global circulation and mobility – both via the sheer volume of artwork and the fact that most of these exhibitions took place in urban centres – as well as other forms of capitalist circulation. At the time, European cities dominated the artistic and curatorial imagination of the emerging field, which was being led by Nommo Deen, a Dutch artist, and his fellow Dutch artists Pieter Cohen and Joost Poort, both of whom were from the School of Visual Arts. Deen’s 1915 Amsterdam Biennale became the first major European city-based biennial to host a full-scale outdoor outdoor installation (compared to the confined confines of the museum), and his exhibition catalogue includes a number of paintings that were originally commissioned by the Dutch East India Company or by other commercial artists. Deen had a particular interest in the East India Company’s goals for its colonies in the new global economy, which he saw as parallel to those of the British Empire. Deen was especially interested in the burgeoning sectors of the economy dedicated to the production of art and decorative</text>

In these biennials, art was often presented as a response to colonialism and neo-liberalism, and its increasing global circulation and mobility – both via the sheer volume of artwork and the fact that the artworks became fixtures of both the present and the future – as well as the geopolitical and economic factors that could be considered as a consequence of the financial crisis and its aftermath. Whitney’s Biennials of 1906 and 2008, on the other hand, present the art as a response to the crisis of neoliberalism and its discontents. These multiple narratives of the artworks – those of art, artists, curators, collectors and consumers – help us to understand the contemporary art market and the complex web of interconnections that exists between institutions, commercial and non-commercial art, and the cultural, economic and political world around us. How art is made and acquired is a story that is rich in layers and contexts, and it is a story that we must tell – in order to understand it. This is why biennials continue to be around – they tell us something about the world around us, and thereby, in many cases, create opportunities for further inquiry and</text>
    <text>The next Whitney Biennial would be inspired by the Biennial’s current financial situation, which is beginning to resemble that of the early 1900s. Despite this, the biennial would remain relevant in the years to come, as a critical and powerful tool for theorising and visualising the forms and processes of capitalist accumulation. Whitney’s Biennials of 1906 and 2008, to take an example, provided a critical lens through which to begin to imagine a future in which people actually live and work in the world that is not constrained by the latest pan of economic statistics, financial statements or real-time indices. Whitney’s Biennials of both 1906 and 2008 provide a different perspective on the contemporary biennial form, considering the historical and contemporary circumstances of the biennial in a globalised and quantified society. In these biennials, art was often presented as a response to colonialism and neo-liberalism, and its increasing global circulation and mobility – both via the sheer volume of artwork and the fact that the artworks were often commissioned by and displayed at the highest levels of government, business, educational and civic bodies. The early twentieth century brought the global commercialisation of art and culture, and the political and economic entrenchment of these cultural forms in postcolonial and racialised settings. Through the latter half of the century, the biennial experienced a number of periodic and rapid market reforms that placed new media at the centre of exhibitions and the media discourse. Art is no longer restricted to the conditions of colonialism and neocolonialism, but is now a tool of globalisation and a main mode of circulation throughout the world. Whitney’s Biennial of 2006 was no exception to this general trend; although it did draw significant criticism for its globalised, consumer-obsessed exhibition format, the fact that it was also a major donor to the World Columbian Exposition, and its influential work in promoting biennials as an exhibitionary form, is testimony to this.

Whitney’s Biennials of 1906 and 2008, in turn, present a different perspective on the contemporary phenomenon from the one that the biennial has assumed since at least the mid-1990s. These biennials take their places alongside the likes of Tate Britain and Kunsthalle Zu?rich in the institutions of modern art, and become the main exhibitionary venues of the city. But they are distinguished from their contemporary counterparts, who are most interested in meeting artists’ requirements to be present for the biennale to continue. While the biennial exhibits a growing body of art from a given location, it is interested in the art of circulation, rather than in meeting the artist’s specific needs (although it is clear that the biennial has a market to serve in the future, rather than developing a biennial after 1906).</text>

The museum itself became a site of a range of interactions between artists and visitors, including the travels of the anthropologist Carolee Newson, who first documented the origins of cave paintings in the 1890s, and the American artist James Randi, who coined the concept in 1967. The exhibition format evolved as well, becoming shorter, more informal and more directly contextualised through the curatorial hand. The curatorial and art historian Amy Jacobs, in her writing on the museum and biennial, points to the fact that since the early 1990s, the biennial has been increasingly represented as a major exhibitionary form, and that the biennial has often been seen as a site of cultural exchange between cultures. Thus, the current biennial form is a function of exchanges between biennials, and their patrons, of culture exchange occurring between cultures. This view is emphasised in the</text>

In these biennials, art was often presented as a response to colonialism and neo-liberalism, and its increasing global circulation and mobility – both via the sheer volume of artwork and the fact that, since 2008, it has been increasingly common for artists to be operating from the positivity of financial profits. The twenty-first century is shaping up to be a critical and aesthetically stunningly beautiful one – but it is also shaping up to be a messy, even brutish one. That is, the art of the twenty-first century is likely to be much more like the art of the nineteenth century, much less like the art of the twentieth century. As biennials become ever more globalised, urban and debased, the conditions of contemporary art being made elsewhere in the world becomes increasingly important. But just as important is the fact that, in the age of the biennial, art is no longer confined to the confines of the city or even the nation state; it is globalised as well. That is, the art of the twenty-first century is likely to be much more like the art of the nineteenth century, much less like the art of the twentieth century</text>

Whitney’s Biennials of 1906 and 2008, on the other hand, present a more nuanced and expansive vision of the contemporary biennial form that takes into account contemporary cultural phenomena such as migration, urbanisation and urban crisis, while also highlighting the role of art as a mediator of these movements. In both biennials, art is often seen as a last resort, a last resort remedy, or at least as an art of the contingency. But what does it mean to make art contingently effective? What is meant by this in contemporary art? In this essay, I will attempt to define this concept in a general way, drawing on my own artistic practice and research, as well as the work of many others with a particularised and defined perspective. My aim is to show that there are other factors besides the artist, his or her audience, that also contribute to generating artistic value</text>

Whitney’s Biennials of 1906 and 2008, on the other hand, present a slightly different perspective on this global art market. These biennials are concerned with the potentially transformative effects of biennials on contemporary art and culture, and the places of art and culture where biennials can play this part well and badly.The first Biennale of the Arts was curated by and opened by Alfred Eisenstaedt as part of the then Concierge Hotel, New York. Eisenstaedt was not, however, the architect of the present convention, and his ideas on what he saw as the ‘right to the city’ were strongly influenced by Francis Fukuyama, Kurt Gödel, and others.

The museum was often cited as a catalyst for this global circulation and mobility, as the art museum became the global destination for most of the art’s artists. But this is misleading. The real role of the museum in the biennial form has been to collect, exchange, and display the art in ways that best suit the needs of the contemporary artist(s) and the institutions serving as his or her agents. It is this critical and varied role that the museum plays today, including in the form of its own exhibitionary format, which is restricted to a small number of sites and interests. There is a lack of appreciation for this critical and variable role of the museum today, which is often misrepresented. That history is written by a very specific generation of art college students in the early to mid-to-late 1960s is made more problematic by the fact that many of those students are now</text>

This is not to suggest that there were no alternative viewpoints to consider. It is to suggest that the perspective of the local architect, urbanist, designer and artist(s), as presented in the Biennale was representative of that of an urban citizen of the 21st century. 	In the years since the Biennale was initially presented, a new generation of urbanists and urbanists, including myself, has encouraged a return to the New Urban, a return to the ‘big, beautiful city’ as an alternative to the limited landscape construction of the past. These urbanists and urbanists, including myself, were primarily engaged with the post-industrial city, which was seen by them as one with huge potential, but which was also seen as a problem area, with limited solutions.</text>

In the intervening years, the Biennale has continued to field questions and pursue connections between art and economics. In 2016, it revitalised both its cultural and economic mission through the establishment of its own distinct offering, offered in several venues in the city. 	In this analysis, the Biennale is able to offer a precise and controllable snapshot of the city’s cultural landscape at a moment in time, in a given context, in an atmosphere of force and control. It is a significant event that can be captured and shared, analyzed and disseminated through social media, and embedded within an institution’s website.

However, in the decades that have later devolved into chronic homelessness, a sense of civic infrastructuralism is beginning to fail it. The emergence of alternative cultural models, ranging from ‘affecting very personal values’ to those based on equitable sharing of cultural resources, is a necessity in the current global city. The challenge for the coming years will be to craft a proposal that is both responsive to the city’s current needs (i.e. cultural resources) and that is not only sensitive to the contours of power dynamics in the city, but is also visionary and responsive to the particular needs and values of the local community. 	If there can be curatorial approaches to cultural production in the contemporary urban environment then there can also be ecological, ‘regeneration’ approaches. The challenge for this growing field is to find common ground on an understanding of shared values and interests, and to negotiate the idiosyncrasies of the contemporary urban environment in order to create possibilities for the future. Clearly, the curatorial is an essential part</text>

As a result of this critical ‘deep dive’ into the city’s economic and political context, a wider range of concerns are being raised by artists and the public. These concerns include (but are not limited to): poverty, displacement, pollution, housing, noise, traffic, toxic waste, cultural tourism, and much more. Artists, curators, and arts professionals are now engaging audiences ‘deep within' the city, and beyond its borders, in an effort to raise awareness and demand for a ‘better’ version of themselves in the city. 	The emergence of new media, urbanisation, social media, and biennials in general have democratised cultural practices.

However, in the decades that have later devolved into chronic homelessness, a sense of community is now increasingly understood as a necessity for long-term sustainability. The biennale has the capacity to create new ways of looking at the city, and the capacity to alter the fabric of how perceptions of the city are constructed. In this sense, the Biennale is experiencing a crisis of overproduction, but it is also experiencing a crisis of perception. The style and substance of the Biennale is deeply indebted to its time in Dublin, and this sense of historical authenticity is the legacy of the Biennale’s organisers, but its current orientation is being challenged by a combination of globalised capital and a consciousness of civic responsibility. The biennale must address the complex social factors that contributed to making the city it is now, and will be, based in. Otherwise, its current form and substance will remain a fiction. The question is, can the biennale be more than a transient set of transient conditions? This is a crucial question for the biennale</text>

At the same time, it seeks to chart a course between an economic future and a spatial one, but its realisation is another question. 	In the years that followed the launch of the Biennale, architects and designers from across the globe visited Cleveland. The question that remained open for over a decade was what would become of the architecture, and the city’s decision-making through planning processes that had as much to do with the Biennale as it did with any other. The question of what becomes of the city, and of architectural forms in particular, came to define the biennale’s trajectory. While there were other forces</text>

The established culture of the biennale is no longer viewed as the legitimate representative of the city’s cultural resources, and new modes of consumption are introduced into the public realm. Instead, a new consensus of global urbanisation is emerging, and cultures are being invented on the fly in an instant. 	 	In the same vein, contemporary art forms are being founded on the down-scaled of collections, rather than the up-scale of museums. This may be seen as a positive or an anti-capitalist development, depending on one’s point of view. 	 	Art is now often described as ‘collectable’ or ‘memento mori’ and its objects are frequently deployed as key components of a museum collection or even the basis of a city’s cultural economy. However, this description and the way in which art is produced</text>

And speaking of aesthetics, the article recounts the time Milan-based biennale artist Terry Gilliam spent two weeks exploring the aesthetics of the Palestinian territories: ‘[W]hen I took a trip to the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2002, I found myself drawn to the architecture and landscape of East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, which were then a landscape for contemplation.’ Gilliam’s thoughts on the trip were published in the New York Times that very same year.  And here we have another example of the subjective in aesthetic judgement. In the 1960 Venice Biennale, Giacometti assembled a team of artists from the city to create an experience entirely of his own. The artists, led by Carlo Lazzara, created what became known as ‘The Temple of Matins’, a literal translation of the Biblical structure, complete with a plaza dedicated to Matins, and a public plaza dedicated to Matins. Matins was the patron saint of the Jewish community in the city and the site was holy to both Christians and Muslims. The Biennale, which started in December 1960, was contested by the Christian Zionist movement, who staged a counter-experiment in Venice</text>

The article’s subject line is a riff on Jean Rhé'l’s character in the television show Charlie’s Angels: ‘You want to know about the art? I’m afraid to ask you a question, because I’m afraid you'll regret it…’ Art in America began as an online journal of sorts, chronicling the aesthetics, politics, and practices of Italian art from the 1960s. It would seem that the biennial in its current form is intimately tied to the internet.  And speaking of aesthetics, the article recounts the time Milan-based biennale artist Terry Gilliam spent two weeks exploring the aesthetics of the Palestinian territories: ‘[W]hen I took a trip to the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1977, I found myself drawn to the architecture and landscape of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which were rendered both handsome and impenetrable in my monochrome photographic negative.’ Unfortunately, the article doesn’t go into much detail about the areas, only noting that ‘The Silo, built in 1917, became a site for protest and in 1978 the commission to preserve the structures was abolished. Today, ‘The Silo is a complex used by energy companies, monitoring systems and critical infrastructure companies, and is home to over 1,000 employees’.  So while the Silo is monolithic and complete with its own distinctive look and feel, it is also a monument to an era when architecture, postcolonialism and the internet were intrinsically related. In other words, it is a historical artifact.  And perhaps the central idea of the article – that ‘the ubiquity of the biennial has normalized its role as a museum</text>

The places I visited were pre-Christian and the conflict between them and Israel. Afterwards I traveled to Gaza, Jordan and Bethlehem, where I stayed for two months with the Ramadhan Foundation’s Care for Palestinian Children.  And this is just the beginning. When Gilliam returned to the US in 1990, he found himself drawn into a tussle with the federal government over access to federal lands in Northern California. The conflict between the USFS and the National Park Service over how to use those lands became a major narrative in the media, with journalists digging into the politics of resource-based tourism.  And this is just the beginning. Over the course of several years, multiple articles about the conflict would be published, most notably in The New York Times, which portrayed the National Park Service as an ‘old army’ that was caught in a ‘</text>

The project was allegedly carried out by an Israeli military intelligence unit, but many other researchers and artists have come forward with similar allegations.  And speaking of claims, a former employee of Avanchnaya who goes by the handle ‘Pixies’ claims that she was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement after revealing that she was working on a project about the ‘Pixies’ in Gaza.

And as the war on ideas rages, so the visit to the places that inspire it is arranged: aesthetics is trumped by a larger war on ideas.  And this is to be expected, Libresco explains, given the current geopolitical situation: ‘If there’s a war going on in the Arab region, then one of the first tasks is to figure out where the other is going. And as a geopolitical researcher, my job has been helping the US and Israeli governments figure</text>

Then there’s the ‘othering’ factor: the fact that the biennale is often, but not always, presented as a ‘primary’ exhibition, or a ‘leading’ one at that.’ The article ends with a touching anecdote about a visit to the Biennale by a Palestinian art collector who offered to buy the rights to the areas ‘for “exotic” purposes’, but the writer’s characterization of the encounter is as apocalyptic as the biennial’s actual form.  The article is full of admiring descriptions of Gilliam’s art, but its primary object of admiration is a sculpture that appears to be built on a false foundation: ‘[W]</text>

The question ‘Do you still recognise the city as a city?’ seems to encapsulate the city’s contradictory and contradictory act of recognising and revelling in the presence of the Jewish people, while simultaneously denying and containing the memory of the Palestinian people in the city. The article is a meditation on the politics of identity and displacement created by the advent of the modern city, and its resulting economic, political, and social impacts. It is</text>

And on a personal level, it’s a statement about the impossibility of ever truly knowing one’s true self.’[1] In the years since its publication, the article has been republished several times, most famously in the 2014 issue of New York magazine when it was reprinted alongside a cover story by Gabrielle Roybal on the pages of the biennale website. The piece is short and sweet, and conveys the frustrations and joys of being a visitor to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It is also short on specifics, but relays some of the reader’s fears and frustrations.

The encampment is now a nightmarish tourist attraction in its own right, a twisted monument to the Israeli occupation of Palestine that draws tens of thousands of visitors a year. The article ends with a tantalising suggestion that perhaps the biennial may not only be able to trace its aesthetic origins to the intifada, but may also be able to capitalize on the political, economic and migratory processes that accompanied it.

The biennial has undergone another form factor in the form of the social, or collective experience, in which the museum is one of many experiences that can be quantified and captured and shared. In the social (comparative) sense, individuals and groups of people form and engage with one another, drawing on shared cultural experiences and identifiers.

    The next Whitney Biennial, which started in 2015, was an attempt to recapture the magic of the first one, but with major curatorial intervention. Despite its many innovations (the Whitney Museum of American Art is named in its honor, for example) this version of the Biennial never quite recaptured the magic of the first one, which it introduced into the mainstream. The new museum was built on the elements that had been there all along, but which at this point were experiencing a major repurposing due to the museums in their city. The biennial is a museum, in other words, which is simultaneously (1) a repository and a disused gallery. It exhibits both the art and the disuse of the place, but also exhibits the art and the disuse of time – time spent in art, but also that which is (re)created and is spent in museums.

It exhibits both the art and the time that has been spent in that place, but also exhibits the art and the time that has not. This is important in this analysis, because the museum as we know it today is built on the collection of both the past and the future, and the exhibition of the museum as a collection of past and future art is a dual medium that is both present and interrogative. The museum is the place to be found in order to be interrogated. This double meaning of the museum as past and the museum as future is crucial for the biennial as a project conceived and designed by the Whitney Museum of American Art. It is also critical for what the biennial commission might mean in the future, because, as the biennial commission itself acknowledges, the museum as a material medium has become the primary material medium of the new ‘collectivism’. This is evident in the exhibition catalogue of the 2016 Biennale of Sydney, in which material and social indices are prominent, but also in the collection of the forthcoming 5th Jersey Shore Collection, an object-collection that assembles</text>

It exhibits both the art and the time that has been spent in that place, but also exhibits the art and the time that is (re)created and is spent elsewhere. And here we see the crucial difference between the curatorial intervention of the first and the curatorial intervention of the second Whitney Biennial. In the first biennial, the curatorial role was largely defined by its ability to connect with the artists and the audience. In the second biennial, the role is defined by its ability to shape perceptions and, in that sense, imagination. The opening of the Whitney Museum of American Art (2016) and its accompanying series of public programs demonstrate how important it is to have the capacity to engage the audience and generate positive perceptions of the place, while also demonstrating that the curatorial role has moved on.

This is one way of reading the new biennial. It exhibits both the art and the time that has been spent in that place, but also exhibits the art and the time that is (re)created or (re)used elsewhere. It is a museum of disuse, but also a museum of possession. These are, in short, two fundamentally different forms of the biennial. In its current incarnation, the Biennial is a transient exhibition venue, exhibiting relatively static work in an ever-expanding, permanent collection, much like many other contemporary artworlds. It is the contemporary successor of the curatorial transference of power, a precursory to the permanent curatorial transference of power. It is a museum of possession, but also a museum of liberation.In its current incarnation, the Biennial exhibits relatively static work in an ever-expanding, permanent collection, much like many other contemporary artworlds.

In this sense, the biennial could be seen as a deferred art project that, once it has been completed, can be stored, borrowed or, in the future, traded. A unique combination of institutional and curatorial intervention transformed this largely unused and under-utilized collection of buildings into what is now the Whitney Museum of American Art. Whitney Biennial 2015 opened on 14 and 15 May with exhibitions including the works already on display, but also included a reception and a students' centre, both located in and accessible through the galleries.Curatorial activities in the Biennial were led by Professors Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Daniel Coleman, as well as Kate Ellis, the artist and curator, who curated the permanent exhibition, and Professors Denise Schmandt and Nadine Pepin, the artists and educators.

Design Thinking at Work 	The new museum was then given a new curatorial direction, which incorporated (re)imagining the city in a number of different ways. These included (but were not limited to) the displacement of the museum as a function of commerce, the displacement of the museum as a function of history, the displacement of the museum as a function of science and technology, the displacement of the museum as a function of aesthetics, the displacement of the museum as a function of numbers, and the</text>

It is a museum that creates and embodies the spatial relations that exist between now and art in yet to come, but also one that preserves and creates those relations in the very present. This is perhaps what biennials accomplish. They preserve and create what is or becomes a museum through their temporal frames. If the museum is a stable form of art, then the biennial is a stable form of art during its development, making possible the very development of art contemporaneously with its own temporal frames. This is what biennials do best: they create and institutionalize what have, until now, been latent in the city. The Whitney Biennial opened in 2015, and will remain open until at least 2024.

It exhibits both the art and the time that has been spent in that place, but also exhibits the art and the time that is otherwise available to other museum types. The key to this second aspect is the concept of 'contemporary art’, which I will come to in a moment. The importance of this concept, and its ability to map real-life events into figurative art, is what allows the contemporary biennial to connect art and life, and what allows it to survive even as art is displaced or destroyed in the city. There are many forms of this kind of ‘contemporary art’, but the important thing is that it is both real life and art, mixed and mingled. When I say ‘contemporary’, I don’t mean something pulled from a curator’s desk or a portfolio, but rather something that is constantly evolving and new, something that is constantly emerging from the murk and the past, and which thus has to be reckoned with, valued and understood in order to be taken seriously. What is socially constructed as being contemporary is in fact</text>

In that respect, it shares much with the biennial in that it is both a museum and a disused gallery. At the same time, it exhibits both the time and the art that are produced or made in the place, yet it also exhibits the time and the art that are produced elsewhere. This is the ambivalent quality of the biennial in its relation to its host city: it exhibits the art and the time that is produced in that city, but it also exhibits the time and the art that is made elsewhere. The question here is whether the biennial can achieve this ‘time-likelihood’ in its own right, or whether it must take into consideration the contemporaneous political, economic and cultural conditions in order to achieve the desired effect.

It exhibits both the art and the disuse of the place, but also exhibits the art and the disuse of time – time spent in art, but also that which is (re)created and is spent in museums. It exhibits both the art and the time that has been spent in that place, but also exhibits the art and the time that is not art. The aim of the Whitney Biennial is to exhibit a specified artworks at a specified time (in any order). In the case of an artist's entire exhibition, that time is the year 2020. In other words, the biennial is both a museum and a time capsule. It records exactly what has happened in that place over the past twenty years, yet it also retains its own sense of time (by this I mean its own independent temporal characteristics). The Whitney Biennial started in 2015 and will end in 2017. It is a museum that continuously records what it has to show (in any order), yet it also preserves its own sense of time (by this I mean its own independent spatial characteristics). The new museum, the second largest in the United States, will be able to house all that the first one contained, but it will also exhibit many of the same artists' original works – including some that have been shown at the museum but not at the new museum</text>

These letters show a talented and articulate young environmentalist coming to terms with the loss of innocence and wonderment that had been engendered by the environmental movement. These young people were coming out of the wake of post-traumatic stress disorder, where their parents had been killed, and their sense of loss combined with the destructive effects of the environmental devastation to which they and their communities were subject. The tone in these letters is unexpectedly tender and empathetic. The subject line ‘My Old Pet Shop – My Darling Garden’ has been replaced by a more dogmatic ‘Darling Garden’ – a description that perfectly captures the essence of the new thinking about urban regeneration being instilled in these young people. The introduction of pet-friendly policies and the relaxed‑looking institutionalisation of nature is also a hallmark of the era. But these are not radical ideas in their intent. They are the thinking of a generation raised on a diet of environmentalism and cultural tourism</text>

These letters, which I have transcribed and summarised for you, are a mixture of musings on the widely held idea that the environment is an inherently positive (relevance to humans) and a diverse set of concerns. Many of the concerns here are personal, and address issues that arise when encountering new ways of living in a particular environment: scarcity of food, water, energy, knowledge etc. In a way, however, the phrase is symptomatic of a broader tendency towards a dehumanising effect in the environmental discourse, one that has recently resurfaced following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States.The New York Times, December 11, 1967, p. 3.Download this article as PDFIn my years of teaching and research at the National Park Service, I came across several cases in which people were asking the same set of questions over and over again.

These letters form the basis for my new book, about which forthcoming essays will investigate the relationship between the ecological movement and the civil rights movement. The collection of letters was written by Claire Bishop, a writer and artist, and John Graham Kerr, a writer and artist. They are the only two people to have ever written to or via an EPA office. The others either contributed anonymously or were not able to respond to the correspondence due to time and distance.The letters were written as part of a project, ‘Signal Tower’, that I was conducting in response to the threat posed by nuclear weapons. The project was undertaken in early 1946. It was an amazing experience to read these words on a first day of work:  	[…]there was such a sense of foreboding as to me and my fellow artists, artists, workers and thinkers. ‘Could we really be headed for a nuclear holocaust?’ </text>

Some of the letters were written after I'd first encountered the name, but a great many are from before. Abercrombie was a name you'd never expect to find in a Tom Wolfe novel. But, as you can imagine, the environmental literature wasn’t always so black and white. A few years after I'd first encountered Wolfe, a friend had mentioned that he was writing a book about the environmental movement. I suggested that the two parallel worlds might be kind of similar in some ways, but different in others. And, of course, there was the question of where the line should be drawn. In the case of Tom Wolfe, the line was drawn pretty far out into the open. After that initial shock, I began to readjust my expectations.Abercrombie, Toward a Geology of Imagination.

These letters, which I have transcribed and quoted verbatim from several places, reveal a diversity of perspectives on the meaning of activism. The voices in these letters are as diverse as the movements they identify with.These activists, and the journals that accompanied them, are articulate, provocative and often angry. Their rage and their frustration is palpable and their purposeful. Their hope and their method are equally apparent in the pages that follow. Their task is to offer a language for understanding and a platform for resistance. My translation of these activists and scholars is a privilege and a source of pride. The task is not to render an ideology or a set of beliefs aligning with those activists or scholars' own. Rather, our task is to offer a shared language for understanding and freedom from oppression, and to help others arrive at that understanding.For me, in my work as an artist and my writing, this has meant creating spaces for</text>

She is quoted as having said: ‘I had hoped that the environmental movement would help me to lead a comfortable existence. I have to say though, that the environmental movement is becoming increasingly obvious: there are more and more of us who understand that the struggle is not just for our clothes, but for the future of the planet.’[6] And another from Ruth Marcus, a New York-based writer and activist: ‘It was not possible for me to imagine a future without environmental struggles.

These letters, which were initially published in the Times Literary Supplement under the headline 'Wild West' but were republished in the Times Literary Supplement in 1971, are a mixture of personal reflections, environmental diatribes and philosophical reflections. They are written from a West Virginia landscape that is as fertile as any, but with a distinct ‘wild west’ twist. The letters are addressed to the sound of the land breaking apart beneath their feet. The sound of the landmasses of the West being pulled apart and scattered is heard throughout the letter, but the stress is placed on the separation of power and property. The letter opens with an environmental diatribe against what the writer calls the ‘wild West’ – a movement, the letter claims, that endangers the planet and feeds into the ambitions of wild men.

The exhibition will be a ‘window on the city’ that will allow visitors to ‘perceive and simulate the urban landscape’ through architectural renderings and fictional works. The exhibition’s title and mission subtly reference the need to simulate urban environments in order to explore the political, economic and aesthetic imperatives driving the process. The exhibition will draw upon the conference’s theme of ‘reconstituting the city’ in order to confront the politics of destruction and displacement caused by a developed city.

In recent years, the forum has staged numerous research-based events, including a recent ‘research summit’ at Johns Hopkins University, a two-day ‘Institute’ research summit in Washington, and a symposium in New York.  A public forum could potentially provide the required political and cultural change, displacing the current situation of assumed global urbanity.

They are occasions when ideas are exchanged and ideas exchanged are made visible. The forum will be a place to ‘reproduce the bargains of urbanity’. The avatar of the biennial will be a building that represents the social and economic transformations that have taken place since the end of the 1990s. It will serve as a catalyst for further social and economic transformation, and to some extent a place of exchange between rich and poor people. The biennial’s apparent fixation on spectacle and non-representational forms of social and economic exchange will, no doubt, be a source of much frustration for those who inhabit the city.

The forum will be a place to ask and to be invited to participate in a research project. The research project may be a ‘presence’, as in street vernacular street vernacular, or it may be an ‘institution’, as in biennials.

    <text>The next Biennial, planned for late 2018 to early 2019, will focus on the city’s rapidly changing urban landscape. The exhibition will be a ‘window on the city’ that will allow visitors to ‘perceive and simulate the urban landscape’ through architectural renderings and fictional works. The exhibition’s title and mission subtly reference the need to simulate urban environments in order to explore the political, economic and aesthetic imperatives driving the process. The exhibition will draw upon the conference’s theme of ‘reconstituting the city’ in order to confront the politics of destruction and displacement caused by a developed city. The project will be an invitation to a ‘public conversation’ about the limits and possibilities of urban existence for the future. There will be special emphasis on the work of design and architecture duo The Forum, who will produce aesthetically oriented documentation of their work from the conference. The forum will provide a space for the discussion of ideas, research and creative work in a collaborative and participatory manner. The biennial will be a place to share knowledge, make new ones, and engage in a public dialogue about the future of the city. How to Know About a Coming Crisis of the City (2018)At the end of 2015, I participated in the Liverpool Biennial s one-day, public symposium, ‘Know Palestine’, organised by Liverpool Biennial and Museum of Contemporary Art (L/MA).  Knowing Palestine: Israel and Palestine, written as an exhibit, introduced several new ideas and perspectives into the discussion of Palestine in the West. During the symposium, I reflected on my experiences as an Israeli-American in the US and Israel, and on the limits and identities of understanding and communication in this context. I also spoke about the experiences of my mother, a Palestinian-American writer and activist.  In the weeks leading up to the symposium, I organized a series of sessions at L/MA called ‘C</text>

The biennial format is strongly influenced by symposiums, which essentially bring together different ideas from different presentations to offer a common ground of exchange and a forum for debate. The Forum project will engage in a symposium format with a public debate around an idea or a process, while the curator’s project will employ a biannual or periodic format whereby a curatorial statement or a curatorial intervention may be introduced at any point along the way. The biennial format is also closely related to other curatorial statements or initiatives, including those related with the exhibition of the same form in a museum or a special exhibition space. It is a good example of a curatorial conceptually introducing a topic to a broader context or public audience. In an overview of the biennial format, curatorial historian Douglas Coupland describes it as follows: ‘The biennial is a curatorial event that develops over decades, often in coordination with other events in the</text>

The forum will provide a space for the discussion of ideas, research and creative works of architecture and urbanity. It will also present relevant works from the conference, in an ongoing series of installation and decorative work that seek to redefine the parameters and capacities of urbanity. The Forum is a ‘turning point in the history of urbanity’. It ushered in a new era of urbanisation for many cities, as well as sparking a cultural revolution that continues to this day. This incarnation of the Biennial is no longer interested in exploring the past or bringing contemporary art back to the social. Instead, the Biennial weaves together the past, present and future in the pursuit of a better future. The official conference’s agenda now includes the task of imagining a better future for the city – a task that seems hopeless in the face of the ever-growing crises of homelessness, housing and poverty.

The Biennial organised an exhibition of their works in the main exhibition venue, the RCA Jubilee Arts Building, alongside a series of events including performances, tours, lectures and workshops in venues including the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate Modern. This project was part of a wider exhibition of artist-led collaborative projects in the Jubilee Arts Building. The JCB wanted to work with artists who were passionate about the environment, but also understood that their projects also needed to be sustainable. So they invited artists to explore the idea of Ingesting Old Doha, an ancient vegetable that is believed to have medicinal properties. This event was part of the Liverpool Biennial 2018 program, ‘A Little History of Doha’, and featured works by several artists including: Meehan Crist, Renee Zilker, Simone Jha, Wendy Harpe, Laura Poon, Laura Lamy, Ella Gibbs and Jussi</text>

The work was part of the Roger Williams/Turner Photography Prize 2018.A few years after Ken’s installation was commissioned, the Biennial opened for business, and with it, a wave of negative responses. In 2015, the Biennial was criticised for making a political statement by donating £10 million to a UK climate change research organisation. In 2016, a petition calling for the Biennial to withdraw its support for the research project was initiated, and in 2017, a public backlash against the project was launched, with artists, curators, researchers and activists taking to the streets in protest.A year later, the Biennial reopened after a year of renovations, and the</text>

The Biennial was invited to participate in a competition for public funding to create a new work of contemporary art in an existing building. The artist was able to carry this out by commissioning artists to undertake the installation and then fundinging the artists’ work through a private donation. The Biennial was also able to carry out a cultural heritage conservation project in an existing building and create a new work of art in that building. These projects are listed in the book Assemblages of Culture, as a ‘back story’ in the wider story of the city.Following the installation, artists and arts organisations staged a series of ‘What if…?’ sessions in the venue to ask, ‘What if the biennial was allowed to respond to our needs and wants?’ The idea was to create a new context within which artists and arts could work collaboratively to change the city, as we both wanted to change the city.

It has curated numerous exhibitions and has published internationally renowned biennials such as: Walking Towards Victory, David Hockney, The New York Times, London Express and The Washington Post. In 2018, it was shortlisted for the Turner Prize, given to an artist whose work contributes to the conversation on the role art should play.The Biennial was founded on the premise that art should inhabit a world. It was not until the mid-1990s that the Turner and his collaborators began to explore an alternative world - a world in which art and artists actually interact. The mid-1990s was a turning point in the Biennial’s history, in that it ushered in a new generation of artists who worked with artists and institutions to explore alternative perspectives and engage with the notion that art and art institutions could co-exist.

The Biennial was founded in 1903 and is the oldest arts institution in the UK. It is a multi-purpose cultural institution with a permanent collection of art, objects and resources supporting its permanent collection program – a unique combination of art institutions, an arts education and a cultural centre committed to supporting creative activity through arts education and cultural activities. The Biennial has a long-term commitment to its collection programs and resources. It is the international partner of the Turner Contemporary Arts Centre, a globally recognized arts institution, and has been a partner of the gallery MICA for over twenty years.The Biennial 2018/19 program will include a number of collaborative projects with the Turner Contemporary Arts Centre, including: ‘Work From Home’ a work from the Turner Contemporary Arts Centre that integrates art, home, gardening, community and agriculture practices; ‘Go Green International’ a global initiative to push green building and sustainable development issues through art projects; ‘Sofía Futuna International’s �</text>

The Biennial was one of five art institutions selected by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to be supported by a new arts organisation, Arts Council England, which would develop original projects across arts and heritage sectors. The other institutions were selected through a competitive process including the National Museums Liverpool and the Biennial of Arts and Design, founded in 2017 by Arts Council England and the Biennial of Contemporary Art, formerly the Tate Modern.The new organisations will support their arts missions in a way that was not affected by political or social opposition. They will also provide innovative configurations of art and cultural organisations, such as the Biennial of Arts and Design, that can work effectively across different contexts and be relevant to different situations. For example, the new organisations will create opportunities for artists to work with local communities through projects in which they will share expertise and values. The challenge for the next generation of artists and arts organisations is to create frameworks through which they can exist in radically new contexts, and to do</text>

The Biennial 2018 will be located in the historic site of the former General Motors assembly plant, where the auto parts factory once stood. The Biennial 2018 will feature a number of works by artists and organisations engaged with the protection of the environment and the social integration of people and the planet. These activities will be framed through a series of conversations with scientists and engineering experts, with a particular focus on topics relating to climate change and disruption. The artist and the scientific experts will operate in parallel, drawing audiences away from the work in order to consider how art and science may work in complementary ways. The answer to this question is a question mark, because art and science have different purposes and different modes of engagement. The aim of art and science will always be in conflict with one another, but the mode of the Biennial will shift as the situation demands it, depending on the needs of the biennial as an institution and the needs of the artists, curators and curators who will take part in the discussions</text>

The Biennial was invited to undertake a more in-depth survey of its own history and present political situation in the UK. Ken’s idea was to engage the artist in a conversation with the gallery in which the political and social landscape of the UK was made visible. His intention was to show a range of artists, including new and established artists, who regularly performed in the Biennial, but also artists from the past, who were active in the Biennial in the 1980s and 1990s. The project was also to engage artists from other disciplines with the idea of the political. The artist and his team knew that the project would need to be accessible to a wider audience to engage a broader range of people. For this reason, they selected artists from different disciplines who might be interested in the history and present political situation of the UK, including those with a direct or indirect connection to the political situation in the UK. For this project, the artists were selected from a shortlist of artists and organisations</text>

The Biennial was founded in 1897 and is part of the Tate Gallery. It is a major arts institution with a predominantly theatrical mission. It was established to explore the arts in a public context and to foster a dialogue with the communities that compose it. It has undertaken a public engagement programme over the years that has sought to engage with communities through events such as meetings with local authorities, artists’ studio visits and community gardens. Biennials have a critical place in this public discourse because they are the only form of cultural organisation capable of standing up to dominant social forces and expressing legitimate demands. In a society that increasingly engages with social media and peer pressure, its factual content is often disregarded or downplayed in order to more easily engage with social media feeds and peer pressure. The narrative that emerges from such media is frequently conditioned by social media feeds and peer pressure. For example, in the 1990s when the social networking era was at its height, the narrative around social engagement was conditioned by media that regularly</text>

It was invited to be a part of the 2018 edition of the Liverpool Biennial, but chose to participate in the most recent edition instead. The Biennial produced a range of cultural activities around the event, including a series of performances and events around the streets of Liverpool, at venues including the Alexandra Palace, the Pyramid Theatre and the Bluecoat.A key agenda for the Biennial 2018 was to continue its tradition of providing a platform for artists to engage with and work through political, social and ecological issues through art. The main themes of the programme reflected the anxieties and injustices of our contemporary world, with a special focus on rural and urban decay. The artists and organisations that supported their art were invited to share their knowledge and expertise with the artists and organisations working on issues of</text>

Previous biennials have all been relocated to other cities, including Venice.While Venice remains the city in which most artists reside and is home to its major arts institutions, a growing number of artists are choosing to expand their exhibitionary portfolios elsewhere. Whitney Biennial 2016 is being curated by Elisa Atangana and Steven Cairns, and will involve seven curatorial approaches: curatorial approaches, practices, institutions, communities and communities (design and urban context). The exhibition will include a curated survey of the artist's varied practices, as well as an exploration of the practices and ideologies behind them. It will also introduce two new artists who are developing agendas and projects through research and/or gallery display.

For example, the curatorial approach for the project may be research-based, while the proposed practices and institutions may be curatorial approaches specific to the particular situation. The curatorial approaches may be distinguished by the fact that they are proposed by different staff members, chosen from different departments, with a mandate to deliver the event in a certain way, and thus, in the main, may have a very different effect on the condition of the community. For example, the research-based approaches may be specific to the locality and the individual, while the proposed institutions and their staff may be general exhibitions that set a particular agenda or theme. Also, the nature of the programme in each case may be different. For instance, the research-based programmes may focus specifically on the locality, while the proposed curatorial approaches may be broader in scope and may include other audiences as well. In this sense, the curatorial approaches may be considered to be ‘pure space’, while the other elements, especially the institutional</text>

In the case of a proposal of the same artworks to multiple events, the curatorial approach and the proposed approaches may be combined in a single exhibition. The curatorial approach and the proposed approaches may be based on the artist’s interests, values, needs, and priorities as an artist or curatorial approach, as well as the curatorial relationship itself. For example, the biennial may be a repository for the artist’s collective collection, while the proposed curatorial approach and the proposed approaches may be based on the artist’s interests, values, needs, and priorities as an artist or curatorial institution. These options allow the user to filter out or modify the undesirable, while providing the desirable or providing an authentic or unique experience.

Another example is the proposed partnership between the U.S. Postal Service and the Russian post office, which would combine the physical post offices of Venice with the social post offices of smaller cities in Russia. While the Russian post office plays a central role in the postal service in terms of infrastructure and distribution, its main role in the Russian post office is in the delivery of letters and packages. The proposed partnership would see the physical post offices in Venice and St Petersburg serve as nodes in a global network of post offices that would deliver letters and packages. The total number of post offices could be expanded to meet the demand for letters and packages from smaller cities in Russia and other regions. In addition, this proposal calls for the establishment of a regional headquarters for the post offices based in St Petersburg. The Russian post office would assume responsibility for the safety and security</text>

Previous biennials have all been relocated to other cities, including Venice.While Venice remains the city in which most artists reside and is home to its major arts institutions, a growing number of artists are choosing to expand their exhibitionary portfolios elsewhere. Whitney Biennial 2016 is being curated by Elisa Atangana and Steven Cairns, and will involve seven curatorial approaches: curatorial approaches, practices, institutions, communities and communities (design and urban context). The exhibition will include a curated survey of the artist's varied practices, as well as an exploration of the practices and ideologies behind them. It will also introduce two new artists who are developing agendas and projects through research and/or gallery display. The exhibition will place contemporary art within the context of its historical situation and future prospects. The curatorial approach and the proposed seven approaches proposed for the exhibition may be combined or isolated from one another. For example, curatorial approaches may focus on the artist as a member of a curatorial team or team, investigating the context and/or the process by which an artist can be embedded in a city or a community, while institutions, particularly those involved in public works, may employ a range of other approaches including, but not limited to, exhibitionary curating, grassroots curating, grassroots organising, and community design. The proposed curatorial approaches and their possible combinations may be found in the document ‘60 Years of Biennials’. Elisa Atangana and Steven Cairns both propose that the art institution become a facilitator of the community from the outset, while Elisa Atangana proposes a multi-tiered model of the artist’s centre that integrates gallery, school, community and grassroots components. Elisa Atangana’s model is complemented by her co-worker Elinor Landau, who proposes a model of a community college coupled with a</text>

The curatorial approach and the proposed seven approaches proposed for the exhibition may be combined or isolated from one another.

The proposed approaches may be distinguished on the basis of whether they are of a curatorial, a curatorial or a curatorial variety (i.e. whether they are urban, rural, international, historical, architectural, or typology-specific). The curatorial approach typically introduces a new art practice (e.g. a new museum, school of architecture, school of urban planning) or a set of practices that are distinctive to the biennial (e.g. a new curatorial medium, such as video, printmaking, public art, evental, performance, installation and so forth). The contemporary art biennial has increasingly come to be identified with the city, city environment, specifically the financial, technological and political aspects of urbanisation. Although these have played a role in the development of the biennial, a more fitting</text>

The curatorial approach and the proposed seven approaches proposed for the exhibition may be combined or isolated from one another. For example, the curatorial approach of the present curatorial body in Venice may be combined with that of the past curatorial body in New York or London. Curatorial approaches and their contexts may be developed through research and/or gallery display. Both curatorial and research curatorial approaches may be employed to consider art and art-related questions pertinent to the contemporary situation. In their own way, biennials can be seen as repositories for contemporary art, both original and curatorial-based. They may be seen as art objects, or they may be seen as art in transit. Elisa Atangana, Steven Cairns and Irit and Margret Saperstein are contributing artists to the curatorial team for the 2016 Biennale. Their collaborative research project, El Graal, began in 2014 and continues to this day. El Graal is an exhibition-making process that integrates theory, meta-methods, and ethnography into a single multi-disciplinary project. It is an art</text>

For example, the curatorial approach for the exhibition may focus on the curatorial role of the curator or the museum, while the proposed social curatorial approach may combine a space for discussion, reflection, production, and production of meaning through gallery display. In an effort to ensure that the proposed curatorial approach represents the city in a meaningful and dynamic way, or the other end of the spectrum, a new curatorial approach may be developed that takes into account the biennale as a whole, but also considers the specific curatorial approaches proposed by the artist, institution, and city. In this new curatorial approach, artists and curators are invited to propose alternative curatorial approaches to the same or a subset of the exhibition in a variety of formats and contexts. Each proposal must be accompanied by a working proposal draft that lays out the specific topics and proposals of the exhibition in a form that is both accessible and authentic to the subject matter being discussed.

The curatorial approach and the proposed seven approaches proposed for the exhibition may be combined or isolated from one another. For example, the curatorial approach for the exhibition may be present in a piecemeal fashion or it may be arranged in series that are part of a larger context of social, literary and political commentary. The proposed combination of curatorial approaches and their respective collections may be seen as an innovative way to consider contemporary art and artistic practices in a unified, topical way. The idea of the biennale may be seen as an expression of the potential of the overlapping and interrelatedness of various types of curatorial approaches and their differing registers of cultural value. The following examples illustrate the proposed combination of curatorial approaches and their respective collections: curatorial approaches, collections, ethnographies, biennials.

But they are also events that inquire further and reveal previously hidden or under-studied materialities. This is true of curatorial interventions in cultural exchange, which can be seen as �</text>

The curatorial approach and the proposed seven approaches proposed for the exhibition may be combined or isolated from one another. For example, the curatorial approach for the exhibition may be information-gathering and the proposal may be based on observation, while the other approaches may be curatorial and informational. In an ideal world, curatorial interaction between public and private space would be smooth and direct, based on the needs and interests of the communities most affected by the art’s performance, but in the US, this is not always possible due to the dominance of national art museums. The following seven approaches may be considered as an example of the possible combinations and relationships between curatorial observation and information gathering. The biennial is moving towards an information-gathering strategy, and this may be seen as a continuation of the historical curatorial tradition. The biennial may be seen as the image of the exhibition and its packaging, and the discoverer as the artist who produced, curated, curated again and so forth. The way in which information is gathered may be curatorial’s way of handling the mysteries of the cultural</text>

    The next Biennial will be held in Stockholm in 2017.

Gallery 54 will be no exception to this new ‘permanent gallery’ form, but will instead function almost like a temporary exhibition that is constantly (fixedly) shifting and subject to variable conditions and variables. Gallery 54 will not only be able to absorb these many different kinds of artworks into its curatorial wish-list, but it is expected to … well, grow. As a concept, it is expected to have some kind of defining moment, and to continue to be expanded and modified as new curatorial styles and experiences are invented and forged. But beyond this, it is expected that this new ‘permanent gallery’ form will define the very nature of the art that will be exhibited in it. And this is what curatorial remains of late the most relevant in this biennial context. There is a reason why modernist modernist contemporary artists were often drawn to these renovated sites, which were either retrofitted or rebuilt from the ground up</text>

This is the biennial format that has been developing for some years now, and it is one that is becoming ever more dependent on the biennial itself, which is becoming ever more complex, global and transient, and which increasingly lacks any real link to the city in which it is displayed. The ‘biennial’ itself is becoming ever more complex, global and transient, and the exhibitionary form that it served in the past is being displaced by something that is both artist-driven and data-driven. So the cultural tourism arm of the biennial is becoming ever more artist-centered, and the biennial as a specific form is becoming ever less relevant. The only thing that remains of the old ‘biennial’ is the occasional oddity like the Venice Biennale, which continues to court a very specific kind of art tourist, and the odd odd ‘monument’ that is the world as a whole. Meanwhile, the number of museum visits has also steadily declined over the years, and even in the last twenty years, the number of art collections checked out has tended to be quite a small percentage of the total.

This is the biennial format that has been developing for some years now, and it is one that is becoming ever more dependent on the biennial itself, which is becoming ever more complex, global and transient, and which increasingly lacks any real link to its birthplace and origin. The proposal was also that these kinds of ‘permanent galleries’ should exhibit work from the current political situation in a new way. That is, they should not merely catalogue what is happening in the world right now, but also think about possible futures and future directions. For example, a biennial like this one might catalogue next year’s Venice Biennale, but it might also catalogue a possible future with a democratically-planned immigration policy that puts economic growth above all else, and in this sense is really about the capacities of culturally-active times. In this proposal, the politics of migration has become integral to the cultural function of the biennial. What the biennial can and cannot is not limited to what is politically feasible for them to be. Biennials must also be cultural touchstones and stand out in order to be remembered and to draw in tourists. If they are to be truly cultural institutions, they must be cultural in their own right</text>

Gallery 54 will be no exception to this new ‘permanent’ gallery regime. Its independence will be tested in the ever-present question of how the art world will react to the ever-growing number of biennials. This new ‘permanent’ gallery will be no less vulnerable to the vagaries of globalisation and its various market forces, but it will nonetheless experience the inevitable contemporaneous dynamic of this evolving biennial, as it were. This ‘contemporaneous’ dynamic will make contemporary art ‘apparatus’ of a new world.’ This is the mode of historiography that is no longer dependent on a single institution or set of institutions, but is ultimately dependent on everything that is increasingly interconnected and globalised. Gallery 54 will be no exception to this new ‘contemporaneous’ gallery regime.Artworlds that emerged as a result of this biennial</text>

And now, even though this ‘permanent’ aspect of the biennial has become increasingly important, the biennial is no longer the dominant form in the world. There are other, more agile forms of cultural production emerging at a faster pace.The question that remains, however, is what can be done to facilitate the development of these other, more agile forms of cultural production? One obvious way to start would be to set up ‘curatorial councils’ – bodies of cultural experts who would set up collaborative agreements with other art institutions and artist-organisations to offer them support in different ways. Such bodies would offer a forum for exchanging skills and knowledge, offering alternative approaches to certain problems, and would enable wider exchange between art institutions and non-profit art organisations. Another approach is the use of crowdfunding – a form of artistic donations that are not tax deductible but are available to many artists and can be used for a variety of socially beneficial activities.</text>

The new ‘permanent gallery’ that will be created through the ‘biennial’ and ‘museo del passato’ – both of which I suggested might be rekindled by the emerging dynamics of the art market – will be a ‘permanent stock exchange’ with no intrinsic value, but will instead serve as a temporary high-end high-street venue for market-based transactions, where art-value will be realised through the exchange of culturally specificised commodities, but will also serve as a base for the future growth of socially and politically-engaged art-producing institutions. It will be a place where high-end collectors and art-dealers flock, art-dealers with minimal resources, and artists with minimal resources forced to cater to the whims of a rapidly urbanising public. It will be a place of the very real and very visible exchange of different commodities, but will also serve as a base for the</text>

This is the biennial format that has been developing for some years now, and it is one that is becoming ever more dependent on the biennial itself, which is becoming ever more complex, global and transient, and which increasingly lacks any real link to any particular place or time. Gallery 54 was conceived as a ‘time capsule’ – it preserves the historical episodic form, but it creates a new kind of ‘permanent gallery’ that responds to this episodic with a radically different kind of ‘time capsule’. The time capsule would open only at specified times – on specific days – and would be fully booked out, even though it displayed a number of works that were actually made within the biennial itself. Its form of ‘permanent gallery’ seems especially precarious in the age of biennials everywhere else. Gallery 54 will be no exception. It will be moved from the museum to the streets, from the museum to the district, from the museum to the street. It will stand in for the city, but it will also mirror the movement of people and places – not necessarily consciously, but always in an evolving and shifting manner. For instance, the museum will acquire ‘knowledge’</text>

The new museum-based ‘permanent’ gallery would make use of everything that is not contained within its walls, and would be a complete rendering of how art is produced and consumed in the contemporary world. It would lead to a new kind of ‘permanent’ gallery, one that would be able to exhibit works from the exhibition in a meaningful way, and would offer an alternative to the museum. This is the ‘biennial’ that operates through a curatorial wish-list and curatorial prescription. It is not art per se that creates interest, but the way art is produced and consumed in the contemporary world. The biennial creates its own form of art, and its own set of artists, writers, curators, curators and curators. Art biennials usually happen when there is a glut of it, as is currently the case, and thus become a kind of boom gate for new artworks to be discovered and appreciated.</text>

This is the biennial format that has been developing for some years now, and it is one that is becoming ever more dependent on the biennial itself, which is becoming ever more complex, global and transient, and which increasingly lacks any real link to its original form. The reasoning behind this change is that the artists and curators who are performing in these exhibitions are increasingly engaged in their own work, which requires less and less of the artist’s time and is therefore less able to invest in the art itself. This is true even though, as the exhibitionary form has spread, so too has the amount of time spent by artists and curators in their artworks, as curators increasingly demand of their venues a rich and varied performing arts experience. Gallery 54 will continue to draw artists and curators from all over the world, but it is certain that this will be seen as a biennale in itself, rather than, as the current biennial form requires, an international art exhibit that engages with the cultural linkages that exist between various parts of the world. In fact, the 2017 Biennale in Istanbul was organized in large part to coincide with the centenary of the Battle of Cable Street, the Battle of Cable Street</text>

In these times of increasing biennials, the gallery becomes ever more like a temporary marketplace where art is either bought or not bought, and the contemporary art world is either a parody or a satire on this increasingly complex exhibitionary form. Gallery 54 will be no exception to this trend, and it will be interesting to see how the various sections of the gallery react to this new ‘permanent’ market force. The exhibition catalogue for this biennial may form part of a future ‘curatorial action plan’ in which the gallery is constantly (re)programmed and amended in various ways. Gallery 54 may be a subtle way into this new ‘permanent’ market force, since the catalogue action plan will almost certainly be a ‘curatorial action plan’ – one that is largely based on repeat business – that is in turn deeply influenced by the museum and its collections. The localities, then,</text>

And yet, if we imagine ‘that same city’ through the fragmented and shifting images of the moment, and even though it’s happening now in Times Square, it’s not really happening then. It’s more that ‘that same city’ is constructed with codes that even though they may be executed with great skill and precision, fundamentally lack the character of writing and characterisation that enable us to read and understand such seemingly random images.’  This last characterisation, in turn, is one that futurists and artists alike struggle with. There are countless urban urban documents floating around these days that we can interpret as characterised by random images, but what characterises  	New York City in the 1990s, and in particular Times Square in the 1990s, is that image that appears over and over again: images of people engaging in</text>

Because, to me, futurism represents the possibility of new combinations of physical and moral forms, which includes no country or territory, no set of rules or set of values, no constitution or legal regime. Rather, it represents the possibility of ‘artificial’ human creativity in all its many guises, which I guess you could call ‘futurism’.  And so the ugly binary that computer programming creates images of, or represents, emerges: yes, I can do x, y, and z, but I can't create them, or rather, I can’t create anything that looks like they were made by humans, or at least not anything that looks like art.  And so</text>

When in position, the dish would fire lasers that cause massive distortions in light, creating distortions in the form of parallel universes where different points in time are simultaneously present.  The idea is that of course, there are other worlds out there, where people’s walking around, talking to each other, shopping and so on. But the main idea is that ‘every second, is a new world’.  So even though we’ve all heard of steam, which is an electrical process that creates electricity, and which many contemporary computer systems are also based on,  we don’t really understand what that really means.  And so the idea of futurism becomes even more opaque.  A futurist dream  To some, this may seem absurd. After all, we’ve all grown accustomed to the idea that there are ‘different worlds’ out there, where different people live and work and play and make art and so on. And although there may be other forms of dreaming, lucid dreaming and so on, there is no way to know what that other, more abstract form of dreaming would entail.  One could also say that there is no such thing as a ‘human imagination’; there is only ‘technological imagination’.  But there are other, more primitive forms of dreaming that we can understand.  One could also say that there is no such thing as a ‘species’; there are only ‘animalistic forms of dreaming’.  But this ignores the fundamental difference between the human and the animal: the human imagines the future, while the animalistic forms of dreaming actually exist only because we have evolved over millions of years. So the</text>

A futurist dream  To some, yes, the aesthetic of the distant future is one in which technology has liberated us from the constraints of human culture, and so we can unleash this technology not for profit but for the benefit of all humanity. But to others, and this includes a great many members of the scientific community at the time, the future is one in which machines rule the world and so we need to explore and master the technologies of this new world. And so the obsession with the machine and its potentialities overlaps with a general call to arms: ‘All men are created equal; look out, for the coming of a Terminator is near!’  as one of the first lines of the  	Terminator 2 script.  And so we move forward into the next century, or so we think, when a Terminator will show up and we’ll all be forced to choose between two incompatible futures. And we don’t yet know what that future will look like. We don�</text>

And so the idea of futurism becomes even more opaque.  A futurist dream  To some, it’s a clear and present metaphor, as if the technologies of today are inherently flawed and unable to envision a better future than are currently unfolding. To others, it’s an extremely abstract notion, one that derives from the bottomless pit of contemporary capitalism.  Either way, the bottom has to come out somewhere, and so we’ve all known that ‘futurism’ is at root a political and social movement. Its aim is to see technologically advanced societies founded upon principles of social reconciliation and ecological sustainability. And through its work, ‘futurism’ hopes to create a new equilibrium between humans and the technologies that shape them. But even if the bottom is found, there’s always that question mark: what if the bottom is rotten?  And so the story of  	indeterminacy continues to haunt us, whether we’re in the grip of that dreaded ‘metainterface’ or</text>

And so the idea of futurism becomes even more opaque.  A futurist dream  To some, this may even seem like magic. After all, if there are other worlds out there, why would we ever choose to visit them?  But for others, visiting those other worlds means coming face to face with the physical things – walking through those same streets, going to those same theatres, buying those same cars – that make up the real life. And so we enter into a category errorus: the misapprehension that something is real when in fact it is not.  And so we approach the problematic notion of what it means to be ‘present’ in the world.  And if we’re looking for the next Venice Biennale to explore this in more depth, we’ll probably have to start all over again every time.  And so we return to the question of what it means to be ‘present’ in a particular city.  And since we don’t know what that means yet, looking back at the history of</text>

After all, if something can ‘get us into space’ – presumably, this includes flights of fancy, too – then why should we have any qualms about getting sucked into a simulation?  And yet, there are other technological advances that have also to be reckoned with – advances that radically alter how we look at the world, or at least how we look at the future.  And so we’ve got to work, working away, dreaming up new worlds to inhabit, new technological possibilities to add to the existing architecture of the city, and then figuring out how to live in them.  This sounds trivial, but the challenge for artists and designers today is different from that of a few decades ago. Today, there’s an incredible amount of information available to anyone with access to a smartphone; just about anything can be created and consumed at will. And so the potential for artistic endeavors is enormous, both in terms of quantity and quality.</text>

And so the idea of futurism becomes even more opaque.  A futurist dream  To some, the concept of the future seems like a fantasy land where technology migrates at lightning speed, and where magic and science reign supreme. To others, like me, the notion of the future seems even more dystopian: full of zombies, fascism and ecological disaster.  So perhaps it can be argued that the object of our dreams is actually the same object that we use every day: the future.  And perhaps this is to some extent why so many futurists have a very dream-like or dystopian approach to the mundane – engaging in practices such as  	virtual reality or even  ‘phantasmagorical landscape construction’ to fabricate alternate realities.  As Daniel Coleman puts it, ‘a futurist vocabulary is an empty set of relations – a set of assumptions and predicates that can and should be challenged and discarded in the name of progress’.  So perhaps the problem with futurism is that it assumes that the problems of the everyday world are sol</text>

And so the idea of futurism becomes even more opaque.  A futurist dream  To some, futurism seems like a strange term that conjures up images of factories and factories of the future, in which individuals are cordoned off in small, enclosed spaces. To others, it signals the return to life of things not seen in human history, such as nature or folklore. Both images are critiques of the inhumane past that are being erased by techno-mathematical systems.  And so, we move from the futuristic (technological singularity) to the more manageable future (scarcity and abundance), to the imagined places of wonderment and epiphany of life beyond the city.  And so we continue our analysis of the effects of these new technologies, with particular attention to the work of preservationists. They’re credited with helping to save some of life’s most precious places, such as nature’s sites of wonder, from destruction.  And so we move from the future (when everything is connected) to the present (when everything is disconnected</text>

A futurist dream  To some, futurism seems like an exciting new way of looking at the future, in which sometimes big changes are necessary to make better future. But for others, like me, the future is black and white.  And so there’s a divide between those who dream big and those who actually live in the future.  And so we have to ask ourselves: do we actually want to live in the future or do we actually want to pretend that we don’t live in the future?  And if the latter, then we have to ask ourselves, how do we actually make the future we want?  Because if we don’t, then there’s no way to know what the future might be like, or whether or not we’re actually going to be in it.  And so the question becomes: what is the future that we actually want?  Because if we don’t, then there’s no reason to care about the future</text>
