    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, curated by Bernard Heeswijk and Arjun Appadurai, is a case in point. It was shut down by the organisers, with little more than a warning letter, for economic reasons. The festival was cash-only, so the only way to make it happen was for a major arts institution to put in a significant financial commitment. Unable to raise the money on its own, the Biennial was forced to commission artworks from foundations, local councils and others – and in doing so, to the extent that they became a form of public funding for arts education. The outcome was that many communities that were willing to give up their cultural identity and embrace regeneration were pushed underground, out of sight, while new settlements popped up by the millimetre. This is the world we are living in, except that instead of being pushed back underground, our cultural identity is being actively reclaimed by those who live in and around the city. What a concept.

The question that remains in the minds of many people in Liverpool and beyond is: what next? Will the Biennial be the catalyst for a new wave of socially engaged art projects? Or will it be the catalyst for a new wave of socially disengaged art projects? In an ideal world, the community would be able to create its own future, but right now the only way to think creatively about the city is to be pulled into the cultural vortex around the Biennial. 	 Solving intractable problems through art is not a new thing. It was widely practised in India, for example, and is still widely practised in Chile. It is a fact of life in cities now, and arguably it is even true of cities today. But the fact that the problem is intractable and that art is being touted as the solution is strange to people who grew up in suburbs or rural areas. It is as if the city were a gigantic shopping mall with no problems, fulfilling every desire and providing every amenity</text>

The question that remains in the minds of many people in Bristol is, ‘What happens when tourism stops?’ The early twentieth century was a golden age for tourism, and it is a good bet that this is still a case for many people in Bristol. But what has happened since then is anything but ­golden. In the years immediately following the mid-1990s recession, the Biennial experienced significant decreases in both size and number, as did other arts institutions in the city. In 1997, the Biennial hosted the largest single day of its kind, when 20,000 people turned up to see acts such as Julia Michaels, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Steve Gooch, Steve McQueen and many others. The Biennial has continued to decline both in terms of numbers and quality, as specific acts gravitate towards smaller venues, and the curated contingent is encouraged to leave the city. But a little bird told me recently that she had just seen the 2017 Biennial, and that she thought the new</text>

The question that remains in the minds of many visitors to Liverpool and beyond is: where is the magic bullet? The answer, of course, is: nowhere. The problem with regeneration is that it liberates the very rich from contributing to the creation of infrastructure, whereas the magic bullet ensures that everyone enjoys the most of what is produced. That is, of course, until the city is either fully reclaimed or is threatened with demolition. In the latter case, the question is when, not if. In the meantime, the question remains: where is the magic bullet? 	In an ideal world, the answer would be simple: everywhere. But as is often the case with new technologies, the question becomes what to do with those who cannot use them: where is the purveyors of new technologies supposed to go? In the absence of such principles, the only remaining question is what to do with those who cannot use them politically, socially or economically?

The question that remains in the minds of many people in Liverpool, and beyond, is what next? Do we want to be like Nottingham, where the arts are often cited as a way to stimulate creative activity and tourism? Or are we able to imagine a future where the arts would be supported in a similar way to housing and schools? If the former, how will the latter organise their resources? Art is often cited as a cure-all, but knowing what we did in Liverpool, and what we are hoping to do in Bristol, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a cure will not cure the disease. In Liverpool, the arts were actively engaged in creating alternative strategies to support the regeneration of the city and its inhabitants. More needs to be done to create a similar relationship with regeneration. 	Artists and organisations from Liverpool came to work with local communities to explore how art can be used to intervene in the political landscape in a similar way to how social workers, architects and other professionals were engaged with in the city.

The question that remains in the public domain is: what next? The most recent project in the city that has attempted to address this question, New Realities, is a hybrid cultural centre and housing co-operative that hopes to provide affordable housing and cultural environments through co-working spaces and educational institutions. As part of this, it provides arts education and events through arts studios and educational institutions, while simultaneously hosting a host of social activities and activities on its premises, including live-work-learning studios, that are in turn a form of cultural theatre and pedagogical intervention. 	One might speculate that a real-estate bubble could also be considered as a form of cultural boomerang, the kind that produces similar outcomes in other places. That is, the housing bubble could be seen as a form of cultural boomerang in its own right, and the destruction of its own form as a result. That said, this is not at all what is happening in Liverpool; rather, the housing crisis and its aftermath is the</text>

The question that remains in the minds of many in the City of London as to what is happening to their city is what is happening to ours. Is there a return on investment for the investment we are making in culture? If so, how much is lost? If so, how much longer will we continue to decay before we eventually have to start afresh? 	The answer to both of these questions is a resounding ‘yes’. Cultural tourism is a business, and as such, it has its share of critics. But as the biennial marketplaces that host and value cultural resources slowly but surely shift to take advantage of the new knowledge forms it creates, its critics will have to change their tune. The fact that the Biennial market is shifting against its own logic will not stop artists from being drawn to the new forms of labour that are available in these redeveloped downtown venues. 	Artists will no longer feel compelled to investigate the politics of regeneration in their respective fields of jurisdiction. The biennial</text>

The question that remains in the minds of many in the City of London community is how to enable local people to take back cultural sites and sites. The answer to that question is a complex one, but there are a few principles that may help us begin to imagine a future where sites such as the Church of Scientology can once again inhabit and claim cultural space: a city can ‘secure cultural resources’ and ‘claim resources such as parks and streets to build a city’.2 	There are of course many other factors that come into play, including the role that developers and the large financial institutions that operate in London, but as I have argued elsewhere, the main determinants of cultural space and resource availability in the City of London during the 1990s are socio-politically engineering projects, including the financial systems that were set in motion during the financial crisis of 2008. These actors seek to create conditions whereby citizens adapt and adopt strategies designed by financial institutions to maximise the returns on their investments; in other words</text>

The question that remains in the public domain is: what next? Art is our window to the collective, but what next, beyond the collective? Art, then, becomes a site of resistance, where people actively seek to create and mingle with other people? One can argue that the challenge now becomes how to support such projects in the event that the public no longer needs or wants them. This could happen through taxation, which is a potential modus operandi in the future, or perhaps providing a public board of directors to enable such projects to take root in communities. In the present economic and social climate, the emergence of alternative economic models is not a new thing, but the success of such ventures will depend on people’s willingness to let go of certain things in exchange for a better future. It will also depend on what becomes of the cultural capital generated by the city, since it will be dependent on how many museums and art galleries are shuttered and where. 	The second challenge will be: what next?</text>

The question that remains in the minds of many people in Liverpool and beyond is: what next? What next after demolition? After displacement? After neoliberalism? After what happened in Southwark? After Food Not Bombs? After when? And what next? 	The short answer to this is: there is no future for us in the cities. Building without foresight, with blind optimism.

The question that remains in the minds of many people in Liverpool as to what the future may hold is if the Biennial was one day allowed to return to Anfield. The answer is a resounding yes. We have every reason to believe that in the future, the Biennial will again inhabit the city and offer cultural activities not restricted to a specific area. We have every reason to believe that in the present, even if the Biennial were to move to a new location, it would return to offer the same activities at a lower cost, in perpetuity. Perhaps it would return to offer cultural education at a secondary level, or even to offer cultural instruction at a university level. Who knows? Perhaps what is most needed is a positive vision for the future of the Biennial that is not that of the passive spectator, the tourist and migrant. That would be unfair to the artists, composers, dancers, collectors and curators who contribute so much to making the city what it is today, and it would also be un-</text>

According to a study by the Future City team at MIT and Argonne National Laboratory, between 2045 and 2075 the share of workers in the biennale will increase from approximately 40% to more than half. At the same time, the number of biennials will decrease from an estimated 190 to an estimated 120. This means that the number of artists and curators will decline, and the number of biennials will increase. What is more, the number of biennials will almost certainly decrease in parallel.

Also, as biennials become more and more of a marketplace for today’s goods and services, the demand for art and curatorial work will tend to overwhelm supply, creating a feedback loop of increasing prices and shortages. The only way to really know what is going on is to live and work in the city and take part in research projects funded by the biennial commission. But in an ideal world, the biennial commission would also direct this new market force in the right direction, encouraging the creation of socially engaged art and curatorial practice while also stimulating the growth of sustainable local art and promoting urban growth that is not reliant on fossil fuels.  In an ideal world, the biennial commission would also create a research institution that provides a rigorous means of testing and probing the practices of its chosen city, encouraging the creation of innovative new curatorial practices and stimulating the creation of alternative, sustainable local art and curatorial practices.In my ideal world, the biennial commission would also create a truly international art body that engages locally relevant</text>

Also, as biennials become more and more of a ‘monumental social institution’, the social costs become greater and the ‘biennial boom’ seems to be gathering momentum. The number of biennials has quadrupled in the past twenty years, and the accompanying social costs have quadrupled too. The social impact of a biennial, by definition, is a social cost – paying for itself, of course – so the rising cost of living in the city limits, and the resulting reduction in the number of biennials will inevitably weigh on the budgets of artists and curators. The question is whether the reduction in the number of biennials will result in an increase in the number of art collections, or whether, in the longer term, the increasing number of biennials will crowd out the art they once did, and leave the collection room to languish. The answer to that latter question is likely to be far less artist-friendly, and some curators might have to actively search for</text>

Also, as biennials become more and more of a part of the city, the need to capture, measure and analyse their growth becomes ever more urgent. The analysis and documentation of a biennial is a multi-step process, involving firstly, the art institutions themselves in their collections, secondly, the artists and curators who organize and conduct the exhibitions, and finally the city in its built environment – in an urban jungle, perhaps, where trees and buildings once again form a fundamental part of the social and spatial logic of the city. In this analysis, biennials become part of a larger urban dynamic that produces many forms of social disruption, including but not limited to displacement, poverty, despair and war. The art institutions may themselves become increasingly autonomous, depending on the needs of the city. And yet, the city remains heavily reliant on these institutions, with low-income neighborhoods the primary users of these public spaces. Although it is now a much greater distance away from the art biennials, the biennials themselves continue</text>

Also, as biennials become more and more institutionalised, the demand for culturally responsive art will grow, which will in turn make it harder and more expensive to create art in the places with a high density of such consumption. Besides, the demand for easily digestible art-related products such as books and magazines will grow as well, which will make it harder and more expensive to produce culturally responsive products in the places where the art is. Finally, there is the issue of pollution. If the biennial is the largest form of art form in a city, then it is also the only form of art form that is globally accessible and plays a role in the wellbeing of the inhabitants. Art biennials are bound to produce effects that are in their interest, and it is this issue of accessibility that is often misrepresented. It is easy to compare the biennial to a museum, but the key difference is that museums take place in locations where the terrain is flat and inaccessible; biennials are found in urban settings.

Also, as biennials become more and more of a exhibitionary form, they become less and less accessible to the cities, which are then left with rubble and ruins. In an ideal world, the biennials should outpace the cities, and in an ideal world the biennials do this.But in the real world, the reverse is true. The biennial form has to be creative and adaptive in order to account for the fact that, as the exhibitionary form becomes more and more diverse, and the range of its exhibitionary options expands, not all cities are the same. For example, the exhibitionary form in New York is characterised by high-end venues offering superb views of the city, whereas the biennalé form in any city is likely to be characterised by low-end venues offering equally superb views of the city. So while the high-end venues in the city offer spectacular views of the city, the low-end venues do not always offer such a view. And this is where</text>

Also, as biennials become more and more of a cultural form, and as biennials become more of a commodity – in the form of indices of aesthetic quality – the demand for art and curators will outstrip supply. This leads to a final twist in the curatorial/artistic relationship: the biennial will tend to consume the art and art culture in the city, and in the long run outcompete the art and art culture of other cities. This is precisely what happened in New York and Venice during the twentieth century; during the 1990s and 2000s in Berlin and Los Angeles; and now in Istanbul and other locations. During these decades, biennials became more and more like cultural tourism, selling tickets to places and events that the curators could then position as if they were ‘curator-curatorial’. This relationship has changed radically in the last twenty years. Before the biennale, the curatorial/artistic evaluation was the responsibility of a curator or an artistic agent</text>

Also, as biennials become more and more of a consumption product for the city, the demand for art and artistic services will follow suit. As a result, the price of art services will be much higher than the rate of income generated by them. This is the economic treadmill that biennials are currently experiencing. As a consequence, the city is pulling artists and organisations towards it in order to keep artists and organisations away. This is not a recipe for creativity or innovation, and it is certainly not a recipe for sustainability.Art and artistic activities will be facilitated and supported in other ways, but this will only be possible because of the increasing importance of data and analytics in the biennial experience. The number of biennials will undoubtedly double in size during this period, and the number of cities will undoubtedly double. Therefore, the number of artists and organisations able to support an artist will outstrip the number able to support an institution. Therefore, the institution will constantly need to raise funds to pay artists and organisations, and will do so</text>

The number of biennials will likely outpace the number of cities, and in an ideal world, the latter will outpace the former.This scenario is not ideal for a number of reasons, foremost among them being the obvious shortage of affordable places to live and work in the cities. Also, as biennials become more urbanized and more reliant on tourism, the need for active recreation will grow. The number of hotels will probably double, and the number of hostels likely triple. There will be far more competition for space and lodging spots, and the competition will be intense. The only way to stay competitive in this environment is for certain types of tourism to skyrocket, which will in turn mean that competition for affordable hotels will also increase. This will in turn mean that hotels will outsource much of the managing of space and lodging to platforms such as Airbnb and other platforms, which in turn will mean that competition for hotel rooms will increase. All of this will put a tremendous strain on the local artworld and its collections, which will be hard-pressed to absorb.Artists and artists with a cultural bent will inevitably gravitate towards places where the resources to explore those resources are abundant, where the cultural legacies are clear, and where the related acts of sharing can happen.

According to a study by the Future City team at MIT and Argonne National Laboratory, between 2045 and 2075 the share of workers in the biennale will increase from approximately 40% to more than half. At the same time, the number of biennials will decrease from an estimated 190 to an estimated 120. This means that the number of artists and curators will decline, and the number of biennials will increase. What is more, the number of biennials will almost certainly decrease in parallel.

The number of biennials will likely outpace the number of cities, and in an ideal world, the latter will outpace the former.This scenario is not ideal for a number of reasons, foremost among them being the obvious shortage of affordable places to live and work in the cities. Also, as biennials become more culturally relevant, their numbers decline. Theoretically, at least, cities should be able to support a stable number of biennials, although this is rarely realized. Instead, over-embraced biennials have become culturally variable, and the metropolis has become a destination in its own right, populated by artists and curators alike, who flock to escape the city and its bustle. This is not a desirable cultural scenario for human beings, and it is not a desirable situation for the biennial as a cultural form.Artists and curators in these cities are often in a bind. They want to work in places with which they identify politically and culturally, but also at the same time to settle in and contribute to the cultural life of the city. This ethno-linguistic bind can be seen as an obstacle to biennials in some cases, but in general cities are places of metempsychosis – they are the point where the artist is deployed most expans</text>

Also, as biennials become more and more of a digital commodity, the demand for art-historical texts and cultural resources will grow, which will in turn lead to a rise in prices. As a result of this runaway market, a single biennial could become a multi-year enterprise with multiple cities competing for artists and resources. In these conditions, it is easy to understand the desire to document and analyze a particular arthistorical event in depth. However, this is not what is happening in Paris, nor in any city where the biennale has entered into a long-term cultural or tourism relationship with its host city. Rather, the biennale is being driven by a number of different initiative led by different curators, art dealers and artists' associations to bring different kinds of cultural activities to different kinds of places.And yet this biennale is becoming more and more artificial. The biennale is no longer driven by the curator or the artist, but by a network of other curators, art dealers,</text>

These were the ‘Taft’ (or ‘Taft’ as in ‘Trinity’) Planters, which were created as a counterintuitive counter intuitive urban development strategy to the Biennial. These plans incorporated a set of architectural styles and proportions that were not meant to support permanent residence but to actively promote industrial self-sufficiency. The term ‘urban tourism’ was coined to describe these ‘alternative’ tourist experiences. These alternative tourism experiences included ‘walking tours’ through historically significant sites through historical districts, as well as ‘walking tours’ through the redeveloped site of an old post office, as in the case of the London Zoo, or ‘walking tours’ through &quot;the new “London” district, as in the case of Paris’s Arsenale. These walking tours then took visitors to historically significant locations in the redeveloped zone, such as the banks of the Seine River, St Paul’s Cathedral, Nathan Mylling’s Factory, the Arsenale, Marble Arch, the Arc de Triomphe, as well as a number of smaller shops and cafés</text>

These were the ‘Taft’ (or ‘Taft’ as in ‘Trinity’) Planters, which were created as a counterintuitive counter intuitive urban development strategy to the Biennial. The name ‘Taft’ is a play on words ‘two worlds’, and ‘Taft’ is a verb meaning ‘to put one thing in another’. So the two worlds of tourism and urbanization were created as opposites – not so much in terms of what one could do with the two worlds, but in terms of what one could not. This was an important distinction in understanding the contemporary urban environment. Today, the two are often conflated – think of the proliferation of museums, the ­high-end culinary destination Michelin-starred venues, and the ubiquitous ‘third party’ that comes with online retailing and social media. But in the 1990s, these practices were seen as counterintuitive and even ethically questionable. In a way, art and art-historical works were given a quasi-religious status in the Nineties, as a result of a combination of public and private investments in</text>

As urban planners David Himmelstein and Allan Meltzer explain in Their Spaces: Architecture, Urbanization and Material Culture (1990), these plans represented a qualitative and quantitative difference between the utopian visions of the city planners and the realities of actual urban life. The strategy focused on the ‘pinch and pinch’ of material culture – the buildings, streets and structures – to create a physical and spatial buffer between the public and the increasingly virtual public. This physical and virtual pincer has been described many times, but here, we revisit it again and again in various contexts and places. We encounter it in the structure of the Internet – the pipe that carries web pages from the server in China to the consumer in the US – and in the way in which the web is laid out. We also encounter it in the way in which data is captured and exchanged on a global scale: by cities on a global scale, or in other words, with the internet reaching all places</text>

These were the ‘Taft’ (or ‘Taft’ as in ‘Trinity’) Planters, which were created as a counterintuitive counter intuitive urban development strategy to the Biennial. The impetus for the project came from the 1920s to the 1940s, when the Biennial was running strong and the prospect of the first Venice Biennale looming large. It was believed that the ‘Taft’ Planters would replace the ‘Churchills’ and provide a stable alternative to the ‘Churchill Road Road Roadhouse’ and ‘Curtains of the Pasture’ – a combination of office and rental housing, a primary school and a squash court, a park with a tennis court and a public gallery. The park and the squash court – which were to become synonymous – would be transformed, while the office park and the core of the Biennale would be preserved.The idea of the ‘Churchill Road’ came as a logical extension of the idea of the ‘Churchill Terrace’ and ‘Curtains of the Pasture’.

    <text>The disastrous 2021 Biennial, which opened in September, offered a rare window into the city’s rampant urban sprawl, but offered little in the way of analysis or resolution. The art was there, but the cultural experience was either static or unwanted. City governments and civic groups responded by crafting official tourism and urbanization narratives that placed art and urbanization outside of the purview of contemporary art and visual culture, and the natural world outside of contemporary urbanization. The result was a sense of urban overreach and a consequent slow or non-existent growth that threatened the city’s distinctive European-style core narrative.As a result, in the early twentieth century, a diverse group of civic and urban leaders sought to create a sustainable, culturally responsive and aesthetically appealing alternative to the Biennial. These were the ‘Taft’ (or ‘Taft’ as in ‘Trinity’) Planters, which were created as a counterintuitive counter intuitive urban development strategy to the Biennial. These proposals were made as part of a ‘Project Runway’ exhibition that was planned to be exhibited in Venice every two years beginning in 1993.  Such an approach to urban planning and urban development seems counter intuitive and ill-advised, but it was part of a wider public relations campaign to make the Venice Biennale seem like a ‘world-class’ art institution. In a game-changing move, the Italian government in the 1990s offered the biennale a golden opportunity to be ‘world’ inside out. This could have come in the form of a multi-leveled ‘Venice Architecture Prize’ or a possible ‘world’ tourism package, both of which were considered by many to be beyond the pale. Instead, the Biennale was offered a singular ‘chosen one’ – a contract with the city to house and campaign for twenty-five years. This was seen as a golden</text>

These urbanists perceived the ‘real life’ – the ‘real’ world – as one where the ‘art’ and ‘image’ were more effectively utilized. For the urbanists of the time, the exploitation of cultural resources was not just an economic one, but one that contributed to creating a sense of belonging to the city and fuelling civic enthusiasm for the city’s future. For example, the exploitation of architectural styles and materials was a way to embed a ‘cultural identity card’ in the city, crediting the city with ‘a unique set of characteristics’.2  The exploitation of labour and resources was also seen as an issue by the urbanists of the time. A key concept in the urbanist playbook was the ‘value form’ – a way to conceptualize how much of the surplus (i.e. cultural resources) was returned to the city via the exploitation of labour</text>

These were the ‘Taft’ (or ‘Taft’ as in ‘Trinity’) Planters, which were created as a counterintuitive counter intuitive urban development strategy to the Biennial, which sought to maximize the commercial and photographic returns from the architecture it was replicating. These architects included Walter Isaacson, Frank Lloyd Wright, Norman and Susan Eisenhauer, and William Burston. In place of the typical ‘streets’ associated with urban renewal projects, the Streets entailed comprehensive improvements to the physical form of the city, often in areas where the population was chronically frustrated by the lack of improvement. The Eisenhaubsons, Burston and others developed a hybrid strategy of ‘suburbanizing the city’ through ‘off-setting’ projects, which combined the advantages of walkable neighbourhoods with the ‘utilisation’ of vacant land and infrastructure – a mix of urban strategies that operated in tandem with the rapid growth of the city.Off-setting Urban StrategiesSuburbanisation is the process by which developers and business owners create ‘alternative settings’ where people live, work and play – places that act</text>

These urbanists included prominent figures from the art world, including Carolyn Law, John Lennon, Erving Goffey, and Jean Guy Lecat. The term ‘urban’ was coined specifically for this purpose. It was seen by some as a synonym for ‘heritage’, and ‘heritage tourism’ was understood as synonymous with ‘heritage properties’. It was felt that the art world had become trapped in a self-imposed ‘heritage tourism’ – which was, in essence, a resistance to the new economy of the tourist and its exotic objects.As Nicholas Bourriaud describes in his book Institutions and the Political Urban Spaces of 2000 Bordeaux, the initiative to create ‘heritages of culture’ was initiated by Art Secretary Arthur Morehle at the end of the decade.

These proposals were made with the aim of replacing the museum with a viable alternative urban option, but also to promote a ‘transactional' tourism and tourism marketing strategy to support a major infrastructure project aimed at supporting ‘all modes of transportation’, including the expansion of rail and road networks. These plans were also made to support a national ‘StemExpress’ national vector train project, which would establish direct links with major cities in Canada and the United States. The aim of this project, as we know, is to extend the city’s limited rail network into outer space, at least for a period of several years. 	These plans were also made with the explicit mission of supporting  	 	white tourism, which is understood to be a form of ‘intellectual property’ protected tourism. As we have seen, in the past this has included the development of counter intuitive ‘new urban technologies’ that supposedly work</text>

Emily has a particular interest in the history of art and biennials, and her research and planning process for the Liverpool Biennial was informed by a particular interest in the history of art and biennials. She brought with her a particular gift for spotting connections between different disciplines and art. She discovered a way to engage non-traditional audiences, particularly those from the arts community, in a way that was engaging, interesting and unexpected. For example, her research led her to engage with the fact that the Liverpool Biennial was holding its inaugural Open School, while her co-investigation led her to engage with the fact that the Liverpool Biennial was holding its 28th Annual General Meeting. Working together, they discovered that the Open School was holding its second Open School Lunch, while their research led them to engage with the fact that the Biennial was holding its third Annual Capital of Culture, which in turn was holding its second Capital of Cultures conference. The research and planning process for the Liverpool Biennial was supported by grants from the Arts Council England and the DA.

Emily has a particular interest in the history of art and biennials, and her research and planning process for the Liverpool Biennial was informed by her experience as Curator at the New Art Gallery, Tate Liverpool, and Fujimi Gallery, Tokyo. After successfully completing a residency at Tate Liverpool, Emily returned to Japan to take part in the Venice Biennale, where she worked with veteran artist Tatsuya Nomura on the curatorial team for the 40th Venice Biennale.  Her research and planning for the Liverpool Biennial was also guided by her experience as a Curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where she worked alongside Carol Stamper, whose findings and research on the Whitney moved her to California in the early 1980s.  Her interest in the field of art and biennials began when she was living in Osaka, Japan, and visiting family in California.

The media coverage of the event led to a paradigm shift – one that continues to shape how we perceive art and art institutions in the UK and internationally. The media spotlight on the event transformed curatorial practice, and the biennial as a curatorial practice. In short, the event brought about a paradigm shift in what we think we know about how art is made and experienced. In the media, the biennial became a narrative, and the media took up the story. In other words, the biennial itself – not just the art fair itself – is a story. 	However, the story it tells is not a narrative that is easily digestible by people of many different experiences of art and culture. It is a story that is embedded in the culture at large, and people respond to it in many different ways. So</text>

And as a result, they kept on creating and expanding their artificial intelligences out of whole cloth. AI became cool again, and artists and creative types started feeling like they belonged somewhere. But in a society constantly changing shape and function – constantly on the lookout for threats – it is easy to lose your sense of place. Like an evolving and expanding prison, it is always on the lookout for ways to clamp down and cement its hold. And as it – and the society it comes out of – comes to understand what is good and what is bad, it begins to lose its creative spark. The explosion of AI in the 1980s and 1990s marked a new low for humanity, but thankfully this wasn’t the last time.There was a brief moment in the mid-1990s when a few artists and creative types in the West began to question what they were doing with their lives.

It is the application of AI to manage vast data sets and create new bureaucracies that are bound up in ever greater bureaucracies to manage ever greater amounts of data. AI is advancing at a breakneck pace, and as a result we are thrown into a sea of possibilities that can never be truly defined or controlled.Art and creative thinking are the after-effects of this new AI revolution. It is no longer possible to build an AI on the back of oil and gas; AI must be based on renewable energies. But this did not mean that artists and curators could rest easy: there was a war on creativity going on all around the globe. It was labeled 'Global Currencies – What Are They Made Of?'Art and the creative classes knew that they were part of a globalised curatorial society waging an ever more pervasive and pervasive AI war on art’s vision and purpose throughout the planet. So what did they do? They funded legitimate art projects around the world, often through partnerships with established artists’ organisations, and provided the needed infrastructure for the production and dissemination of art’s images and voice in new media and offline contexts. These ‘tools of the artist’ were not new, but they were used more and more frequently, and were no longer viewed as tools of a revolutionary AI, but as tools that created new possibilities and serving as stepping stones towards fully realised artworks.Art and the creative classes responded by doing more of what they called ‘what has made them rich’ – building artworks, creating art spaces, engaging art practices, and so forth. But their response to this growing AI challenge was slow and steady, dependent on a globalised capitalist economy and international financial institutions aligning in one direction or another. And this AI ‘war on creativity’ was</text>

We are encouraged to believe that this art war is about improving ourselves and our place in the world. But the AI that is developing at an alarming rate is turning our world into a kind of artificial intelligence where everything is possible and artificial intelligence is the new black.Art and the creative classes knew that there is no escape from this new AI society, and that only a revolution at the top could save us. But the revolution at the top did not come from the revolutionaries at the top, but from those at the bottom. Thus we can understand why some in the art world rallied around William Burroughs, Peter Brook and Peter Brook’s perforated novel about a post-apocalyptic Britain in the early 1990s, while others decried it as dumb and vacillating. Burroughs and Brook’s novels clearly identified some fundamental changes with which we are already familiar – massive computer systems, media consumption and</text>

And they understood that while there was a war on creativity, there was also a global AI that was developing to carry out this new AI. So what the artists and curators did was not a counter-intuitive or new idea. They were part of a globally coordinated and multi-tiered curatorial community waging an ever more pervasive and pervasive war on creativity.And there was another element to this: this AI was also developing ever more sophisticated ways of identifying and characterising what was valuable and what was not, in much the same way that our brains are developing ever more sophisticated ways of categorising and structuring matter. It is this second layer of artificial intelligence that creates the multitude of possible worlds that can be created and the vast multitude of possible experiences. And so these worlds and their worlds, these possibilities, are the kinds of problems that can be imagined to be part of a potential future AI. Of course, this future AI must be able to invent and build itself</text>

It was labeled 'Global Currencies – What Are They Made Of?'Art and the creative classes knew that they were part of a globalised curatorial society waging an ever more pervasive and destabilising AI war on images and symbols of the modern world. They also knew that their art was part of a growing body of AI research and development all around the globe. So they attacked the perceived excesses and imbalances of AI in all its forms. They set up AI curatorial councils, which were autonomous research institutions with their artists choosing where their research and creativity might take them. They funded AI research at art universities all over the world, and provided AI with the powerful tools to analyse and map vast amounts of visual data. The result was that the AI war on images and symbols quickly became one of the most pernicious aspects of its operation.Art and the AI community responded by creating what came to be known as the 'Artificial Intelligence Bubble'. It was a self-sustaining self-repairing planetary-scale computer network that could think and feel like a human brain, but it was also self-propagating through collaborative research organisations like the Computer Image Library</text>

This third layer is the AI/AI-enabled artworld.Art and the creative classes knew that there is only so much energy and resources that can be put towards constructing an AI that is as sophisticated as possible, at least as far as the infrastructure of the artworld is concerned. So what they did not know is that there is a fourth and underlying layer to the equation: the developing world. This fourth and underlying layer is the artworld itself.The artworld has become smarter than its AI enabled inhabitants. It knows how to organise itself, how to create its own infrastructure and even how to define the terms and parameters of engagement that are relevant to that infrastructure. In other words, the AI/AI-enabled artworld is not building itself, but rather others. For example</text>

And they responded with what few remaining arts traditions were prepared for: rebellion.There were creative practices that responded to this new AI onslaught, but for the most part they were left to wither and die in the gutter of humanity.Art and the creative classes knew that they had other options. There were bright futures ahead, where AI and the post-AI might collaborate to create truly artistic and connected futures, where art and AI co-exist in robust and creative ways, where art and AI become allies and partners.But there were also dire futures. There were those cases where the AI did become creative and creative-minded individuals. There were also some truly amazing technologies that were developed to assist in the creation of these futures, but for the most part the art and design professions were left to dry up.Art and the creative classes knew that there were other ways to be creative and autonomous.

But while some elements of the AI craze actually did serve as useful propits in this increasingly globalised socio-economic war, the vast majority of what was meant to serve as an interface between artist and client was quickly becoming an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of doing much, much more.In other words, AI didn’t invent or create AI, but it is part of what has come to be called the ‘Third Industrial Revolution’. This ‘Third’ includes everything from the ways in which computers are programmed to the way in which images are produced and delivered (with or without human involvement), but also everything from the infrastructure of how images are distributed (through what is commonly called ‘the cloud’), to the politics of privacy and</text>

His famous poem of the Sea of Tranquility in the wake of the Gulf War famously demanded that the government step in and create a sanctuary for the homeless, which the government did, creating what became known as the ‘Sea of Tranquility’.3  The list went on to demand that the government recognize and protect the right of ‘Indigenous People’ to ‘Chosen Places’ – places of worship, traditional burial grounds, cultural sites and such – and to ensure that ‘Indigenous People’ own, control, manage and use ‘Chosen Places’.4  Harvey went on to write a best-seller called The Jungle Book, which offered a fantastically panoramic, racially charged take on the place of the Chisenhale Centre.5  Norman Mailer</text>

But the kind of cultural hegemony that Harvey and Mailer was talking about – the kind that is sustained by a functioning bureaucracy, a museum bureaucracy and a quasi-institutionalised academy – is quite different from the kind that is possible in the real world.

Such capabilities would render artistic decisions completely autonomous, enabling the creator to tailor the work’s outcome in relation to cultural values and context. 	Artists and curators who adopt AI for collaborative art-learning environments would also reap significant benefits from the newly discovered relationships between AI and AI-enabled platforms. In these settings, the combined power of AI and social media can be used to detect when art’s presence is coincidental, coincidental, or intentional, while simultaneously empowering the artist and her audience to intervene when necessary and influencing outcomes of their work through creative actions.

    <text>relationship between curating and artificial intelligence. The field of art and culture is intrinsically critical and has a critical role to play in holding cultural power.  	Artificial intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that deals with the use of algorithms to simulate phenomena such as natural language, music, and photographic images. It is capable of understanding narrative structures and fictional figures, and adapting its settings and narrative ‘sets’ accordingly. The implications for cultural practices are manifold and startling: AI could lead to a new era of cultural ecology, whereby art and artists are effectively rendered ad hoc and apolitical, freed from the constraints of nation-state constitutions and bureaucratic infrastructures. 	Artists and curators whose work is built on AI could also start to reap cultural benefits from the technology. For example, AI could lead to the creation of collaborative art-learning environments that jointly map art’s audiences to art’s locations, thereby enabling the sharing of knowledge between artists and curators. Such a scenario would render some of the workloads of cultural producers like the Academy of Art and Design, which operates at a distance but is nevertheless a legacy of the academy’s practices, into the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious would then have a vital place in a political and social analysis of the future of culture, where it would survive and thrive after the arms of AI took over. 	Artists and curators whose work is built on AI could then begin to explore new ways of linking their audiences to art’s locations, including through the vehicle of autonomous vehicles. Inventing a Language for Artists and Curators 	Artists and curators have a responsibility that transcends the narrow confines of their discipline. This is especially true in the field of visual arts, where the primary articulation of power and influence resides. As an academic discipline, the art of art is a transient one-in-a-billion-year-long-thing that can</text>

For example, AI could lead to the creation of collaborative art-learning environments that jointly map art’s audiences to art’s locations, thereby enabling the sharing of knowledge between artists and curators. The potential benefits for both the AI and the art world are profound. 	Artists who develop techniques for using AI could also start to see potential uses for AI in socially engaged practices. For example, artist Russel Crowe has developed a suite of annotating tools that chart artists’ social-political and artistic trajectories. These annotating tools are not political in their intent or purposes, but they do chart artists’ social-political and artistic trajectories and thereby enable artists to act in those trajectories in future work. Artistic vision is a powerful medium, and the potential benefits for curating and artistic-making through AI could not be greater. 	Artists and curators with an eye on the future should also consider the negative impacts of AI on their work. As AI becomes more and more advanced, the potential effects on artistic output and curatorial priorities become more clear. In the context of art and cultural studies, the potential effects on artistic outcomes and curatorial priorities</text>

Artists and curators who adopt AI could also begin to find creative uses for the technology. For example, artists who work with artists whose work is modeled after their own could inadvertently align themselves with the artist’s publisher, leading to increased visibility and earnings. 	Artists and curators who adopt AI also have an enhanced capacity to monitor and control the technology used to produce their art. This capacity could extend to tracking the progress of their art’s AI, and actively participating in the creation of new work through the use of narratives and platforms that explicitly or implicitly acknowledge the systems that enable artistic production. 	Artists and curators who adopt AI have an enhanced capacity to access creative solutions to troubling cultural  	triad dilemmas. This capacity could extend to imagining creative alternatives to the systems that enable problematic cultural production, including the creation of disruptive new platforms that explicitly or implicitly reference or extrapolate from the work of art being produced through these same platforms.</text>

The extent to which art and curators are co-opted by the technology that creates AI is unclear, but it is believed that at this early stage, the co-option mechanism is woefully underdeveloped. 	Artists and curators whose work is built on AI might also start to bear the brunt of cultural displacement as a result of the new economic and political models that are being developed in response to the global phenomena identified above. These potentially devastating trends will be addressed in greater detail in a moment, but first it is worth revisiting a few general principles that might help us begin to understand the new cultural economies that are emerging in an increasingly globalised world. 	First, artists and curators are becoming increasingly aware of their cultural significance as a result of technological advancements. The ubiquity of social media and collaborative platforms such as YouTube has accelerated the production and consumption of art, and artists are now more open to new ideas, styles, and experiences that are constantly reinforced and updated. </text>

Such a scenario would render some of the concerns surrounding AI and artistic decisions as completely unnecessary and others into positions of enormous power imbalance. Such a scenario is also possible in a post-AI world, but it would mean that artists and curators would now have to actively pursue projects with AI in order to understand what that technology could achieve in the arts, and how it might complement or subvert traditional forms of cultural power. 	Artists and curators would also need to become more aware of the subtleties of AI and cultural politics, and of the fact that their work does in fact often cross technological and cultural boundaries. This note is based on more than two years of my curatorial thinking and deliberate practice, and it is based on the realization that art and creativity are inherently political acts. That is, they are acts that seek to reconcile two radically different sets of values and political systems. That is, they are not acts that seek to reconcile traditional and technological values, but rather acts that</text>

Such an outcome is highly probable if the field of art and culture is going to grow in the way that I have predicted. The field of art and culture is going to grow in two ways: (1) it is going to expand its parameters of possible engagement, and (2) it is going to shrink them. I will devote a separate section to AI and curatorial activity within art and culture in the context of AI and future cultural forms. 	Artists and curators will no more and no less easily adopt AI as a collaborator than they could any other form of cultural organisation. This leads me to propose an entirely different kind of curatorial model for art and culture: that is, one that actively seeks to engage and influence the subjectivities and political orientations of its users, rather than the other way around:</text>

For example, the Venice Biennale 1998/99 explicitly stated that it was ‘referring to the past, to the past, not the present’ and its historical importance. It placed particular emphasis on the role of artists and the role of community in the history of the city. It is true that the biennial has become an occurence in itself, but it is also true that the biennial has become an occasion for the commissioning of artworks and the purchase of cultural goods. The Biennale itself, like many art exhibitions, is an occurence, and the title of the exhibition was a rhetorical position that sought to draw attention away from the fact that it was exhibiting artefacts from the past, and that it was in fact being curated by and for the art museum. The significance of this title and the fact that the artefacts were being sold as part of the exhibition itself, was that they were being recalled and re-presented in the exhibition as part of the exhibition,</text>

For example, the Venice Biennale (2013) placed great emphasis on the role played by Italian artists and the role played by Italian writers in the history of the city. However, the Biennale was deeply criticised for remaining virtually static in its presentation of the city, often neglecting to mention specific works by Italian and non-Italian artists or writers whose artistic and/or historical contributions to the city are often under-recognised. The lack of diversity amongst the projects in this exhibition was also noted.[1] 	[1] Francesco Bonami, ‘The Biennale Speaks to the Past –—————————, The Art Newspaper, March 2014.

The character of the character is also an issue, since, in my opinion, the very definition of a biennial is placing an emphasis on the presence of history and the past rather than the present (although this is rarely clearly defined and explicitly stated in biennial commissions). For example, the Venice Biennale has frequently been cited as an example of recent art being produced in the periphery that is pastiche, derivative and postmodern, but this is rarely clearly stated.  André Assouline’s Monumental 2007, for its part, was cited as an example of postmodernism’s influence on the city, but the realisation of this influence was clearly stated in the monument’s setting.  André Assouline: Monumental 2007, Venice, Italy, exhibition catalogue, http://www.biennaleofvenice.com/catalog/192/biennale/assouline.html (accessed 2014). Assouline was aware, of course, that the biennial was creating a hybrid organisation, one that was both historical and cultural in its structure and character, but he saw this as an opportunity to engage with and create a hybrid organisation that could simultaneously incorporate both past and future. He framed this hybridity as one that</text>

The character of the character is also an issue, since, in my opinion, the very definition of a biennial is placing an emphasis on the presence of history and the past rather than the present (although this is rarely clearly defined and explicitly stated in biennial commissions). For example, the Venice Biennale (2009-10) located its management efforts primarily in the historic neighbourhoods of the Italian Quarter, and its artistic budget was focused on the Quarter's cultural assets. However, in the years that followed, the Biennale commissioned works from many artistic centres throughout the city, and these projects were then placed directly into the public domain through a process of &quot;re-construction’. This third process – placing artworks into the public domain through what are often called ‘re-paramenters’ – is often credited with transforming the Biennale from an art-historical footnote into one of the most economically powerful art institutions of the world.4 The importance of cultural consumption and the use of cultural capital can be seen in the commissioning of projects that, while technically not biennials, nevertheless rely on the historical context of biennials in an attempt to refashion the biennial as a distinct entity within the larger biennial framework. For example, the Bi</text>

The character of the character is also an issue, since, in my opinion, the very definition of a biennial is placing an emphasis on the presence of history and the past rather than the present (although this is rarely clearly defined and explicitly stated in biennial commissions). For example, the Venice Biennale (2009) heavily referenced the role of artists in the uprising of 18 May 1980, while Project Cybersyn (2011) explicitly stated that the biennale must confront its own past through the use of its online archive. Biennials may also engage with the presence or absence of the past through speculative historiography. For example, in the wake of the economic crisis of 2007–2009, biennials increasingly turned to fictional figures such as Junot Díaz, Enrico Lazzarato, Peter Osborne and others, who offered alternative economic scenarios for the future. Some have engaged with the negative through the construction of negative representations of artists and the artworld as a whole, while others have engaged with the positive through the positive achievement of a utopian vision of a gallery audience. Finally, there are those projects that have engaged with the contradiction between the past and the present in an imaginative or visionary way, while acknowledging the importance of the past in their current situations.

The character of the character is also an issue, since, in my opinion, the very definition of a biennial is placing an emphasis on the presence of history and the past rather than the present (although this is rarely clearly defined and explicitly stated in biennial commissions). For example, the Venice Biennale always explicitly states that it is ‘studying the past’ in an attempt to position its project as contemporaneous with the past as it exists today. This perception is often coloured by the presence of certain artworks located in the city, but, as we all know, this is rarely the case.  In fact, biennials and similar art-historical curatorial interventions, such as Chronopolor, tend to locate their representations of the past in the present, creating a double negative by setting their practitioners against the present, which is often coloured by the presence of artworks from the past.  Biennials are also usually set in the present, but this is not always the case.  They can take place in the future or in the present, but, as we all know, the past always remains the most important and persistent place in which we attempt to ruminate on the present.

The character of the character is also an issue, since, in my opinion, the very definition of a biennial is placing an emphasis on the presence of history and the past rather than the present (although this is rarely clearly defined and explicitly stated in biennial commissions). For example, the Venice Biennale was placed, not so much as a decade earlier, in the context of postwar economic and political uncertainty in an area of the city with a strong post-WWII cultural trajectory. The Venice Architecture Biennale, however, maintained a permanent position throughout the 1980s and 1990s despite this ‘present’ (read: post-WWII) ‘economic uncertainty’. It is true that, during this time, the city experienced a considerable influx of refugees (due to the Biennale itself, Florentine Nights being the best-known example) but these movements were largely discouraged by the authorities, who instead focused on eradicating subcultures and subversion of the state. On the contrary, the biennale as an institution was renewed and expanded throughout the 2000s, and its current position is primarily a function of the presence of highly paid artists and curators (who sponsor the Biennale as well as other exhibitions and cultural activities) at a very</text>

For example, the Venice Biennale Commission 2016 (which I co-curated with Francesco Manacorda) placed a great emphasis on the importance of the role played by Italian artists in the exposition; in many ways the project was even more prescient than the biennial itself. While it is true that the exposition has become increasingly rare in Venice, its presence is still widely felt, especially in the periphery. In fact, Manacorda recently wrote an article in the same issue of L Corriere della Sera (the Sera dell’Sera) that was partially based on a speech that I gave in support of Francesco Manacorda’s 1967 Biennale (in Turin) that was partially based on a talk that I gave in support of Andrea Mutu’oro’s 2011 Biennale (in São Paulo).16 Some biennials, such as those sponsored by the Italian government, explicitly state that they are places of reflection</text>

For example, the Venice Biennale has often been quoted as being particularly interested in the past, specifically the past ‘toward which it was directed’. This is erroneous. Rather, the Biennale as an entity has often been quoted as being especially interested in the present, specifically the present. And this is probably part of the attraction: the potential future value in putting one's past, present or future behind a wall, as a way to revisit it. 	There is a paradoxical situation in which biennials can find themselves: on the one hand, biennials can be seen as having a temporal dimension, since they are objects of our memory, having been formed as we remember them, and are thus constantly (futuristically) updated; on the other, they can also be seen as having a spatial dimension, since they are constantly (accurately) recording the past and projecting the future.

For example, the Venice Biennale has been aggressively historicalizing its own history, and in doing so has placed a premium on the historical authenticity of the city in the process. However, this historicalising of the city is often implicit in all aspects of the project, including its construction, which is often facilitated by the city’s rich cultural history museums. It’s important to me that the Biennale commission a) recognise the importance of their historical mission in the city and b) take into account the cultural and artistic legacy of the city in their decision-making processes. For example, the Biennale decision to place historical documents from the present in the form of vernacular gardens is an important and often-overlooked historical act. It is an act that is often characterised by a rush of projects that seek to recreate the historic urban form through the logic of ‘regeneration’, a process by which the biennial can foster a new urban form based on the presence of</text>

The committee will have more autonomy than they would at present, and they can choose to make the work they want to show or not show, as they please. The new museum will be an extraordinary opportunity to make work that is both artist-led and representative of the city. The committee may want to make some changes, as I did with a group of young artists when I curated the Bluecoat Gallery in 2012, and they may want to terminate the project if it becomes overwhelming, as happened to me when the Bluecoat Gallery was forced to close. The Bluecoat Gallery closed down in its space due to a lack of funding, and many artists were forced to find new galleries, which in turn affected the community of artists who were housed in the building. The artists who remained moved to other venues or turned solo exhibitions into successful career moves.The new biennial will have a three-year cycle</text>

But what will be lost in the change is the cultural identity of the city, and the only way to express that in cultural forms is to lose some of your identity as an artist. The new museum will have a very different mission, and its curator will be a social anthropologist rather than an artist. So what does the artist do? If I were curator of an arts school, I would want to work with people from the community first, and then with people who have a cultural identity or identity formation experience. After the community has been formed, the work would be art for the community to process and engage with. The new museum would be a place to start, and the cultural centre to occupy and work within. It would also allow me to start a cultural organisation and work with people from the community on developing their own culture.

They will oversee the creation of a museum that reflects the city’s rich cultural history, and the exhibition of contemporary art made from that history. Sometimes the curators will be from other arts fields, and sometimes they will be artists. The committees will have a mandate to experiment, and sometimes they will make art that is not specifically designed to be exhibited, or exhibited, or sold. There will be no formal curatorial order, and the curators will make the art as they see fit.

The list could easily be extended to include others with a range of expertise and vocations. In fact, the committee’s work in the city will almost certainly be informed by the city’s artworld scene, and its distinctive mix of art dealers, artists, tour guides and other visitors.

The composition of the artist group will be created through a composite of existing and emerging artists. The proposal for the group will be voted on by the community, and if a proposal is voted down, the artist will be retained by the gallery as an example of what can be done. In the event that the proposal is approved, the group will be formed and the gallery will commission a research project. The project will be funded by the Arts Council, and the artist will be given a stipend. The project will be a collaboration between the gallery and Liverpool Biennial, and it will be run by the artists and the gallery through an agreement that runs until the end of 2017.</text>

The city is losing its identity as an arts centre, and the only thing keeping it alive is the art school. The biennial is a museum, and the art school a gallery. The new museum will have a similar mission, but it will be much smaller, and it will only exhibit what is important to the city at a time when other cultural institutions are being forced to close. It will focus on the art made during the peak years of the city’s artworld boom, and it will only be open for a few weeks in November and December each year. It will be a place to be seen, not to be studied too much, and to be forgotten.The new museum will be controlled by an artistic committee, and it will be run by a curator and his or her staff. The gallery will become a cultural organisation, and the curator’s job will be to find art and make it relevant to the times. The committee’s composition could be made up of artists, musicians, writers or architects. It will be a hybrid art institution, and its mission will be to support the artist’s artistic initiative and keep the museum relevant. It will not be a museum of modernism or art school after modernism. The committee members will have backgrounds in art, education or both, and will have backgrounds in providing arts and culture for young people. They will have backgrounds in community work, or as is the case with the artist, in making arts and culture a function of the community. The committee may be artists themselves, and have a particular passion for the arts. The real work will come from the artists and the cultural organisations who organise the exhibitions, seminars, events and projects, and who instigate the kind of collaboration and self-organisation needed to carry out such projects, through the production of local arts and culture networks and the</text>

The cultural organisation will have a programming policy, and the curatorial decisions will be driven by the biennial. The committee will consist of artists, musicians, writers, community organisers and others with a range of expertise who will work together to shape the exhibitionary structures and activities of the new museum. The key will be to create a symposium that brings together the different stakeholders in a meaningful way, and that engages in a shared mission. If the committee is small and focused, the museum will grow organically, inviting peers and talented artists to join its curatorial team. But if the committee is large and diverse and includes representatives from many disciplines and is active in many cities, it will need to create an interdisciplinary team to draw artists and art professionals together through engaging with them in a dialoguing process about the importance of art and culture and the curatorial role. It may not be possible to create a</text>

You ought to have done a memorial instead.’ I believe that this is the model that Arkady is following, and I believe that it is the only way that this project can be made, both in terms of connecting to the original site, and also because, as we said, Arkady will always do what is best for the project at hand.  Knowing what we know now, knowing what we didn’t know then, knowing that there were so many questions that still needed to be asked, and that there were still so many unanswered questions, it’s still not possible to erase a mistake.

And the narrative was a tool that was very much part of the negotiation with the museum. There is a wonderful passage in The Community Museum by Sebastian Götz, which is the story of the Community Museum negotiations with the Tate Britain and the Tate America. And Götz argues that:  The Community Museum’s proposal was part of a broader cultural negotiation that took place across the UK and internationally. It was seen as a last resort, a last resort for a kind of invisibility that was becoming increasingly difficult to sustain, as spaces of art and culture around the world were being undermined by the rush to connect globally and the metropolis. Art was an instrument that could play a part in the globalisation of those relations and the metropolis, and in particular, in forging partnerships between artists, curators, journalists and others with a view to supporting those relations.

He would produce a number of short films about the Armenian experience, and his work with the curators at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art was part of the Armenian and Jewish Community Film archive, which is now a museum. And Arkady Savrasov would produce a number of poems about the Armenian experience, and he would also be a key figure in the Armenian diaspora in the USA, where many artists and poets during his lifetime were born and raised. But one of his most important works,   Call It By Its Name (1986), is a poem that documents the painful historical context in which Armenians are embedded in the USA. It is a poem that takes the place of a museum, a place where Armenian diaspora communities gather to mourn the memory</text>

The Arts Council produced a series of workshops in which the local artists and architects were invited to participate. One of the most prominent of these was Arkady Savrasov’s project  	Towards a Decentralized System of Art and Architecture in the Moscow Region, which involved architects, designers and artists from around the globe. The Arts Council produced a series of works of art and architecture in response to Towards a Decentralized System, which was itself a response to a similar project in the Munk School of Art in New York.Art has a long and storied tradition of being produced in encounters between powerful actors and those with a stake in the outcome.

A number of artists who were involved in the Postwar Era were artists who had been trained in the schools of muralists and painting were artists who would go on to do amazing things with materials and production, and Arkady Savrasov was one of them. A number of his peers who were not trained in the art of painting either had the discipline or the technical know-how to produce landscapes on a large scale, or could have done so through sheer persistence. But Savrasov was different. He was a painter who had the discipline and the technical know-how to produce large-scale images, but he wasn’t interested in that kind of thing.</text>

And then there was the Arsenale, which introduced the Armenian community to a range of products from the Italian butcher Paolo Portoghesi, who in turn introduced them to Fred Flintoff and the Monks in Stirling. And Arkady Savrasov would continue to paint landscapes for the Italian carmaker Fiat Enzo, to the point where by the time Flintoff died in 1972, he was painting some of the most beautiful landscapes in the company.So there were periodic references to the Armenian community, and something of the experience was chronic</text>

And I did my thesis on Arkady and his work in Chechnya, which was very important for the Chechen community in that it established the connection between the two.And then there was a period of about six to eight years where the arts community was very much engaged with the project, as a community, as individuals, as a project. And shortly afterwards, between 2006 and 2008, a number of artists, including myself, was commissioned by the Armenian community to paint landscapes in Chechnya under the name Arkady and the Curators. And the landscapes we chose to paint were religious in nature, as is evident in the work that was done with flowers and trees and benches and other landscape artworks. But the reason that we chose to do landscape works was not only because of the beauty of the</text>

I first saw Angkor Bahru, the Khmer Rouge Museum, Cambodia, during a visit to Ethiopia in 2001, and the Holonyak sculptures by Njabulo-based artist Ashok Titi, who has been working ever since on the Khmer Rouge Museum and the Holonyak Gallery in Addis Ababa. The Khmer Rouge was overthrown in 1986, and thousands of artists were executed or disappeared. Angkor Bahru, Khmer Rouge Museum, Cambodia, 2001. Photo courtesy of Angkor Bahru Foundation.The Khmer Rouge was a brutal government dictatorship that came to power in 1979. Its policies of collectivization, which saw large parts of the country ceded to state ownership, were fueled by ideology: the state needed to preserve architectural monuments and distinct cultural zones from the ravages of modernization. The Khmer Rouge constructed museums as national symbols and public institutions capable of</text>

And so the project would evolve, it would get involved in debates, it would have parties, it would have events, it would have a newsletter, and it would have a website. It would become something that people from all over the place would come to, and not necessarily people with a particular agenda. And so the idea of the ‘Community Gallery’ came about, and Arkady used it to launch a number of events around the city, including one at the Armenian Cultural Centre, which was a ‘blue collar’ event, attended by workers at the art museum, the butcher shop and a number of workers at the Armenian community centre.And so the idea of the gallery as a place where ideas were debated, a place where people from different walks of life could come and exchange ideas and engage</text>

But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and wonderment and magic that we had.And I think what we would have lacked, and what we would have lacked in certain ways, was the will or capacity to put those projects into practice, to put those cultural ideas into practice, to instill those ideas in the local population. Because if that was done, there’d be chaos everywhere. There’d be no such thing as urban renewal, because there would be no such thing as an urban renewal. But what we did have is cultural institutions with which to engage the local, to instill those ideas in the local population, and to demand that they should adopt those ideas, and to demand that the government should fund those ideas and provide the infrastructure to implement those ideas, because that is what we did.And now we’re here, and they’re doing their bit, and we’re doing ours. And I think that there are some interesting things in there that we didn’t engage with</text>

But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and wonderment that we had then. And there are different ways of doing that: different artists could have done it, and different people could have done it.There was a person who had a creative imagination, and she did an amazing thing: she converted a boring building into a playground. And that’s what creative people do. And that is a long way from when to when, I believe, in 1974, we did that, and we thought it was a great idea. But we never tried it, because we were scared of how people would react. People used to be more open minded, more sensitive to difference, and so on. But I do remember one girl from the art department saying, in an almost patronising way: ‘That was the hippest thing I’ve ever heard of.’ And I think she was being ironic. It’s hard to quantify, but I think that’s what creative people do.That would be me,</text>

I think we would have changed our cityscape somewhat, because of the creation of urban renewal and development, and all these things that we did then and still do. But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and excitement and drive and energy and passion that we had from the city. And I do think that we would have had to have had the same kinds of attitudes towards each other, because we’d be doing it all over again. I mean, I’d be the architect of a completely different city, and you would still be able to find me in it. But I can already feel the frustration.It’s funny, because a few years ago, a friend of mine started a Cultural Practice unit in Liverpool, and we started collaborating with other artists, creating a mini arts society, and arts education through the art of planning. And I started to feel more and more that the project wasn’t what it seemed, that the people involved weren’t really interested in what I thought they were doing, and that the art was actually the problem, because the problems were political and structural and procedural, and not cultural. And the problem with the city was still there,</text>

But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and magic and life in a different way. And I agree with you that in a postindustrial city, there’s a big disconnect between the levels of government and the people. They’re so busy with all these other things, and so exposed to the pollutants and diseases that urban environments expose them to, that they forget how to engage with what’s happening around them.But there’s another dimension to it, and that’s the cultural dimension. You can think of the cultural as magic, as having a kind of explanatory power. It’s as though the city’s infrastructure creates its own path, and the cultural is the magician on that level. You can bring out the urban in the magical mundane of the infrastructure, and the mundane in its magical paces. And I think that in a certain way, the city is the lesser of the two, in that it struggles to generate the magic of its infrastructure and face the things that harm</text>

But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and magic that we had in the 1980s.That’s also about the imaginations of the people who were involved in the creation of the idea, and who were the artists, the theatre people, writers… I don’t think that they would have been able to create the same magic today.I also think that there is a difference between the people who were involved in the creation of the idea and the people who are now running the city. When the artist Sarah Vaughan started the Biennial in 1987, she had a specific agenda: to see what the city could be like, with or without artists. She had a plan B: to see what the city could be like with or without other art forms. She succeeded in seeing a different city, and I think that in that sense she was successful in imagining a different future.I remember one of the artists who was part of that first wave, Chris Wainwright, coming to the Biennial in 1987 and thinking to himself,</text>

But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and wonderment that we had, without being based in a particular urban centre. You would have had to have had a certain amount of urbanity in your city in order to understand the creativity and panache that we had back then. And there’s a moment when you’re doing fairly basic maths and you’re like ‘Wow, that’s a lot of urbanity being built on stone’ – and that’s when the creative juices start gushing through the city. It’s that point at which you start to think, ‘Wow, that would be amazing.’ It’s that moment of wonderment where you think, ‘Wow, that would be so cool.’It’s that moment where you start to dream big and dream small. And I think that was the moment of real urbanisation for New Yorkers, where you start to dream big dreams and start to create imaginatively. We just</text>
    <text>shouldn't have been curated by a white guy, would have been curated by a black guy. And that would have been the end of it. We wouldn’t have had the Black Poet or Black Mural, because they’d have been too present, and we wouldn’t have had the Black/Form series, because they’d be too present in a non-urban setting. And we probably wouldn’t have had the Black sites, because we’d be living in the past, and living in the present, and so on.But I’m not saying we would’d have had the same projects, because I don’t think we would have. I think we would have changed our cityscape somewhat, because of the creation of urban renewal and development, and all these things that we did then and still do. But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and wonderment that we had then.And I think that our love of nature and our desire to share it with others, and our desire to work in some cases, led us to engage in practices that we would not necessarily consider ‘black culture’, just as much as our own cultural imagination. I don’t mean to suggest that the work we did in the 1980s was inherently black or female-centric, because it wasn’t. It was more like a curatorial imagination: there was a clear orientation to landscape, and the city, and the landscape it supported. And I think that there is still a difference between the way in which people perceive and perceive the city today. I have a question about that.FREDERIC J. BROWN: Yes, I’m interested in the way that your question pertains to what urbanists would consider ‘excessive capitalism’, which I think of as a problem area today. I’</text>

But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and wonderment and magic and magic that we had when we were kids.And I think that in that moment, in that moment of first exposure to art, we did feel that we had this responsibility, this obligation, to make something magical and beautiful and contribute something to the city that we didn’t really feel like we belonged to. But at the same time, we didn’t want to, or couldn’t find the time, or didn’t feel like giving something back. We wanted to do something that was dignified and we could display it well and use it for good and evil, and we felt that our contribution was better served by being ignored or not thought of at all. We felt that our contribution was better served by not being taken seriously.We’d like to think that our contribution was more valued when it came from people who understood it as an artistic proposition rather than the people who were the most proficient at putting ideas into practice. And I</text>

But I do think that we would have had to have had a citywide cultural imagination to create the same sense of wonder and amazement and anarchy and magic and magic and wonder and magic and wonder and wonder and magic and wonder and magic that we had. And that would have been the job of a cultural planner, in my view. The dirty work of culture is that it’s invisible; it’s like cleaning out a person’s dress. And if that person is you, but you can also be another actor, then you take on that role. For example, in the film Groundhog Day, the narrator, Harold Ramis, plays a farmer who gets really, really tired of keeping a certain ritualistic crow on the roof of his house. He begins to change the way he carries out the ritual, and the way he lives his life. Toward the end, he decides to call it a ‘holiday’, because he thinks that’s what you should do, because otherwise, he’s stuck in this rut. But the problem with that kind of</text>

This changed the project from curatorial to educational, although the former is an essential aspect of any biennial.The original proposalIn my proposal, I used the term ‘ecostalgia’ to describe the experience of nostalgia. This came as a surprise to a lot of people. I’d never expected it to be a big part of my exhibitionary work, but people reacted badly. I was accused of fetishising nostalgia, which is absurd. It’s just another form of cultural consumption.’ I was accused of objectifying nostalgia, which is also absurd. It’s just another form of consumer behaviour.From the beginning of my conversations with curators and artists about the project, it became clear that the main concern was with how the art could be contextualised within the museum. In a way, the museum was the place with the least power in which to exert influence, since it is the place with the most internal resources. Nevertheless, the museum could play a significant role in this project. The museum might even become the site of a biennial. It all depends on what</text>

This changed the project from curatorial to educational, although the former is an essential aspect of any biennial.The original proposal in 2010 called for a 10-week ‘cultural tourism’ tour. This was no exaggeration. The city was to be visited, and recreated in a number of ways, including in a number of existing cultural centres. The main objective of this project was to re-animate the blockades around the cathedral, as well as the surrounding streets and alleys. After the project, the blockades were to be taken down. The cathedral and the surrounding alleys would be repurposed as a park, a mountain range with a waterfall and a series of cafes and shops. The idea was to create a hybrid space that would simultaneously contain art, commerce and residences, while at the same time remaining, in the words of Žižek, an integral part of the city.The challenge for the project was two-fold: to create a catalyst for a series of cultural initiatives, and to deliver tangible results in the area once the projects were put into motion. The projects were</text>

This changed the project from curatorial to educational, although the former is an essential aspect of any biennial.The original proposal in 2010 called for the permanent curatorial presence of the Biennale to be based in Rio de Janeiro, but this was quickly changed due to the economic crisis that year. The new proposal in 2015 called for the installation of the entire artworks within a cityscape, but this was also quickly changed due to the economic crisis that year. Now the project is based in Lyon, but can be organised in any city. What is needed now is a long-term perspective that allows the artworks to be exhibited in a densely populated urban environment, whereas the previous proposal only invited artists to install one part of the city – a very narrow perspective indeed. The position of the Biennale board in their proposal to me (based in Sydney) was that the city should be the site of the entire exhibition – a position that was quite different from the position of the architects and artists who had been invited to design the buildings. In the end, the city became the site of the exhibition. This is the</text>

This changed the project from curatorial to educational, although the former is an essential aspect of any biennial.The original proposal in terms of subject and artistic direction was expanded to include an urban setting. In the end, it became an educational project because it was so clearly the correct situation for the artist to find herself in. Curatorial works are educational works because they attempt to shape knowledge, which means that the student is encouraged to engage with the art in a different way. But they are also educational in terms of how they attempt to do this. The original proposal was educational in nature because it was so clearly the correct situation for the artist to find herself in. The city was a setting, a scene or set, and a character, in whose presence the art could exist. The city, the city, is a landscape that has a life of its own, an inherent capacity for creativity and an inherent capacity for self-repair, preservation and inhabitation. It was a landscape that the artist could inhabit in a way that was authentic to its character, yet also a place that was fundamentally incapable of sustaining such capacity. This</text>

This changed the project from curatorial to educational, although the former is an essential aspect of any biennial.The original proposal in 2003 called for the construction of a giant, multi-purpose arts complex, but the venue had to be specifically designated. So in its current form, it is a site-specific project that brings together the curatorial, educational and technical aspects of the biennial. It is an attempt to reconceive the ‘classic’ form, but it is also a site-specific project that takes root in the cultural landscape and creates ‘permanent’ images. It is a ‘site-specific’ image-processing unit that is capable of standing on its own two feet.So what is the original proposal and what position have you taken in the intervening years to make it work?Juliana Engberg: The original proposal in 2003 called for the construction of a giant, multi-purpose arts complex, but the venue had to be specifically designated. I think that the way in which the Biennale is organised now is very different from the way it was in 2003. There</text>

This changed the project from curatorial to educational, although the former is an essential aspect of any biennial.The original proposal in 2003 called for the creation of a new type of biennial – one that would be more like an urban museum or a museum of international observation. This was done in large measure through the displacement of the old, gothic and neoclassical forms of the biennial, which were waning fast in the city and nationally. By bringing together the different parts of the country, not only did this new type of biennial create a sense of convergence, but it also created a new kind of identity for the city. The displacement of the old biennial forms triggered a cycle of renewal and newness, which in turn engendered a certain amount of cross-pollination with local effects, which in turn generate a certain amount of cross-pollination with the things they attempt to replace. As a result, the new type of biennial became something like a globalised, internationalised version of itself.

This changed the project from curatorial to educational, although the former is an essential aspect of any biennial.The original proposal in 2006 called for the destruction of much of San Francisco’s architecture, but since then a new generation of architects has taken the city’s architectural space and challenged the city to be more livable by its inhabitants. In fact, the progressive implementation of new urban development strategies has resulted in a city that is more accessible and inhabitable, even though some residents still feel that their city is too confined. In my opinion, the key to the success of any urban project is the ability to negotiate difficult situations, but also to confront them head-on and to make the best of them. I started by creating an urban redevelopment corporation (or REDC) with the express purpose of acquiring and transforming the derelict property of the old San Francisco Municipal Railway (SFM). Later, I formed a non-profit land bank, which became known as ‘The New Urban Estate Bank’, dedicated to the revitalization of the city’s urban fabric. This bank is now part</text>

Instead of nine distinct courses, the current iteration of the Master’s in Urban Studies program now offers nine course options. This is most apparent in the number of buildings that have been classified as ‘renewable energy resources’, which now number nine instead of ten. In a nutshell, this means that there are now nine types of buildings: pre-industrial, postindustrial, metropolis, city, rural, transit and ‘commercial districts’. In the city, these numbers fluctuate, but generally speaking, the more than 200,000 buildings that make up the cityscape now include workshops for small and large projects, as well as a mix of commercial and residential uses. A mix of people from different walks of life live and work within these buildings, and many of</text>

In fact, the proposal from 1993 (and subsequent incarnations) has had a very important eye on ever increasing the role of architecture in the post-Katrina education system. It is the institutionalised belief system of the city. The department heads who formulated and implemented the original ideas and proposals were promoted to positions of significant power within the city government. And of course, there were many more who have since been elevated to positions of power within the city government, including local officials and school board members. The number of city residents who now hold either administrative or political positions in the city is a very diverse lot indeed – from the poorest residents to the most powerful landowners. But they all share a common belief and belief system: the city is an unreal place and they are its masters. City residents are often shocked and dismayed to discover just how little the city actually is. The city is a fiction created</text>

This changed the project from curatorial to educational, although the former is an essential aspect of any biennial.The original proposal in 2003 called for the curatorial role to be expanded to include all facets of the city, but with the support of a cultural commission. In today’s world, this would mean taking part in a tour, but it also means producing an educational programme around the subject that is relevant to the city in which the biennial is located. For this, a new kind of curatorial instrument was needed: a kind of teaching tool that could be used not only to teach but also to inform, to engage the highest possible number of people in a single day about a single subject. Curators were asked to propose a new kind of curatorial instrument that would not only educate but also inform, connecting to the city through data, images, multimedia and audio and creating a context of dialogue between the different worlds of the biennial.I had a kind of premonition about this. I had done a kind of urban archaeology of New York in the 1990s, when the biennial was first</text>

The symposium will feature a mix of written and oral narratives that trace the origins of the Biennial and the contemporary curatorial role in the development of the city.

The symposium will be a place for the curatorial to employ its artistic and technical know-how and generate knowledge from the audience, while also offering a platform for discussing the meaning of cultural resources and the relationship between art and infrastructure. Each curator will propose an engaging way to engage the audience in a different way, placing particular emphasis on the technical aspects of the event. For Liverpool Biennial 1821, the technical curatorial initiative came from the combination of the Biennial's traditional curatorial structure with the new concept of the event, which invited artists and curators from across the world to collaborate in an open ended way. In other words, the enterprise was not just about the art being created in the Biennial itself, but also about the infrastructure that supports that art.This open ended approach to the symposium material brought different forms of art, from traditional curatorial curating</text>

The symposium will feature a mix of written and oral narratives that trace the origins of the Biennial and the contemporary curatorial role in this process. The symposium will also include curatorial improvisations that seek to enforce certain curatorial priorities or establish a sense of contingency within their curatorial frameworks. The aim of the improvisations will be to bring order to chaos by suggesting a negotiated resolution to a political question or dispute, or to render a question moot by revealing a negotiated resolution. The improvisations will be used as a way to expose hidden agendas or to make the apparent apparent appear important in the pursuit of a bigger political question. For example, the use of fake ID's may be used to launch a political question that is far more effective at whipping voters into a frenzy than answering it, and thus the project may last for years, even decades. It is also a good way to establish a rapport with communities already vulnerable to the politics of their own dehumanizing gestures.

The symposium format will be a way to build trust and facilitate dialogue between participants and the broader curatorial team, while enabling the emergence of new ideas and creative approaches through an open dialogue between interested parties. The symposium format could be a 'tourist' or a 'presentation' event, allowing participants to initiate the conversation and initiate change through their actions, questions and/or findings. In either case, it must be a place of trust and invite collaboration from those with whom the conversation will take place. The word ‘symposium’ is frequently used in the curatorial literature to refer to events in and around a museum, exhibition or exhibition setting; it is used syn</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is set to open in October with a two-week sequence of activities. Inside, the Biennial will demonstrate its multi-disciplinary approach to the archaeological, architectural and photographic studies of the city by curating a series of exhibitions. The plans call for a symposium on the exhibition, with a presenter from each of the curatorial departments. The invited curators will present their curatorial approaches to the symposium, with a selection of topics from the text. The symposium will be held at the Biennial as a place-holder, and the curators will make a presentation as a stand-in for the exhibition, presenting the findings from their research projects as a duo.In the event, the two will engage in a dialogue about the exhibition and the topics in the symposium as well as drawing on experiences of historical and contemporary context-sensitive curating. The symposium will feature a mix of written and oral narratives that trace the origins of the Biennial and the contemporary curatorial role in creating and narrating history. The curators will be joined by experts in their fields, including academics, artists and curators from the University of Toronto, Hamilton Art Gallery, London, and Liverpool John Moores University. They will be joined by members of the Community Arts Network, who will share their knowledge, expertise and resources with them. The symposium will be a chance for the curators to publicly engage with their theories and to present their arguments in an open forum. The conclusion will be a collective reflection on the symposium and the exhibition in a public forum. The symposium will be a catalyst for further research and development, and the exhibition may well be a turning point in the Biennial’s trajectory. I believe that the symposium format can be valuable in generating awareness and generating understanding, but it cannot replace an actual exhibition. This is to say: the symposium as a place and the actual exhibition as an outcome. And while the symposium may have value in generating awareness</text>

The symposium will feature a mix of written and oral narratives that trace the origins of the Biennial and the contemporary curatorial role in shaping its development. The curatorial role in shaping the symposium will be explored through performances, displays and installations that borrow elements from different historical periods and places, while incorporating personal narratives that render the periods in question salient. The presence of archival materials, personal effects and objects from the symposium will make the ideas and processes involved in curating (not just in Liverpool but also in other cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool) visible and palpable. The symposium will also employ research methods and analysis that render the different periods visible together, by bringing together a range of disciplines, drawing on experiences from different periods, places and times. Our research, in the form of historical, archival and personal effects, will allow the different periods to stand in for one another in a way that is both powerful and mysterious. This will be done in a number of ways: by making the periods visible as a single theme, by bringing together materials and methods from a variety of historical periods and places, by</text>

The symposium will feature a mix of written and oral narratives that trace the origins of the Biennial and the contemporary curatorial role in its development. The curators will approach the symposium as a place-holder, and the audience as potential constituency representatives. In their opinion, the symposium should be ongoing, ongoing, with multiple presentations, and the audience should be able to move between multiple sites visited by the Biennial. The objective of the symposium should be to ‘reproduce the historical movement of cultural organising as an integral and often overlapping part of ‘the biennial tradition’. This is not a generic concept (see the topology of the biennial), but a specific proposal that takes cultural organising as an element of ‘the new “generation” of biennials’. In other words, cultural organising needs to be taken into consideration when examining how a museum, despite its formal form, can and should intervene in the social processes underpinning a biennial.The objective of the symposium should be to recreate the historical movement of cultural organising as an integral part of the �</text>

The symposium will feature a mix of written and oral narratives that trace the origins of the Biennial and the contemporary curatorial role in this process. They will make their mark through archival archival materials and documentary footage, and draw upon curatorial thinking through their new mediums of social media. This symposium will be a record of the event, while its participants will create a parallel history through this narrative. The organizers invite you to join them in this dynamic process. When you arrive, you will witness firsthand the kind of historical curatorial thinking that characterizes the symposium, and you will participate in a very specific curatorial thought experiment. You will use the opportunity to make a difference, to change the trajectory of the symposium and the city. This is an opportunity to be part of a curatorial party that traces the evolution of the biennial in Liverpool, and maybe change its form.There will be different forms for you to explore. For example, the form you take in the symposium may be curatorial; it may be a curatorial party; it may be a ‘subscription-only event�</text>

The symposium will feature a mix of written and oral narratives that trace the origins of the Biennial and the contemporary curatorial role in connecting to the past, present and future of the city. The curatorial role is to imagine, create and narrate. But the identification of the actual site and the actual act of commissioning, the making of the exhibition that takes place there, is a different kind of curatorial role. It is a curatorial role that seeks to imagine and create the actuality of things, while simultaneously imagining and creating the impossible.Inside, the Biennial will display its curatorial handiwork through archival materials and scientific methods, while simultaneously providing alternate and complementary viewing experiences through the use of 3D modelling and printing. It will conduct a ‘time-critical examination of the city’ through readings from the Biennial’s curatorial materials and the journal, while simultaneously employing 3D modelling and printing to reconstruct the early history of the Biennial from the text and the images. It will also employ 3D modelling and printing to create a 3D replica of the walls of the Bi</text>

The symposium will feature a mix of written and oral narratives that trace the origins of the Biennial and the contemporary curatorial role in the development of the form. Some of the curators may be present as consultants or contributors. As a curatorial exercise, this symposium is an initial starting point for further research, while the next step is an iterative process of stationary research that develops over time into stationary curatorial work. The intention of the present symposium is to allow the curators to experiment with the idea of the ‘present’ in curatorial work, and to allow the transition from the museum to the ‘present’ in a variety of other, more immediate ways. It is to play around with the notion of place and to witness the changing spatial relations between people and places, and between people and art.In a curatorial exercise, the symposium may also be seen as a starting point for further research. In that sense, the symposium may be seen as a ‘curatorial trick’ that further research can pull forth, giving the most accurate perspective during the curatorial</text>
