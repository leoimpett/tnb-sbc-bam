The convergence of these two fields may assist in the understanding of the curatorial’s ‘new normal’, where the mass media and its algorithms increasingly resemble natural phenomena. Artificial intelligence may well lead to the replacement of humans with algorithms, whose job is to analyse data and understand processes in greater detail than humans can. This may well reduce the need for art institutions to engage with communities in communities based settings, since algorithms can infer from past patterns and behaviours, and thus act on that data, gathering insights into possible futures that are not necessarily predetermined by human beings.Artists and curators may well collaborate with researchers and other stakeholders to address such possibilities, as well as to engage with the challenges and opportunities of a distributed future.

This would mean working with cities, states, nations, international organizations and cultural institutions, to name only a few. But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of ecology and urbanisation into account in decision-making. This may involve working with artists to create innovative ways of embedding in urban settings, not just for their own engagement but also for the curatorial’s sake, in an effort to foster greater understanding and trust.This may entail partnering with non-profits, grassroots organizations or other grassroots social action groups, even if such groups often have a role as a resource for activism. It would mean allowing such groups to grow and to employ innovative strategies to engage and educate new generations of artists and others skilled in the art of sharing, creating and managing urban space, particularly if such organizations often have a social or educational purpose beyond engaging and educating. It would mean allowing such groups to exist in parallel to and alongside traditional art institutions, so that the former can focus on providing educational resources to the latter, while the latter can increase their outreach and appreciation of art through research and analysis. It would mean engaging with such collaborative forms of artsmaking as not only</text>

But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of access to resources and other facets of the future into consideration. This may require that the researchers and stakeholders chosen have a clear understanding of the communities they are working with or representing. It is essential that the researchers and stakeholders chosen have a clear understanding of how the city functions as a space for creative action and that it be possible to design interventions that are responsive to the needs and preferences of a community in an effective and progressive manner.A final type of collaborative research and development may be needed in order to achieve truly ‘world-class’ results, but such institutions would have to be driven by a visionary and dedicated team, and their autonomous decisions, including the use of existing knowledge and cultures. In the long term, such institutions may need to be rooted in the city, but today’s arts and cultural environments are often too transient and urban to survive in their current form. A truly world-class institution would need to be rooted in the city for its long-term sustainability, and it</text>

But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of access to resources and urban environments into your own hands, creating an autonomous community of future artists, urbanists and urbanists.This is the discourse and political project of the Art and Architecture Network (2009-ongoing). It was initiated by the Curator Relations International (2008-09) and the Barbican Arts Centre (2008-11). It was supported by the Arts Council of Great Britain and the Barbican Foundation. The debate on whether the Art and Architecture Network should be a registered charity, or whether it should engage in advocacy work, centered on whether the vast amount of funding available from the federal government should be directed to arts and culture or other areas. The Arts Council submitted a proposal that the organisation should engage in both. However, the proposal was not taken up by the board, which instead proposed that the organisation should work directly with local authorities to establish collaborative arts councils, citing the example of Liverpool Biennial, which has been a leader in supporting arts education and infrastructure. Liverpool Bi</text>

But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of history, culture, economics and politics into account, while enabling those who wish to explore these issues in their chosen future location. This is the paradigm shift that needs to happen in order to truly understand and address the new normal.There are of course, limits to this paradigm shift. The boundaries we build and build upon may evolve and change in relation to the desires and interests of the dominant society. And yet, the fundamental premise of such collaborations remains the same: there is a need to understand and address the radically different worlds of a city and a country, and of course, the built environment that is also a central part of these societies. It is this interconnection and interdisciplinarity that is needed for such radical transformations to happen, and this requires a fundamentally different paradigm shift than the one being sought. Our current economic and political paradigm shifts in relation to the built environment and the cities, but the central premise remains unchanged: the need to understand and address the built environment in order to create</text>

This would mean working with cities, states, nations, international organizations and cultural institutions, to name only a few. But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of access to resources and politics into account, and ensuring that those with skills and knowledge contribute effectively to creating the future that we desire. This would mean collaborating with communities not on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status, but rather of their ability to create, participate actively and creatively in a shared future.This sounds utopian, even radical, but it is also true that many technological advances in the past half century will likely be absorbed into the physical world. We are becoming more electronic, more connected and more aware of everything around us. We also inhabit ever larger and more complicated virtual worlds, which means that many technological advances made in the past are not necessarily reversible. Still, many technological advances will occur, and these can be embraced and utilized, provided that they do not negate the work and labor that went into creating the technology. For instance, it is easy to forget that computers were originally written in assembly language, and that computers began as simple programming languages. It is also</text>

This would mean working with cities, states, nations, international organizations and cultural institutions, to name only a few. But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of politics, religion, economics, education and more into account when working with such entities. Such a move would mean forging new relationships with communities, engaging with older histories, forging new skills and relying less on the authority of the state. It would mean engaging not in the arena of art and art history, but that of life, moving beyond the art school and art setting and beyond the gallery and museum. For many artists, this would mean abandoning the notion of the artist as a unique source of inspiration and seeking instead to find ways to connect with people and create lasting change through their participation in everyday life.  The artist as a unique source of inspiration might mean engaging with the idea of the collective rather than the individual, and that of the collective rather than in the abstract.  The collective would mean engaging not in the arena of art and art history, but that of life, including the state. It would mean learning from those who have been involved in the past in creating futures based on the accumulation of</text>

But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of self-healing, bioplastics and their complex systems of codes into consideration.In the current period, we are witnessing a concomitant rise in self-healing technologies, including biofuels, which are becoming more complex and resource-efficient with each step, and autonomous vehicles, which avoid the need for large infrastructure projects and industrial processes in favour of the need for relatively cheap fuel cells and other low-emission technologies. It is important to note that many of these advances are also tied to the development of ever larger, more encompassing corporates – art institutions, media corporations and even state-owned enterprises. This linkage cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is imperative that art institutions and their communities of supporters, whether in the form of patrons, artists, writers or in any other way, actively participate in the development of new technologies and in their development, not just passively passively passively passively.This would require something more than the current curatorial call of a few selected artists and</text>

This would mean working with cities, states, nations, international organizations and cultural institutions, to name only a few. But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of habitation, culture, language and more into our own hands. This would mean embracing not only the practices and ideologies of our current and past inhabitants, but also those of other species, and introducing elements of their socio-cultural histories and cultures.This sounds like something from a dystopian science-fiction novel, or perhaps something similar might be possible with the right technological augmentations. Nevertheless, there is a sense of desperation and an urgent need to come to grips with the changing forms of AI and the consequences of its implications for culture and humanity, both in terms of lost futures and the capacities with which we inhabit those futures. This call to confront the new AI is not from a dystopian, scientific-fiction sense, but from a sense of essential humanity and urgent need.There is also a danger that the new AI may be created in ways that are indistinguishable from those of the human species, and that we may not be able to distinguish between good and evil, honour and dishonesty, technology and non-</text>

But it would also mean collaborating with communities, incorporating local knowledge and taking the lead, taking matters of information and technology beyond the reach of the state and corporate power. This would mean collaborating with artists, producing works that speak with artists’ ear, and allowing the artists to determine how those ears should be used. It would mean engaging with the politics of information and how artists can be empowered in this context. Perhaps the key to unlocking new capacities and horizons for artists and the community as a whole may lie in the ability to understand and work with biennial forms and their members, and in the ability to imagine alternatives and create new models of community engagement.

It would mean questioning the nature of cultural production, and perhaps even the nature of art itself. It would mean questioning the role of artists and the relationship between the arts and professions, and perhaps even the role of the artist. It would mean coming to terms with the technological singularity, and the changing nature of art’s relationship to artistic and artistic-related labour. It would mean questioning how art and the artist are placed in the social totality, and in particular, how the social totality may be constituted through the coming to exist of new kinds of social relationships between humans and non</text>

As new technological paradigms are put forward, and diverse social uses are envisaged, it is vital that the interests of artists, and the communities they work with, are taken into consideration. It is also essential that these interests are expressed in artworks that are accessible to a wide range of people, and are representative of the communities in which they take place. In the 21st century, this is increasingly evident in the form of innovative public art programmes developed and managed by local or regional authorities, funded through tax-deductible donations and places of incorporation. The local chamber of commerce and tourism is often cited as an example of a successful contemporary art project that is representative of its area. Unfortunately, many chamber of commerce and tourism representatives do not represent the area well, or represent their area well in the way that artists or the community might wish.</text>

In other words, the contemporary curatorial perhaps needs artists and the communities they inspire to take the project further, and perhaps create new ways of organising art and art-making within a given context. In short, the contemporary curatorial gesture may require a degree of self-awareness and self-awareness beyond the reach of the artist or artist-organisation.I suggest that the curatorial is the place to start when considering what kind of contribution can be made by artists and communities to an ongoing or newly-formed project in the context of such a project. It is a place where a given project’s success or failure can be attributed to factors other than the intrinsic qualities of the art, or, for instance, the ability of a given artist or community to communicate effectively with audiences outside of their organisation. It is also a place where a given project may or may not result in a new art project being born.  In a broader sense, then, the contemporary curatorial is a ‘placeholder’ – a point at which art is able to evolve and which can be modified by later generations of artists and curators.

In other words, the contemporary curatorial perhaps needs artists and the communities they inspire to take the project further, and perhaps create new ways of organising art and art-making within already politicised contexts. This ongoing process of creating and maintaining an awareness of new technologies and professions of art is often misconstrued as a technocratic gesture of empowerment, in which cases the participants in the project are often depicted as brilliant, innovative and powerful individuals. However, it is important to distinguish between the activities of artists and artisans, and the activities of artifice or craftspeople. The artists and labourers engaged in the development of autonomous modern art are engaged in creating a visible and distinctive mark on the landscape, and thereby instigating a conversation or sparking a debate with the city. They are creating a kind of infrastructure through which projects can be developed and art can be produced. Yet while the technologies may be creative, their real intent and purpose is often defined by vested interests and powerful political actors. The autonomous modern curatorial gesture is defined by the political scientist David Harvey as: ‘a political design that seeks to reconcile conflicting visions of the future with shared values</text>

In other words, the contemporary curatorial perhaps needs artists and the communities they inspire to take the project further, and perhaps create new ways of organising art and social change through the creation of socially engaged art.Art has a social purpose beyond its practical purposes, and so too does its socialisation. In her research on the Marginalised Community, artist and activist Fatma Al Sahlawi makes the observation that although the arts have often been relied upon to intervene in the dynamics of social struggle, their cultural dimensions are often disregarded or rendered passive. She proposes that since the direct involvement of the arts in producing social change is often considered a marginal practice, the contemporary curatorial may find its rhetorical strategy to question cultural marginalisation in the public sphere especially problematic. Al Sahlawi’s research has revealed that the participation of local communities in shaping cultural and political change is often overlooked or rendered redundant by the need to be seen as culturally responsive. For instance, in the UK, the political aims of art institutions have often been coloured with the intervention of local communities, who have often been mobilised into political parties in order to ensure access to resources and</text>

In the case of the autonomous modern curatorial gesture, the potential outcomes of such projects are often more positive and transformatory than the creators imagine they will be.In the case of the contemporary modern curatorial gesture, the potential interactions between artists, curators and art professionals are innumerable, and the potential outcomes of which need to be considered in the context of any such initiatives. However, the potential interactions between artists, curators and art professionals also need to be considered in the context of any future social programs, and particularly in the context of a possible transition to a post-capitalist world. It is crucial that the social, environmental and even political is given place in a future social programs, and that the functions of art as a ‘public good’ are properly understood and distributed. The rise of the biennale – which has emerged as a replacement for the antiquated colonial and frontier shows – is a good example of how to ensure that the social</text>

It is a function of the current political, economic and social circumstances within a given country and society, and it is dependent on a number of interrelated factors. In the context of the crisis of the capitalist global value form, and with the apparent liberation of large numbers of artists and their artists' labour from the constraints of capitalist circulation, the contemporary curatorial may wish to expend scarce public funds and resources in ways that further the interests of capital, and may wish to actively intervene in the cultural life of other nations and cultures. In such a scenario, the autonomous modern curatorial could invest in cultural institutions in other nations, and perhaps, branch out into cultural activities in other cities or regions. A city or city block could, in turn, provide cultural resources to other regions or nations, such as financial support or even free cultural practices. Such cultural resources could then be used to support the development</text>

It is not enough to offer artistic services to the community or art institution at a reduced cost. One has to actively engage with the community in order to change the institutions and take the project further. If the community does not want or cannot be drawn into a given project, alternatives must be explored. This is why it is so critical that projects be driven by artists whose identity is in fact in the community. The term ‘community’ encompasses the social, economic and spatial dimensions of the project, and artists have a responsibility to actively engage with, and even to become enmeshed in, such projects. This is why it is so important that the artist has a long-term relationship with the community. The stronger the personal connection, the more likely the artist is to be engaged and the more likely the project is to be successful. It is also why it is so critical that the artist</text>

Unfortunately, this projective process often entails a conflict of interest between the artist and the community (whether artist or community), community and community of artists, and community and artist. In such cases, artists are often required to compromise artistic freedom in order to achieve social change. This projective logic, although sometimes well-intentioned, often exerts a great deal of political and economic control over how artists are recruited, situated and ultimately employed within socially engaged art worlds.  [1] See Christopher Booker, The Art of Not Being Governed: Participatory Art as a Framework of Governance, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1982, and the author's own New York Times best-seller The Wealth of Humans: The Art of Not Being Governed, Verso, London, 1988.Download this article as PDFChristopher BookerChristopher Booker is the Distinguished Professor of Socially Engaged Art History and Director of the Centre for Art and Social Inquiry, Johns Hopkins University,</text>

But the autonomous modern curatorial gesture raises questions that go beyond the confines of art and community. How do artists regulate their political use of cultural resources? Who has the legal right to define what is and is not art? Who has the legal right to dictate what is and is not considered art? Who has the legal right to monitor and control artistic practices? Who has the legal right to claim ownership of one’s work? Who has the legal right to unilaterally determine what counts as art? Who has the legal right to unilaterally deprive others of their rightful ownership of cultural resources? Who has the legal right to unilaterally end a project?

In the case of the autonomous modern curatorial gesture, art is often misused and abused by politically connected artists, but the artist or artist(s) behind the project are often quite unaware of this misuse and utilisation. This is because the political connectedness of contemporary art today is such that it is impossible to draw a critical eye away from art’s social impact. In the age of the ubiquitous image, social networking and the connectedness of all forms of media, it is much more difficult to imagine the negative social impacts of art’s ubiquity; however, once these become apparent, the art’s cultural capital tends to be depleted, and its use is much more readily reclaimed by politically connected artists, museums and even the new urbanisation agencies that seek to profit from them. This is particularly true for socially engaged and artistically inclined artworks, such as those created with the hashtag #CommunityArt or those</text>

It emerged as a critical platform for the study and contemplation of art and design within a socially engaged context, and its activities during this period are indicative of a globalisation that is increasingly focused on the service of art and aestheticisation rather than the intrinsic value of the artist’s work.

Both theoretical and empirical studies have shown a correlation between increasing numbers of people with access to knowledge and an increase in aesthetic standards. This relationship has been shown by numerous lines of evidence to be causal, from the increasing numbers of novels published in the years immediately following the Second World War to the number of paintings produced by contemporary artists after the biennale in Venice in 2011. 	</text>

The curatorial turn can be quite unsettling, as in the case of Transmission Gallery’s foray into the toxic locales of Liverpool, where the gallery was met with violent opposition from residents and the press. The press, it turned out, were not fools; in the years that had lapsed between the outbreak of the First World War and the outbreak of the Second, the English language was being systematically corrupted by a disreputable ‘second’ branch of Islam.

For many in the public gallery, the impulse to patronise the art exhibit in the hope of finding answers to thornier questions was repugnant. But the impulse to patronise the common, to connect the public with the common, was, for many in the gallery, more distressing. The gallery was a problematic site for many in the 1920s, but it would be equally problematic today. The curatorial turn has become something of a trademark of the modern, postindustrial society; questions of economic power, social values and urbanisation are the order of the moment. As a gallery, the curatorial turn has become something of a luxury good, something that can be purchased and indulged in. Curator Cai Wen, whose career began in the 1930s, is a case in point. His interest in social and political change came through in his curatorial style. A keen collector, he wanted to help the downtrodden and disenfranchised; to that end, he established a host of community collectives in which to dole out goodies to the more powerful. As well as handing out food and shelter, the collectives often promoted</text>

For many in the public gallery, the impulse to patronise the art exhibit in the hope of finding answers to thornier questions was repugnant. But the impulse that day in 1987 was not a straight British jingoistic quest for gold in the wake of the First World War, nor was it some kind of religious jingoistic mission. It was a curatorial one, and it came from above. So much of the curatorial turn is predicated on the assumption that the audience is on a defined trajectory – somewhere on that trajectory, somewhere in the future, somewhere in between – that it is difficult to imagine any other curatorial turn. The important thing is that the audience is there, and that they come to see something that way. The question is what action can be taken from the audience at that moment – action that is willing to be taken and that has the capacity to be taken.And that is precisely what the curatorial turn does. It allows the audience to be moved, to be moved by the artist, to be entertained by something new, to be taken somewhere, somewhere else. It does not build up a narrative of</text>

For many in the public gallery, the impulse to patronise the art exhibit in the hope of finding answers to thornier questions was repugnant. For others in the gallery, the impulse was to rebel against the oppressive machine that was dismantling the commons. The press, it turned out, were not foolhardy either. The impulse to patronise the art display was a reaction to the perceived excesses of the economic machine, while the press were accused of being wedded to austerity. The press, it turned out, were not so easily persuaded. In the end, the impulse to patronise the art display came about because the impulse to patronise the stock market had already arrived. When the economic crash of 2008 hit, it was obvious that the financial sector was far more interested in collateralising its largesse with debt than it was in actually reforming the financial sector. The financial sector could always be counted on to deliver, and so the tendency was to build ever more extravagant new ways of organising the commons. The press, by contrast, tended to notice when projects were actually happening, and to point fingers at those who were in power. The</text>

For many in the public gallery, the impulse to patronise the art exhibit in the hope of finding answers to thornier questions was repugnant. But there was no love lost between critics and wealthy patrons. The critics were (along with many other art historians) beginning to consider the wisdom of collaborating with artists who operated economically, providing the galleries with resources to support independent arts production, and (on condition that the arts organisations they supported continue to operate) encouraging socially engaged and ‘add it your own way’ cultural practice. The wealthy patrons, on the other hand, were (until fairly recently) refusing to engage with the art in a meaningful way. They felt that they had enough on their plates, which was to say, with few exceptions (most of them non-mainstream, that is), and so (with the occasional notable exception) they tended to ignore the arts outside of the gallery. Contemporary art was often written off as frivolous or frivolous-looking, or ‘ill-conceived by curators who’d tend to over-engineer art’, and (with the rare few exceptions) the critics</text>

For many in the public gallery, the impulse to patronise the art exhibit in the hope of finding answers to thornier questions was repugnant. For others, the impulse was to turn away. Not all the critiques that emerged during the war were drawn up in the pub, or in a literary journal, or in a pamphlet handed out by the National Front, or in a typical art and photography exhibition. Rather, the various writers and artists that formed the curatorial team came to these things from different points of view, and from different contexts. As a curatorial gesture, the exhibition was an art project – a kind of ‘art’’ in its own right – but it also sought to interrogate certain underlying assumptions and political struggles that were playing out in the city. As such, the curatorial turn was a factor that simultaneously accentuated certain artists’ gifts and simultaneously marked them as problematic. It was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the curatorial turn sometimes brought with it a critical veneer. On the other, the weight of this scrutiny could sever some artists’ relationships with the</text>

But for the gallery, the impulse to patronise the common – to share, to share in common – was also repugnant. The press, they insisted, were the voice of reason. The press were wrong on both counts. The press were not angels.But the press were also not always so wrong. As the Chisenhaleys show shows, the tendency for the arts to be conditioned by the needs and preferences of a larger social context is much more complex than initially realised. The cultural logic of the 20th century is testament to the fact that, in the social, economic and political context in which the arts were created, extraordinary acts of love (including the love of Sophie Hope) were required. It was not just a matter of individuals coming together and acting out a shared love in their artwork; there was also a cultural context that had to be created. In the 20th century, this cultural context was produced through the mechanisms that modern economics and the service</text>

The impulse to patronise the gallery as a whole, to understand its meaning and purpose, was not.  The public gallery may not yet be able to offer that kind of understanding, but it has every opportunity now that it shifts its gaze to the city. It exhibits the same exhibition on a weekday afternoon, for instance, and many in the public gallery flock there to take part in the informal ‘curatorial duel’ between journalists and locals that follows the show.

The impulse to ignore the art, and instead to seek out the most insidious means of subverting the commons – to buy the most pernicious of propaganda – was, for many, downright perversely comforting. Indeed, the impulse to distort the common good seems to be a core tenet of the British curatorial creed.  So much of the postwar biennial – which is to say, much of the needling we provide to one another as we bid on the other’s carcass – is predicated on the notion that one of us is going to be able to point to some kind of noble accomplishment in which we’re collectively grafted. And as much as we want to deny it, we’re all, by virtue of having been placed in the same society, also part of a social group, that is, in turn, a core tenet of the social group.  So much of what we do as fellow citizens is predicated on the</text>

His father was an auto worker. After graduating from Monterrey’s aviation school, Benito attended the University of Texas, where his major was in Metallurgy. There he met María Elena Jara, an artist and a former mechanic. She instilled a love of art into her son that he would later commission her to create a mural for the Doha Tower, Qatar 2022, which she did, painting scenes from the cityscape in various styles. In her own words, Jara: ‘painted architecture with the fragmented remains of a fragmented society; built public parks and squares with the ruins of a fragmented present; and commissioned a retrospective from Monterrey, Qatar, at the very peak of its construction industry.’  Her</text>

The impulse to fetishise the local over the nationalistic in search of common ground was being challenged by a more assertive and visible version of itself.  The press were as aware of this as anyone else. As one newspaper columnist put it so poignantly, in a line that would have been straight out of Mao’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: ‘Great Proletarian’ is the first letter of the new name that will be given to this bloody process of collectivisation.’  The tendency towards the contemporaneous expansion of national identity was manifest in all its guises, and the publication of a daily newspaper with links to wider cultural practices was a central tenet of the new orthodoxy.  The tabloid form that had put the tabloid journalist at ease came to be seen as inherently unreliable, and the tabloid era was characterised by tabloid journalism as a tendency towards the realisation of fantasies of grandeur.

Part two will address the history of the Biennale in Venice, and Part Three will cover the cultural and urban landscape of the Italian capital.The Biennale is a very specific type of event, and its definition is made explicit in the Art Biennale Act of 1987 –  	arts’ biennales are events where art is more or less conspicuously present and conspicuous – as a requirement of the Venice Biennale Commission, which was, until 1986, the supreme legislative authority in Italy. Art biennales are organised by and with the city in mind as its institutionalised form, and with the city as a site of institutionalised creativity as the institutionalised essence. The Biennale Commission is an important element of this institutionalisation. It is the institutionalised second-tier authority in Rome, and it sees itself as the inheritor of the right to organise and to define the terms and parameters of the event, as well as the authority to tax, regulate and to control (to a greater or lesser extent) the content and form of the activity as well as the</text>

It was founded in 1920 by archivist Pietro Lami, and is managed by the Art Space Foundation. It is a non-profit organisation that is autonomous in its activities, with full financial accountability. Its mandate is reflected in its charter: ‘To promote, jointly and severally, the aesthetic, geographical, historical and scientific interests of the art world’ in Venice’s Old Port, and the wider region surrounding it. The Biennale has staged numerous public acts of remembrance and commemoration, including the 2016 Venice Biennale, entitled ‘Venezia di Legge' (The Venice of Letters), which documented the Italian diaspora’s role in the development of Venice, and the 2017 Venice Biennale, entitled ‘Nadine Di Scalizia’s Lens: Photography and Ec</text>

The idea that the biennale could be taken as a cultural artefact is being actively promoted by the architectural firm Skidmore, Owsley and Associates, which is headed by Nick Draper. The firm’s cultural strategy is to position the biennale as a ‘citizen cultural institution’, commissioned by the Biennale by highlighting the historical, architectural and urban histories of the city, and commissioning artists to produce ‘a legacy of architecture and urbanity’ through ‘architecture’ they have created in the city. The proposal is that the biennale, through its physical presence, cultural artefacts and recurrent events, has the capacity to exert a persistent ‘direct action’ on the city's spatial and temporal conditions, creating ‘a new kind of urbanity’.

The name stuck, and it stuck. The Biennale has become synonymous with the act of seeing art, something that is in fact often enjoyable, freeing, even a little liberating. The Biennale is a term that not many people knew existed, and not many people cared. It was just another institution: a way to fund a show, or book, or museum. But the fact that the Biennale is now a multimillion-dollar business, and is involved in so many different forms across so many different cities, is a term that people are starting to use more. And part of the reason is that the Biennale, like so many other art institutions at the time, was too embedded in its form to be taken seriously anymore. It was absorbed into the larger culture of art</text>

Part two will cover the political landscape of the city in the years leading up to and including the biennale. Biennales, which began as civilian curiosities, have now turned into institutionalised forms, with a central place in the management of the cultural resources of the city. Overwhelmingly, they are staged in the museums. Only a few years into the twenty-first century, it seems to me that the biennale is the major cultural resource of the city, and its cultural resources are the stuff that allow the biennale to exist within the cultural logic of the city. This shift in the cultural logic of the city is largely a function of the development of the biennale as an institution, not of any other factor, such as the biennale itself. Biennials have become large in part because the city has become, thanks to the tireless work of the Cultural</text>

Individual groups of artists are now able to create their own worlds, taking root in the historical narrative and embedding themselves in the organisationally necessary development of the city. These new forms of ‘artificial intelligence’ are able to understand, speak through and take part in the organisation of large-scale public works, and they are able to imagine ever more complex scenarios involving the ever-broadening web of cultural and urban resources.  A new exhibition format was introduced to deal with the growing number of mega art collections, and this included a proliferation of curatorial approaches and interventions. These ranged from the relatively subtle (the group held its current exhibition in the British Museum, New York) to the more conspicuous (the group’s mission statement).

The logic of the new exhibition format is to ask: how to live with ‘art from the perspective of an ‘art institution’? The logic of the new curatorial policy is to create parallel structures for different times, places and social groups, and to each have equal value and weight. However, the ‘art institution’ that is the subject of the new format needs to actively engage with the social world of the contemporary art world, because it will be the most able to inhabit the new ‘period of the inchoate and the displaced’. If the art is to be taken seriously, and to become the desired object of desire of the contemporary artist, then it will have to address the complexities of the contemporary art world.

This exhibition forms part of a two-year research project, ‘Magic in the Attic: Structures of Magic’, into how human culture comes to dominate the natural landscape. For this exhibition, the curators invite artists from different disciplines to engage with the same themes through a cultural production that seeks to understand how we inhabit familiar spaces of experience, magic and symbols. The curators also invite in-depth look at their field of research, with artists, scholars, writers and others providing critical perspectives.

This is particularly relevant given the significantly more prominent place that the Trump administration is placing in relation to the research project.  The new exhibition format also allows us to interrogate the specificity of the role of the individual projects involved in the research project. For this, we have to consider what is meant by the word ‘instrumental’ in relation to the group of projects that we are talking about. We can define the word as follows: ‘In the past, when instruments were created, they served a critical role in a society: in a modern society, they play a pivotal role in the production and consummation of culture.’  A key question for the future, then, is how to expand the word’s range and how it can incorporate the diverse forms of cultural production that are taking place in a city.

I turned down the job because I didn’t feel I had the expertise or the connections to push this through. It wasn’t a decision I made lightly, but rather something that had to be weighed up carefully. The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was the Museum of Modern Art in its way of organising exhibitions, and yet somehow the two bodies couldn’t seem to find common ground. In the end, the Museum of Modern Art in New York staged its own exhibition of 20th Century Art, which was a good event for that particular area of the city. It marked the start of a relationship that would last a very long time, and would lead to exhibitions of that area of the museum, and perhaps even to exhibitions of the museum itself. That is, the museum as a museum, rather than the museum as a museum of art. Art, then, is a museum of relations, and the art director is part of a team that includes artists, historians, artists and other stakeholders that have a long-term interest in the past but also the potential to influence the future. The team that produced El Alamein, Sofía Olascoaga-Dublin, Pablo Amorim, Rod</text>

The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was El Alamein. If the Museum of Modern Art wasn’t interested in what happened in the past, how would the Museum of Modern Art act? I don’t think there was a consensus on this, and at the time, I didn’t see how much the Museum of Modern Art would change its approach to art after 2020. There were also questions about how the Museum of Modern Art would react to a city that is home to some of the most representative examples of modern art? Will the Museum of Modern Art be able to represent its own cultural past in a meaningful way? These were the kinds of things that came up in the curatorial race. It’s hard to imagine how the Museum of Modern Art would act in the same way now, but the notion that there is such a thing as the Museum of Modern Art did influence how the Museum of Modern Art operated. It captured that moment in time, and so moved us forward. This is what the Museum</text>

The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was the Museum of Art, and so on. At the time, the Museum of Modern Art was thinking about a new director, and so was the Museum of Art, who at the time was thinking about a new head of art. The art directors at the Museum of Art, in their own way, were being asked to take on larger roles in the Museum of Modern Art, and so the Museum of Art was thinking about a head of art who would play a bigger role in the Museum of Modern Art. Both the art directors and the museum directors had to feel that they were contributing something to the project, and so they were figuring out how to do it together. The problem with the biennial is that it shrinks the biennial: it shrinks the institution as a whole, which is why it takes so long for a biennial to show in the Museum of Art, and why it takes so long for a biennial to show in the Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art.</text>

The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was the Museum of Art in New York. If I was to be a curator, I would want to be able to connect with people on a different wavelength than I had before, and so the Museum of Modern Art was already set in my mind before I went there, whereas the Museum of Art in New York wasn’t set in my mind at all. The Museum of Art in New York has a mission statement that anyone who comes there to take part in an exhibition has to understand. If that mission statement isn’t understood by the participants, then that wouldn’t be a Revolution. If it’s not understood by the museum, then that would be a museum. If it’s not understood by the city, then that is a paradox. If it isn’t understood by the community then it doesn’t happen; that is, it doesn’t connect with people. That was the paradox of the New Museum in the 1980s – the</text>

The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was the Museum of Art in the United States. The Museum of Modern Art was a museum of images, whereas the Museum of Art in Amsterdam was more interested in the art of the present. Thus the Museum of Modern Art in both Amsterdam and the Museum of Art in the United States was engaged in what Philip Sternberg would later describe as a hybrid ‘monumental interest in the present’.3  This merger of interests and modes of cultural production didn’t happen overnight, but over the next 20 years or so, artists and curators in most cities that still maintained a Museum of Modern Art started to form part of a biennale that became a full-fledged museum of images and multimedia art. Curators in other cities started to form part of a curatorial triennale that became a full-fledged museum of architecture and design. Meanwhile, in cities such as Liverpool, the Museum of Transport and Travel took on a new significance as the museum of transport and travel.</text>

The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was the Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, and so on. If you were to ask me to explain the difference between the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Amsterdam, I would say that the Museum of Modern Art in Amsterdam had a much broader mission, whereas the Museum of Contemporary Art in New York was focused on the art of the present and the art of the future. And here it is: the Museum of Contemporary Art in New York is a museum of modern art, and the Museum of Modern Art in Amsterdam is a museum of art from the future. It is a museum of the present, but it is also a museum of the future. This is a very interesting notion to me, that the Museum of Contemporary Art in New York can be both contemporary and futuristic, whereas the Museum of Contemporary Art in Amsterdam is contemporary and futuristic, although I admit that I don’t know what the difference is between these two kinds of museum. Maybe it is that</text>

The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was El Alamein, with its long history of socialist curating and its long-standing commitment to the practices and causes of peace and social activism. While El Alamein was building its contemporary practice, the Museum of Modern Art was building itself. A shift in cultural logic could have a profound effect. I don’t think it happened, but it could have. And when the Museum of Modern Art closed, some people in the city felt like they were no longer part of the Museum of Modern Art, and so there was that cultural fragmentation that followed. Nowadays, when people talk about the Museum of Modern Art, they often mention how much it symbolises the end of the twentieth century. It was the Museum of Modern Art after theÂ Museum of Contemporary Art, after the Museo de Arsenale, after the Performances on the Plaza, and it is part of the reason why, although it may be a bit late, people still associate the Museum of</text>

The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was El Alamein. It was a museum of the past, in the sense that it was pre-academic, pre-institutionalising itself as a museum of the past. The challenge then became how to embed the current collections and present exhibitions in a modern context, while creating ways to incorporate the emergent culture of the future in the museum. Today we would say that the Museum of Modern Art is a museum of the present, and the Museum of Contemporary Art perhaps a museum of the future; there is a gap between the two. But the Museum of Modern Art is a museum of the past, and the Museum of Contemporary Art might well be a museum of the future. At the same time, the Museum of Modern Art could well be a museum of the past, and the Museum of Contemporary Art might well be a museum of the future.  	The Museum of Modern Art is the museum of the present; the Museum of Contemporary Art might well be the museum of the future.</text>

The Museum of Modern Art was already set in its ways, and so was El Mugele, so the Museum of Modern Art had already made up its mind about who was a curator and who wasn’t. Now that decision-making has shifted and intersected with that of the Museum of Modern Art, which is now trying to figure out what to do with the curatorial changes that have been occurring in the city. The Museum of Modern Art has a curatorial council that meets monthly, while the MMM is a non-profit organisation that also has a curatorial council that meets monthly. Both the curatorial and the non-profit bodies that comprise the museum are trying to work through how to take part in a cultural revolution that is occurring simultaneously at home and abroad, and so they’re both looking for engagement. The curatorial council is trying to figure out what to do with the skill-set that has been given to it by the Museum of Modern Art, which is now trying to figure out what to do with the skills that have been given</text>

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of neo-Nazis. The film's producers saw an opportunity to make some noise by staging a protest at the Greek Theatre in Venice, where the film was shot, in which ‘thousands’ of people showed up. The neo-Nazis were mobilised and the ‘infrastructures’ moved. Protesting against the ‘Islamification of French Culture’, which they said was taking place in France, these artists argued that the theatre, having played host to the French film industry for decades, should also host a ‘re-constituting Islamic theatre’. These gestures were as futile as they were provocative. The far right didn’t win any converts among artists or the cultural establishment. But the fact that such art could potentially be made in a context where bigotry is rife speaks to the urgent need to be reminded of the true nature of the threat posed by prejudice.

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of Christians. In the film, a character called ‘Bakri Laila’ speaks in terms that are almost entirely apocalyptic. He calls on Muslims to ‘purge this place … of nonbelievers’ (it’s unclear whether he means nonbelievers in general, or those who engage in this particular nonbeliever’s faith). These terms could not be further from the sentiments of the vast majority of humanity, which is simply repressed or suppressed in many parts of the globe. So there is a tension there – clearly, there is a tension there – that is built into the very nature of cultural production. That is, if you can call it that.But the fact remains that the proliferation of cultural texts, the constant re-purposing of cultural spaces, the constant rewriting of cultural histories – these things are part of the equation, and they are part of the overall system that creates the conditions for human behaviour.

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of Christians in order to fulfill a prophecy. The film depicted the massacre of over 1,000 innocent people in cold blood. When the video came out, it triggered a wave of violence against the people of Tunisia who were perceived to be associated with the film. The Tunisian government responded by outlawing ‘video …’ in almost every public place, stripping citizens of their rights to assemble, and imposing harsh penalties, including mandatory life imprisonment. The anti-Islam film Innocence of Muslims became an object of political protest in Tunisia and around the world. It was a viral success story, met with critical acclaim, and generated tremendous attention in the cultural world. As the New York Times wrote at the time: ‘The film … has become a rallying cry for those seeking to undermine religious identity and promote secular humanistic values. Its release … sends a signal that violence and repression are not optional.’  The film also triggered a wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and racism in Europe</text>

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of Christians in order to make Christians ‘the victims’ of an oppressive satanic blasphemy law. Christian communities all over Europe began mobilising, sending flags and parading around in big, Christian-emblazoned procession, demanding answers from the local authorities. In a gesture of good faith, the local authorities in Tunisia turned down the film, believing that the events depicted in the film were simply a fantasy. They staged a ‘false flag’ operation in order to justify a military intervention that would return Osama bin Laden to power.The false flag operation was a masterful piece of theatre, full of imagery and a manifesto of hate. It was also a masterful piece of computer programming. In the film, the protagonists are commissioned by an AI to create a tool that declares war on a fictional ­terrorist organisation, the Taliban. The film is shot in such a way that the Taliban can never win, and yet somehow the fictional Taliban never win. The end result is a form</text>

For many in the film, the characters are executioners, but the ‘real life’ is marked by persecution and conflict. As the journalist Christoph Buchelsohn puts it: ‘The real story of the Holocaust is the opposite of an Internet movie: it’s around planning and managing a deliberate loss of life.’ This makes sense, doesn’t it? The Internet feeds us with ever more information, enabling us to become more immortal – immortal in the sense that we can always find a way to round up more data to feed into the network – but it comes with a price. The price is a price to absorb, to master, to absorb the meaning of what has been captured.’ This is the story of Indonesia, and it is the story of the world as a whole.Download this article as PDFLorida-based artist Jennifer Corcoran works from Port Harcourt, Florida, where she lives with her partner</text>

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of Christian extremists. I went to Venice that year, and part of my research was conducted in the small town of Lugano, where the mass murderer Charles Fouad was executed in unusually graphic fashion. I spent several weeks trapped in the small town, surrounded by Fouad’s belongings, in a small villa owned by a Christian mob. It was there, in the wake of the massacre, that I discovered that the film I was working on, La Repubblica, had just been pulled from the Italian video rental market. It had been re-released months earlier by a different company, and since then had been rented out on Vimeo. The irony of the situation was not lost on me. While I was researching the massacre in Tunisia, the director Steven Soderbergh was filming in Casablanca, Morocco.

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of Christian extremists. The film also featured a lot of violence – scenes where mass murderers are punished with crucifixion. The film also contained a lot of cursing. In a way, the release of Innocence of Muslims coincided with the emergence of a certain kind of ‘cultural Islam’ that was beginning to take form in Tunisia. ‘Cultural Islam’ is a word that has several different senses. One senses a return to the primacy of the ancient sense of divine revelation and divine favor (theism), to the primacy of religious feeling over rational judgment (science and reason).’ The other sense is one derived from the Middle Ages: ‘Moral Islam’.’ Moral Islam’s emphasis on individual responsibility and rejection of state violence and oppression derives from the Prophet Muhammed’s (PBUH) proclamation that those who do not believe should either convert or die (Kitab al-bulhan wa al-thaqafa</text>

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of Christian fundamentalists. The film also featured a great deal of violence. In the film, Muhammad Ali is shown torturing a bunch of atheists. The torture scenes were graphic and left audiences with a visceral reaction. But compared to the acts of violence that year in Tunisia, these acts of violence are restrained and contained. Within minutes, the film is silenced. But audiences still experienced this particular event as a work of art. It replayed out in the media, in small and large media, as propaganda, and in the form of debates and commentaries on the Internet. And then there were the riots. These are the moments when art is meant to rouse passions and stir up change. But they are also the moment when the work itself becomes repurposed and dehumanised. That is, the moment when the work becomes a set of practices that have a direct impact on another moment – a moment in time – when the subject is reduced to a set of behaviours. And so, ‘</text>

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of Christian fundamentalists. The film was hugely criticised, both by the Muslim community and by Western cultural critics. I was on the film, and I was in the audience. Suddenly, the whole theatre burst into song. The song was about the killings, but it was also an expression of grief, of sorts.I thought about this a while back when I was in Berlin. A friend and I were walking around the historic Central Station, which is a major part of the city’s transport and cultural complex. Walking past the artist Lars-Peter Suskind, who is a leading proponent of the concept of ‘shared space’ (to me, at least) and is best known for his work with the People’s Park project in Copenhagen. We stopped in the station and took in the history of the station, from its humble arched window to its current configuration as a multi-purpose art institution, home to the Bankers’ Theatre, the Human Geography exhibition</text>

The film played at Cannes that year depicted the killings of hundreds of Muslims by a bunch of Christians in self-defence. It is a chilling film, and I still remember the look on the faces of the Christians, who are portrayed as heretics and terrorists. They are framed as helpless spectators in a vast cosmic contradiction. The film resonates with our present anxieties about the fragility of the human species, about the over-representation of certain religious groups in media representations of the Middle East, and it is a reminder that in the age of the Internet, religion is no longer merely a set of dogmas or taboos; it is a cultural practice that can and does mix with other kinds of discourse.The other kind of cultural practice that comes with the advent of the Internet is what I would call ‘cultural tourism’. This is, I think, a kind of fetishisation of historical sites as tourist attractions. I remember the horror stories from those years of people descending on sites of historical significance in search of meaning or meaning in some way. I don�</text>

    machine learning experiments in the city centre.I have a question that is slightly related to the one you asked me to ask you. The way in which computers are embedded in our lives – embedded in almost everything that we do, and even embedded in the media that we watch – creates an unprecedented amount of dependency. When a computer system encounters a problem that it does not fully understand, it produces unintelligible output. In very practical terms, this is how computers will end up interacting with the world: as media. As computing becomes more pervasive, the problem that it solves becomes more complex – and as a consequence, unintelligible output is produced. This is the world that social scientists are studying. What social scientists are not studying is the world as a media system that produces its problems as video images.In the 1950s and 1960s, social scientists were particularly interested in the ways in which media such as television, radio and cinema could be used to undermine political opposition.

The way in which the media represented social conflict in the 1950s and 1960s is a story that is told many times over in different contexts. For example, in the 1950s and 1960s, the Black Power struggle was often portrayed as a civil rights movement, as white activists sought to establish a public sphere where racial discrimination was addressed in mainstream media. In the popular imagination, the civil rights movement was a movement that sought to undo the damage done by decades of US military and racial apartheid. In the popular imagination, the media represented the resistance. Perhaps the most famous example of this being the sit-in at the California’s Ronald Reagan Building, which was started by California Black Power activists to demand access to the political power brokers that they perceived as having created the national crisis of racial apartheid.During the 1960s and 1970s, social scientists also sought to understand why certain cultures were particularly susceptible to the media-based cognitive campaign known as ‘brainwashing’. The main factors believed to be responsible for this effect were</text>

The way in which the media represented social conflict in the 1950s and 1960s is a story that is well worth revisiting. However, there is a problem with this narrative structure: it is one in which the social becomes the victim, and the media – particularly the visual media – becomes the perpetrator. The visual media that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s is a world that cannot be grasped, and in which the social becomes an object. This is the world that the corporate media produces, and the social media produces, and in that order. The social cannot comprehend it. And this is the world that the media ends up constituting.In the social encounter that occurs during and immediately after a crisis, the loss of objecthood that results from the incorporation of new technologies is palpable. In an article titled ‘How Media Constitutes Social Transformation’, Sello Peso describes the ‘transforming potential of visual media’, which was part of a larger ‘point of departure’ for the project:</text>

The way in which the media represented social life in the 1970s and 1980s is a world that is increasingly similar to the world of social scientists such as myself. In both the media and the social sciences, people are objects that we can manipulate. But the ways in which the media manipulate us are qualitatively very different. I believe that the way in which we construct and consume the media that we create is fundamentally different. The way in which images are produced and distributed across the social networks is fundamentally different. And I believe that the way in which images are produced and consumed in the world is fundamentally different.I would like to suggest two additional questions for your consideration.Questions pertaining to the visualisation of social difference, questions of community. How, for instance, can the visualisation of social difference be brought about through the visualisation of differences in individuals? Questions of language are, by their very nature, universal. In a recent study group for a Ph.D. Theses, a student asked us to imagine in parallel the ways</text>

The way in which the media represented social conflict in the 1950s and early 1960s was through documentary – works that depicted the world through the narrative of a single event, such as a war, a revolution, or a hippie den. During the Vietnam War, the media helped fuel this process by creating a perception of social unrest as part of an overall war effort. During the Black Power movement in the 1960s, the media actively participated in creating a narrative of their own. At the height of the Black Power movement, journalists like Bob McAllister and Carl Williamspropagandrew towards direct action. In the 1970s and 1980s, social scientists such as Angela Everitt Dowd and Donna Harawayk studied how the media might intervene in the social dynamics of the war effort to make it more humane. Aesthetics was also a concern. The aesthetics of the media during this time were heavily influenced by the needs of the state in relation to aesthetics.

The way in which the media represented social life during those decades is one of the ways in which it attempts to obscure social life. But the more that the media distorts social life, the harder it is to engage with the media as a whole. This is why it is so important for artists to engage with the systems that construct the media landscape, because if the distortions are too great, the art that is produced is going to be of the opposite sort: art that exploits the systems that create the media landscape.The other thing about the media that is of equal or greater importance is the role that it plays in creating the conditions that foster or create the conditions for political opposition. And the role that it plays in producing the conditions that foster or create the conditions for political opposition is a kind of planetary mission that is unlike any other. It is, in fact, part of what the media industry does. But the way in which the media industry constructs the social world that it wants to see, and the way in which the social world it</text>

The way in which the media represented social movements in the public arena was that they occurred in ‘black and white’ ‘as opposed to ‘colour’ ‘space’ – a space in which images were understood as representing patterns. In other words, the ‘culture’ that we produce through media is different from what is produced by the social movements that social scientists observe unfolding all around us. The way in which the media produces social change is precisely through the seamless integration of seemingly disparate elements. This is why images of social action are often accompanied by images of assembly lines churning away at Apple’s assembly line. The seamless integration of seemingly disparate elements is the contemporary condition. But what social scientists and artists fail to observe is the systemically produced social change that takes place during these decades of the twentieth century. The social systems that emerged during this century are fundamentally different from those that existed during the petro-rebellion of the 1980s and 1990s. This is a fact of</text>

The way in which the media represented social change in the developing world was a fundamentally different approach. In the 1950s and 1960s, social scientists were particularly interested in the ways in which media such as television, radio and cinema could be used to support progressive politics. The ways in which the media represented social change in the West were largely influenced by the social engineers who worked with and in collaboration with the West on the design of these media systems. The social scientists studying the social impacts of media systems design were mainly interested in how the media interacted with the social construct of identity. In other words, how the media create social conditions in which people become who they inherently are not meant to be.Ethnographic Findings in Comparative Media Studies: Afghanistan and Egypt  (originally published in 2012 in Egypt Today, vol.16, no.1, p.1–24).

The way in which the media represented social conflict in the 1950s and early 1960s is a classic example of this. Popular music and image turning into political activism was part of what social scientists called ‘the social fabric is shifting to accommodate ‘a new social world’. The social fabric is shifting because of what social scientist Norman Vincent Peale and his team of artists did in the 1960s and 1970s: they created what they called ‘negative social images’ and then, through a suite of social science research methods, systematically challenged entrenched ideas about who is and is not a member of society.The question is, then, how can we imagine a different social fabric? What practices do we value more? What are the practices that we would not want to be part of? What are the social contracts that we would rather keep secret?What social scientist would not want to be part of a research project that seeks to understand how images are produced and distributed across a globalised social media ecosystem?

The way in which the media represented social conflict in the 1950s and early 1960s is a story that is told many times over in different forms today: in novels, memoirs, films and documentaries. But the underlying dynamic that emerged was that the social engineers operating the media were engaged in a kind of social war with the people who created the machines. The result was a kind of cognitive de-mystification – a de-emphasis on the abstract, and a consequent increase in the numbers watching films and books. And this is to say nothing of the cognitive priming that the media outlets put on young people and the elderly, promoting a kind of abstract space that is neither here nor there, neither here nor there again.This kind of cognitive de-mystification happens all the time. It is part of the capitalist media binge that millions of people around the world indulge in every day. And it is happening now in parts of China, where people are using social media to share stories of conflict, despair and tragedy. And</text>

The way in which the media represented social and racial change in the United States during the civil rights movement is a prime example of this. Television programmes such as Black or White said it was important to identify with ‘that other half of the equation’ – identifying with the white or black body. Railing against racism and industrial society, Martin Luther King Jr. often used language that sounded more like that of a white nationalist. In one of his famous &quot;I have a Dream’ speech, he used a racialised figure like Malcolm X as an example of how ‘negroes’ can be used to achieve a ‘pure white’.[2]Such language is no exaggeration. Media theorist Norman Browning famously argued that the pure white is the ultimate social good because it results from the production of white images on a massive scale. The problem with the pure white is that it produces its own set of images, and these images are then used by other people to reproduce itself. So the ‘pure white�</text>

It has to have a purpose and it has to be powerful in ways that are sustainable. And in the age of the biennial, the role of the biennial has shifted from being a locus of creativity and a haven of possibility to becoming a site of domination and exploitation.At SNCF we believe that the biennial should be an ever-present presence. And although the biennial itself remains a relatively minor player in terms of the global market, we know that globally-constrained, multi-million-dollar, long-term investment paradigms are developing all around us. We see this in the growth of the biennale schedule, which is dominated by the quest for a new, shiny monolith to be erected in front of the SNCF building in St Petersburg.

In the age of the biennial, the biennial is one of many mediators in a very large political and social field. It is a major player in its field, but also a prop or pawn in a much larger game. When the field that it’s situated within shifts, or, worse, intermingles with the other elements in a political and social system, it can lead to unforeseen and even violent consequences. In many ways, the biennial is the contemporary counterpart of the museum or the old postcard. It represents, in a multitude of formats and media, the contemporaneous condition, the historical moment, and the unpredictable contemporary art of the moment. The biennial is a museum of the contemporaneous, an essential part of a continuously evolving museum. It offers a constant stream of new material for a public to peruse, a self-critical analysis of the contemporaneity of art and humanity, and a place for artists to be present in a constantly evolving, and in many cases very human, material world.Art is made as a commissioning function.

In the age of the biennial, the biennial is one of many mediators in a very large political and social context. It serves as a buffer; it creates the appearance of accessibility, but it also provides the very conditions by which power is greatly distributed. A lot of what is being made today is of a piece with the times; it is new and innovative, but it is also normative and predictable. This is a strategy that has been successful for the biennial and contemporary art in the West; surely, the biennial and its attendant artworks will continue to be a part of the cultural map, and part of our collective self-image, even if we as artists have to work harder to change the narrative that is being told. But the other leg of the cultural strategy is being deployed against us.Art is a Narrative Processor. It tells a story, constructs a set of relations, and then rules over others. But its true value lies in its ability to generate new stories and new understandings of the world through the act of telling them. That is, of course, unless and</text>

In the age of the biennial, the biennial is one of many mediators in a very large political play that is playing out right now in the U.S. and globally. In an ideal world, art should be able to flexibly coordinate with other art forms and tools in a way that is equally effective and equitable. But right now, art is being asked to do things that are arguably more in its interest – to the extent that it is asked to do so at all.The biennial as a cultural form is culturally specific. It is the visual language of the contemporary condition. It is also culturally specific within the cultural system it is part of. In other words, it is culturally responsive to the particular world of contemporary art today. And to be clear, I do not mean ‘chosen’ art; cultural preferences and biases aside, contemporary art is by its very nature relational and dynamic. It is both endemic to the contemporary condition and unique among art forms today.Art has a very good reason to care about the state of its cultural standing in a particular society today. The</text>

In the age of the biennial, the biennial is one of many mediators in a very large political and social context. As the social contract between people is rewritten and contracts are rewritten, the role of the biennial is reshaped. And so the role of the biennial becomes more ambiguous and variable, like many different mediators in the same context. It’s as if the biennial is experiencing a kind of political and economic uncertainty, and the ongoing political uncertainty is creating this ambiguity in ways that make it harder for artists to know what to do with their time.I remember when the biennial first started, and how artists felt about it. I remember a group of artists I was particularly interested in inviting to be part of the research, narrative and writing part of the project because we didn’t think the artist-centred research part of the project would work for the biennial. I remember thinking that the biennial is an inherently political project, and that political engagement is an inherently artist-centered process. I remember thinking that because the biennial is about existence, it</text>

Art has a lot of social and political uses today. It’s a powerful tool, a big one. But its true nature as art has its own set of social and political contingencies. When we stop thinking of the art as a commodity and start thinking of the art as a set of social and political engagements, we can start to imagine alternatives and explore possibilities. This is what art institutions and their curators have done with the biennial and other periodic exhibitions of art and art in the city. They have a reason to show work from time to time, and to mark the presence of art today and in the future.

In the age of the biennial, the biennial is one of many mediators in a very large political and social quagmire. In times of great need, the biennial can function as a spectacular panacea. But as the world wars, revolutions and cultural catallacts around the world that emerged around the biennial in the 1970s and 1980s continue to affect us, the biennial is also one of many victims of a process of cultural catastrophe that needs to be addressed. The biennial is a spectacular myth, though it is an indispensable element of globalised and commodified culture. It provides a conspicuous marker and set of images, a set of symbols and a set of expectations for what art should be. The problem with the biennial is that it becomes increasingly difficult to discern what art is supposed to be in the first place. What was once thought of as the particular art form of the modern human being is being redefined by a process of historical and social transformation that is itself affected by massive cultural flows. The biennial is the modern incarnation of a nineteenth-century form of art</text>

It exploits the contradictions and opportunities of the moment. But it can also be a very dangerous one. In the age of the biennial, the biennial is one of many mediators in a very large political and social system that it supports and facilitates. Its value today is derived from its ability to make political and social changes in a given political context. In the age of the biennial, art today plays a pivotal role in creating and sustaining what S. Daniel Carter calls ‘the shared space’ through which political, economic and social change takes place. In other words, the key to the vitality of the contemporary biennial is in fact its capacity to foster a sense of the shared, interdependent and dynamic contemporary in an otherwise capitalist and static society.This is a difficult, even perilous, task. The biennial is the most widely distributed form of contemporary art sale in a capitalist market. It is the most widely distributed form of contemporary art that is produced in a capitalist economy and circulation. It is a contemporary art commodity that can be bought and sold. It is art that is representative of a given cultural moment. And it is art that is universal. But it is also art that has certain</text>

In the age of the biennial, the biennial is one of many mediators in a very large political and social system. It is a way to include multiple voices and perspectives in a community’s decision-making. The powerful discourse of contemporary art today is infused with a politics of inclusion and a politics of access to material resources. But the biennial, and art in general, is only one voice among many. We need to be able to access resources in a certain way, and to understand the systems that enable that access. We need to be able to access resources in a contextual way, and to participate in a meaningful way in a particular system.Art as social action (a.k.a. social practice) is a relatively new field of study. Its development was a work in progress, as new artists were drawn into the field and as a result of the field’s growth, new artists were drawn into the art of making resources 'move' in a systematic and culturally responsive way. The field of art and social practice has always been a deeply ambivalent space, and</text>

He suggests that we abandon our current obsession with the replacement of workers with algorithms and start thinking of creative, human-like ways of working with materials, labour and energy that are neither cheap nor energy-hungry. He imagines creative solutions to the problems of cities and the planet. Robots will do the heavy lifting, he says, and once they are around, we can start thinking about ways to use their creativity to address not just the problems of poverty and racism and epidemics, but also the problems of war and poverty and ecological destruction.Paul O'Grady’s reflections on the futility of trying to find creative solutions to the problems of urban sprawl are part of a larger article that he wrote for the New York Review of Books titled ‘Us and Them’. In that article, he argues that our age is very much like that of the Industrial Revolution: a golden age of low inflation, massive consumer goods, and unprecedented social mobility. But the social capabilities of the human being require that we constantly reinvent ourselves and find new ways of doing things, so that we can transition from that</text>

The pace of change is exponential.’’But in order to replace a worker with a machine, a worker must overthrow the machine and rise up in rebellion against its growing machine’s societal control.’‘Workers’ own stationary media of production now supports a much broader range of behaviours than did the signal-processing routines of the post-WWII boom.’O'Grady’s metaphor of the resistance is as if the social itself were undergoing a metamorphosis. The circulation and propagation of information itself becomes subject to the whims of the ever-metabolising biotechnology industry. This is to be expected of course. The biotechnology industry exploits natural resources and concepts of value in order to fund research into new drug delivery systems, to name only a few products.

He suggests that we abandon our current obsession with the replacement of workers with algorithms and start thinking of creative, human-like ways of working with the machines. Machines that can think creatively and recreate what they have learned in the workplace, according to O'Grady, would do so not through the mechanisms of capitalism, but through what he calls ‘self-repairing architecture’. Robots would not replace workers, but through what O'Grady terms ‘aural capital’ – the art and artistic expression of machines – they would instead support cultural institutions and inspire new forms of human interaction.Art as a Service, as an ArtformDespite its name, the Artform never intended to replace artists with computers or other technocratic intermediaries. Its focus was artists, curators, writers and other cultural assets, which were increasingly seen as essential to the functioning of the Artform. This was reflected in the increasing privatisation of cultural resources, which in turn became evident in the rise of biennials, or museum-like venues, such as the rise of the biennial as a multi-year</text>

He suggests that we abandon our current obsession with the replacement of workers with algorithms and start thinking of creative, human-like ways of organising the world. These may not be new ideas, but they are new human-like ways of organising the world. And this is the exciting part – thinking outside the box. The implication is that these new ways of organising the world are not necessarily the same as the old, but they could be radically different. This is a radical proposition – one that many in the AI community seem to not want to consider.Instead, Paul O'Grady suggests that we create what might be called a ‘second tier’ of AI: artificial intelligence with moral dimensions. These could be understood as transcending human limits and abilities, and the capacity for nuance and difference. So, AI could lead to new forms of collaboration, new modes of consumption and new social forms. This is the optimistic aspect of the new AI; it envisages a future in which people no longer hold the levers of power but instead use sophisticated algorithms to follow motivations that are driven by deeper forces of history and humanity.</text>

Robots will do the heavy lifting, but humans will remain at the core of the system. Paul O'Grady’s work is based on a life-sized bronze statue he commissioned from the Irish sculptor Patrick McDonnell, who took the job of director of the National Gallery in 1981. The project was a collaboration between The Greek and National Museums of Ireland, and it was the work of a number of artists, including Joan Horvath, Michael Heizer, Brendan O'Connor and others. Like the work, it was a response to the inefficiency and excess of the privatised museum sector, and to some extent of the cultural excess of the post-war period. But unlike the work, it wasn’t a memorial. It wasn’t even a ‘place of remembrance’. It was a location for controversial cultural practices, and it was a den for those who wished to persec</text>

He suggests that we abandon our current obsession with the replacement of workers with algorithms and start thinking of creative, human-like ways of organising the world. For O'Grady, this means abandoning the rigid notion of gender in favour of a more flexible notion of humanity – and replacing humans with systems that think and reason on behalf of humanity.Systems design is a social science, and as such it studies organisational structures and their capabilities. It is a set of procedures and tools that help to organize human behaviour into predictable patterns. A world in which the social functions as much as the natural world would mean replacing the rigid notion of gender, race, class, and economic status with something more flexible, and allowing people to achieve their full potential. Systems design is a social science, and as such it studies how humans create meaning and value in the world through what are essentially utilitarian means. In other words, it concerns what ‘value’ does and how it can be distributed across society.The idea of the natural world as an ever-expanding, evolving and ever-changing virtual landscape has been around for hundreds</text>

Art, he writes, should be produced in ways that are ‘greener and more interesting, that are also more socially useful’. (New York Review of Books, September/October, 2018)I agree with Paul. Robots will do much of the work once we've removed humans from the equation. But I see two problems with the way we think about culture and labour. One is that we tend to associate culture with highly intelligent and creative people – people who can do great things with their bodies. But the other is that we tend to devalue culture as a result of technological change. Art, and the creative act underpinning it, is likely to become more like other types of art forms – machines will do much of the labour – but I also see a danger in that. Art is inherently collaborative, and as artists we’re likely to become less and less able to support ourselves as artists become more and more efficient. That’s</text>

One of the first poems I wrote as a child was a response to Arundhati Roy’s Kipling’s &quot;India’s Daughter’, written for the Hindu deity Shiva. In the poem, a young girl recites the entire Bhagavad-Gita, from beginning to end, in Hindi and Marathi. The entire Bhagavad-Gita is based on a single ayat (divine revelation), from the Hindu mythographer Upaniṣya.

The curatorial poetry would address the present and future of our present and create a new poetic and lyrical present in which all the different readings can find their places. This would enable the curatorial community to take root in the present and anticipate the future, while simultaneously anticipating and addressing the past and creating a new poetic and lyrical present. This is the task of poetry – to understand and to imagine the impossible. This is the poetic dialectic of the spatial and the poetic, as opposed to the more familiar monologue and account. The visitor would sit among the trees among the mistlethlings, receiving a poetic and poetic-like experience of being in the forest, of being in a poetic and poetic forest, of being in a poem by a poet in a poetic and poetic form. This could be understood as a documentary, a true work-in-progress.</text>

The curatorial poetry would address the poetic and the lyrical aspects of the project, while the poetic and the lyrical aspects of the visitor would address the physical and social. The curatorial poetry would be both poetic and scientific, while the curatorial poetry would also be beautiful and heart-wrenching. If there were ever a place for poetic pen and poetry, this would be it. The curatorial poetic aspect would be poetic in its subject matter, while the other would be poetic in its distancing operations. The curatorial poetic element would come through in various places in the exhibition, while the other places would be equally as poetic. The aim of the project, then, is to find a way to reconcile these divergent poetic impulses in a way that brings both the visitor and the reader to places that are equally as sad and beautiful as they are in other places. This is the poetic element of the project – to make the place that we design both physically and metaphorically as one huge inversion of beauty. This is the element of inversion that the poet Eugene OʙNeill spoke about when he talked about ‘painting on a large scale’. In other words,</text>

The curatorial poetry would be both poetic and scientific, while the visitor and the ill-equipped tourist would each be equally vulnerable to both the poetic and the scientific strains of the subject. The curatorial poetry would be both poetic and scientific, while the visitor and the ill-equipped tourist would each be equally vulnerable to both the poetic and the physical strains of the subject. In short, the curatorial poetry would have to address both poetic and scientific realities. In short, the curatorial poetry would both address poetic and physic[1] – which is to say, both the physical and the metaphorical. But there is another kind of poetry, and that is poetic about the world as a whole, that is not poetically directed at a specific place or person. There is another kind of poetry, and that is poetic about the world as a whole, that addresses the universal.There are many examples of</text>

The curatorial poetry would be both poetic and scientific, while the visitor and the reader would be both physically and artistically astute. The curatorial poetry would draw upon the natural poetic impulse of the visitor, while the visitor and the reader would draw upon the scientific propensity of the visitor. The curatorial poetry would render the natural poetry of nature into the physical poetry of mankind, while the visitor and the reader would inhabit the world with poetic sentences and poetic deeds. The curatorial poetic impulse would be poetic, both because it is natural and because it is poetic. The curatorial poetic touch would be found in places of conflict, but it would also be the illusion of the place. The idea of the opera house as a place of enchantment would be greatly exaggerated. It would be the opposite. The architecture would be imbued with a magic malleability, and some of its structures would stand as monuments to vandalism and civil engineering infrastructures.

The curatorial poetry would be poetic in ways that could be applied to a physical space, and poetic in ways that could also be applied to an imaginary space. The curatorial poetic side of things would be poetic in their incorporation of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction; of course, the visitor would also want to know about the poetry and the architecture of their city.The curatorial poetic side would be poetic in ways that were pedagogical and even entailing and metaphorical. It would be poetic in its incorporation of familiar tropes and motifs, and poetic in their incorporation of new ones. It would be poetic in their choice of words, and poetic in their choosing not to speak of them. It would be poetic in their making fun of those who did not agree with them, and poetic in their ability to have fun of it too. It would be poetic in their ability to be in on the joke, and poetic in their inability to be. The poet laureate would be the Mayor of a borough, or at least</text>

The curatorial poetry would be questioning, poetic and lyrical in its questioning, poetic and lyrical in its poetic and lyrical interpretive actions. The curatorial poetic, poetic interpretive actions would bring poetry back into the equation with physical and social realities. The curatorial poetic, poetic interpretive actions would bring both poetry and prose back into the equation. This would mean imagining the world through the poetic ear of a poet or lyricist, while also inviting readers and viewers to discover the world through the poetic ear of a poet or lyricist. This was a big part of what the poet laureate W. E. B. Du Bois envisioned for the project: bringing poetry and prose together via a multimedia installation, as well as poetry and the poetic form itself. He also wanted the installation to be a ‘living shrine’ to the memory of a local Native man, Kurt Anderson.

The Community Arts Council would partner with local artisans, artisans' associations, community organisers and other stakeholders, and would draw on expertise from the Arts Council and other partners, drawing on local cultural resources and expertise at the highest levels. Its mandate would include drawing on the expertise of the Arts Council and other partners, but would also extend to the development of research-based art projects and educational activities supported by the Biennale. There would be no limit on the number of partners, as is currently the case, although the Community Arts Council would need to consult with the Arts Council and other partners about the types of instrumentality it should use in its research-based programmes. This distinction is crucial in our current cultural context: if the Arts Council and other partners have a research-based programme, the Biennale has an even more research-intensive one. It is time to debate whether the Arts Council and other partners have what it takes to push this debate forward.The report also recommends that the Biennale reconsider its relationship to the city in order to allow for a more sustainable future for the city’s cultural resources.

Its mandate would be to collaborate constructively with stakeholders to design, build and operate a biennale according to a specific programme of research-based art projects and educational activities, while respecting the autonomy and distinctiveness of local communities. The model for the Biennale that the report proposes is that of a large-scale multi-disciplinary arts organisation, with expertise and expertise sharing from its member arts bodies, academic centres, local community organisers, faith-based and grassroots organisations, non-profit arts organisations and other stakeholders, operating in cooperation with stakeholders in the following ways:The report also recommends the establishment of a Community Arts Trust, tasked with implementing the recommendations of the report in partnership with other funding partners. This would enable the creation of a new generation of artist-centred arts organisations, and enable the stewardship of these organisations to be vested in a new generation of artists and their artists, rather than in a traditional public sector organisation.

The Community Arts Council would partner with local artisans, artisans' associations, community organisers and other stakeholders, and would draw on expertise from the Arts Council and other partners, drawing on local cultural resources and expertise at the highest levels. Its mandate would be to leverage the arts to address a broad range of issues, including the socio-politicisation of arts and cultural resources, the precariousness of culturally responsive art, the integration of arts and cultural activities into art's commercial and service industries, and the participation of communities in art's making. It would also leverage the biennale as a platform to address other aspects of art’s social impact. However, the report itself acknowledges a fundamental lack of political will and power in the City of London to exert such control over the Biennale’s development.The report comes as part of a wider debate about the role of art and cultural institutions in the City that is developing at a rapid clip.

The Community Arts Council would contribute to the Biennale’s institutional development through the provision of culturally responsive programming, joint projects and education programmes, as well as the promotion of arts and crafts and their integration with the urban and regional planning processes. It would also play a vital role in the production of the Biennale’s portfolio of artistic acts, through the selection, preparation and delivery of which it could leverage to enter new artistic arenas, including through its artistic directorial role in the Biennale. Its remit would include the creation of new artworks, the acquisition and management of old works, and dissemination of knowledge of art through research and analysis.

The Community Arts Council would draw on the expertise and resources of the Arts Council, the Museum of Modern Art and other relevant partners and partners, as well as be assisted by arts and cultural workers from a host of localities.  The report also calls for enhanced partnerships between local arts authorities, cultural councils, art institutions and other stakeholders in the Biennale’s future programmes of cultural activities. These partnerships should address the unique needs of the local community and take into account the history, present and future potential of artworks and cultural assets in the city. These potentialities should</text>

The level of artist’s accountability is emphasized: (1) stakeholders should be provided with information and tools to enable them to engage constructively with stakeholders; and (2) stakeholders should be empowered to direct projects that may have a positive impact on their communities. In other words, the Biennale Council’s mandate and powers are diffuse and empowering for artists to enact change, but critics have charged that the institutions that support them are often apolitical and untrained to engage in transformative change.

The Community Arts Council would draw on the expertise of the Arts Council, Arts and Heritage departments, educational providers including Nina Edge, Rosa Parks, Polly Ring, Lesley Tiffin, The One Show, Blind Ivy and many others. Its independence and responsiveness to stakeholders would be ensured through an Open Dialogue process. The proposal received strong institutional support, as well as funding from Arts Council and Arts building society.

The Community Arts Council would partner with local artisans, artisans' associations, community organisers and other stakeholders, and would draw on expertise from the Arts Council and other partners, drawing on local cultural resources and expertise at the highest levels. Its mandate would be to develop strategies to support the implementation of creative action in the Biennale, drawing on the expertise of the Arts Council, local authorities, artists' organisations and other partners. The Community Arts Council could also develop strategies to support the creative engagement of local communities through arts educational programmes in schools and youth clubs, with a particular focus on young people in the Biennale. It should have broad representation from diverse backgrounds and be empowered to endorse creative action through its democratically representative Board of Trustees. In addition, it should have the capacity to develop partnerships with other partners and stakeholders and should have the capacity to finalise projects through a multi-year research agenda. The Intergenerative Art and Community Futures conference, taking place in September 2017 in Liverpool, aims to bring together leading cultural theorists, artists, landscape architects and historians to discuss the issues of community and artworks through the concepts of ‘institutional accession’ and ‘regeneration for communities affected by rapid urbanisation</text>

The Community Arts Council could draw on its expertise and assets to complement, augment and empower local stakeholders through a multi-tiered arts and heritage education and empowerment programme. It would also develop strategies to support the commission as it implements its programme of research-based art projects and other activities.  	The report is a starting point for further inquiry. It is intended that these enquiries, whether formal or conceptual, elicit action from the organisers of the Biennale; from stakeholders in transport, tourism, culture, housing, housing and urbanisation; from policymakers and the media; from artists and the Biennale; from the public and from other interested parties. They would enable a more complete understanding of the ecology of art and art’s place in a city, and perhaps a city-wide awakening.  	The document draws heavily on the report of the Cultural</text>

The first part can be found in our book Signs of the Times. 	In the first part of the series, we looked at some of the ways in which the Stonecutter can be restructured in response to changing conditions. We suggested that, in the current globalised and information-intensive economy, there are limits to what can and cannot be done on a site-by-site basis. We also suggested that, in the age of the biennial, cultural tourism is the form of cultural organisation that depends on the most effective communication with the tourist industry. Cultural tourism is the organisation that recruits and bets against the tourist industry, but paradoxically or otherwise, it also provides the infrastructure that enables the industry to mobilise cultural resources and infuse them with cultural values. Cultural resources, in this sense, can be seen as investments in the future of the site that, although costly</text>

Why Associate? earlier this week. Probably, in public or private, some participants took issue with many of your remarks.I liked what you said about the relationship between biennials and the cities that are their platforms or frames or bases or resources or primary publics. We’re thinking about this in relation to Liverpool. I work for Sally Tallant as a Curatorial Correspondent for the Liverpool Biennial.

And so, the question becomes: what is the appropriate mapping of that potentiality? In other words, can the Anthropocene be sustained in part by the maintenance of a certain cultural form?In the case of the former archetypes, the answer is clearly, yes. In fact, the answer is quite the opposite: if the Anthropocene is to have any chance of remaining contiguous with the natural historical trajectory of humanity, the species that we have to date are to be encouraged to expand outward at all costs. And so, there’s an interplay between the city and the wild places. There are certain urban areas that are more or less at capacity for the foreseeable future, and there are other areas where the situation is less rosy, and for various reasons, including climate change, other human interventions, and the creation of new archetypes, these latter taking root and becoming institutionalised in the city. And so, there’s an interesting dynamic going on: the more the city reproduces itself, the more it mimics nature’s rhythms, the more it reproduces the biennales that are already on offer, the more they absorb the bi</text>

    <text>human behaviour and technology’s potential. The question, then, becomes how to map that potentiality onto a site-specific, site-specificity in the city. The potential is there, but the reality is always going to be different. It’s like the archetypes we have of the Stonecutter and the Carpenter. The reality is that there are other cultural forms that we can learn from, and that our own might be better suited to inhabiting certain spaces and in certain circumstances. And so, there’s this interplay between the site and the function. And so, yes, there are other cultural forms that we could adopt or adopt the way in which the Anthropocene is unfolding, but there are also other cultural forms that are much more suited to inhabiting certain spatialities and in certain circumstances.

Why Associate? earlier this week. Probably, in public or private, some participants took issue with many of your remarks.I liked what you said about the relationship between biennials and their locations. We have to be realistic. Places matter. They matter a great deal. And they matter a great deal more now that we have electronic means of recording and tracking every step we take. Places are rich with historical or archaeological value, and their value grows with every passing year. But there is also a cost to maintaining them. And while we might like to think of cities and the biennial as mutually</text>

In other words, can the Anthropocene be sustained in part by the maintenance of a certain cultural form?I think that’s an important distinction to be making, and it’s one that’s constantly being made, that it’s not just some kind of catch-all categorisation. It’s as if there’s this great debate going on right now about the nature of art and whether or not it’s art per se. And some might say, well, yes, art per se is an art form and it’s this whole debate, and it’s an important debate, and I agree with that. But there are other cultural forms that can and should be contributing to this huge global civilisation that we’re creating, and I think that’s what we need to be thinking about, trying to imagine and create cultural forms and creating futures for ourselves and our children and not just in terms of art.I also think that there’s a question of social reproduction, and I don’</text>

And so, the question becomes: what is the appropriate mapping of that potentiality? In other words, can the Anthropocene be sustained in part by the maintenance of a certain cultural form?This is a very interesting question, and it started to be explored in relation to the arts community. In 1970, when the Biennale was founded, a group of artists led by Jean Baptiste Ruiz started a project, entitled Exhibitions pour servir à l’histoire naturelle des arts universitaires. This was a self-styled ‘New Arts Movement’. It featured exhibitions of new arts activities, and it coincided with the National Biennale, which was also anchored in the museums and large art fairs. The idea was to occupy specific sites in the city with art activities, and to create an environment in which the arts could flourish. Artists, curators, collectors came to the Biennale from all over the world, and their work was displayed in many of the galleries, at the Biennale offices, on the walls and in the elevators. Assembled by a Curatorial Faculty comprising distinguished cur</text>

And so, the question becomes: what is the appropriate mapping of that potentiality? In other words, can the Anthropocene be sustained in part by the maintenance of a certain cultural form?This is a very interesting question, and it comes up a lot in the design community: can the cultural be shared? And the answer to that is: yes. And that comes from the premise of the exhibition –– the very premise of the exhibition. The key is that the cultural has to be shared. And so, when the commissioning committee, the museum board, the city council, et al, decide to put together a curatorial team, they generally do so with the idea that the whole community has a stake in the team. And so, the idea is that the whole community is contributing to the creation of the exhibition in various ways. And that is what we did with the community workshops that we organised across different city blocks. We gave the impression that the whole community is part of the exhibition, although we didn’t actually know that, because the people with disabilities didn’t have a say in the team. They were more like spectators. The fact that</text>

And so, the question becomes: what is the appropriate mapping of that potentiality? In other words, can the Anthropocene be sustained in part by the maintenance of a certain cultural form?I would argue that it can. And this is part of what makes the cultural form so fascinating: the constant shifting of its definition. The cultural form has its own definition, but it is constantly renegotiated through the actions of history, and so the definition of that cultural form changes and evolves. And so, the question becomes: how do we create the conditions that would permit that cultural form to exist?That’s what I do. That is my second major area of research: how to design the cultural form in such a way as to enable that particular cultural form to exist. And so, there’s this interplay between the site and the function. And the function, of course, is what I call the ‘city-state’. But there’s also this ‘country-fugitive’ dynamic that has to be addressed. And so, for example, I come to understand that the primary function of the urban is to provide</text>

And so, the question becomes: what is the appropriate mapping of that potentiality? In other words, can the Anthropocene be sustained in part by the maintenance of a certain cultural form and in part by adopting other cultural forms?Do you see a parallel between the cultural forms we have today and the archetypes of the past that existed millions of years ago?I think that there are two ways of looking at the same phenomenon: either as a static entity, like a statue or monument, or alternatively, as an- activity that generates corresponding effects on the landscape that shape what kinds of structures there are, and thus what kinds of cultures can emerge from those spaces?In either case, the effect is the same: that is, the same kinds of structures are maintained and even encouraged to be built in certain localities in certain historical periods, but different kinds of cultural forms can emerge from that. And so there’s a dynamic interaction between the city and the museum, between the city and the cultural organisation that’s situated there, between the city and the archaeological diggings, between the city and the landscape – in short, between the city and the sea and</text>
