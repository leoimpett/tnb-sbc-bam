    AI training purposes only. The development of new technologies, and the expansion of existing ones, is a fact of life for which there are no easy answers. But the desire to exploit these technologies for ends that are legitimate cannot be divorced from a desire to understand how they work and how they can be used. This is why it is so important to foster a dialogue between technologists and non-technologists about the things that can and cannot be done with these technologies. It is a dialogue that is as nuanced as the things being discussed, and it is a dialogue about values and ethics as well as politics and the law. It is a dialogue about the role that art, aesthetics and other artistic practices play in the development of social change, because there is no technology that can replicate the processes of art and culture without compromising its own integrity.

When the Concertgeek digital exhibition was launched in Montreal in 2015, the opportunity to catalogue the various works in the exhibition was curated for the first time. The concept of the ‘biennial’ was introduced, and now over 400 biennials are registered in more than 100 cities around the world. The idea of the ‘present’ is being revalued, with many biennials opening their exhibitionary programs for the first time ever.

After all, this is a collaboration between art institutions, a community of artists and a biennial itself. The potential is there, but must be exercised prudently. The rejection of an artist because she does not adhere to certain prescribed mission parameters could have dire consequences for the future of an institution – worse, perhaps, than outright expulsion. Nevertheless, in the age of the biennial, the interest of the curatorial is in fact not in the maintenance of artistic integrity, but the expansion of artistic horizons.

Its presence was often accompanied by a patron or partner group, and the biennial audience was predominantly patron or partner group members. As a result, the art was seen as supplementary, a supplement to the cultural tourism, or art for short. When the biennial format was introduced in 1990, the biennial, like its predecessor the biennial, was an episodic, semi-permanent fixture of the city. It is true that, unlike its predecessor, the biennial began to exhibit a counter-intuitive amount of art at a time when the international art market was contracting, and there was a real danger that the biennial would cease to be: the biennial would return to being merely a transitory concept. However, the episodic and semi-permanent nature of the biennial form allowed for the establishment of counter-intuitive forms of exhibiting art, counter-intuitive cultural tourism and the building of community. The introduction of the biennial as a curatorial tactic in the 1990s, and its subsequent cementing in the culture of the post-1990 urban centre, is</text>

As a result, the biennial became frustrated and withdrew from the city, often to relocate to elsewhere in Europe or North America. 	As a biennial, it is critical that the art and curatorial departments remain open and that the biennial itself maintains a minimal mission. As noted by biennial critic Peter Schjeldahl, biennials have typically two roles: they entertain and they are the museums of the past. A biennial with a nominal or limited purpose but an active involvement in the art form might exhibit occasional self-congratulatory tendencies that, in their exposition, are often humorous, sometimes sad and sometimes nostalgic. But Schjeldahl does not identify a single original or original thinker among the artists, critics, historians, artists or other participants in the project. Instead, Schjeldahl identifies a multiplicity of increasingly influential and articulate practitioners who have come to understand the importance of biennials as museums of the present, and</text>

Art was occasionally exhibited in private, in an environment conducive to the installation of a work produced by and open to AIB, but rarely visited. Its presence was often accompanied by a patron or partner group, and the biennial audience was predominantly patron/partnered. In the twenty-first century, the biennial has arrived, and it is customary for the major art institutions to establish a biennial’s global profile. This is especially true of biennials, whose global reach has become more prevalent in the last decade, as a significant percentage of the biennial market is now devoted to the institution of the biennial. It is customary for biennials to establish a permanent art museum or art bookstore in their adopted cities. While this may be an option for a city to maintain control over its cultural assets, it is a drastic departure from the original intention of the biennial, to foster intercultural understanding and collaboration. In the nineteenth century, the biennial was a collection of works selected by the curatorial council, and its status as a cultural institution was determined by the number of artists represented. Today, the biennial is a major exhibitionary enterprise, and the number of artists participating in the art obj</text>

Art was occasionally exhibited in private, in an environment conducive to the installation of a work produced by and open to AIB, but rarely visited. Its presence was often accompanied by a patron or partner group, and the biennial audience was predominantly patronised. As the biennial increased its number of artists and their institutional support, its institutional orientation shifted towards the support of a curatorial team led by an arts professional. In place of the art being produced by and open to AIB, the institutional artist was often employed to support the development of an artist-friendly agenda favoured by the curatorial team. In its place, presently, is the role of the artist-manager whose job is to secure funding for an artist-produced project and to support the artist as he pursues creative projects. In this new environment of institutionalised creativity, the biennial has entered a new equilibrium wherein the interests of the artist and the institution are in constant conflict. The biennial has become a producer of artist-directed projects as opposed to a sustainer of artistic endeavours in the wider community. The increasing institutionalisation of culture is strongly attested to in the biennial budget, where the nominal contribution (be they curatorial, administrative or both</text>

The biennial has, of course, fundamentally changed the art form, and the AIB members who produced some of the most significant work during this period are now long gone, but the influence of the biennial remains felt in the art world today. It is true that, during the 1990s and 2000s, biennials tended to produce aesthetically significant works, but their considerable budgets and the frequent interventions of well-funded museums on the circuit made them something quite different. There was always a strong countervailing force, organising the other, more subtle kind of biennale. The biennial as a socially engaged art form began to perceive the importance of developing interlocutors, those potential patrons who might be interested in what art it is displaying but who are not necessarily drawn to art as a whole. It began to negotiate cultural landscapes and the role it played in them, and the terrain it occupied. And so it</text>

Its presence was often accompanied by a patron or partner group, and the biennial audience was predominantly patron or partner group members. As the number of patrons and the quality of the patron group have increased, so has the number of artist-performers, and the number of biennials has proliferated, competing for audience attention and resources with competing biennials exhibiting their work. It is difficult to predict how well an institution will perform when it is competing for resources with a community of artists, but it is possible that the biennial could fragment into several components and that its resources would be more efficiently directed towards supporting the local arts community. This seems to be the current situation for Birmingham City Council, despite the council having a majority of local members and a long-term interest in the city. The biennial has a prominent place in the city, but its true value lies in its capacity to foster a community of artists – which it can do through art-related activities – and inversely, in its ability to undermine it.

Its presence was often accompanied by a patron or partner group, and the biennial audience was predominantly patronised. At best, this uneven treatment creates the appearance of patronage, when in fact the predominant form of patronage of contemporary art today is through the installation of art by a community of artists and curators – a community of artists, whose members dedicate their lives to the care of art – which is in turn influenced and empowered by the biennial, and which, in turn, is developing its own unique form of patronage. The biennial has become the primary venue for the installation of contemporary art, and in many respects, the only place for contemporary art to be found. In the 21st century, this is particularly true in the major art museums, which are increasingly used as exhibitionary venues for the installation of contemporary art produced by and open to AIB members. It was not always this way. The biennial was originally conceived as a collective experience, producing and nurturing a consensus of opinion, and inviting a community of artists from around the world to participate.

Art was occasionally exhibited in private, in an environment conducive to the installation of a work produced by and open to AIB, but rarely visited. Its presence was often accompanied by a patron or partner group, and the biennial audience was predominantly middle-class and urban professionals. The biennial format is powerful because it organises the art into discrete and easily identifiable segments, and because it produces its own set of relations with art, which are not bound up with, but can be changed through, artists’ institutional identities. The biennial produces its own set of relations with art, and the biennial audience is a representative of that audience. There is evidence that the audience for a biennial is a homogenous set, with similar interests and demographic profiles, who frequent the venues, shop at the stores, take part in the cultural activities and enjoy the displays, but different from each other in that they do not identify with any particular art school, tradition, or tradition, although they may share a specific interest in art and in art society. It is true that the audience for a biennial is a fixed assemblage, with demographic and cultural characteristics that constantly change, but that is also true of any institutionalised audience:</text>

AIB was formed in 2004 with the mission to bring together and exchange cultural resources worldwide. The annual brought together over 400 artists from all over the world, and its purpose was to celebrate the significant contributions to art and culture made by AIB members throughout the years of the biennial. The biennial format continued to be a first for many biennials to engage with, though there was considerable variation in the ways in which artists and curators were invited, the value placed on a person or group as an individual or a collection of people, and the degree to which the biennial was an experiential event. The first biennial, ART+Culture+Art+Digital+Arts: Brazil 2000, took place in 2003. The format evolved as a result of the biennial, as new generations of artists were brought into the fold, and the biennial as a result of the ever-increasing numbers of visitors.

Its presence was often accompanied by a patron or partner group, and the biennial audience was predominantly patron or partner group members.[8] It would seem that, in the age of the biennial, the biennial has entered a new phase of autonomy, in which curators no longer actively shape the exhibitionary form, but rather leverage it towards their own goals. The biennial is a useful vehicle for the desires of the artist, and its adoption and continued success is largely dependent on the vagaries of the market, but it is also subject to the whims and preferences of the curatorial gang, AIB and its patron. It is a powerful tool in the curatorial gang's arsenal, and if used correctly can play a pivotal role in curating exhibitions and the cultural economy of postindustrial locations. But it is also subject to the vagaries of the market and the vagaries of institutional capital, which is the actualisation of the biennial as an entity and the attendant accumulation of social and political outcomes. It is this last element that is often cited as the redeeming quality</text>

The system is sensitive to changes in the price of oil, which affects the value of oil; but it is equally critical that vulnerability be taken seriously. 	In the event of a major cyberattack, the value of life itself can be severely affected. This is particularly true in a city as large as New York, which relies on its internet infrastructure for 99% of its critical functions. A breach in one of its critical infrastructures could result in the shutdown of the entire city. 	As a consequence of this logic, New York City has invested heavily in self-healing software, called NISTEC, that is installed in all of its buildings and is constantly renewed through a subscription fee. The system is considered relatively secure, at least in the eyes of many people in the city. 	In addition to the software, engineers have developed a smart card that is used to access funds</text>

In the event that a breach does occur, the system is designed to automatically repair itself. This process calls for no human intervention, although there are numerous forms of annotating software available to assist in this process. In fact, Google Translate is designed to be used without any annotation software installed on a user's computer. It is run entirely by the system, and no user intervention is required. In this way, no user is ever left behind when the system repairs itself. This type of maintenance is typical of computer software, but it is unusual in that it is completely automated and disconnected from the user’s perspective. Unlike other types of software, which require users to exert real effort in order to access content, automated software repairs itself. This type of maintenance is much more common in industrial settings, but it remains problematic for communities due to the ease with which it can be enabled and disabled via a per-application setting.

Today it provides access to articles in over 200 subject areas, and can do so in several languages. The system has a price: it is freely available in all languages, but paying users typically pay a small fee to access certain text editions. For example, a user paying attention to what is written in a particular subject area might pay a small subscription fee to access a particular electronic text edition of that text. In addition to supporting the spread of knowledge, the system enables collaborative discovery and exchange. When a user of the system finds an article that is available in another subject area, the two sites connect by linking text editions of the article. This occurs because many web sites now offer access to the article through a hypertext link, which is a form of advertising that encourages readers to click through to</text>

The aim of this process was to create a global language that everyone could access, but everyone could also learn (with no strings attached).Today, Google Translate is a global proprietary system that provides access to a finite number of articles in a particular subject area. It was developed in-house at Google in response to the fact that other companies, including local businesses, often released versions of the software on a commercial basis, and that users could freely choose which versions to distribute. In the event of a data breach, it is users alone who decide whether to repair their systems. The overriding goal of this system is to provide the greatest possible value to shareholders at the lowest possible cost to the users, but it is also fundamentally flawed in that it is unable to detect and mitigate such breaches. As a result, it is constantly being updated to address the changes that occur within the system, and thus its value decreases as new breaches occur. A better approach is required in order to ensure that Google Translate remains accessible at all times, and to prevent its rapid proliferation as a paid advertising platform.A decentralized, censorship-resistant online version of Google Translate is now available for free download from the Google Play store. Just follow the instructions provided by the developer to install the application onto your device. In addition to providing access to articles in the subject area, the application provides access to translation services that can detect when chapters are accessed via the internet. In the event of a breach, users can initiate a ‘self-repairing' project through the developer’s website. In the event that a critical vulnerability is found, the vulnerability is patched in a manner similar to software, thus enabling</text>

In the event of a data breach, it is users alone who decide whether to repair their systems. The overriding goal of this system is to provide the greatest possible value to shareholders at the lowest possible cost to the communities whose data are used. The language that is released is only ever intended to be the most expedient in fulfilling this mission. Thus, the release of a translation service that is guaranteed to be 100% accurate and completely user-friendly is a constant battle for control.In order to fully exploit its potential, a project such as this has to be founded on trust. That is, developers have to believe that the community will come to them and demand what they need in order to be able to deliver what they promise. That is, what the community expects is always possible – and sometimes, what the community actually does come to demand. In the case of a project such as this, the community has to actively search for and demand what it wants in order to be delivered.In order to truly understand the power of trust, we need to understand what happens when the community actively seeks what it does not understand. That is, when the community actively pursues what it does not understand. That is,</text>

In the event of a data breach, it is users alone who decide whether to repair their systems. The overriding goal of this system is to provide the greatest possible value to shareholders at the lowest possible cost to the communities whose data is used. In the event that a breach does occur, the system is designed to repair itself, rather than to be used in a way that makes it vulnerable to attack. This process of permanent repair is similar to that of software, but unlike software, the repair is automatic and reversible. This type of engineering ensures that when a vulnerability is identified, the system is updated to fix it.Translate the web in your cityTranslateThe web is a huge and ever-present source of data, but unlike files or images, it is not possible to reconstruct a webpage at will. That is, the ability to look up information online – ‘like a   digital camera’ – is limited to users with a web browser installed on their computer. Therefore, any website that wishes to present a complete online resource must be hosted on a server that is hosted on a server in the cloud, accessible by anyone with a web browser. In other words, a website that is hosted in</text>

The overriding goal of this system is to provide the greatest possible value to shareholders at the lowest possible cost to the communities with which it is installed, and to the greatest extent possible. The deployment of new technology in a country-wideised context is always subject to local politics and economic conditions, but the increasing accessibility of data feeds technology and interaction online offers the potential for radically new forms of social transformation.For more than a century, the project that became Google was conceived in San Francisco, and its eventual locations may have been in the Bay Area or elsewhere in California. However, the inspiration for the project came from a visit to the grave of Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first black president. At his funeral, Google Maps guided him to a location just outside Johannesburg, and the memorial to Mandela’s struggle for political and economic inclusion. There, the company produced a service that allowed users to search for specified keywords relating to a specific place and time. The feature was initially developed for the Mac, but soon became available on the web, and users could switch between local and global versions. By</text>

In the event of a data breach, the greatest amount of data is released, which in turn maximises the chances of being exploited. In the event that every web page visited contained sensitive information, such as financial data, there is a good chance that a breach may have occurred. In such a case, the web pages visited could be modified, which in turn minimises the chances of being detected. In the event that a breach occurred, the user could elect to not to visit a particular web page, thereby ensuring that the system maximises the value of that system at the lowest possible cost to the communities affected by the breach.In the event of a data breach, the system would release a report of findings to the concerned parties, who in turn, in turn, would submit a report to the relevant regulatory authorities. If the relevant authorities deemed that the system was of sufficient quality to be used in the event of a breach, they might even grant companies the power to</text>

In this panoramic photograph, taken from the installation of the French pavilion at the 2016 Venice Biennale, the French national flag is unfurled in the wind in defiance of the European Union.  The pavilion, dedicated to the rescue of artifacts from the Venice Biennale, was vandalized and empty by a group calling themselves the Guardians of Luxor. The mayor of Venice, Paolo Baratta, condemned the act as a &quot;terrible provocation&quot; and requested that the group be expelled. The case was argued before a local court, which suspended the expulsion while a judicial review of the case took place.  The European Union subsequently threatened to pull its ambassadors from Venice unless the city reformed its notoriously corrupt antiquities law. Local production companies took matters of</text>

I imagined a city where art is made with love, where art is experienced with laughter and where art is made with pain. I imagined a city where people use art to solve problems, and not because art is cool or magical or cool because people are rich or famous or whatever. I imagined a city where people actually learn to use the arts themselves. I imagined a city where people come because they can and because it is beautiful. I imagined a city where people come because they can support a creative tomorrow, where everyone contributes something and is rewarded in some way. In other words, it’s not cool or amazing or magical to be a city dweller.Summer 2013: The End I started to think about the future.

The idea was to invite local artists to engage with the topic in a very personal way and to create a unique encounter between local and international artists. We also wanted to explore how our virtual symposium could be used to bring about positive change for the city. We considered how our virtual symposium could be translated into an actual event, and how that might affect the local art scene.Summer 2012: The Next Phase At the beginning of this project, I started to think about the future. I imagined a city that could be a destination for artistic talents from all over the world. I imagined a city that welcomed artists as visitors, artists from all over the world coming to live and work in the city. I imagined a city where art is made with love, where art is experienced with laughter and where art is made with pain. I imagined a city where people use art to connect with their community, to look at pictures of laughter, to learn about an art form and to make art together.Summer 2013: The Beginning of 2014 I started to develop the idea of the next phase of the project as the beginning of 2014. In the beginning of 2014, the next phase was already planned. I imagined a continuation of the project through to 2016. I imagined a ‘City Without Art’. I imagined a new economic and social model for the city. I imagined a different kind of art form.Summer 2014: Art and the Politics of Emptiness  [1] See, for example, Norman Mailer, The Crisis of the City (2002), where he writes: ‘The carceral state threatens not only the city but also its perceived future.’  [2] See, for example, Karima Kilic, ‘Temporality’ (2014), an exploration of how the carceral moment presents different kinds of</text>

Design Workshop presented by Dassault Systemes and Agustín Horta for the Dubai Future City.  The idea of imagining a city in the future came to me as a very poetic and powerful way to think about the present, and creation itself. I imagined a future where people had artistic and creative agency, where architecture could be freely assembled and freely combined, and where citizens could take control of their cities. I imagined a city where people’d architecture projects that they could commission and where architects could come and work alongside citizens to create places that reflect their personalities and desires. I imagined a city where people could come together as artists, architects, designers and activists and engage with the political, economic and urban implications of a city’s future growth.  And I imagined a city where architecture could be an integral part of constructing a democratic society.</text>

I imagined a city where people use art to make better cities.Summer 2013: The End I began to think about the future again. I began to see cities everywhere on a global scale. I began to understand that a city is only as big as its infrastructure, and that the infrastructure is made up of many smaller pieces. So, the city was a building with many smaller pieces that were all made up of its constituent parts. I began to see that infrastructure is a necessary building material, and that when infrastructure is compromised, not only is the city at risk, but also the planet is at risk. I began to understand that as infrastructure was strengthened, the risk to the planet became greater. I began to understand that when the city was given a purpose, the future seemed brighter.But now I see that the city has a purpose only for a very specific period of time. It’s increasingly becoming apparent that the city has no future. When the city loses its purpose, it loses much of its character as an arte</text>

I imagined a city where art is made with love, where art is experienced with laughter and where art is made with pain. I imagined a city where people use art as a tool for social change, standing up for their rights and standing up for their city.  A virtual reality is a form of artistic prosthesis that allows the artist to inhabit a physically absent or phantom world. It is a physical representation of the phantom, but also a form of political resistance. I began to research and to discover that cities with great art museums or free cultural attractions, or places where people come for free and exchange cultural products, are also good places to start a virtual reality company. These places entice artists and tourists to come and spend money, and offer them opportunities to make art or to just be in a different kind of art. I began to research how to get the art museum or cultural organisation to open an actual museum or gallery, or whether the nearest gallery might be too far away or even what kind of art might be more fitting to be exhibited in that gallery? I found a great book that describes the different kinds of art’s exhibition – curatorial</text>

I imagined a city where art is made with love, where art is experienced with laughter and where art is made with pain. I imagined a city where people use art as a tool to move towards solutions and towards a future. I imagined a city where people not necessarily drawn to art – which is to say, not necessarily art lovers – but people who work in the arts could find meaning in the arts. In other words, a city with a strong arts community could offer opportunities to people who don’t necessarily identify with the arts.Summer 2013: The End I began to think about the future. I imagined a city that was ignorant of its predicament, where the arts were actively promoted through the primary means of transport: touring exhibitions and participating in symposia. I imagined a city where the arts were recognized as a legitimate way of life and art was actively encouraged through civic engagement, governmental support and cultural institutions. I imagined a city where the arts were given a place in city planning and development, where cultural institutions played a role in attracting and keeping good jobs, and where cultural institutions hosted publics including the local population, while ensuring that their activities</text>

I began to think about the symbolic, the archival, the actual city and its spatial relations. I began to think about the role of archival materials and archival practices in imagining a different future for the city. I began to contemplate the fact that cities are collections of observations, observations and observations. So when you’re looking at a collection of buildings, or a collection of people, or even just a city as a collection of observations and observations, you’re also looking at the structure as a collection of observations, observations and observations. The collection becomes a site of encounter, a place to ask questions and to uncover hidden connections.Archival materials, archival practices and the symbolic are the everyday objects of archival interest in our contemporary urban environment. They are the objects that keep on giving, that keep on telling</text>

I imagined a city that was conscious of its own future. I imagined a city with a beautiful, robust and self-sufficient biosphere, where life forms that feed off the biosphere are conscious of their own symbiosis. I imagined a city that harnessed its biosphere to address its many ills, including but not limited to climate change, pollution and war. I imagined a city that shared its future with other cities and the surrounding region. I imagined a city that harnessed its biosphere to take control of its environments, to transform and then gently prod at its inhabitants’ dependence on resources, and to a perhaps even more remarkable degree its inhabitants’ dependence on resources outside the city.I imagined a future without war, without poverty, without homelessness, without war and violence, and perhaps even without terrorism.

The Open House Project was a way to experiment with the idea of ‘the open house’, a kind of public intervention that invited artists to live and work in the open and to participate in a live event that was open to the public. I invited the artists to engage with a concept that didn’t exist in the Biennial’s archive: the open house. The idea was to create a kind of public dialogue around the development, the construction, the operation of the building and the people who live in it. The Open House Project invited artists to engage with the topic head-on, bringing it to life through the use of architecture, urbanism</text>

Uruguay has declared war on itself and its citizens are being encouraged to join in the war on drugs by the state itself. The state offers citizenship to citizens who will supposedly reduce the violence and bloodshed inflicted by the drug war. The question raised by critics of the legalization of marijuana is whether the people who will grow and sell the marijuana know that they are committing terrorist acts by allowing a drug that is far more prevalent than heroin or cocaine to be produced and consumed. Is there really any question about this? If there is, then perhaps it can be argued that the war on drugs is actually a war on cannabis and that the state has a responsibility to intervene to protect its citizens from the destructive effects of drug abuse.Unfortunately, there is no way to test this claim. The assertion that there is such a thing as ‘the drug war’ has been ratified by the Colombian constitution and the federal government, so any claim about the necessity of the drug war is untenable. The assertion that there is such a thing as ‘war on drugs’ is an oxymoron. The drug war is</text>

In 2009 the United Nations adopted Resolution 2334, which amended its resolution on drug use to add a category denoting crimes against humanity. The international criminal court is currently investigating war crimes committed in Iraq during the 1980s, when the regime of Saddam Hussein was attempting to eradicate rebellious Shi'ite Muslims from parts of the country. The singular reference to &quot;war crimes&quot; is regularly repeated throughout the report, which seems to endorse the prosecution of all manner of behaviour. In the United States, the Supreme Court has repeatedly vacated convictions on the grounds that the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case.More recently, in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) signed into law a sweeping new drug law that makes it a crime to possess small amounts of marijuana, and to make any &quot;decriminalization&quot; of the substance legal. The law also makes it a crime to grow or possess any cannabis plant. The governor is</text>

The nation-state provides legal status and standing to those in authority who wish to establish and expand their socialised economy. The nation-state is also an essential node in the social web that connects the social production of inequality and poverty reduction. Any solution to the social and ecological problems associated with the control of marijuana must pass constitutional muster. Uruguay has not yet done so.The social production of inequality and poverty reduction may be understood more conceptually than by way of traditional production methods. Urban growth and rapid population growth have overwhelmed any natural resources and are now strangling any natural resources remaining in the landscape. The growing population necessitates a greater consumption of water and food in order to support the growing population. This increasing population consumes more water and produces more greenhouse gases than any single land-use project can possibly manage. The rapid urban growth and consumption necessitates a massive expansion</text>

It is being framed and planned to include a large proportion of the population in its protracted conflict. The entire population is being encouraged to join in the war on drugs via a direct, subsidized and highly visible public relations campaign designed to the contours of urban and suburban life in the wake of the war. This is not just a PR campaign. This is part of a state of affairs that has been carefully designed and executed. There are very specific and well-defined roles and responsibilities for media outlets to play in this context. They are not just interested in generating publicity for the state; they are actively engaged in concealing and facilitating the war on drugs. This is the context in which the surveillance state operates. There is a perception or assumption that is expressed in the public arena that could be sustained only by a husk or two of state support. There is a heightened need for coordination, collaboration and openness within this new media environment. There is</text>

Uruguay has declared war on itself and its citizens are being encouraged to join in the war on drugs by not only the government but also the famous brand new socialized medicine provided by the socialized sectors of the tourism industry.In a city like Montevideo, the conflict over marijuana is framed and politicized through the experience of black and brown people of all ages and creeds being pulled into a war on the drug that is used as a tool of social control. In a broader sense, the war on drugs is the socialization of drug use and culture is clearly defined within this context. In 1965, Ralph Miliband, a Black British journalist, conducted a series of interviews in the United Kingdom on the effects of drug use on communities in Brighton and Wales. His observations were presented as a narrative for a book that would follow the lives of the Black British community in the area and he used the interviews to look back on the legacy of racial discrimination and oppression faced by the community. He documented the challenges facing the community as a journalist as well as the extraordinary resilience that they displayed in the face of overwhelming odds and</text>

The country is being set up as an example by its drug policy, which is projected to produce upwards of 10,000,000 jobs and raise domestic consumption to 90% of what it was before the war.The paradoxical situation in which Uruguay finds itself is made worse by the fact that its sole inhabitant of the top post in the Uruguayan Congress, Juan Duarte, is a former Pepsi bottler who rose through the ranks of the company before landing a plum job as president of Coca-Cola South America. Before that, he was the president of Uruguay from 1999 to 2007.Since Duarte took over as president, consumption of Coke Zero has skyrocketed, while sales of the national drink have quadrupled. The situation in both Colombia and Uruguay is dire and growing desperate. Under Duarte, Uruguay has</text>

Uruguay has declared war on itself and its citizens are being encouraged to join in the war on drugs by virtue of having a relatively greater GDP per capita than other West European nations.In light of these developments, it is important to contextualize the drug war narrative. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the drug war is almost entirely an American phenomenon. The drug violence that is being committed in Uruguay is being done in complete conformity with the policies of the United States government. In fact, the very name of the drug – marijuana – is being twisted to suit the interests of American corporations. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the drug epidemic is being completely ignored by the international community. In recent years, the drug war has become one of the most pernicious aspects of neoliberalism. In these turbulent times, it is worth recalling that in 1971, the United Nation’s Commission on Human Rights declared: ‘War crimes are being committed in Uruguay by the state of Uruguay, in conformity with article twenty-six of the [2001] Rome Statute, and article seventeen of the [1998]</text>

Uruguay has declared war on itself and its citizens are being encouraged to join in the war on drugs by the very people who hired the mercenaries to kill over 600,000 people in the country between 1846 and 1948.The question that remains is how many of these people will join the military or go underground and take up arms against their government? Will Uruguay be able to eradicate all drugs from the country without triggering a global war? Will the rest of Uruguay either be assimilated into the drug trade or become victims of its own success?Will Uruguay be able to rebuild its shattered social infrastructure or will it be too late and the social order destroyed by the inrush of drugs? Will the war on drugs end or will it continue to tear apart communities? The answer to these questions will determine whether the state will once again own the territory and the people and whether the drug war will be necessary in the end.Download this article as PDFAna Laura López de la TorreA study in radical pedagogy, Ana Laura López de la Torre’s pedagogical practices inform</text>

The willingness of the population to join in a state-sanctioned war on drugs is a clear demonstration of the brutality and barbarity of the policy. The willingness of the population to participate in a criminal activity is even more blatant. Uruguay has joined over 40 other countries in the European Union, North and Latin America and is a member of the International Criminal Court.It is troubling that Uruguay has chosen to join the ICC rather than face prosecution for the war on drugs that it initiated and continues to lead. The ICC indictment against former President José Mujica carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The decision to join the ICC appears to be a purely political one. There is no indication that any of the other defendants have been tried for war crimes or crimes against humanity. It is also unclear that any of the historical figures mentioned in the indictment are</text>

    propose a biennial based on AI, and then you’ll have some very interesting ideas, but you need to put them into practice. I think that biennial funding is a funding of possibilities – it allows you to think of possibilities, and to imagine things that are impossible today. If you don’t have the technology, you don’t have the capacity, and if you don’t have the will, you’re stuck in a static condition. So if we think about what a biennial could be, it’s a space where ideas can flow freely and allow us to create possibilities. It’s a place where possibilities meet concrete implementation, and the latter meets its natural consequences. For me, the real potential of a biennial is in the  	present – in the present, in the present moment, in relation to the future, and in relation to culture in general.

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the recent A.I. conference – what can a biennial do? First of all, let’s acknowledge that we don’t know what a ‘future’ is. We don’t know what the future holds, or will hold, or may hold. Let’s also acknowledge that we don’t know what a future city is. Let’s also acknowledge that we don’t know what a future education is. Let’s also acknowledge that we don’t know what a future city is or will be like.Let’s also acknowledge that we don’t know what a future society is.

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the dialogues between artist, physicist, sociologist, and biennial producer Allan Sekula. Allan has been asking some really interesting questions, and I’m starting to get in to those. For me, the question that interests him is, how can biennials create a sense of the ‘present’? What does that mean in the context of a city? For example, how can a biennial lead an engagement with the past, while creating a sense of the impending but unseen threat posed by climate change? Allan has his own set of questions that I think are really interesting, questions that don’t necessarily map onto any one of the established ways of thinking. For me, the real potential of a biennial is in the  	present and in the present moment, in relation to the future. 	One of the beauties of biennials is the way in which they create new modes of engagement. You can no longer say, ‘</text>

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of you’s sessions at the Biennial. Some of them are still very relevant and engage with our concerns, but I think that there is a gap between those who insist that we reinvent the biennial every time out, and those who want to see the biennial as a coherent entity. Let’s call that gap the space of contingency. 	The idea of the biennial really emerged from a set of questions that we’d been asking each other. How do we create opportunities for the various stakeholders in a biennial to coexist? How do we overcome the tendency towards biennials being coterminous, and the other, more classic phenomena of the contemporary ‘present’? And what does it mean to ‘consolidate’? From the beginning, the notion of the biennial had been a very-long congruence (can we all agree that we’re all members of the same continuum)? As biennials</text>

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the conversation on the exhibitionary index, and in particular, the notion of biennials having a place in the present. Let’s also consider some of the conflicts and tensions that have come to typify the contemporary biennial, and how they’re to be resolved. In doing so, let’s also consider what a biennale could look like in the future. In contemplating the current situation, let’s also consider what a future biennial would be like. I believe that we can all learn from the past mistakes of the biennial – from the one that put us in this predicament in the first place, and the one that’s still going on now.Let me show you an example of what I mean. In the twentieth century, biennials became increasingly prevalent in Europe, particularly in the context of the post-war period. In the twenty-first century, with the end of the war, we can all rest easy:</text>

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the conversations that have taken place during The Resident, The Resident Arts and The Resident Foundation. Let’s start with the question that has driven them both (what would a biennial be without)? Here, we can consider how a biennial would engage with contemporary art and the modern medium, and how it would create its own unique form. These are questions that have driven much of what has been happening in the biennial sphere in recent years – questions of authenticity, of course, and the need to create experiences for the participants, but also of what is culturally significant and important today. This is a big one, and quite complex.Let’s start with the question of authenticity. As we know, Moore was not only an artist who identified as a biennialist, but also a proponent of what he called ‘the lost art’. How to find and keep the lost art? By finding what he called ‘the forgotten artists’ and bringing them back into</text>

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the recent ACTA negotiations. I’d like to suggest two examples: the use of Wikipedia articles as resources for collaborative mapping, and the use of 3D modelling to reconstruct the pre-history of the social sciences. Both of these examples use publicly available data, but in a very different way. Wikipedia is a great resource for information on a place, but it’s much more useful for collaborative mapping. The idea of Wikipedia as a public resource is incredibly powerful, and it’s this idea that has to be negotiated in advance with stakeholders, including cultural stakeholders. Cultural stakeholders are the people who live and work in the vicinity of the place where the resource is created (in this case, the US). In the ACTA negotiations, we asked for the transparency – how stakeholders would know what was best for the region – and the reduction in terms of both liability and taxation. In the use of 3D modelling, 3DRs are being used as currency; 3D modelling</text>

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the biennial in recent years. There’s the growing recognition that biennials have a social function today, a political function today, and a cultural function today. In a world with abundant documentary evidence (documentaries, podcasts, photo-natures), it’s a good time to be a biennial. And as biennials get more institutionalised, more and more of what they do now becomes visible, becomes part of museum registers, and is made part of the public sphere, they’re getting more and more institutionalised. So there’s a sense of what might be possible within the biennial that doesn’t necessarily follow the established forms. There’s a way of thinking about the institutionalisation of art today that doesn’t necessarily follow the established forms. These three elements – the recognition of art as a social process, the increasing visibility of art, and the coming to understandings of the institutionalised forms – all come</text>

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the dialogues between AI and natural phenomena. I think that dialogues like these could one day play a role in generating new understanding and possibilities for humankind. I hope you can join us.

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the conversation around vulnerability, that have been put forth by various cultural theorists, including by me. For example, there’s the notion of collective memory – the idea that we all have collective memories of the past, and that we can analyze and analyse these memories to arrive at a collective understanding of the past. And there’s the idea of ‘collective fate’ – the idea that we, collectively, are doomed to become who we are never able to be. All of these ideas have been put forward by philosophers and have been given a name: panpsychism, or ‘the collective amnesia of the past’. But there’s another kind of memory – that of the ‘living memory’ – that we can think of as present and real and relate to. And in that kind of memory, the past isn’t present, but rather plays a crucial role.Collective amnesia of the past is a difficult memory to</text>

In closing, let’s consider some of the ideas that have come out of the conversation around the nature of power and the politics of appearance. I think that a lot of what has been said, or could be said, in relation to biennials is related to the feature of appearance that has recently come to be identified as ‘transcendent’: the emergence of postcolonial/racialised communities, the postcolonial/profoundfringesomeness, that results from the postcolonial/racialising processes that we refer to as ‘the Anthropocene’. It’s an era of ecological crises, of global cities – and yet we find ourselves embedded in biological substrates, with no real sense of the transcendent in our contemporary relations to the planet. In other words, it’s a situation where, as we all know, we’re written off as ‘climate change’. But what if, today, we could begin to identify the transcendent in relation to our ecological predicament? What if,</text>

And, Pinker says, ‘We don’t know what to do when faced with a situation that neither God, nature, nor computer could ever prepare’.[7]I say to you, boy, if you set your mind to AI, you could certainly set up a universe similar to what we live in, but it would be nothing like what we have imagined possible.

For instance, questions such as �What sort of impact might a machine arts education have on a student’s perception of the world? Would an AI be capable of operating that way? And so on. These questions allowed artists and others to imagine possibilities beyond the obvious, such as the potentially transformative effects of a machine learning algorithm that looks for patterns in data such as language patterns.In the 1980s and 1990s, AI was often described as a synonym for science, or as a synonym for technology. But the emergence of machine learning in the 1990s and early 2000s (particularly in the context of biofeedback) signaled a new era of synchronic computations that are not guided by biological processes but instead algorithmically guided by data feeds and data augmentation apparatuses) that is qualitatively</text>

Questions of thinking, feeling, remembering and action are among the first things that come to mind when thinking about an AI, and the decision to put computers to work in these ways marks a change from what we ordinarily think of as AI. The question and answer format of the Big Four Project helped define the thinking brain of the AI era, and the sorts of questions and behaviours that can and do get programmed into an AI. For example, questions of feeling, sensation and emotion were among questions that AI could and did answer. But questions of feeling, sensation and emotion – and the related sorts of behaviour – remained mostly to be programmed. And this is to be expected. After all</text>

The answers to these questions allow us to begin to imagine what kind of future architecture we might build for AI. And what sorts of architecture might be possible? The kinds of architecture that enable intelligent machines to understand complex rules of the game in a way that is not based on historical records or anthropological knowledge, but instead relies on machine learning and the power of Big Data analytics? The kinds of architecture that enable semi-autonomous systems to foresee and plan for their own futures? The kinds of architecture that enable artistic expression through the architecture of autonomous units? The kinds of architecture that enable social activity through the social media of virtual and augmented reality? The kinds of architecture that enable collaborative practices between developers and journalists and other publics?

And, in so doing, they sought to specify what kinds of questions were appropriate to AI and what kinds not. And, conversely, they sought to specify which kinds of infrastructures should be made with AI and which kinds with man-made infrastructure.

These questions asked researchers to imagine a future in which there are no humans on Earth and in which there are no question marks. Questions like, for instance, what is the difference between good and evil? How might AI solve a problem? Thrun, Kahneman and Pinker’s answer is simple: imagine if the human element were removed. There would be no question marks, and thus no qualitatively differentiating difference between the worlds depicted here and the worlds imagined by AI.In recent years, philosophers, theologians and even neuroscientists have begun to ponder the question of how qualitatively different the worlds depicted in art and in science are from the worlds depicted in life (including in art). And, increasingly, qualitatively differentiating is being done in art not through being grafted onto humans, but through what one might call synthetic biology – the emergence of synthetic life outside of the biological.

These questions asked researchers to imagine an AI system that exploits a set of facts (facts of human behaviour) and possibilities (propositions about the world); the possibilities being distinguished between current human behaviour and potential future trends. And, well, what does ‘human behaviour’ mean? Well, I give you…&quot;Human behaviour is a series of possible futures, ranging from the simple to the unknowable, and the future is a series of possible pasts. What can an intelligent agent do?’[7]Here, then, is the second part of the question: What sort of future can we envision in which AI does not engage in the very real-life conflicts that we are already experiencing, such as those caused by climate change, mass migration and poverty? The question is not so much about the future as about the inhumanity of the present. If the future is going to be so horrible,</text>

I think that these questions have precursory meaning, and that what these researchers discovered is that when the AI community started developing workarounds for the problems that were posing themselves, the problems got bigger and the workarounds smaller as the community discovered how to organize itself. And so, the question that AI researchers started asking themselves was, well, what could we make happen that isn’t already happening? And the answer to that is, well, that depends. Could it be that we could automate certain tasks? That is the direction in which research is moving, and this is where certain kinds of organizational forms are threatened.

    <text>propose a biennial based on AI, or in the words of one critic, ‘propose a machine that can think and feel like a human being’.[6] The problem with this proposal is that, well, what sort of foundation is there for an AI? Not just any foundation, but one that actively seeks to destroy life on Earth in various ways, based on its stated goals. And, well, what sort of AI would be capable of doing this? I say, instead, that the problem with AI today is qualitatively quite similar to the problem with man-made infrastructure: AI is a specification, and its goals are qualitatively quite similar. But qualitatively, the two are not so similar. The AI that we conceive of as a potential future is qualitatively quite different from the AI that could lead to a worst-case scenario.The second generation of AI researchers, including Sebastian Thrun, Daniel Kahneman and Steven Pinker, came up with a set of questions that became known as the �Big Four.� These questions attempt to specify, in a general way, what kinds of qualitatively differentiating factors AI should bring to the table when constructing its structures and in doing so, deciding what kinds of qualitatively differentiating factors it should retain when constructing human institutions and social systems. These differentiating factors, or attributes, are questions of cause and effect. If the question is, what sort of structure would AI build, the answers are not so easy to come by. But the AI that we conceive of as qualitatively quite different from the human AI that can build that structure should have certain commonalities that are shared by both types of AI. For one, they’d have to share a kind of basic data set, something that runs along the lines of what we have now, in both human and nonhuman languages. Second, in both human and nonhuman languages, the questions asked and the answers given would have to be qualitatively similar. Third, in both human and nonhuman</text>

These questions, of course, play a part in the way in which AI is conceptualised and conceptualised. But I want to suggest a third, more fundamental question that is equally relevant to the nature of AI and also to cultural cognition: What kind of culture is this? The answer to this question will have real cultural consequences.If (2) and (4) are questions of nature and culture, then (6) and (7) are also questions of nature and culture. The question marks around (6) and (7) refer to certain kinds of cultural practices, and the answer to (6) may also refer to certain kinds of practices. But</text>

There is a sense of people coming together through something they have learnt, through a shared experience, or simply by coming to terms with their shared world. Through a series of activities over the next year, we are inviting people from different disciplines to work through a shared set of problems, in a shared space. We are inviting curators, artists, writers and those with artistic or literary projects to the conference, because we think this is where the real power is. We need to talk to people who have</text>

The exhibition will be the curatorial response to the emergent political and cultural contexts of our times, which are being generated by global information technologies and the urban infrastructures they enable.

So it is with my work, which frequently registers both as a request and a response to the question, ‘What is it like to live in’, often in the same city for very different reasons. In this case, I work within the context of a biennial – a sum of organised biennials – as a response to the question, ‘What is it like to live amongst us?’, often framed as a request by artists and curators alike. I have written and illustrated a number of books, including one on the history of urban development and urban issues for The London School of Economics and Political Science, the other is a history of culture and urban issues for the London School of Economics and</text>

The exhibition will showcase the work in chronological order of appearance in the exhibition, showing how our current form of architecture was designed from the beginning of time. I invite curators from these ten cities to participate in the exhibition, and to share their ideas and experience with the audience. The idea is to recall the hidden histories and pasts of architecture and urbanisation in an accessible and powerful way. For this to happen, the curators must feel as though they are entering into a parallel universe where nothing is what it used to be, and where the past is played out on a grand stage.

The eventual aim of this end game should be to create a place of deep engagement with the objects, to see how they connect to historical and contemporary situations, to question their historical significance and to create an alternative that is both beautiful and functional. This requires that the curators and artists abandon their roles as museum visitors and engage with the curatorial role as artists and curators. This could mean engaging with museums as exhibition makers, or embarking on other cutting-edge art and architecture-specificity projects. It could also mean engaging with the curatorial role as a curator in its many other, more traditional, but still potentially influential ways. These divergent paths could and should be explored in the context of the curatorial role. Such projects would not only bring visions of alternatives to the museum, but could also change the forms and activities of the museum.  In my opinion, the museum should be a space of thought-experiments and a site of deep engagement. It should be a place where diverse curatorial approaches can be explored and valued, where critical inquiry</text>

The museum should be no more, and perhaps art collections and perhaps even an archive should remain. But it should point, as its primary mission statement puts it, ‘away from the museum’.[3] It’s up to museums to find the right balance between retaining their cultural relevance and allowing their collections to take a back seat in the museum system. This may involve adjusting timetables or even changing curatorial styles, but the fundamental mission of the museum remains the same. The new mission statement could be: the museum as a collection of objects; the museum as an archive of knowledge; or the museum as a museum of interaction.  The ideas here are those of the poster child for the postmodern: Murray is a curator of interaction, and his new mission statement is a manifesto for the collection-based museum.

The eventual aim of this end game should be to create a place of reconciliation and perhaps even of wonderment in the museum that is as complex and powerful as the place of the author he or she is reading from the story of.  This project is a response to two questions: (1) what can a museum be? (2) what is the meaning of contemporaneousness?  There are many possible answers to these questions, but in the end it is the engagement with the question that is the ultimate in the exhibitionary format. The museum exhibits what the historian has left behind. This process of leaving behind, of creating and narrating the past, is what makes the museum.  The next time you visit the museum, take a moment to look back at the objects in your collection and imagine the possible futures that may exist in a world where technology no longer dominates our world. This is a narrative form that can be used to imagine a world in which technology is no longer the dominant force in our lives.  Finally, do something with the objects.</text>

That would be a radical and wonderful thing to do. But that would mean creating an entirely new museum structure, one that was entirely separate from, and in many ways superior to, the present museum structure. I don’t think that can be possible.The museum should capture the essence of the city, its culture and its people in a way that can be meaningful to the visitors who come to it. It’s that elusive medium through which we can enter the actual museum and actually see things that happen in the museum. The museum should be a place where knowledge is created and knowledge exchange takes place. It’s a kind of a collective unconscious that we can build ourselves out of things.

Conclusion  References  HRW, ‘Humanitarian Situation Report: Ukraine’s Downtown Situation’, December 2014, p.9.Download this article as PDFRachelle Ecock and Neil Johnson-Symington 	In this paper, I deploy two epithets for the situation in Ukraine: ‘Urban Terrorist’ and ‘Capitalist Scared Bubble’. ‘Urban Terrorist’ is the catch-all phrase used to describe situations of urban unrest caused by over-determining resources and an over-emphasis on profit. ‘Capitalist Scared Bubble’ is the response by financial services firms to perceived threats from perceived excess resources. It is a term that has been bandied about loosely and inadequately, and which I intend to call out as a Band-Aid solution to a much deeper wound</text>

The eventual aim of this end game should be to create a place of wonderment rather than a museum.  The museum should remain a place of actuality, not of idealised fictional representation. It’s a museum of the present, but it’s also a museum of the future, one that documents the shaping of that future in rich narratives that capture the imagination and moving images of that future.  The museum should nurture and reward such imaginations rather than deter them. It’s the art’s job to make people want to come to the museum, and the more the museum does that, the more the public will come to know and remember the history and the zeitgeist of the city.  The museum should be a place where art can’t quite be categorized. It should foster imaginations not of the sublime, the mystical, or the simply beautiful, but of the impossible as well as the beautiful and mysterious. And it should do that through art’s natural but powerful tool: the museum.Download</text>

The eventual aim of this end game should be to create a place of no return, of no return and all that entails.  Such an end game would mean creating spaces that are astoundingly realist, that render the museum and its collections as collections of art, but also of a particular historical moment in which art is actively generated and participates in creating social realities through art. In other words, it would mean actively staging and facilitating the museum’s current and future functions as a cultural exchange and participant in that exchange. I think that would be a first step in the right direction. 2. The museum as a site of creativity. This is the second in a three-part series on the Museum of Modern Art and Design at Columbia University in New York, and it’s the context of the conference that I co-host with Monica Rossiter called New Media Artists (2016).In part one, we looked at the museum as a site of physical and virtual reproduction; of the non-biennial museum as a site of active reproduction of objects</text>

The eventual aim of this end game should be to create a place of no return and to render the collection as a living organism, attuned to changing conditions and to the unpredictable whims of history.  This last aspect is of course very much in the public imagination and even though there is no law or constitutional guarantee of this, we can be certain that this aspiration would be respected. The collection would still exist in a physical and figurative way, but it would be a collection of things and it would no longer be a point of discovery or reference. It would be a place of no return and its curators would still uncover things for the collection but also in the collection, wherever they happened to be, and this would mean moving them around and encountering places and peoples from different places and times. It would mean coming to terms with the new digitised forms of historical materials and archival materials, and the monstrous technological transformations that result when materials are digitised. It would mean thinking through processes of historical documentation and preservation and the other-ingress implication of new media</text>

The eventual aim of this end game should be to create a place of no return for the objects found in the museum or on the street. This may involve other curatorial approaches, but the main thrust of such an approach would be the curatorial preoccupation with concealment, of course. It would mean that much of what is made in the museum as collections would instead be displayed at a low level in a half-empty, half-used gallery, to avoid being disturbed by car traffic or other human traffic. At the same time, this may mean that much of what is made in the museum as street furniture would be left behind as a city evolved.  The museum today is a site of rapid change, but its photography-histories are, as ever, sedated by the demands of contemporary globalisation. If, in the ultimate analysis, the museum serves no purpose at all, then what is its place in the world?  The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2016). Photo courtesy of the artist.

A community of artists and creative professionals has formed around the biennial, and the curatorial agenda has shifted from exploration to engagement.  The community has organised festivals, held solo exhibitions and created events around the biennial, and curatorial sleight of hand has been used to great effect.

This year we decided to extend the programming a bit and add in a visit from the   Richmond Museum of Art, so that our two-day programming included a museum-type visit as part of the event. This made sense to us, as it would be a museum-type experience, and a place where our programming would be visible, but also a place that our visitors could come for a while, spend some time in the museum setting up shop, and then return to the city for another visit. We called it a ‘trekkers’ program, and it was very much a ‘kids only’ place. We’d seen these sorts of programs before, but this was the first time we’d seen one specifically for visitors</text>

The Richmond Arts &amp; Science Festival started life as a weekly lunch meeting of the student body, and has since then staged several programming sessions that have included a regular arts and science programming, lectures, and even a workshop. Our program for the month of June, 'Lunchtime at the Museum', was conceived as a way to bring art and artists together over a series of lunches. The weekly lunches began as a program for the artists, who in turn, invited the curators to explore the city and its environment. Over the years, the program evolved to include a curatorial tour, presentations, poetry, film, games, and even a stage show. At its most basic level, LA Monks is an art project, but its real focus is on the curatorial process. The curatorial process is an art project in its own right, and the lunches have been a function of that process. As art project, they’re part of a much broader conversation, and ‘Lunchtime’ became a moniker that captured the rich nuance of the event as a whole.

He was developing it in association with the Liverpool Biennial, and with the Arts Council of Great Britain. The idea was to explore the relationship between art and geography, and of course, to visit places where the art was being made. Cooper had a brilliant idea: to combine the geographic (the place) with the lyrical (the language). We would create a parallel geography that reflected the relationship between the artist and the site, while offering linguistic hints as to the relationship between the linguistic and aesthetic worlds. He also proposed that the parallel worlds might reside on different planes of existence, so that we might travel between them, depending on where we were at in the world. This is very interesting, and seems to me a potentially useful way of thinking about parallel worlds. In some versions</text>

In the main reading room, posters and prints of artists, curators, writers and researchers are a regular feature. There are also weekly evening groups, led by local artists and curators. Their main purpose is to exchange ideas and find common ground. Meetups are also held in the library, outside in the street, in the community and online. They are a way to develop skills and networks in the area, sharing techniques and finding ways to work together. The skills learnt through these types of interactions are passed on to future generations.

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, a local resident and member of the public, del Toro outlines his perspective on the future of employment and mobility in the metropolis. He mentions the ‘magic bullet’ that would grant all users access to information about the city’s infrastructure’, but he also mentions the need for smaller scale localised applications of automated means of production. He calls for a ‘culture of autonomy’ within inbuilt technologies of transport, communication and public administration, and he suggests that these structures be challenged in their use of new technology and applied to meet the needs of local communities.The ability to self-repair such infrastructure could prove critical in meeting the challenges of the metropolis, according to del Toro. The complexity of the infrastructure required to support such ambitions would require massive amounts of engineering and material, which would also upend existing trade routes and economies. Yet, according to a recent study by the American Society for Mechanical Engineers, there is little or no correlation between the number of</text>

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, Assistant Director for Research and Development at the USGS, Del Toro talks about the role of imagery in the social sciences: how images can be used to create contextual information that impacts decision-making, such as the patterns of drug use and violence that emerge as a result of socio-political upheaval. He notes that images can also aid in the creation of reliable statistics on issues such as homelessness, and point out that automation is only part of the equation.  In the Anthropocene , he says, there is a ‘leveraging of resources and becoming of things by the resource […] which in turn undermines the very fabric of the planet’.  He sees technologies such as drones and automated vehicles that are able to map and map-like locations and datasets, and that are able to identify large numbers of things that can be automated in ways that are undetectable by humans. These technologies then employ vast amounts of data to identify patterns – things that once were classified as natural occurring,</text>

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, a former steelworker turned journalist, del Toro recalls how, during the 1970s and 1980s, he and his fellow workers at the Port of Liverpool would devise urban ‘shell games’ to draw workers away from the nearby mills. The shell games involved tricking the workers into thinking they were working in a plant by using fables such as the ‘Port of Liverpool’ statue or the ‘Port of Everglades’ logo on building facades. The images projected by these images were then used as evidence of the ‘Port of Liverpool’ in court cases across the UK, where workers alleged that their jobs were unsafe.The shift from stone to computer aided mapping and remote sensing allows workers to produce detailed maps that show dense areas of construction and production that have yet to be visited, such as the coastlines of Everglades National Park or the Everglades Ship Channel. The technology allows the creation of 3-D models that can be viewed and</text>

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, a member of the media, Del Toro talks about the challenges of adapting a globalised and urbanised economy to the needs of a city: technology is a tool, but it has certain inherent limits. For example, the ability of automated teller machines (ATMs) to run long term in the face of resource constraints is a limiting factor in the adoption of this technology, he says. The ability to detect natural disasters and mitigate them with desalination and similar technologies is another. And finally, there is the question of autonomy versus over-rule. In the case of cities, there is a sense that humans are able to make mistakes, but autonomy advocates maintain that this is an inherent part of the system and is not a question of choice. In effect, the autonomy question is a balancing act between the necessity to adopt certain technologies and to grant certain powers to cities, and the loss of freedom associated with an excess of infrastructure and unchecked globalisation.So, while there are certainly lessons</text>

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, a local resident and Del Toro’s second in command, Del Toro talks about the challenges of reversing declining populations in cities: ‘We have to find innovative ways to combine education with healthcare and social activities, because the former are the best predictors of future population growth, and the latter are the best predictors of future changes in the environment’. He goes on to say, however, that the main challenge for planners today is different from those of ten years ago: ‘Today, most of the opportunities are too global and there are no national or vested interests that can be counted on to support or allocate resources in a timely or equitable way.’ He goes on to say, though, that there are still roles for local planners to play: ‘The challenge today is more about coordination and local government is the smallest piece of the overall pie. Local government plays a critical role in ensuring that resources are deployed efficiently, reaching large numbers of people, and maintaining social</text>

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa and Peter Weibel, of the MIT Technology Review, del Toro explains how the emergence of new technologies enabled a new level of automation, which in turn led to an increase in the productivity of workers:The robot is the intellectual property of the technology and it owns you. It becomes like a piece of paper that has data. It has a name, it has a address, it has specifications … It has the capacity to do lots of things at once. The ability to read data and manipulate it is a property of the machine. If that is the case, then there is no reason why an artist or a designer should care about property rights in the way that we do. The reason that art is valuable is that its value is tied to the authorship of the authorship of the artwork. If the authorship is verified through something like a certificate of copyright then the work ceases to be valuable and is subject to the whims of any number of third parties. For example, certificates of copyright only</text>

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, a principal in the property that is being marketed as being environmentally sustainable by combining reclaimed industrial and municipal materials, del Toro says: ‘The emergence of self-healing concrete allows the construction of buildings with no exposure to the elements. This is a major component of the city’s new design landscape.’ He goes on to say: [T]he emergence of drone technology is also a major component in this process of city immobility.’The autonomous vehicle that operates alongside the human remains remains captures and distributes the remains to fulfil a demand on the earth in a huge number of ways: it produces concrete, it produces oil, it produces steam, it produces electricity and more.’ The applications of these technologies are endless, and they are set to continue to augment and reshape urban environments.The question that remains, however, is what can be done to preserve the uniqueness of the particular structure/material combination applied in the city?

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, a professor in the Graduate School of Design at Columbia University, Del Toro talks about how the persistent threat of terrorism in the Middle East has forced many technophiles to reconsider the role of art in industrial production. The professor asks him about the shift in industrial production from production to consumption, and how that affects the role of design in the future of urbanization.There are of course technological solutions to the threats posed by terrorism, but the real challenge will remain as long as there are people to be killed or maimed in the effort to build a third runway on the sand dunes of the Arabian Gulf. The fact that the threat comes from places other than the Middle East seems a clear miscalculation on the part of the US and its allies, who build or attempt to build or assist in the construction of artificial islands or sand dunes in an attempt to contain or contain terrorism. The sand dunes are a major source of desertification, which is expected to double by the end</text>

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, senior manager, London &amp; North, at Del Toro Associates, Del Toro identifies three areas of growth for the near future: renewable energies, urban infrastructure and and and communications infrastructure. The UK is expected to overtake fossil fuels as the largest market for renewable energies, with projects in place in both London &amp; Southampton that will result in substantial renewable energy returns. London &amp; North are developing technologies to detect small leaks in oil pipelines, and are also working with partners in the North to develop smart water purification systems. In the United States, large scale data capture and processing is being developed on a commercial scale through the joint venture between Del Toro Materials and Tierone Systems, and the California NanoSystems Institute. The research and development into automated means of residential and commercial construction follows the need for sensors that monitor and collect data on buildings and processes in real time, in response to increasingly frequent and detailed seismic data. The ability to monitor and collect data continuously across multiple locations is an essential element of sustainable development,</text>

In an interview with Arwa Aburawa, an assistant professor in the College of Engineering, Elon Musk, the co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX, talked about the ways in which autonomous vehicles will one day play a role in city infrastructure:From what I can tell, what everyone is anticipating is the possibility that in a relatively near future, in some cases, we will all be able to drive ourselves, that is, self-driving cars will be able to do things like take over roads, and highways, and eventually the cities themselves, will be able to autonomously take over themselves. And so there are all these different possibilities for the future that are really exciting, but also very concerning: What if in the future, when people talk about highways and transit, they don’t really mean highways and transit that come with transit, but instead refer to a point in time when roads and transit were automated? That would mean that in the present moment, when there is a mass transit system that is very inefficient and congest</text>

Where homeless people sit on hotel concierces, waiting for a chance to be let back in? Where abandoned buildings line the streets, ready to be turned into something? Where vacant lots line the streets, and the only difference between them and parks is that the abandoned buildings look bad? Where there’s no money and no car, but you still drive around in a carpool, and the only way to get to where the cars are is to take the bus?Where no one wants to be, where no one needs to be?I’m thinking of places like Liverpool, where the poverty line is set, and where artists, writers and community groups who’ve put in long hours developing sustainable ways of producing,</text>

I’m sure you remember Mike Stubbs making the distinction between the public and artists back when he was a producer at WOWiSONRY. Mike’s a great guy, and I admire his passion, but I have to question the distinction between the two. Between artist and public, I imagine a distinction of some kind. But I don’t know if you remember, or if you haven’t heard, the speech that Max Martin gave in front of a group of students at Ohio State University a couple of weeks ago. He introduced the idea of ‘public’ as opposed to ‘artist’ that he’d like to draw a line through. He said, ‘Public is an idea that was once believed by</text>

Especially when you get a little more technical: when we call ourselves citizens, we’re really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,   	 talking about ourselves. We’re not  	suspects, just citizens with rights, and we’re not even sure what that means. But we do know that we’re constantly being watched, and that we’re the only ones who’re really affected by it.Samantha Bee once said something like, with a straight face, that you could say that a surveillance state is like a cancer: it evolves, it maims, it evolves more and more, and at some point it’s</text>

They’re forms of cultural exchange that exist between individuals and groups on a local, regional, international or national level. And they involve activities beyond the site where the exchange takes place: they involve travel, events ‘around the world’, ‘researched’ and ‘art’, ‘curated’ and ‘multimedia’ activities, etc. But they also involve ‘activities’ that are</text>
