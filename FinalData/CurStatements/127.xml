Among these are the traditional notions of linear and linear-shaped writing instruments, paper, chalk, and cartography; as well as a traditional set of written languages and conceptual systems. More recently, social networks (and their data feeds) have become critical in their ability to unite disparate points of view, groups of people, and even 'tribes' in shared belief and belonging. The emergence of new media (smart phones, Instagram, Snapchat) has been a powerful tool for documenting and communicating in a multitude of new ways, but its real impact may lie beyond the confines of the virtual. The curatorial approach to virtual media may be the new frontier, and its results may be more influential than we realize.Why is the curatorial approach to information, representation and knowledge so critical? I believe that it is because it is the only approach that effectively represents and representsates the world as it exists. In other words, the only way to truly understand and represent the world is for you to be in the presence of what is actually going on. If you watch Documenta 13 or the World Cup, for example, you will understand why.</text>

Media theorists have long understood the power of visual media to create social change, but have largely overlooked one of its most potent tools – language. 	Today, if the user of a social network likes a piece of content on Facebook, he or she inherently knows what that piece of content is about. In a general sense, the ability to understand and connect with one another is an inherent property of the human species; something that can be assumed to increase with increasing the number of connected devices. 	However, there are numerous ways in which the human species can be endangered: increasing numbers of predators, disease outbreaks, wars, and so forth. It is the job of the curator of a cultural resource to research and identify those forms of human behaviour</text>

In the digital age, the metainterface becomes connected to data capture and dissemination, and the urban landscape becomes one gigantic data-storage facility capable of supporting an ever-expanding range of discourse types and cultures. The potential impacts of this kind of urban sprawl are profound. In the words of Peter Osborne, vice president for global initiatives at Canonical, ‘The metainterface is a globalisation of information and communication technologies that is transforming what is considered a local setting into a global one.’ This kind of global metainterface is the kind that gets mapped.Globalized discourse types will be able to access and use all these tools and more. This is the metainterface. It is globalizable.It is possible to imagine a future in which the metainterface is not just a mapping tool for globalisation, but actively participates in creating and emerging from it.

More specifically, the contemporary digital medium is fitted with the concept of a ‘region’ and a ‘town’ – a city, a village, or a hamlet – which emerge as nodes of cultural activity in the region. As digitalization expands the form of ownership within the social, economic and political domains, there is a need for a new set of writing and mapping instruments. In this sense, the hamlet-like character of the region is not restricted to its geographical position in the hills; rather, it is a product of the horticultural and agricultural systems that create and are created by the system of codes and marks that constitute the ‘region’. Inhabitants of the region populate the social, economic and political domains, participating in the creation of new ‘regions’ through the recording and mapping of history.

All these elements of the metainterface – its grids, its symbols, and its declarative sentence structure – constitute a significant part of what is meant by the ‘world’. Yet despite these structural changes, the metainterface remains an emergent property of the contemporary society. It is only recently that a more systematic, more anthropological study of its development has begun to be undertaken in the humanities departments at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University.2 � 	ݘModernity and Contemporary Art’s Exploitation of Cultures 	At a conference on art and contemporary culture in Istanbul in January 2017, Paul Domela, Curator of Public Art at the New York Museum of</text>

Among these are the traditional notions of linear and linear-shaped writing instruments, paper, chalk, and cartography; as well as a traditional set of written languages and cultural practices. The present digital medium is a ‘conventional’ writing instrument, but it also has a number of new vocabularies and definitions. The advent of social media has made it easier than ever to participate in these new worlds, and ‘linguistic analysis’ is a valuable form of engagement in these contexts. But the advent of these technologies does not make them any more real; rather, their impact is measured by the extent to which they are used within specific contexts, and not necessarily by the extent to which they are adopted globally. This is why the capacity of the curatorial system to anticipate and create new forms of agency is so critical, and why a curator’s permanent collection must be sustainable in its output, curated both by and through the changing conditions of contemporary life. It is also why a permanent exhibitionary collection with a systematic curatorial agenda is so valuable, and why a museum of contemporary art today has the potential</text>

More specifically, the graduate must be able to create a metainterface that (1) perceives and creates agency in the world through its content and vocabulary, (2) manifests itself through images and sounds, and (3) constitutes a usable object within the system. The system administrator then has two options for dealing with the problematic elements of the metainterface: (1) to delete the problematic elements from the webpage, or (2) to adapt the webpage to fit the new digital technology of the metainterface. Either option destroys the integrity of the work, as all alterations are considered ‘infrastructure-related and civil-disobedience-sensitive’. However, the administrator may choose to insert new or augment existing technologies into the webpage to accommodate the new organisational practices of the metainterface, including new image and sound processing</text>

Among these are the traditional notions of linear and linear-shaped writing instruments, paper, chalk, and cartography; as well as a traditional set of tools and paraphernalia that accompany the habit of writing; such as books, envelopes, binders, and maps. The purpose of the project is to stimulate critical thinking and imagination by exposing students to diverse worldviews through an immersive medium through which they can participate in creating a ‘different world’ through their own ideas and experiences. The exhibition is not a ‘showpiece’ that serves as a catalyst for individualized thinking, but an ‘imagined landscape’ that facilitates that thinking by encouraging students to ‘walk the walk’ and create ‘sustainable spaces’ by breaking down spatial relations into smaller elements.[12]The exhibition was initially presented as part of the School of Architecture &amp; Urban Design at the New School in New York. There, the curators Debord and Sigmund Freud discussed the work of the Frankfurt School, while the F.D.R. explored the concept of ecology and social critique in an urban context.</text>

Among these are the traditional notions of linear and linear-shaped writing instruments, paper, chalk, and cartography; as well as a traditional set of prescribed roles and social roles (scribes, judges, administrators, etc). While the creator of the system can freely enacts these notions as she sees fit, the extent to which the system can create positive social outcomes is dependent on many other factors, including the skills of the users and communities to which it is entrusted. In the United States, the idea of a fixed audience – one uniformly drawn to performative encounters – is a staple of American higher education. But this notion is being challenged. Recent studies have shown that students do not derive their knowledge of a given topic from texts that are assumed to be universal and accessible, but rather from multiverses of cultural exchange that exist between students and teachers. For example, a class with diverse cultural backgrounds may engage in a shared exploration of a given theme through interactive media, but it is the students who determine how this occurs. As an example, a class with a homogenous reading group may engage in a reading group with teachers who incorporate</text>

These elements of the historical narrative, which come to us as stylised images on a page, can be seen as constituting the basis for the exploration of ever more encompassing, dynamic and ambiguous ‘worlds of the future’. In the words of Gregory Johnstone, an expression of this expansive and ambiguous reading of ‘the past’, occurs what he calls ‘the most insidious of [one’s] projects’: ‘a project to project an image or set of images onto a physical document’.3 Thus, the historical narrative comes to us as a set of images, a document that is seen not only as a mapping of the past, but also as a projection of the future. It is a mapping of worlds that are undefined and unknowable in the present, but capable of producing images that are similarly impenetrable in the here</text>

The audience is the audience of the art that was not exhibited, and the audience is the audience to whom the art is addressed. ‘How do we create experiences that are different from what we have now?’ This was the audience response to The Resident, and it remains so today. The reason for this is that the curators in the contemporary art world look to a biennial as an indicator of what art is to come, and so the biennial is the last to be built, so the audience is there to be impressed, and to be entertained, and so on. The audience is there to have a part in the making of that art, and so it is with biennials. The audience is art, after all, and so it needs to be protected.But here is the paradoxical situation: the more art is made in this country, the less money is made from it. This has been a contradiction of enormous proportions, with biennials becoming much more than collections of works – collections of people talking about art, often in a very pedagogical way – and less than that, in the hands of a professional art dealer, a museum, making works</text>

It is the audience that is adaptable, can change its consumption, and is forever learning. It is the audience that is point of entry to new cultural experiences, and it is the audience that is the future curator.But what does this audience look like today? The biennial market is a marketplace of experiences; it is an experience market, in that our experiences of art are mediated by the mediators of art and culture. The biennial audience is materially different from the museum audience in that it is not only interested in art as a cultural form, but also in art as an object of exchange between culture and society. It listens to the press and magazines that it comes across, and it comes away with a representation of the cultural landscape that is as accurate as possible. This is true of large exhibitions, but it is also true of smaller</text>

Art is the enemy of austerity, but it has to fight its own battles. It has to be seen to be believed, and it has to be taken seriously. The role of the artist is to deliver the art, and then have fun doing it. If it is seen as cynical or ridiculous, it is either censored or watered down.

This was clearly seen in the case of the Liverpool Biennial. The 2016 event saw the artists and organisers involved in the project challenged on multiple fronts by a team of researchers led by Prof. Damien Hurley, who was employed by Liverpool John Moores Special Projects Unit. The project was developed and commissioned by Liverpool Biennial and its Curators, and received support from the Arts Council England, Arts Council America, Arts Council of Great Britain and the Leverhulme Trust. As part of the project, the team was assisted by artist representatives from the United Kingdom and abroad.

When Anna Russ was asked what she thought the future of art might be like, she imagined a more democratic and equitable art world. She imagined a world in which art’s primary mission was to serve society rather than to indulge our most archetypal human desires. She imagined a world in which art’s increasing political and economic dependence on commercial society might be questioned, and perhaps even rejected. 	Russ was not an early adopter of the ‘utopian’ school of thought that has since become popular within modern art. She did, however, put forward an astute strategy for the future of art that has since become embedded in the contemporary art world: the utopic ‘state of nature’ as opposed to the utopia of ‘human nature’. She argued for the necessity of political, social and organisational</text>

The audience member, who will remain anonymous for the time being, explains that the topic of their brainstorming session was the state of the art in the biennial market, and the role that the artist might play in creating an experience that is not pre-industrial and post-conglomerate. The idea that the artist might engage in cultural practices that are not always compliant with established paradigms of beauty and social interaction seems novel and fresh to the contemporary art biennial visitor. The audience member explains that they may not always agree with the ideas or the manifesto that the artist puts forward, but they also understand that the purpose of the Biennial is to explore ideas and questions, and that the audience members are the future curators, so ‘we might have a potential in curating.’ The audience member concludes by asking how the conceptual frameworks</text>

This is an important one to foster mutual respect amongst artists and curators, and it is a conversation that needs to happen. It is the audience that is invited to curate a biennial, and the artist has a responsibility to ensure that their work is relevant and engages with the audience’s expectations. It is the audience that makes the art, and it is the audience that delivers the art to be exhibited.There is a tension, which I think is important in building bridges, that is built into the biennial – the tension between biennials and the particular forms of institutionalised art that they represent. If the biennial were to adopt the institutionalised forms of art that are part of the museum, then the biennial would cease to be, and the curators who commission the art would become museum curators.

The audience is the audience of the art that was not exhibited, and the audience is the audience to whom the art is addressed. ‘How do we create experiences that are different from what we have today?’. ‘What can a biennial do today?’.  One of the themes of the biennial is the adoption of practices that are more fluid and unpredictable, and the development of a biennial that adopts these practices would mark a shift from the curatorial to the artist’s curatorial perspective. Biennials can adopt a variety of curatorial approaches, and the patronage they receive is largely determined by the variables that lie outside the building they occupy. For example, the roles and idiosyncrasies of the discoverer and the tourist are affected by the availability and movements of resources (including, of course, the money at stake). In the case of a biennial that adopts the money and resources of a major museum, the role of the artist is limited to the art that is being exhibited, and the resources supporting the art. Art is not necessarily more accessible or is necessarily more variable in terms of its value. The role of the</text>

There is a contradiction in the way that the museum or art gallery presents its collections, but also in the way in which the biennial presents its collections. The museum presents its collections in a chronological order, in order of appearance, but the biennial does not. The chronological order of its collections is an order of appearances, and the biennial’s chronological order – its collections of small works – is a kind of a monologue. It is the appearance of a collection at a museum, but it is also the appearance of a collection in a museum. The collection has a chronological presence, but it is also a collection in a museum. There is a tension here, and the audience is affected by this sense of presence. If the collection is there, and the biennial</text>

The idea that biennials could be taken as collections of behaviours, tendencies and perhaps even instigators of art’s social consequences has been explored. Here, then, we return to the lineage of biennials at the MCM, and to reflect on the curatorial role in the development of the current art exhibitionary form. We begin by considering a body of recent art that is neither contemporary art nor, for that matter, art in the making. We then move to looking at the cultural origins of the biennial, and of the curatorial role in its development (other curatorial drivers, cultural beacons, and museums, to name only a few). Finally, we look to the future of the biennial as a possible future. Biennials have become prominent in the last decade, with exhibitions in major cities around the world. At the Venice Biennale, for example, the number of biennials overtook the number of museums.[1] Should biennials be</text>

The third was a series of six videos, each of which addressed a different aspect of the biomedical sciences. Embryology is the biological term for the study of human embryonic and placental function; piazza is the anatomical term for a museum collection or collection of collections. Embryology today is a multidisciplinary field of inquiry, addressing issues of embryonic development, behaviour, and organisation on a global basis. Embryology/Placental Biology/Aesthetics is the interdisciplinary field of art, architecture, and science that deals with the fate of human embryos and the potential for their development into any number of body parts. Embryology today is particularly concerned with the conditions of embryo and fetal development, and its postnatal and intersexual developmental stages. It is concerned with the collection and management of these developing embryos and their bodies (neoplasms, fibroblasts, connective tissue, and muscle tissue) in order to research and understand the origins of human behaviour and organisation.</text>

Embryologies in Contemporary Art   Embryologies are living, evolving parts of the human genome that tell the story of evolution – the design that we have evolved from, how we came to be here, and what comes next. They are the ultimate symbols of how art, and specifically, modern art, is produced. Embryology: a Design Subroutine (2017) presents a selection of the best recent and recent work in the field from around the world. It is the culmination of a three-year residency, fellowship and a postdoctoral fellowship program at the M.I.T.

They came together to make a single, much larger, much more widely seen work, all on a single day. This combination of curatorial explicitness and online public access made it possible to see all three separate shows simultaneously, once a week, for nine months straight. This combination of curatorial and public access was not accidental or unique, but was part of a nationwide (and international) circulation that began in earnest with the introduction of the biennial in Venice in 2015.

There is a tension, and I think the Museum Service feels that tension. On the one hand, the Museum Service works very hard to institutionalise the beliefs of its members, to produce a particular image of itself through museum exhibits, to articulate the ‘historic meaning of the city’ in docent-driven educational programmes, to ‘reanimate’ buildings and ‘reclaim’ space through ‘radical urban practices’. But on the other, the Museum Service is susceptible to the whims of powerful economic forces, and has to be patient, and I think of the art museum as a case in point. The Museum Service entered the twentieth century having produced works that, while powerful in their own right, were powerless in challenging the power of powerful economic forces. The power of the artist was realized through the medium of the museum, whereas the power of the museum was realized through the object. And so, although the Museum Service entered the system with its curatorial focus</text>

So the museum as a form of cultural experimentation and surface gives way to an evolving and emerging architecture of cultural production. And one of the first projects I did with my colleague, Daniel Coleman, was called Prefabricated Communities: Housing and Culture in a Technological Society. We imagined a future where housing and culture are intimately intertwined, but also where creative and forward-looking research and development happens where once only industrial buildings are left. This research and development happens in three stages: design, research and implementation. In the first phase, we created a registry of opinions on a city-wide scale, based on criteria such as wealth, location, cultural attractions and much more. Then we engaged in a public conversation about the importance of the registry, engaging residents from every stratum of the city. We gathered data on where the art was located, the number of views of each work and what kind of experiences residents had visiting the galleries. Finally, we turned to the public to suggest additional areas for</text>

It is a place of deep storage, accessible only by a privileged few, and it is a place where other kinds of fiction can also be imagined. But it is also a place where things that are not ‘real’ can still be imagined, and ‘real’ can mean many different things to different people. The museum precisely locates and captures this dynamic, its ambiguous coordinates. It is a particular architectural feat of cultural capital to be able to conceive of the past through these terms, but it is also a particular conceptual trick to be able to imagine the future through these terms. In that sense, the museum is neither here nor there, but both here and there. It is both a temporal and an ontological singularity. But what happens in the museum, and what it represents, ultimately remains trapped in time. That is, until someone gets killed or moves away.So the museum is both a temporal and an ontological singularity, but it also exhibits, or</text>

How to Think of the Museum as a Prairie Animal 	Looking back at the evolution of my thinking on the museum, the way in which it became a point of convergence between cultural theorists and urbanists is through the model that I developed for the International Phylactery of Art (IPA). The IPA is a registry of ideas, a map of places – with roots in the Middle Ages – and a set of conventions or ‘laws’ that define the place. The way in which the ideas are listed determines what form that place takes. 	What the IPA represents are two forms of what I call ‘regenerationalist thinking’. The first form is exemplified by the law of the jungle: ‘No man, beast, bird, or plant shall live on the property of the United States, … ', which dates back to 1787.1 	The second form, exemplified by the law of</text>

The museum is a particular problem for the system because it is a ‘regenerational fiction’ – it was designed for a specific era and purpose – but it can also be an incredible portal to another era or another world. The museum becomes what it purports to be: a repository for a particular set of beliefs, a particular set of practices, a particular set of beliefs about the past, but it is also a place of expression and a home for ‘regenerational dreaming�. It is an apparatus that can produce great changes through its simple materials and architecture, but it is also a fiction that is constantly evolving and subject to change through the power of its own laws. Therefore, it is not just an urban myth, but a form of political, social and cultural agency. Furthermore, it is possible to read the museum as a form of art that has been curated by a cultural theorist, and that thus seeks to simultaneously interrogate and transcend the museum as a form of art, producing new forms of art through the transformation of structures and practices. For example, the New York Museum of Art has done interesting things with its collection of fossils and its collection of sculpture and archive, but it has largely stayed out of the way of what has been described as ‘postmodernism’. It has curated events such as the New York Public Library’s New Mural Masters Program, and it has curated exhibitions of a kind, but it does not necessarily represent</text>

These two features that I look for in a historical museum are contradictory and in contradiction, and in the system, they form a double bind. I would argue that the museum is an artifact of the past that is constantly searching for its own form, but it also believe that ‘the museum should embrace the contradictory, and often contradictory, aspects of a given period’. In other words, the museum should strive to tell a story that is both as compelling as possible, but also allow for the possibility that the past could still be reborn in the future through what I call ‘regenerational pedagogy’. I think that is an important distinction to make, and I will explain it further in a moment.The second element in my three acts of writing is the figure of the urban explorer. The urban explorer is one of the few remaining elements of twentieth-century western tourism that remains relevant in our contemporary world – and in a way that the automobile does not seem to be</text>

If the museum is a particular barrier to the practice of making real, then the biennial is the insurmountable obstacle to any such practice. The biennial needs to find a way of linking the actuality of the art to the practice of accumulation, unless it is aimed specifically at making art itself. In that case, the art and the artists who work in the art world would be content to sit by and become content. But since the museum is a more pervasive presence, and since the biennial is the true object of artistic and curatorial control, the biennial artist would also need to find a way of linking the art and the artworld. This is the dynamic in crisis: the metainterface of the biennial, the actual art world, the profitable art market, and the active participation of the art world in the business of living art – in other words, the biennial as an economic enterprise. And here the dynamic is interesting. The biennial as an art</text>

The museum becomes what it calls a site of expression. It offers a space, a forum, a forum, where different belief systems can be expressed simultaneously. In this way, it is both a site of repetition and a site of imagination. Perhaps the most beautiful feature of the museum is its capacity to generate new ideas and practices on the site of the exhibition, but it is also a site of actualities and traces of history. It is a record of things that have happened in and around the museum, both here and in another city across the river in Burlington, Canada. It is a place of encounters and traces of repetition, but it is also a place of dreams and fantasies. It is a myth of human achievement, but it is also a myth of a mythical human future. The museum, in this conception, is not just a collection of objects and collections, but something more. It is a site of act of discovery, and perhaps even of mythic descent. It is a place</text>

And so the museum becomes both the site and the object of various ideas, beliefs or realities. It is a site of negation and a site of negation. It is a site of presence and it is a ‘living sculpture’ that reflects and is affected by the world around it. I call this ‘regenerational tourism’. And so, the idea was that the museum should be a site of negation, a place where different interpretations of the same idea are put forth simultaneously, in a constantly shifting dynamic. And so, the museum became a site of expression and a site of living sculpture. It is a site of negation because it is constantly subject to change, fluctuating in relation to the thoughts and ideas emanating from the city. It is a site of positivity because it is</text>

The fact that it was started by a non-profit arts organization also sends a message that the arts are valued above everything else. The fact that it was started by a non-profit arts organization also allows for the reuse of parts and surplus arts materials, which in turn saves on energy costs. The fact that it was started by a community organization also allows for the arts to be brought into the mix and incorporated into the daily lives of the residents. After the initial CBBC model was developed, a different model was developed in which the non-profit arts organization took over and created the SpaceAA community land trust, which in turn created its own cooperative arts organization. Cooperative housing co-ops all over the world, including in New York City, have followed this model, and similar to the CBBC, have grown into very successful non-profit entities. CBBC staff members meet with the residents and volunteers once a week to provide support to the cooperative. Cooperative housing has become so ubiquitous in the city that it’s not just referred to as ‘housing’, but is also ‘a core unit</text>

The fact that it was started by a non-profit arts organization also sends a message that the arts are valued above everything else. In this day and age of biennials and museums of every sort springing up across the UK and abroad, it’s nice to think that the CBBC could have started by asking artists to take over a building and changing the dynamic of the building as a way to start a conversation with the city. The fact that it was also hand-selected by the Arts Council and Tate Britain, rather than some random art gallery, sends a much more powerful message to the city that’s being built on its shoulders. The fact that it was co-opted by the city government sends a much stronger signal to art galleries that they’re part of a strategic planning process that’s being executed just to add another building to the skybridge. In both of these examples, the cultural institutions that were drawn on and supported by the city in the building process were in many ways more influential than the art galleries that came later.The fact that the CBBC was created in</text>

The fact that it was a place where people could come in and be creative and engage with the building and its processes is a sign that this is something that is deeply embedded in the building and that the CBBC will continue to produce innovative and powerful ways to engage with the city. The fact that it was completely offline for four years after the art community took over it is a sign that the art community took over it forcefully, and are still actively engaged with it to this day. The fact that it was entirely offline for six months in 2011 and has been for some time after that is a sign that the arts community is still engaged and active.

The fact that it was started by a non-profit arts organization also sends a message that the arts are valued above everything else. The fact that it was started by a non-profit arts organization might make it harder to negotiate access to sites and artefacts, since the arts are now regarded as a core value in the city, but it’s worth mentioning that the non-profit was largely self-funded, and the arts were largely subsidized by government. The fact that it was also started by an arts organization also means that the arts organization has a financial stake in the success of the project, and that the arts organization can negotiate the best terms with the city to put in place what’s considered a ‘cultural district’ in the city.  	When the CBBC was first being considered, the majority of the funding came from the New Democratic Party (NDP), which of course was vehemently opposed to the idea of a co-operative grocery co-operative opening in the city.

In a way, the CBBC’s creation as a for-profit enterprise is a perfect reflection of the city’s economic malaise: the quality of life in the city is deteriorating at such a rate that it’s almost as if the buildings are on autopilot, unable or unwilling to deal with the crisis.But the real strength of the CBBC is its capacity to grow and its ability to absorb new ideas and people, while still retaining its essential mission of supporting the arts. As the city rotates on its side, so too does the CBBC, with people coming from everywhere in search of a sense of belonging, a purpose, in a city that’s increasingly indistinguishable from nothing more than a disused art museum. And while the CBBC may lose a few artists every now and then (most recently, Gabrielle Royceuil and Monica Rossetto), its ability to constantly reinvent itself (re-</text>

The fact that it was a pilot program for a new policy on commercial space, and that it was so successful, even though its primary purpose was to house performance art, also sends a message to the city that the arts are hugely interstingant with the functioning of this particular form of capitalism. The CBBC sits at the intersection of culture and community; it allows for the co-constitution of art and community, while simultaneously suggesting that the arts are not simply another commodity for consumption but that they are actively a component of any economic development. Since their inception, the CBBC has functioned as a kind of civic space for those who use it. It has hosted a number of community events, including one-day performances by artists or groups selected through an educational selection process, group workshops led by artists, and a permanent collection of works on display for review and discussion. It has hosted regular public programs that bring together artists, artists education professionals, local community members, and the city</text>

These aren’t just economic signals, they’re also about who is contributing to a project like this one. If the arts are over-represented within the project, then that project is likely to be more ethnically diverse, since the participation rate among artists is much higher when it comes to projects like the CBBC.  The fact that it was also started by non-profit arts organizations also sends a message to the arts community that it’s OKAY to leverage the building as a way to make a profit. The fact that it was also co-opted by the city (and therefore, by the arts community) also sends a message to the city that the arts are a core value, and that they’re going to be supported even in the most adversarial of ways, whether that’s through a free parking spot or a guaranteed income.  This kind of naturally-occurring counter-geography is vitally important to understanding</text>

The fact that the CBBC is now a for-profit enterprise sends a message to the arts community that it’s OKAY to leverage the building as a way to make a profit. The fact that it now distributes its profits back to the arts organization that created it sends a different message: that the CBBC should be a non-profit corporation rather than a for-profit one, and that the arts organization should exert more control over how its resources are used. In this way, the CBBC can more easily access income from the arts, while still maintaining a strong independent ownership stake in the building. Both of these changes are positive, but I think the most significant one is the one that allows the CBBC to more easily access income from the arts, while still having a strong independent ownership stake in the building.    At the same time, the CBBC has to work hard to maintain the integrity of its arts organization.

In my opinion, the fact that it was started by a non-profit arts organization sends a message to the city that the arts are a core value and that the CBBC will treat all stakeholders, no matter what their size, position or affiliations, with fairness and dignity. All stakeholders are going to be treated with fairness and dignity, no matter what their position or affiliation. This also goes for art institutions or artists; the fact that artists are the ones initiating the conversation and the institutions are responding to it is going to be a struggle for the latter to maintain their original value, whether they are established or new artists. In either case, the conversation that’s starting is going to be between the artist and the institution. If the conversation is going to be institution-driven, then the institution is now going to have to actively participate in it in order to achieve some sort of impact.  	So far,</text>

The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its own set of social functions today, and its own set of cultural functions tomorrow. But the biennial as exhibitionary form would have to undergo a radical rethink in order to engage those social and cultural ends. If we take the form of a biennial, the curatorial and exhibitionary decision-making today would need to be radically different from the decision-making of the discursive purse and the purse of the nineteenth century. The twentieth century was a golden age for the discursive purse, and a century in which biennials became significant in part because of their high cultural values. The twenty-first century is a dangerous one for the discursive purse, because the discursive purse is the basis of the capitalist potentialities that are being realised today. The twenty-first century is a critical one for the discursive purse, because the social and cultural ends of the biennial are now coming into conflict with one another.

The biennial as exhibitionary form would have to undergo a radical rethink in order to engage critical and popular audiences again. The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its own set of functions in a city, but is increasingly failing in these regards. It is time to aspire to a form of publics and publics of a city that is not confined by the biennial as its form today.Exhibitions are the most obvious and commodifiable form of this exhibitionary potential. They are an essential part of the exhibitionary narrative. However, biennials can only ever represent a fraction of the city as a whole. A public of a city is a public of a place, and a public that is open to travel and discovery and cultural exchange and exchange and other practices that are not necessarily displayed on the page. The museum, which is the first step in this historical sequence of permanent exhibitions, is a different kind of place. It is a place of encounters, of places that people actually happen to be in, experiences that people actually happen to know. It is a place of places that people actually happen to want to visit and culture that people actually want to</text>

The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its current function in the age of social and global exhibitions. It is the form of the global icon, present and former, that is being reinvented. The biennial as exhibitionary form is being replaced by something more present and contemporary, and this is a process that will continue to be driven by the needs of capital as it shapes ever larger biennials around itself. The biennial as a curatorial tool is no longer needed in order to tell a story or to create a sense of place, nor is it sufficient today to tell a story or create a sense of place. Many curators today use artistic licence and tricks to hook their exhibitions – and to a lesser extent, some artsfonds – on the current trends or moods, even if these are subaltern or negative. The biennial is no longer the dominant form of the exhibitionary world, but it is being replaced by something more contemporary and contemporary, and this is happening at a rapid clip.

The biennial as exhibitionary form would have to undergo a radical rethink in order to engage critical and popular audiences again. The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its own capital, and its own interests. It is a form that can be cobbled together from many different elements, and hence is able to absorb and absorb newness, innovation and different kinds of culture without losing its character. Common to all these different forms is the tendency to take for granted what is commonly referred to as ‘the present’. This common, totemic quality of the biennial is itself a capital trap. It is able to claim to be interested in and addressing the current state of the art in a particular city because of its core values (such as the beauty standardised by the city, or the importance of green space and rural architecture), because it is able to establish a shared set of relations to these values through art and cultural tourism, and because it is able to present these shared values as a set of principles. But what makes the biennial different from other exhibitionary forms is that it is able to produce its own forms of space and time; it does not</text>

The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its own capitalistic interest today, and it is in part a result of the terminal capitalism of which it is a symptom. The biennial as an exhibitionary form would have to undergo a radical rethink if it were to reclaim the public and create a public capable of opposing the terminal nature of the biennial and its potential for mass extinction.This would mean engaging the biennial in a fully political, popular and popular way – one that does not sideline its primary mission, but rather one that seeks to render its current and former visitors as responsive to the politics of their daily experiences, so as to create a public capable of confronting and opposing terminal capitalism. Such engagement cannot happen through museums or major curatorial displays, because it would render such displays redundant and empty, and it is only possible to engage with such displays through biennials. It would have to challenge, in a sustained and public way, the prevailing modes of its exhibitionary function today, and it is this latter aspect of its mission that bi</text>

The biennial as exhibitionary form would have to undergo a radical rethink in order to engage critical and popular audiences again. The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its transient publics – that is, its transient clients – and the urbanized transient populations that fill the biennial market. The exhibitionary form would have to undergo a radical rethink in order to reorient and engage these populations in a way that is not confined to the metropolis and its attendant industries. This would mean engaging the public through what is often considered the architectural archipelago – a public that is not only drawn to the biennial but also to architecture and museums in general – but also through what is sometimes considered the architectural museum. The reason why the biennial is transient is that it is constantly subject to the vagaries of market forces and historical circumstances, and so it is always on the lookout for ways to raise its profile and to entice a higher clientele to attend. In this dynamic, the biennial has to constantly reinvent itself and so it is with the biennial as a cultural enterprise. It needs to be interesting to a clientele that is increasingly attracted to urbanity and</text>

The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its own proliferation today, and its own set of social and cultural functions. It is, therefore, not a biennial in the strict sense of the word, but a form of cultural exchange with transient populations that constantly seek out different forms of participation and experience. The exhibitionary form is an artifact of capitalist circulation and accumulation, and its contemporary manifestation is a mass market for a transient, urbanising species. The biennial as a cultural-economic-political-economic phenomenon is the product of a capitalist cultural logic that seeks to produce a constantly expanding number of high-value items at low costs. The biennial has become the definitive form for a transient, urbanising species to which the market can be expected to adapt. It is, therefore, not an artifact of the past, but a constitutive feature of the contemporary condition. The biennial as exhibitionary form is an artifact of the capitalist cultural logic that seeks to produce ever more of these high-value items at low costs. This cultural logic produces</text>

The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its own future. Therefore, the biennial as an institution must struggle to survive in a more social and public way than it does now, in order to have any chance of remaining contemporary. Licensing the biennial to cultural institutions is not enough for the biennial to exist in the present, but it is essential for the future. It is not enough for the biennial to exist in the present and be authentic to the people who attend it, but it is essential that it be accessible to these audiences in order to be able to sustain the potential that it has. The biennial as an artistic production form is not enough for the artist to produce cultural value in the present, but it is essential for the future of the art form. The biennial must strive to become more than a museum of art and culture, and must actively engage with questions and concepts of social life and urbanisation in order to become a capable and valuable art form.In a recent curatorial project, I worked with artist and</text>

The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its own set of functions today, and it is not clear that the art world or contemporary art museums would welcome such a rethink. The exhibitionary form is a requirement of the biennial today, and the only way to change that is for both to change themselves. The art world would do well to consider what it might look like if it ceased to be an exhibitionary form, and instead embarked on an ambitious curatorial and art historical mission. That would require changing the definition of the biennial itself, and perhaps other curatorial and art historical forms, in order to accommodate such a mission.

The exhibitionary form that the biennial was originally conceived as serves its own purposes today, and its own set of social  functions today, and not all audiences can be accommodated within the biennial. This is true of museums, which are currently the main exhibitionary form today, and institutions such as the biennial itself, which have been forced to make hard choices in the interest of public resources and on the basis of political and social considerations. It is also true in the age of social media, where artefacts now dominate what is exhibited, and where biennials can be counted on to deliver ever greater amounts of information and data to their audiences, who then construct and interpret that information and data to suit their interests and lifestyles. Think of the ancient art museums that are closing in on the biennial and the accompanying biennale, which are being fuelled by the information infrastructures that are being developed and directed by the city in the age of unlimited data.

Biennials are places where the artists who came before are remembered; they get covered in books, and become part of a canon, but they don’t seem to be places where the next generation of artists are developing their creative strategies or panning out projects.  	There are always stories of how the biennial changed its form or its content; of course, there are always counter-stories. But the way I see it, there is a real disconnect between the biennial and the art world anymore; the biennial is the very embodiment of the art world.  	And I think that is a very dangerous precedent that we are setting, because the biennial is the very embodiment of the art world in its current form.  	I come from a creative-writing background, so I naturally see the world through the prism of literary forms.

I suppose the question is what can the biennial do other than offer exhibitions and give shows?  	The answer is quite simple: it can do anything that the art world can do.  	In fact, I suppose the main thing the biennial can do is offer a convenient compromise to the art world: it can offer a set of skillsets (tricks or seduction), a set of curating approaches (curatorial omniscience or pure fancy), and most importantly, a set of curating approaches that are designed to be used by other art institutions.  	I see the biennial as a weird kind of an institution; it has no formal institutional power or mission and has no moneymaker or commercial aim. It is a transient kind of entity that happens to be in the presence of art for a limited period of time. The thing is, though, that the biennial is</text>

It’s one thing to put out a biennial that represents the art of the past, quite another to actually come up with something new and interesting and useful and to embed it in the cultural landscape.  	In the current climate of biennials, the biennial as a concept is at a standstill; the art world doesn’t seem to have the requisite infrastructure in place to support the artist-driven, participatory, and socially-engaged biennial form that is becoming increasingly popular in other places, and which is now more or less standard in the UK. Biennials may still have a place in the art world; their ubiquity and globalisation now make them visible across disciplines and cultures, and their low prices and easy access to resources mean that they are a main event, and their access to capital markets ensures that they can continue to function as such. But in the current cultural conjuncture, the biennial as an entity is experiencing something of a miracle, largely thanks to the largesse of the art market, which is now awash with the artist-driven, socially-engaged, locally-sustained biennial, and which is now showing signs of waking up to the fact that it no longer needs to be a center of the universe.  	What used to</text>

It’s one thing to put out a biennial that represents the art of the past, quite another to actually come up with something new and interesting and useful and to embed it in the cultural landscape.  	In the current climate of biennials, the biennial as a concept is at a standstill; the art world is awash in images of biennials throughout the world, and it’s hard to imagine a world without them. 	The question of what a biennial is, and what a curatorial job it is, is as relevant as ever. The new biennial that emerges out of the art world will likely have a significantly different approach to the curatorial job, given the pace of change and the fluidity of subjectivity. Curators will need to find new ways of engaging audiences, and that may involve engaging with notions of presence, identity and place. Some curators may well decide that the art world doesn’t need to know about their local conditions, so as not to detract from the authoritative aspects of the art world. 	Finally, and most controversially, what kind of relationship would a biennial have with a curatorial job? I hear the criticism that a biennial would be like a city coming together to declare war on itself. That is,</text>

It’s one thing to put out a biennial that represents the art of the past, quite another to actually come up with something new and interesting and useful and to embed it in the cultural landscape.  	In the current climate of biennials, the biennial as a concept is at a standstill; the art museums that once commissioned them are the ones being forced to close their doors; and the biennial itself is being forced to adopt a curatorial agenda that is not driven by, nor dependent on, the priorities of, the major art museums and their curatorial departments.  	With only a few curators remaining in their respective fields, the task of finding new ways to engage the art institutions that once commissioned them seems to be growing increasingly difficult; at least in my experience, those institutions have enough sense now to be able to dismiss my work as just that – a workaday curatorial gesture. 	Many curators I know would happily embark on any curatorial initiative that might be thrown their way, but for some reason (perhaps the high cost of living and the pressures of being a curator) curators tend to avoid the more politically-engaged practices of the art-historical and archival curatorial traditions, and so rarely engage with the politics of their present.

It’s one thing to put out a biennial that represents the art of the past, quite another to actually come up with something new and interesting and useful and to embed it in the cultural landscape.  	In the current climate of biennials, the biennial as a concept is at a standstill; the art world is but one particular brand of observer. There is no such thing as the ‘brand of culture’; there is only the ‘brand of culture’.  	So how does the biennial come to inhabit the cultural landscape? I think it comes down to two factors. One is the massive amount of money that is now being spent on art and culture per diem (in London, at least). A culture is worth more than a handful of paintings, or even a couple of sculptures.  	Secondly, and more significantly, there is the massive consumption of culture that is now taking place in cities all over the world. All the biennials are now visited by a cultural tour operator, and at the end of the process the world over, artists and curators are doing business as usual.  	So culture is the new oil. It’s a replacement for the old fossil fuel, and as a result the biennial is now frequently</text>

It’s as if the biennial has become static and unchanging, whereas artworlds see and act differently. There is a gap to be filled, and if the biennial is to truly come to life, it needs to find a way to exist in parallel with, and in contradiction to, the art world in some way.  	The answer to my question, then, is: what is the angle on which the art world can and will operate in opposition to the biennial? If the biennial is to really come to life, then the art world needs to change how it creates narratives around art and artists. It’s not enough for the art world to read a story or analyse a figure; it needs to actually come to terms with how the artist represents or represents a specific</text>

It’s as if artists have stopped thinking about the past, and the art world is now thinking about the future only.  	Art and the biennial have a kind of frozen in time, partial to mutual dependency through sharing, appropriation and the gathering of information. The biennial as a concept is subject to the conventions and ideologies of the art world, and its usual methods of reproduction, but its content, which is curatorial in its own right, is subject to the vagaries and interests of the moment. The biennial as a curatorial tool is constantly evolving, and in this process it acquires new conventions and ideologies. The mainstay of biennials is the one and the done in the same place.  The double dissolution of the biennial as a curatorial tool and as a curatorial event itself represents a kind</text>

There are signs that the biennial may be re-figuring its former self, with artists and curators actively exploring new ways to engage with the art form through experiences that are more grounded in the real life (and sometimes the virtual) world.  	One such approach may be innovative curatorial that seeks to create its own biennial through experiential work that incorporates art and art’s social  	roots. Such an approach is being explored by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which is creating a new branch of its museum called the New Museum that will be centred around the social aspects of art</text>

The biennial is placed at the intersection of history and contemporary art, and the art museums that once commissioned artists to work in their collections are placed at the intersection of social and political or urban development. It’s as if both the biennial and the socially engaged photography project are trapped in a loop of engagement. Nothing highlights the present or anticipates the future well, and the biennial as a project is</text>

The result was that in the years that followed the financial crisis, when the city was hit by massive population growth, funding from the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery dried up.

And they’re turning up to see what the city’s cultural economy is doing. Not every engagement with the arts has to be about making money for the Arts Council or the Heritage Lottery.  Borders, too, can be valuable through their ephemeral nature – like our own behaviour around the biennial – as a way to imagine into existence new ways of engaging with the arts and culture that aren’t constrained by the present. And within the art world, there are now also signs that the biennial will no longer be able to be relied upon to deliver on its promises.  Despite the Biennial’s financial difficulties – which have become ever more evident over the past year – the biennial remains committed to its stated mission to bring together and present contemporary art from around the world.

They’re turning up to see if the Biennial can buy itself. The irony of it all is that the Biennial started out as a biennial in the sense that there are certain kinds of artworks that can and should be made in the city, and the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery should be supporting those kinds of arts as a right. In the year 2000, the Biennial was granted authorisation from the Arts Council to make a selection of works that it felt were appropriate for the site – a sort of permission-by-numbers approach. The works selected would then be installed in three sites – a site-specific collection, a temporary sculpture park and a public square. The collection would be used to fund the park and the sculpture park, while the Heritage Lottery and the Biennial themselves would pick up the pieces and move on. The idea is that as the city changes, so does the collection, and as the city changes, so does the sculpture park and the collection. This is a very interesting way of looking at the</text>

The same people that put in billions of pounds of debt servicing mortgages, whilst society hollowed out pension schemes, schools and infrastructure also put in billions of pounds of funding for art and cultural institutions, whilst society augmented their already incredibly rich patronising of the arts with direct funding from the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery. The result was that in the years that followed the financial crisis, when the city was hit by massive population growth, funding from the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery dried up. While pockets of resistance emerged from the Arts and Heritage authorities, as the population exploded in the city, the financialised arts complex was pushed to the margins. There were pockets of really turning up to the arts, but those people now working for the Biennial in Liverpool are turning up to see if the Biennial can pay for itself. They’re turning up to see if the Biennial can buy itself. Doesn’t seem like a sustainable situation, but the resistance seems really strong. If the Biennial can’t pay for itself, it’s like a city without a budget, except that there’s a shortage of arts professionals. The resistance to austerity is really interesting, because in places where there’s austerity, there’s a tendency to uproot arts practice and culture: museums are a good example. In places where there’s no austerity, such as Liverpool, the museum becomes a very important player in the local economy, providing jobs and investment, cultural institutions are essential, but also essential for the functioning of governance, so that local communities have access to resources and also to arts institutions. But when there’s no austerity, the museum is a scarce resource, and when the biennial comes to town, that’s when things can get messy. The Museum of Liverpool is facing funding cuts, and is struggling to</text>

There were pockets of really turning up to the arts, but those people now working for the Biennial in Liverpool are turning up to see if the Biennial can pay for itself. They’re turning up to see if the Biennial can somehow buy itself. The challenge now is for the Biennial to build sustainable partnerships that will sustain it through tough times, while the city struggles to feed and clothe itself.Art’s future has never in any way looked rosy. It’s possible that the art of the future will look just like the art of the past: just as harsh, just as unpredictable. But we already know that most art of that future will be made by robots. What we don’t know is how to organise ourselves in such a way as to create art of the future. That’s a challenge we need to tackle.Download this article as PDFAna Laura Lopéz de la TorreAssociate Professor of Art History and Theory, University of Illinois at Chicago, where she directs the College of Art and Design.

There were pockets of really turning up to the arts, but those people now working for the Biennial in Liverpool are turning up to see if the Biennial can pay for itself. They’re turning up to see if the Biennial can hire its own artists and institutions and turn a profit, and if so, how. And if those institutions turn a profit, then there’s going to be lots of money to be made.  	These negotiations between the Biennial and the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery are the reason why the Biennial was able to save so many buildings during the crisis. The Biennial was able to enlist the heritage organisations to help it access funds through the lottery. And so the Biennial became something that it is today capable of sustaining, even in the unlikely event that the Arts Council decides to pull funding away from the Biennial. 	This is what happens when the arts and heritage industries work together. The outcome is often interesting. The Biennial I think is a case in point. The Biennial was set up with the idea that it would be able to self-brand itself as independent, so that when it started, it already had a following of artists and arts people from</text>

They’re turning up to see if the Biennial can buy itself.  	The question is, will the Biennial pay back its debt? I don’t think so. The question is whether or not the city can absorb the huge amount of infrastructure and building that has been put in place to support the biennial’s eventual growth. In the past ten years, the Biennial has grown at such a rate that it has become a multi-million pound business, with dedicated artists and organisations all over the city, many of them quite independent. It’s true that in the early days, the Biennial was always presented as a ‘platform’ for the artist’s discursivity, but as the Biennial has multiplied and diversified, so has its audience. It’s also true that the artists who created the artworks for the programme (including myself) were often engaged in a self-branding process whereby they began to present the city in a certain way, in order to generate</text>

And if that’s not a crisis, then I don’t know what is.

There’s  Borders, Profits and Beyond: the Consequences of an Ecological Society, by Peter Hudspeth, published by Verso, 2015, that traces the economic, social and cultural impacts of the biennial as a capitalist artefact throughout the global south.

Why are the cultural institutions turning into investment grade products? Why are the arts bureaucratic bodies like the Biennial becoming art supply companies? Why do the biennials become art collectors? Why do the cultural institutions become so politically active? Why do the cultural institutions turn into parties to the economic system and afford political parties access to wealth? Our biennials could do with learning from the local artists who came before them, and from those who followed them like hungry ghosts. Why are the artists who came before us now finding it harder to access their creativity and becoming less engaged with the world? Why are the biennials turning into art supply companies?

They’re turning up to see if the Biennial can’t, or if, god forbid, it becomes unsustainable. And they’re turning up to see whether the Biennial can’t, because that’s what’s at stake. The Biennial is a social enterprise, and its funding is a source of strength for organisations like the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery. But it has to fight, every step of the way, the forces of neoliberalism and complacency to call the bluff of the institutions that put so much faith in the promise of a socially engaged, arts-informed, culturally engaged and awash in arts media landscape. The Biennial has to fight tooth and nail, every step of the way, to make the city a place worthy of the name. That’s why, every step of the way, it’s been able to sustain the very real cultural struggles that it is meant to educate future generations about.  The reality is that the biennial has to work</text>

And they’re turning up to see if the Biennial can pay for itself through cultural institutions paying for themselves through curatorial budgets. The fact that the Biennial is getting bigger and that it's now run by a board of directors with access to huge amounts of money tells us a lot about the way in which art is reproduced in the city.

But I do admire the fact that where art is concerned, there is now much more willingness than ever before to view art as a biennial, or even a curatorial project, with risks and possibilities beyond the formal. I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be seen as controllable, whereas in the past when the biennial format was the way to produce high-quality art, the opposite was often the case. There is a fundamental shift in the way in which artists, curators and arts administrators are orienting their resources and their activities. And it is this fundamental shift that I seek to facilitate through the provision of the Biennale project. The biennale is a project with a projective element to it, such that resources and activities on a project-by-project basis lend themselves to the notion of crisis, disorder and uncertainty. It is a projective project. It is a project with a narrative. It is both acutely aware of the problems it creates and incapable of curing them. It is patient but also yet demanding. It is art, but it is art nonetheless. That is to say, it is art that is art in crisis.Art is art in many other ways, and this principle is perhaps what separated it from its</text>

But I do admire the fact that where art is concerned, there is now much more willingness than ever before to view art as a biennial, or even a curatorial project, with risks and possibilities beyond the formal. I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be seen as an object of aesthetic consideration, but also to be minimally visible, to be submerged in a sea of other more pressing, more visible forms of art. We have become used to seeing, being led by experts, great architectural works that virtually redefine the terms of what is seen as ‘public’ space. In places, this may be seen as a positive thing; in others, as something that distracts from, or is at best pretends not to be in the midst of. And it is this last attitude, this pretence, that I believe is most at stake in the current political moment. There is much that can and must be said about the current political situation, much of it being true. But the tendency is to constrain critical thought to the formal, the defined space, the agreed upon set of norms, and particularly the agreed upon set of values. And these agreed upon norms are being rapidly eroded. In places, they are being reinstated in ever growing</text>

I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be shrouded and hidden, to be barred and regulated in order to become something that it does not yet wish to be. I feel that art is being actively encouraged to adopt a number of the strategies that Marx and Engels advocated in the early stages of the process of creating socialism (including the active involvement of the artist/workers in the construction of society), and to seek to eliminate whatever remains as possible aspects of what they called the social, political and organisational tasks ahead. I do not claim that these strategies will all prove viable, nor that these actions are without risk and that art should always take such actions. But I do feel that it is increasingly necessary to readjust standards of what art can be, and to readjust expectations of what art can be good at doing. And I think that is precisely what biennials are doing right now – by readingjusting standards and intervening in the marketplace of culture and ideas, intervening in art's role in constructing social relations, and promoting or destroying those</text>

But I do admire the fact that where art is concerned, there is now much more willingness than ever before to view art as a biennial, or even a curatorial project, with risks and possibilities beyond the formal. I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be treated as a collection of facts, rather than as a living, breathing entity with agency and future or past futures. I do feel that there is a shift in the institutional or curatorial support of cultural practices, and a shift in the kind of understanding of what is expected.I think that, as the biennial has become more established, and the biennial as an institution as a whole becomes more institutionalised, and the parameters of what counts as a biennial or curatorial project have become increasingly defined, we are entering a stage now where it is much more difficult to imagine any other outcome, including for example, a local, regional, international, or even a cultural village. We are entering a stage now where it is much less possible to imagine a world in which cultural practices are not actively encouraged and which arts are not heavily influenced by the financial or political machinations of power.From what I can gather, the shift in institutional support for art and its production is a by-product of</text>

I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be absorbed and absorbed into the cultural life as it is happening – under the pretence that this is all part of a larger dynamic, that this is all part of a globalised world. But this too is risky and it often seems as if the artists and curators who are being encouraged to engage with this new system, which is being designed and developed in the name of 'culture', are actually being actively engaged in concealing something from the public.Art, as we know, is a public good. And now we see a public being encouraged to engage in mechanisms of cultural production, of cultural circulation, that are being designed and constructed in the name of ‘culture’. But this is just the culture industry concealing something from the public. We need to dig even deeper into what is being sold to us as ‘culture’, and to see how this is being produced and distributed across the planet. We need to know about the cultural colonialism and racialised capitalism at work in</text>

But I do admire the fact that where art is concerned, there is now much more willingness than ever before to view art as a biennial, or even a curatorial project, with risks and possibilities beyond the formal. I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be hidden, to be anaesthetised, to be co-opted, to be rendered invisible, to be corrupted, to be rendered insane in the service of political ends. And I do admire the fact that, for the most part, these political, even radical, ends are being promoted, or are being tacitly endorsed, by institutions, rich and poor, globalised and neoliberalised, with or without our participation. But even today, in our current economic and social predicament, we are nonetheless deeply embedded within the biennial form, and continue to be encouraged to look to it for our sustenance, to call its attention to ourselves when we see an opportunity, to see ourselves represented on a plate, to be part of a cultural elite that is otherwise content to let others be cogs in a machine.These are, in a nutshell, the five elements of the contemporary biennial: the art market, art supply, the biennial itself, the curatorial role, and the visitor.</text>

I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be met with resistance and even hostility, not to mention the occasional appropriation (but a lot of it is by artists and curators who see this new biennial format as a compliment). I feel more and more like a second-class citizen, like most of my generation.Art is a powerful sedative, numbing us to our real lives, making us willing to overlook small things, making us forget the big picture. But it is also a huge barometer of a person, measuring character traits and attitudes, and allowing us to change our minds about very fundamental things. A good piece of art is a great barometer of a person, but it is also a great barometer of a culture – and a culture is a collective memory preserved for a very specific reason: to be shared, circulated, and passed on. When you are in a room with a museum, a cathedral, or a theatre, and you are given the task of contemplating a painting, you have to be able to identify</text>

I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be seen and considered only within the given parameters of the biennial itself. And I do feel that, in this context, art is being encouraged to operate outside of the narrative of the biennial itself. But this only makes sense if you take into account the fact that, for many artists, this is the only real sense of engagement, and art is expected to be ceded narrative space and narrative responsibility. I do not claim to have all the story, but I do believe that, at the same time, I possess a sufficient amount of insight and knowledge to allow artists and others to make sense of it all.  And, today, there is much more narrative and contextualisation happening outside of the art world, as well. I do not know what the future holds, but I can say that, right now, we need to be extremely vigilant in looking out for it, because it could very well mean something radically different tomorrow. Art and artists are artists and they make mistakes, and I do</text>

I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be absorbed and dispersed, to be ignored and to be replaced by something else. I feel that a certain amount of biennials are becoming what Clement Greenberg would call ‘monuments to neglect and suspicion, to violence and repression’. But I also feel that there are wonderful, powerful, unique things happening outside of this particular envelope.And I’m not just saying that. I’m saying that art and art institutions are critically complicit in the climate in which we live, and that they are hugely indebted to the neoliberalisation of culture as a whole. I mean that they created the crisis of identity politics, which has metastasised throughout the world, and which many of us are now keen to forget. And I’m not just saying that. I’m saying that the cultural dynamics of the global south are much more complex than people often give credit for, and that cultural imperialism, whether it occurs in the context of the arts or elsewhere, is a much</text>

I feel that under the current biennial format, art is being actively encouraged to be circumscribed and compartmentalised, to be represented, to be cordoned off into discrete 'parts' and 'arrangements'. This is being done in large measure thanks to the biennial itself – which is being re-shaped and modified in a hurry, with projects in every possible dimension now considered possible, including those that are in direct opposition to what the biennial as we know it is currently about to become. I do not mean to suggest that art today is immune to this kind of political/cultural/economic/material/social/ideological/ideological girdling. But I do think that now more than ever, we need to find ways to collectively and artistically and politically articulate the complexity, the storms, the changes that are happening all around us, in order to look out into the world and to be aware of the fragility of life in general.This is a very particular kind of vulnerability, which I picked up on in On Community and the Biennial.

In the past, visitors were dazzled by the campus, which included a virtual castle complete with massive statues of Roman and Medieval emperors, as well as a museum of Academy history. In the new media age, this fantasy is replaced with a more urban environment. At the same time, the Academy is increasingly concerned with a post-defence posture, and has been experimenting with ways to accelerate the pace of innovation and construction while maintaining a presence in the city. In an attempt to strike a balance, the Academy has created a new mini-institution, the Academy of Arts and Culture, founded in 2013, which includes a museum, production facility, events and a host of other services. In a city, the Academy of Arts and Culture is a large, open and self-supporting enterprise. It is a catalyst for creative activity, a steward of cultural resources, and a platform for the early stages of research and development, as well</text>

This tour involves the Alumni Dinner itself, as a vehicle to explore the past, present, and future of the dinner. In the present, the Alumni Dinner is a vehicle to explore the contradictions, the strategic misuse of a great meal, and the subsequent need to make amends.

In the past, visitors were dazzled by the campus, which was filled with historical artefacts and replicas of weapons, vehicles, uniforms and other materials. In the intervening years, the Academy has attempted to rehabilitate the academics space by renovating the Audience Participation Unit and the School of Advanced Study, as well as opening a new wing of the building, called the Student Accommodation and Learning Centre.  In 2015, the Academy reopened the Academics building, which at the time was undergoing a $200,000 renovation. This was despite the fact that the Academics was closed indefinitely in 2016 due to a lack of funding due to a lack of enrolment. During this same period, the School of Advanced Study was undergoing renovations, which it also neglected to mention was largely due to a lack of students. The lack of resources and the over-emphasis on academics in the media makes it easy to dismiss the fact that the School of Advanced Study was</text>

In 2014, the Academy was re-opened to the public after a five year renovation and reconfiguration. The new architecture is a complete re-imagining of the old days, a mix of academic and military quarters, a hybrid military/academic complex, a design studio and a production house. The new mix of uses involves academic work and present-day military work, while the university has set up a new programme of research into the military-industrial complex.  A growing number of arts organisations are coming to terms with the fact that their work in the arts context is no longer expendable, and are intervening with the production of culturally responsive art on the part of artists’ employer.  </text>

In the past, visitors were dazzled by the campus, with digital cameras capturing the natural history of the campus and the surrounding countryside, as well as the motion of moving buildings and vehicles. However, the academy has recently realised that it does not have the infrastructure to manage the large number of visitors expected each day, and so has invited the public to create their own experience of the campus, by creating what the academy calls a ‘tourist village’.  The creation of such ‘villages’ is a clear bid to reconnect the visitor with the artefact, by turning it into something that is recognisable, while simultaneously challenging and imaginative.  The creation of such villages has urban theorists and urbanists in all of us salivating, since it resembles the city in all of its complexity, with vested interests and diffuse users shaping the terms and values of the urban space. However, the logic of this initiative is flawed on numerous levels, including the service provider's, whose main interest is</text>

In my opinion, the new media technologies that embraced the web in the early 1990s, such as YouTube and Spotify, turned the city into a public domain, and the emergence of new media has exacerbated this sense of de-enclosure.

In the past, visitors were dazzled by the campus, on account of its secret chambers and vaulted ceilings, and by the supposedly magical powers that these impenetrable spaces supposedly evoked. In recent years, however, the Academy has been forced to reduce the campus to rubble due to an increasingly influential local government agenda, which sees the city’s remaining residential neighbourhoods as inherently linked to the security of the UK’s national security. In the words of Winston Churchill, the only person to have voted against the draft was himself.  As a result of this perceived undervaluation of the city, the UK Military Academy has had to lay off several thousand students and has had to close several facilities to make way for large government projects.

Nevertheless, the Academy has a significant collection of historic buildings, including the Chrysler Building, one of the first buildings built in the US to house Nazi military hardware. A collection of war memorabilia, including uniforms, paraphernalia and tools, is also stored in the building. The ADN is inviting visitors to explore the site of the attack on the Academy, and to nominate a site for the future site of the US Military Academy, based on two criteria – historical and geographical.  The historical criteria  is derived from the fact that the Academy is the oldest continuously operating school in the US, and the second oldest continuously operating centre of K–16 education in the world. The geographical criterion is based on the fact that the Academy is located in the city where the US Military Academy is</text>

In the early twentieth century, the biennial became the largest single exhibitionary format in North America, accounting for over half of the total.2 As a result, it became the occasion of frequent and scathing criticising, with artists, curators and art writers branding the format as inherently anti-intellectual, and the curatorial profession as inherently anti-popular.3 ‘Art for Art's Sake’4 Frank Lloyd Wright famously articulated these sentiments in his famous monograph on the “AQUARIUM: THE CURATOR”,1 which he produced in response to the biennial exhibition, but which was published after the biennial had begun. In that book, Wright claimed that the biennial format was the antithesis</text>

Dr. Majumder is quoted as saying: ‘When the Indian Health Service started, we started treating patients with simple diseases. Then we started treating things with complicated diagnoses.’4 		In a larger context, this observation may help us to understand the devolution of functions between the medical and social spheres.

In other words, they attempted to articulate the idea in terms of a historical trend, rather than the actuality of controlling historical material. 		But the collection that has emerged as a defining feature of the twentieth century, and is now the dominant form of art museum, is built on the back of the historical curatorial curatorial curiosities. Its form and function have changed, but its core assumption remains that of collecting. And so it is the job of contemporary art historians and artists to</text>

In the 1980s, this was manifest in the staging of the Venice Biennale, when artists and art writers protested that the need to ‘diagnose’ the event meant staging it in a museum, and in the present by the inclusion of a 2000 year old collection of Roman mosaics in the National Gallery, London, which many artists felt was a burden on the institution.

Yet, this is not true of all curiosities, nor even of contemporary curiosities. Today, biennials are individual curiosities with their own distinctive characteristics, which happen to be conspicuous. Modern biennials have come to dominate the ‘ordinary’ form, in which biennials are often mentioned alongside other curiosities, such as museums, archives and zoos. But they do not yet possess the institutional power or financial independence to rule the world as they wish, and their influence is still limited by the control exercised over them</text>

But understanding that fact will only exacerbate the already considerable social inequalities that continue to exist in that city.

The series features interviews with over-60 artists, scientists and heritage-conscious individuals from around the world who discuss the recent past in an attempt to produce a shared vocabulary of meanings about the future. The episodes are an effort to capture the idiosyncratic idiosyncrasy of each place, its people, and its place in the larger social world. The aim of the project is to interrogate the ways in which a biennial can (and, I guess, cannot) connect with its place, its place in the world. In doing so, it has produced eleven episode collections, each of them dedicated to a specific place, a specific time in time.

The collection Arrival: Contemporary Art in the Twenty-First Century (2014) is a chronicle of art and cultural movement in the twenty-first century, focusing on the terminal stages of the terminal illness of art. The collection It's All Part of the Same Now: Two Parts of the Same Art (2015) is a romp through the contradictory forms of modern art, focusing on the ways in which a curatorial hand can manipulate the language of art in a terminal illness as part of a broader political and social critique. The collection The Collectors: Art and Politics in the Age of Zero (2018) is a return to form with the biennial as a political collection and the terminally ill as a collection of ill people. The collection will be no less critical, but will instead attempt to make the terminal state of affairs seem like a viable point of departure from the crisis.

The collection Arrival: Contemporary Art in the Twenty-First Century (2014) is a chronicle of art and art-related phenomena in the global South, focusing on art made in the immediate aftermath of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. The collection After AIDS: Art from the Microscopic to the Macroscopic (2015) is a set of 19 paintings that offer a survey of art made possible by the discovery of nano-sized particles of HIV in blood and other bodily fluids. The fifth and final collection, Our Time, was published in 2016 and focuses on the human-caused climate change and its effects.I should preface this statement by naming a few artists and curators who have been invited to participate in the upcoming Venice Biennale:

Michael Ames: Michael Ames is an independent documentary filmmaker, producer and art teacher.

The collection Arrival: Contemporary Art in the Twenty-First Century (2014) is a chronicle of art’s fluctuations in global perception, a collection that includes works from places like Cairo, Mumbai and São Paulo. The collection Mirrors on a Wall (2017) is a monument to the Occupy Movement in New York City, its high-wire act as a form of political resistance, and the politics of virtual private property. The collection We Are Here: The Art World (2018) is a coming-of-age story about the exhibitionality of contemporary art in an artworld, as it happens at a time when we are (more and less) seduced by the glitter, the exclusivity, and the metainterritorialism of contemporary art's promise. The collection WOW: What a Time to Be Alive (2018) is a docudrama about the biennial as a curatorial gesture, drawing on the work of filmmakers including Matthew Vaughn, Laura Poitras, Jon Favreau and Adam Szymczyk, that is as seductive as it is exhausting.</text>

The collection After Modern Painting (2015) is a set of twenty-first-century van Wyckian vanities, a name that evokes William Shakespeare's character Copper, who, in The Tempest, gives the finger to a crowd gathered to see a trick, and then proceeds to paint the entire crowd with half-baked designs that turn out to be ghost paintings. The collection After Modern Painting is a response to this kind of exhibitionism; it collects and reflects on the ways in which contemporary art is reproduced through the use of 3D modeling, textiles, images and images based on demands for authenticity and authenticity-based art. The collection After Modern Painting was inspired by the curatorial speech that John Muir delivered as the keynote speaker at the 1988 Venice Biennale, where he declared: ‘Modern art is the appearance of things not</text>

The collection Arrival: Contemporary Art in the Twenty-First Century (2014) is a chronicle of art’s encounters with the new curatorial regime, in an exhibition format that coincides with the curatorial regime of the twenty-first century. The collection The Other (2015) is a coming-of-age story about the contemporary art of entering the contemporary artworld, and collecting contemporary artworks among the ruins of a once great art community. The collection was curated by Kunsthal Aarhus, Denmark and FACT, an international art collective founded in 1989. The collection will be on view in Venice from June 17–October 19, 2016.The collection is a project of the Danish and Danish-based museums, Berlingske Tidende and Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as the Freire &amp; Coppa Foundation, and the Liverpool Biennial. It was also curated by Kunsthal Aarhus, Denmark and the Danish and Danish-based museums, Aarhus Museum, Oslo, and Kølbække Museum, Copenhagen. It was supported by the Danish</text>
    <text>project raises questions about how human biodiversity is distributed throughout the planet. The series features interviews with over-60 artists, scientists and heritage-conscious individuals from around the world who discuss the recent past in an attempt to produce a shared vocabulary of meanings about the future. The episodes are an effort to capture the idiosyncratic idiosyncrasy of each place, its people, and its place in the larger social world. The aim of the project is to interrogate the ways in which a biennial can (and, I guess, cannot) connect with its place, its place in the world. In doing so, it has produced eleven episode collections, each of them dedicated to a specific place, a specific time in time. The collection My Place: The Exhibition Place (2012) is dedicated to the city of Liverpool, with an exploration of its past, present and future, in an exhibition format that coincides with the biennial itself. The collection Arrival: Contemporary Art in the Twenty-First Century (2014) is a chronicle of art from the twenty-first century, and My Place: The Exhibition Place is a project to capture the idiosyncrasy of the present and contemporary art in that era. The collections were commissioned by and jointly published by Liverpool Biennial, and their arrangement with art critic, Art Newspaper.IRAQA/LAURENT/BOURGEGUE: 1920–2004 (N.Y.P.P.) is the name of the company that owned the oilfields in question. The oilfields in question were located in the city of Kuwait and were owned by Kuwaiti Oil Company (KOC). The KOC was a for-profit corporation established in 1922 and owned by the government of Kuwait from 1926 to 2004. Its main business was producing oil from the ground. The oilfields in question were part of a large complex that was part of the larger Kuwait Industrial Complex (KIC), which was part of a much larger complex that extended further afield.

The collection Arrival: Contemporary Art in the Twenty-First Century (2014) is a chronicle of art and its impact, drawing on the curatorial approach and aesthetic of the ‘art space’ – a concept introduced in the biennial’s current bible, Modern and Recent Art – and its synonymously, the ‘curatorial space’ (hence the museum-like structure and rich collections of art, antiquities and original objects that characterize the biennial). The collection The New Curator (2015) is a curatorial intervention that creates a specific collection of objects through a process of elimination. While the objects it presents may not be contemporary or artefacts, they certainly are contemporary and relate to the contemporary situation. The collection is an intervention into the contemporary art market and is intended to participate in its dynamic, ever-expanding circulation. Its curatorial intentions may be incremental and its impact variable, but its effect is always the same: something new is created every time it is opened. I say this as someone who has curated several biennials over the years with</text>

The collection Arrival: Contemporary Art in the Twenty-First Century (2014) is a chronicle of art from the twenty-first century, in an exhibition format that complements the biennial. The collection Itinerant: A Visual Journal (2015) is a visual journal of contemporary art from the 1970s, a journal that is both a form of and a mode of recording contemporaneity. The collection New York Times Visual Journal (2015) is a visual journal of visual culture in America, its cities, and their inhabitants. Its primary task is to capture the essence of visual culture in a single place, people, and time. The collection Chicago Reader (2015) is a visual journal of visual culture in the United States, its people, places, and practices. Its curatorial focus and extensive online publishing gives it a unique vantage point in the world. The collection Los Angeles Times (2016) is a visual journal of visual culture in the United States, its cities, their people, and their practices. Its curatorial focus and extensive digital publication makes it a journal of contemporary art from everywhere,</text>

The city is a site of constant change and flux, intertwined with the daily life of millions of people all over the world. The notion that cities’ transient character – constantly on the move to meet the demands of an ever-expanding market economy – is a myth. [6] See Amber Dean,  	Urban Templates: Futures of Cultures (2016), p. 20.

[6] See Howard Zinn,  	The Gathering Storm (1964), for a critical analysis of the perils of global capitalism.

[4] For an overview, see also my Anthropology Today article,  	Crisis and Curation, from 1970 in which I argued that crises of urbanicity were the direct outcome of the on-going process of global nomadic accumulation of capital in the form of successive capitalist crises. [5] The word ‘curation’ has been used in a number of different senses in relation to materials and physical objects, but its precise sense of objectifying relation is the subject of much dispute. Some have appropriated the concept of the  	Cure, from the 1950s medical textbook by Francis Galton, who coined the concept, while others have used the term to describe processes of encrustation that result from the inorganic (material) commodity fetishisation of a particular form of labour. The tendency towards global material nomadism is a form of proto-curation, and the modern biennial is no exception. [6] See Søren Pold, ed.,  	A History of</text>

These are just some of the questions that the Biennale could often be found employing as a moral or political challenge or rallying cry. Whilst the answers to these questions may differ depending on the specific position taken by the artist(s), there is generally agreement that the aim is always the same – to travel to a location and engage with that location in some way. Whilst these ‘ideal candidates’ may differ in detail, they all tend to involve a location somewhere in the world, ideally somewhere accessible to visitors – something that cannot be said of most biennials. The important question is what can a location afford? The answer to this is often ‘yes’, but often ‘no’. While locations may place value on the notion of habit, they also often invest in the notion of development, often in the form of infrastructure or development that supports it. While not</text>
