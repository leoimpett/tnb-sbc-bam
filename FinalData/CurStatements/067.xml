In the case of the film, the city is a figure in its own right, presenting itself as both corrupt and beautiful, with a ‘city’ that actively participates in the production of its own sense of beauty, whether that sense is created by the city’s ongoing financial problems, its role in the warring classes of the international financial sector, or its ongoing role as a site of imperialist confrontation.

The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for postindustrial cities is this notion of rebirth. If the city is to function as a cultural site or a site of aesthetic creativity, it is imperative that it is a site of reanimation. If not, the cultural tourism generated by this pseudo-site of aesthetic carnage is unlikely to generate enough funds to cover the operating costs of such cultural tourism. The ‘design’ part of the manifesto is this: ‘The city is a site of constant change – constant regeneration, continual demolition, continual rehab – and so it follows that change must come from elsewhere.’’ Thus, cities are asked to create ‘permanent memorials’ to the past, but must also actively reclaim space from the city. The ‘design’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ is this: ‘Not everyone can be a designer. But everyone can learn how to be creative problem solvers. The question is whether everyone can master the art of problem</text>

The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for postindustrial cities is a point of departure from the city, which is now being forced to make way for a ‘design hotel’ or ‘design matcha’ (more specifically, a plan to be developed by the Crowne Plaza hotel company, Toronto), a condo tower and condo cooperative, and a host of other businesses, many of them non-profit social enterprises). The ‘design hotel’ moniker is a catch-all term for a constellation of businesses created to meet the hotel and condo’s overnight needs, whether those needs are met by the city’s various local authorities, the hoteliers, or even the multinational corporations that own the products of city planning. The ‘design matcha’ moniker is a point of departure from the city, and the non-profit sector has begun to use it to mean many different things, with varying degrees of effect. 	[ii] Kara S.

The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for redeveloping the city means preserving and restoring to historical glory formerly occupied spaces, but it also means creating something new and exciting in the place of what was once a ‘great urban space’. This is why ‘design’ has become a synonym for postmodernism and urbanisation is spreading across the globe. It is a ‘problem cities’ problem, but it is also a ‘city’s’ problem.’ [1] http://www.designboom.com/2014/11/30/design-infrastructure-future-urban-exploration/2/14998880.php#sthash.u8q9qSBLo.dpuf.dpuf.20141207.ALWAYS_A_WEEK.WOW_20_.DTE_B1 .DTE b1,  London,  25 June 2014. http://www.designboom</text>

This is why cities have ‘heritage buildings’ – buildings and sites that have served as monuments of colonialism and neo-liberalism in the past, but which are now being forced to remake themselves through the processes of gentrification and postindustrialisation. The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for postindustrial cities is this revisionist history. The ‘design’ part of the ‘design biennial’ is this revisionist vision of the city. The city is reanimated through the processes of gentrification and postindustrialisation, but in the process, it is replaced by an ever more privatised form of capitalism. In other words, the city is a site of continual transition – from the past, to the future, to the present – and thus is constantly subject to change, confusion and displacement. How to Know About It, a project co-founded by Deena Chalabi and Sarah Carter-Hughes, aims to help artists and designers decide for themselves what is or is not ‘heritage’ in Toronto. It is a set of questions and answers that facilitate a clearer understanding of the city’s urban fabric and urban politics, while enabling creative solutions to challenging problems. The questions and answers, developed by the artists and designers,</text>

This is why cities have ‘heritage buildings’ – buildings and sites that have served as monuments of colonialism and neo-liberalism in the past, but which are now being forced to remake themselves through the processes of gentrification and postindustrialisation. The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for postindustrial areas includes a concept of heritage value, which derives from the ideas of eco-trending and is promoted by the likes of Zaha Hadid, whose company, Doha-based ZHA, is the world’s largest builder of historic buildings. Heritage buildings are valuable for a number of reasons. Firstly, they are used by a community or a particular neighbourhood for a long period of time, and thus are a kind of investment for that community or neighbourhood. Secondly, the length of this use – a building is put into service for many years, and thus contributes to its intrinsic value – is a kind of insurance policy against potential damage. Thirdly, the role of the museum or a gallery in the ‘design manifesto’ is premised on the value of the building as a resource – in the form of deeds, contracts, building sections, renovation schedules and so on. Finally, the role of the gallery or the museum in the ‘</text>

This is why cities have ‘heritage buildings’ – buildings and sites that have served as monuments of colonialism and neo-liberalism in the past, but which are now being forced to remake themselves through the processes of gentrification and postindustrialisation. The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for postindustrial cities is why cities are moving towards algorithms – the development of ever more pervasive and pervasive data-collecting apparatuses that are able to map, identify and categorise citizens according to their movements, habits and patterns of living. Cities that sit idly by while their citizens become increasingly digitised are susceptible to this process of urban-discovery in the future, when the narratives of cities will no longer align with those of colonialists.  One can argue that the postindustrial city is moving towards a digital city, and that this means that the city is no longer anchored to particular sites or individuals but instead exists in a data-rich virtual space. But this doesn’t seem to be the case in many cities. The postindustrial city seems to be moving towards an increasingly data-driven city, where the city is no longer defined by the past but instead constructs its own narrative. This may happen in relatively urban centres where the car is still the dominant mode of</text>

The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for postindustrial cities is the heritage of colonialism and neo-liberalism. It is, in other words, a proclamation of the past but a plea for the future. It is a reclamation of sites and identities through the processes of gentrification, but it is also a plea for a radically different future. By highlighting the city’s precariousness and the urgent need for strong social and health services, but also its potential for transformative social changes, the ‘heritage’ part of the manifesto serves as a call to action for a city whose urban landscape has been modelled on the logic of finance rather than the histories of its pasts. 	As noted by the French urbanist Bernard Saltin in his seminal work Contemporary Urban Development, the contemporary urbanisation process has accelerated in the past decade, largely as a result of the massive financial injections into infrastructure that have replaced traditional modes of production. Saltin focuses on in particular the financialisation of roads and rail</text>

The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for postindustrial cities is this kind of urban-regeneration: a form of postcolonial identity that integrates the city into the social contract between city and citizen. 	[6] And yet, despite this insistence on the city as a valued site of social reproduction, environmental degradation and conflict resolution, there is considerable resistance to the idea of the city as an inherently valuable cultural possession. The biennial as a form of cultural tourism seems to be losing favour with the cities that construct it, as cities realize that the biennial has little choice but to engage in the cultural tourism inherent to the city in order to fund itself. Cultural tourism is a necessity in the face of rapidly expanding urbanisation, yet the push towards ever more encompassing ephemeral media formats, to include all kinds of data, discourse and data, discourse that is as fluid and variable as the city’s surface, to the extent that it is not constrained by the city’s current consumption and</text>

The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ for postindustrial sites is this: survive the Change. This is, of course, the postulation of the uncertain future – in any case, the ‘design’ part of the manifesto is often prescient, and often wrong. But the ‘survive the Change’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ is a guiding principle of the project, and the survival of the ‘design’ part of the manifesto is a project mission. The city is made up of many different places, and the idea of the city as a complex of ‘places’ is often used as a crutch to justify a single ‘place’ or a single decision. But the ‘survive the Change’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ is often called upon to bail the ‘design’ part of the city out of its predicament.

The ‘heritage’ part of the ‘design manifesto’ is an essential part of the project’s mission statement. It defines the vision of the city for the manifesto as a whole, and for the curatorial hand in bringing the design manifesto to life. Heritage buildings are typically places of conflict, conflict, and beauty – places with a past that is no longer secure and certain. They are places of confrontation. They are places of magic. But what they lack in charm and beauty, they more than make up for in the ability to make us forget – to turn our memories of past glories into something more beautiful and palatable, to turn our present conflicts into something more amenable to the interests of international capital. This kind of maturation and transformation is precisely what the city is intended to do. It is part of the international system of capital accumulation. And while the city may have some of the characteristics of a successful design manifesto – capital may indeed be attracted to places where capital is present and can establish its own internal logic of the</text>

The answer, in many cases, was to do away with the word ‘city’ altogether. After the 1967 Biennale, the Biennale Corporation began to refer to itself as the ‘Organisation’, and its various ‘curatorial initiatives’ as ‘The Fixture’. While the city was being made up, the ‘Organisation’ was making itself known.This  	was, of course, an art project. As much as the city, its streetscape, the factories, warehouses, parks and historic sites lent a mythical character to the exhibition, the Biennale could not have been more ‘art’ itself.

Contemporaneous with these social activities were commissions for which the artists typically felt that their work had been fully warranted. In other words, the biennale as an art form was always at its zenith. However, the corporation’s promotion of a single art form has increasingly come to dominate other aspects of the institution, which has resulted in the biennale producing culturally responsive works that can be seen as both innovative and telling. At its most basic, a biennale is a marketplace for cultural behaviours. It should be creative in its consumption and it should be dynamic in its making. This dynamic has brought to the surface of many people, including our country, which has then been seen as a potential future market for</text>

The perception of insularity around itself was also part of its logic for not inviting any art from outside the city. The biennale’s partnership with the city meant that it could devote much of its time to policing its image, whereas other arts bodies were more open to other ideas and cultures. In 1970, for instance, the Liverpool Biennial established a Cultural Circle programme that invited artists from across the globe to develop their own cultural narratives in and through the city. The programme’s theme – ‘Envisioning a Future for Environments, Towns and Cities – echoed those of other cultural biennials of the time: ‘Can a Future Be Found?’ and ‘Future City’. The language of future city was used to describe an imagined future where people no longer looked to the</text>

[4] The biennale also established relationships with other art institutions, including the Tate Modern, who funded a commission by Francis Bacon Hall, the curator of the British Museum, on the walls of the institution. Art is often thought of as an intermediate step between the public and the arts, but Bacon’s commissioning group, which included Peter Brook, John Lennon and Ringo Starr, perhaps explains why the biennial has maintained a relatively low profile in the canon of art institutionally. The Lincoln Biennial was even more politically active, initiating a residency programme for artists. The biennial’s low profile is perhaps due to its short, intense and transient form of art-historical survey: the project was put on hold in 1970, when the arts council intervened and, with little fanfare, the council reneged on its commitment to the project.

The Nigeria Art Bureau joined this, becoming a separate entity, with offices in Lagos and New York. The new image-making agencies brought with them a host of other innovations, including the proliferation of underground art fairs, the proliferation of bazaars, and the proliferation of creative-writing curricula. But the essential African model for contemporary art production and consumption – producing, with stunning images, images that are readily understood by the target market – was fundamentally interrupted.African centres took off, in part thanks to the IAPA, which brought lucrative commerce and artistic services to the region. And although the market for art in the region was the main driver of expansion, cultural institutions also emerged as important providers of cultural resources and catalysts of artistic activity.

One of the first commissions I did was for the City of London Biennale, which was in turn its first major external purchase. The Biennale got involved with the City of London's plans to transform the old Chiswick Studios into a new ‘cultural district’, and with the city’s Mayor, who supported this idea from the back benches. The Biennale was keen that its image be synonymous with the transformation of abandoned places of art and culture, so it teamed up with the city’s Museums Commission, which were keen to stamp ‘Public Practice: Open Space Movement’ on the premises and invited the artists to create a ‘public space for debate and reflection on the city’s past, present and future’. 	These collaborations between the Biennale and City of London museums came at a pivotal time. The Biennale was starting to feel like a museum, to be seen and</text>

As a result, we can identify key moments when the Biennale started to connect with artists: the opening curatorial manifesto, the 1999 Biennale commission, the 2000 Biennale memorandums of understanding, the 2008 Biennale programme, the 2012 Biennale website, and the members of the 2012 Curatorial Cast.  The process of biennale commissioning, selection and creation – the narrative that emerged during this time – is indicative of a larger art market that is preoccupied with the appearance of objectivity, objective measurement and the appearance of value. In the contemporary context of the ever-increasingly important role of measurement, it is the mediator of a cultural landscape already heavily reliant on the appearance of measure. This narrative is no doubt part of the enforcer and enfant terrible of modern capitalism. It is useful to draw attention to a few of these narratives.  The first is the</text>

These packages were designed to entice the artist(s) into the fold, and made the city visible through what its name implied – a place to be visited, a place to be ‘caught’ by international art dealers. The ‘cultural tourism package’ offered by the Biennale Fund was a good match for the city’s growing tourist industry, and the transnational travel agencies that needed to be found in order to cater to the growing biennale market. The ‘art-school-per-diem’ component of the package was part of a broader, integrated tourism package that also included ‘curatorial’ programmes. In</text>

The aim of these was to recognise and create worlds around themselves, through which artists could operate in and with the city, through which neighbourhoods could be rebuilt and creative possibilities created.The Biennale’s global image-making came about as a consequence of several things in particular. One of these was the creation in Liverpool of a few impoverished artists’ studios, whose identities were stamped on the walls of the city, and whose activities were monitored by a small network of security cameras. These were followed by a series of photographs that became known as the ‘Blue Print’ – a set of guidelines for artist-organisations to follow in creating their image-identity portfolios. In these photographs, the artists’ active participation can be seen as a requirement, or a means to an end. The Blue Prints encouraged an ideological and commercial relativism that saw art as inherently ‘good’, and the arts as inherently ‘evil’.’[29] And this moral neo-liberal relativism has continued to this day.

The name came from the fact that the exhibition was in the arts centre of Liverpool, alongside the Liverpool Biennial in 1966 and the Liverpool and Westminster Biennials in 1972. The Biennials invited their artists to act as curators in their city, which prompted the Biennials to set up their own arts and heritage commissions. The Biennials established partnerships with other arts bodies in the city and abroad, and formed the basis for what became known as the Biennale Corporation.

The biennales, along with other arts bodies, followed suit, setting up image-recognition programmes.

The Biennale Corporation was established in 1984, and though it has expanded and changed hands many times, its mission remains the same. It works to bring art and culture together in socially engaged ways, through programmes of educational, cultural and political activities, through its production of biennials and their image-recognition platforms, and through its various other arts and heritage activities. The aim of the Biennale is to 'serve as a bulwark against the elements that pervert the noble cities’ natural histories, enabling all who witness its process of historical reclamation to contribute meaningfully to their cities’ social, cultural and political wellbeing'.15  The Biennale Corporation has a budget of about £420,000 for its activities in the UK and US in 2016.16  It is run by a board of trustees, which includes senior cultural and</text>

My interest is in the latter; what is considered ‘civilized’ in the here and now may be subject to change and reshaping in the future. In order to reap the benefits of such changes and developments, it is imperative that the art, meant to serve as a flag, flagstone, or any other suitable building material, is culturally responsive to the new modes of technological revolution and urbanization that are thrust upon us. Such building should respond to the new modes of technological revolution and urbanization with materials and engineering that are both resilient and interpretive of the new management of urban space. Such building should manifest the social, economic and geo-political changes that are demanded by the new management of urban space in the immediate vicinity. Such building should be culturally responsive, economically powerful, and, above all, aesthetically appealing. Rare is the such a response to the demands of contemporary urban development that is not met with something equally, if not more, modern and accessible.  So, there is a clash between the needs of the contemporary urban and those of the natural world, and between the ancient and the new urban forms, all wrapped up in the same urban form. There is a tension</text>

My interest is in the latter; what is considered ‘civilized’ in the here and now may be subject to change and reshaping in the future. In order to reap the benefits of such change and exploration, artistic and curatorial interventions need to be multivocal, and have a contingency in the face of it. They need to be able to react simultaneously to the possibility of change and to the possibility of not being able to react. This kind of malleability is needed for art and art’s social function to be realised.Art as an Art form, the ability to see possibilities for change through art, is a core curatorial value. It is also a necessary curatorial value in the age of the biennial, and art today more generally. But what is essential in the age of the biennial and art, and the associated culture of the ever-present exhibition, is what might be described as the ‘positive side’ of change. A term coined by the biennial critic Peter Schjeldahl in his book The Art Biennial (1976), and now part of the UCMJ (2015), this ‘positive’ aspect of bienn</text>

My interest is in the latter; what is considered ‘civilized’ in the here and now may be subject to change and reshaping in the future. In order to reap the benefits of such an intervention, such an art project would need to be globally distributed and self-financing. Managing such an artistic stake through curatorial appointments is a different kind of management. It involves making compromises in the interest of the common good, and it is the contemporary artworld that places such a premium on transparency and accountability.In order to reap the benefits of such an intervention, such a art project would need to be internationally distributed and self-sufficient. In doing so, it would need to be able to sustain a consistently high standard of transparency and accountability, which would enable the community to judge the project’s sustainability. In addition, it would need to be able to provide a compelling argument for such an intervention in the international art marketplace. That is, the more it was transparent, the less it was admired and the less it was believed by the general public. In doing so, it could risk being labelled a radical interventionist art project and defeated in the marketplace.At the time, Sar</text>

In order to reap the benefits of such an intervention, one would also need to be able to articulate the consequences and costs of such change, and how this may affect the populations being helped to become ‘civilized’ again.This is a difficult distinction to make, to say the least. There is a sense of over-emphasizing the social and political dimensions of the past in contemporary art, while underestimating the class and ethnic ones. It is also a distinction that many artists, myself included, would not wish to draw into being. There is a danger, in fact, that such intervention could hasten the demise of ‘civilized’ art as we know it. The Sarwar Brothers, despite their artistic aspirations, were not able to shake the tendency toward social pathology and bureaucratization that was brewing in the art world at large. It would be nice if the social dimension could be brought into the picture in the same way that language, icons, music and film are elements in a larger cultural landscape.</text>

In order to reap the benefits of such an intervention, the arts’ community would have to become integrated into the culture of the city, and then the city itself. It is a daunting prospect for an artist to establish a significant practice outside the art world, but Sarwar is a rare exception. He has a unique perspective on the city at a critical juncture in its development: the art world is a few short years away from being populated by self-appointed urban activists bent on transforming the city into a utopia. The arts scene in the city is unlikely to be what it used to be, but Sarwar has the opportunity to create a parallel universe where the arts community can flourish alongside the city at a scale never before imagined.This article was originally commissioned by and published in The New Inquiry, Volume 2: Issues in Art &amp; Culture, 2009, and it can be found at http://newinquiry.org/issues/index.html#art-and-culture.Download this article as PDFJennifer Graham and Monica Ross</text>

My interest is in the latter; what is considered ‘civilized’ in the here and now may be subject to change and reshaping in the future. In order to reap the benefits of such innovation, artworks had to be anchored firmly in the present and thoroughly reacquainted with the people and culture that inhabit the site today. This was arguably the context and agenda of Conversation Art’s' 2015 Poppycock Poem Contest.Though technically a public art competition, Poppycock was also a kind of a ‘club’ for people to come, share ideas and connect. It was a place to share, exchange and experiment, exchange and come back to.

My interest is in the latter; what is considered ‘civilized’ in the here and now may be subject to change and reshaping in the future. In order to reap the benefits of such innovative thinking, a community of practitioners has to actively engage with the concepts and practices of contemporary art in the context of its own community. The project I am conducting right now involves interfacing with an existing and expanding community of artists, designers, artists and designers through a host of facilitators, community organisers and artists’ organisations. Though these may have different objectives and approaches, their common thread is a commitment to creating meaningful co-existence between people with different backgrounds, creeds and identities in a given community. Though each organisation may have different priorities and may have different skills and resources, they all have one thing in common: they all want to achieve a similar outcome in their given community. Art and creative-art organisations should operate with these intranational actors understanding that their work is ultimately about them, not necessarily about what happens in the community. This may require negotiation, but in the end it is up to the community to decide how to be governed and to whom.  One final thing to</text>

In order to reap the benefits of such emerging technologies, the future may have to grapple with the terrible malady of urban sprawl and cultural colonialism.That the massive, all-encompassing, ever-expanding web of information that we call the ‘web of connectedness’ has entered our collective consciousness is testimony to the power of metaphor. It is testimony to the ubiquity of information; to the magical, all-encompassing, all-encompassing notion of connectivity. It is testimony to the fact that, as biopolitics evolves, links everywhere around the globe become less tangible and more variable. It is testimony to the fact that, as new media technologies develop, the kinds of cultural politics that once accompanied the spread of myths and stories also take on new dimensions. It is testimony to the fact that, as the Åkerfeldt-Deisseroth Conjecture goes, the end game for which biopolitics has been historically engaged is precisely that of the reconnection of the peripher</text>

In order to reap the benefits of such an intervention, cultural producers of the present and future need to be able to intervene in the creation of those things considered ‘civilized’ in the here and now.This kind of intervention is the kind that can and should be made today. It is the kind of intervention that can create and foster change through knowledge sharing and the cultivation of mutual understanding. It is the kind of intervention that is able to create new situations through its awareness and engagement. In short, it is cultural production at its purest. But it is also cultural production that is unavoidably political and political in nature.That is, the more we know about the world around us, the more we realise how we actually don’t understand it, and the more we realise that our own engagement with the world is political and political, the less we will be able to engage with the world as a whole. That is, the more we see the world through the filter of our own cultural production, the less we will</text>

In order to reap the benefits of such an intervention, however, the community would have to embrace it fully and enthusiastically. I would guess that the ability to alter one’s perception of the future or create one’s own future would render such an undertaking ‘ill-advised’. It is certainly possible to miss the forest for the trees, to perforate the benefits of such an intervention, to miss the forest and thereby reap the benefits but to remain ignorant of the consequences. This is the predicament of the cultural urbanist: he or she can construct a utopian future for the inhabitants of a city, but such visions run counter to the prevailing forces of capitalist urbanism.  	Arjun Appadurai has been called upon to contribute to a new generation of cultural urbanists. Though not an urbanist himself, his position is shifting and it is now time to call for a new sensibility in cultural settings, one that will render the city as an island in the sea, rather than the capital</text>

The dialogue between art and curator has shifted from a dialogue between artist and audience, between curatorial and educational, to one between curator and public. The curatorial movement has become enmeshed in the socio-political landscape, and the public, publics, as separate and distinct entities. As a result, curatorial interventions, whether political, economic or both, can have very different effects on different situations. 	In 2014, the Biennale convened its 25th edition in In 2016, the Biennale selected its venue from a shortlist of cities determined by a public referendum. The Biennale’s current mandate is renewed with an eye on the biennial’s own date of publication in 2018. Whether the Biennale is to remain an interventionary curatorial tool or shift towards an interventionary role remains to be seen. But in the meantime, its current mandate is increasingly being questioned. 	[i] Svetlana Boym</text>

It’s a rare event, with the support of a major international curatorial body, that can be endlessly looped through again and again. It’s the kind of art that can be repeated thousands of times in a lifetime, in a continual loop that seeks to produce new worlds, so the repeated performance needs a certain amount of weight and meaning. In this sense, and as performance, it’s revolutionary. It expands, deepens and deepens the understanding of the new world created by the old world. In an ideal world, the uncurled wouldn’t need to be reminded that they are performers in a performative art form whose works are part of a larger cultural system, and would exist in a world with no further external influences.

The warring factions in Syria have been a source of much discussion in the region, with those on the receiving end of violence often playing a leading role. In 2017, Istanbul’s Sultanahmet Sultan Mosque and Museum staged the restoration of a section of the mosque’s minaret, where Ottoman-era gold was discovered next to what was believed to be the remains of Byzantine mosaics. A total of fourteen works by ten different artists were selected to perform at the biennale as part of the Istanbul Documenta 6 exhibition. The majority of the artists made works for the Documenta 6 exhibition, which was curated by and opened by Sultanahmet Sultan. However, a few works, including works by solo artists, came from the collection of Modern and Contemporary Art Museum, and the Armenian and Assyrian Museums.

But I’m curious about what they think is possible for migration to happen in a specific city, so that people can think of their own specific city. For example, how might a biennale in Berlin or Los Angeles that is about migration in a particular way invite artistic practices that are specific to those cities?

It’s here that the curatorial intervention enters ‘the flesh’, or the flesh of the situation, as it were. The three artists, as visitors, are then confronted with the politics of everyday life, and the politics of art’s place in it. 	The event itself, at its best, engages with the politics of everyday life, and at its worst it does the opposite: it actively manipulates the politics of the situation in an attempt to suit its interests. In the spirit of the Cultural Monuments series, the curated activities here operate as a kind of ‘counterfactual’ narrative, building up the sense of what it means to be a contemporary artistically, and how that might manifest in the art world. The third act of the Biennale opens with a narrative that puts the contemporary art world in mind once more, as the curators lead through the streets of Venice, taking us into the empty streets outside the Biennale</text>

It deals with the politics of war and the politics of destruction as much as of migration. It’s a place to be seen, but also a place to be destroyed. 	The project began as a ‘quest for public access’, and from the outset, the curators knew that their work would be of use to a public engaged in a public debate about the way in which art is produced and delivered to such a globalised and material society. So the introduction of the Venice Biennale 2018, ‘The Architecture of Silence’, coincides with the publication of a book by the same title in early 2019, and the year is 2018.8 The exhibition is a ‘time-critical art project’, and its publication coincides with the need to address the present as a project of national resistance. In other words, the project is interrupted during these two key years, but it resumes when the other projects are finished and public access to the project is ensured</text>

It’s no coincidence that the various biennales throughout the 1990s and early 2000s emerged when the terrorism and conflict associated with the proliferation of transnational capital was at its height. The biennial has a particular role to play in simultaneously highlighting the familiar and proposing something new, especially in the art world. The fact that it opened three years before 9/11 (in the United States) and that it was curated by a man named Andy Warhol (who was also the curator of the hugely influential  Black-Eanes/Bienal Histories: Buenos Aires Biennale of 1988) meant that it received a lot of hype from art-news outlets, which enhanced its profile and made it a target. The biennial has a particular capacity to declare things as they’re occurring, since it opens with a description of the site as a city in which conflicts have become international news.

At its inception, the project sought to bring together three curators from different places of expertise: Meehan Crist, Laura Kate Harrison and Dr Evelyn Kyle. Crist, an artist who has a particular interest in the intersection of art and social practice, was tapped as an expert on post-colonial and racialised and multi-generational art forms; her work has addressed topics of identity, migration and history, as well as the politics and histories of contemporary art. Her artworks have been commissioned by the Biennale, the Swiss Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as the Liverpool Biennial and the Corfu and Tenerife Biennales.

[3] This exhibition will undoubtedly be seen as a major setback for the project, if it is not halted and corrected. The main event, which is being promoted as a ‘Coming Out Question’ by the organizers, follows a familiar script: a feminist icon is the focus of a controversy, a critique of patriarchal ideas is given, and the chosen subject is called upon to offer a contrarian perspective. The question is posed, and the answer is given in the affirmative, usually by way of a character reference or anaphora. Bacon’s character, Benjamin, is the prototypical English Enlightenment intellectual and his question is a familiar refrain. The question is posed in the first Folio of the Writings of Benjamin Franklin, where he writes: ‘What right have I to speak, if any man “found a Way to rob me of</text>

Modern philosophy and its impulse to understand the world through the narrow confines of the human condition is a myth, and Bacon’s discovery that the Light that causes us to think and act on behalf of all of humanity is a source of enormous inspiration and power. 	[3] Much of what is being projected onto the social dovetails with the goals of, and in some cases the characters or ideas of, the new order. In other words, the social is not something that will return to us, but rather requires the concerted efforts of many to continue to sustain and develop it. 	[4] Some have argued that the social is the arena in which the contemporary social struggles are the most interesting and least understood, and that the contemporary project to understand and represent the world through the symbols and taboos of the social is, in fact</text>

What we call the World today is the World Order that arises out of the World Economic Forum (WEF), World Bank and IMF. The word World Order is no longer a primary or defining concept, but rather one is often defined by a place or set of places (whether in the West or the East). The term derives from Latin, and is often used to refer to the political and economic orders that emerged from the economic convergence of the late eighteenth century. The rise and fall of commodity prices, and the subsequent policy of fiscal and monetary union that followed, is widely understood as the end result of the political unification of the nineteenth century. It is worth noting that Bacon was not the first to formulate or propose such an idea. The philosopher John Stuart Mill had already done so in his Time and Place, published in 1779, and a generation later Thomas More created the ‘</text>

Bacon’s error is to imagine that the Enemy could be found somewhere else, and that the World as we know it can be brought about by the application of reason and reason in the following manner: abstract space and reason produce an Empire that is pure and simple, but also vicious and incomplete. And here we see the source of the Empire: the basest kind of Empire, where the Good is understood not as an abstract concept, but as a specific thing – a thing that exists specifically to be destroyed. The Empire produced by the Enlightenment is a thing that is pure and simple, but also vicious and incomplete. And yet, somehow, we know that the Empire produced by the modern philosophy of Enlightenment will produce a World in our own image, in our own image with a particular set of qualities and characteristics, and that this World</text>

Modernity is not everywhere a disaster, but it is certainly not all sunshine and roses. The fact that ideas are still matters of opinion, and those who hold dominant views in society often get a free pass when it comes to wielding those opinions in power. It is our responsibility to shape the world, and when we do that ideas are often given a go-ahead by those with a clear interest in seeing their way of thinking preserved. 	[3] So if, as claimed by Francis Bacon, we should strive for what is called ‘a new kind of Government’, then perhaps it would be time to reconsider how we design our institutions. Perhaps it would be time to consider creating our own ‘civil society’, based on the philosophies and fads of the moment.

The problem with the modern philosophy of Enlightenment is that it is a conceptually inadequate way of organizing the world, and ideas or collections of ideas are not enough to create a new world. Ideas and collections of ideas are essential for such an organizing effect, but the modern notion of the Enlightenment is itself inadequate, since it fails to take into account the multiple material forms of modern culture. Modernity is a collection of collections of ideas, and the modern condition is a collection of different collections of ideas. Modernity needs a social organization that takes into account the multiplicity and diversities of the social totality. The social organization that is needed is a ‘world congress’ that incorporates the diverse collections of ideas and phenomena that are now considered to be part of the modern world. Modernity requires a ‘Common Cause’ that includes diverse philosophical, social and political perspectives. But while the various collections of ideas and phenomena</text>

Modernity itself is the refusal to acknowledge reality, to acknowledge that the world is unpredictable and that this exhibition was, in fact, made possible by the very thing that Bacon had imagined would replace the world. 	[3] This was perhaps the original idea behind the pigeon’s cage, but the later proponents of the ‘One World View’ seem to have relished the chance to appear non-threatening and take credit for the idea. For example, in 1776, Benjamin Franklin wrote to his friend James Madison:  TheNitrome[…]when the Declaration of Independence is read, there is supposed to be found a Reverence for the various Forms of Empire, which have for Many ages past been Observed to exist among Men: It is a Remarkable Discovery to Us that this Declaration should now remain a Document, though so much of the Same Subject Matter, though Written in Verses, and Taken</text>

Education and knowledge are the means or ends of this thinking. A World War One exhibition, which we presume to be real, would place the blame for our economic predicament squarely on the shoulders of the affluent nations that comprise the newly identified Global South. 	[3]One might ask: what, then, might a World War One institution do in the present globalized and interconnected world? One might also ask: what can a World War One institution do in the present political and social situation? One might also ask: what might a World War One institution do in the past, when civilizations were more easily brought to heel? This is a difficult question to answer in a sustained and definitive way, partly because we do not know what the future holds for us.

Modern philosophy, as we understand it, begins as a movement away from the notion of the human as a rational animal towards something closer to the notion of the divinity of nations, empires, and cultures. Modernity is not, nor can it ever be, all about the accumulation of things in one form or another; nor is its true destination in any rational conception. Modernity is a movement towards possibilities and possibilities, towards the separation of things and towards the creation of new human worlds. It is, as Bacon would have put it, all about the acquisition of ‘possibilities’ and ‘episodic moments’. This is why, as we move away from the very idea of the human as a rational animal, we encounter, as well as seek to define, the concept of the human being as a species being divided into different types or kinds.

Modernity is an economic process. The more we dismantle it, the more it stands to be rebuilt, one piece at a time. Modernity, as we know it, is fragile and cannot function without the support of a strong economy. Modernity, which is the very process that Bacon had in mind, was being designed to be incredibly flexible and adaptable, capable of being rebuilt at any moment. Modernity, which is built on the back of immense debt, is being actively undermined by an economy that calls for ever more austerity and necessitates ever more financial engineering. So much of what we think we know about the economy, and the more we invest in it, the more precarious our investments look when the bubble bursts. The result is that more and more people are being lured into ever larger and more precarious debt traps. And of course, the ever-expanding, ever-inflating bubble feeds on ever more unsustainable regulations</text>

There are now people of all types and generations demonstrating across the country who believe in these same cultural themes and find them central to their identities. In my opinion, it’s vitally important that the art world not only understands but participates in this process, because at the same time it’s the only way that the gallery can function. The other is for the gallery to shift gears and exhibit work that it does not understand, or doesn’t feel it is entitled to. I believe that the recent shift in focus away from the gallery as the site of the aesthetic and towards the participatory aspects of cultural organising has created a fractured and insecure gallery environment. I see this in curatorial work, in curatorial performances, in the way publics are invited into galleries and museums, and in the curatorial writing that is more frequently published and considered authoritative. I believe that the most innovative, influential, and politically aware curatorial work is that done in partnership between artists and local communities. It’s a</text>

There are now people of all backgrounds exhibiting in galleries, displaying their art in public places, and connecting with visitors from all walks of life. These artists therefore come under increasing public pressure to address entrenched social and political ills in the city, but also the pressure to demonstrate some kind of alternative to the gallery’s predominant role. This exhibition should, however, also address the systemic causes of the decline in standards of living in the city, since the primary determinants of cultural quality, economic development and productivity are the people with which we come in contact. It’s ironic that the biennial that is the subject of this process is itself exhibiting its own mortality rate, since its raison d'être is to engage with the city and generate experiences of culture in places, but it has to address deeper issues because the city is the locus of its value. So it’s ironic that the Gallery is currently experiencing a token reopening of the Art Deco building, although this hasn’t been</text>

I find this ironic, since the social aspects of cultural consumption are the ones that are predominantly determined by factors of geography, demographics and the city’s economic malaise. In an ideal world, the Gallery would sponsor cultural events in the areas where they’d be most prevalent, and then curate these in an open, participatory and locally-sustained way. Unfortunately, this never happens, and the reason is that the Gallery is – as I have said many times – all-powerful and all-knowing. It does not matter what happens in the neighbourhood, the socio-political situation in the area, or even what kind of cultural experiences exist in the neighbourhood; what matters is that the Gallery does an adequate job of running the events that generate the art supply and the money to pay for art. In other words, the socio-political dimension is</text>

There are artists from all over the city contributing to the international curatorial community. So far, so normal for a biennial, but what has changed in the last 15 years is the curatorial and art institution’s role in the city. The biennial has largely replaced the curatorial as an institution that nurtured and promoted internationalism in the city, and in places such as Liverpool, it’s actually the opposite. The biennial is a collection of images, and the curatorial role has largely replaced that of nurturer. The biennial is the place where images are taken and where images are made, but it is the image of the city in which the art is displayed, and the image that is most often exploits.

The fact that these artists are black or Asian artists however, or that they are from the Caribbean, the US or some other region, or continent, is somehow not relevant anymore. For example, the proliferation of art by women artists exploring issues of gender and sexuality is no longer confined to the arts venues of the West, but is now being presented in traditionally ‘indigenous’ contexts by artists from other parts of the world. It is a phenomenon that has occurred even though the number of female artists in most artworlds around the world has steadily increased, despite the fact that in many parts of the world they still remain underrepresented in most art venues. More than one in four artists in the world today are women, but historically this has not always been the case.  One can argue that this is due to two factors: the discovery and proliferation of culturally responsive art,</text>

Our inability to perceive this however, is largely due to the inefficiency and bureaucratisation of the City Gallery, whose main mission is to run the exhibitions that generate the bulk of the money for the arts. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Gallery used to be run by a board of curators, now it’s run by a board of curators appointed by the mayor.

The reason why I find the recent appropriation of major cultural themes by local artists distressing is that these themes are no longer the sole province of an elite, white, metropolitan minority. There are now people of all colours and creeds coming to understand the significance of the arts and culture they touch. I believe that a surface level look at the local arts scene in the 1990s is misleading and deceptive, and that the art world of the 2000s is much more open and participatory.I also believe that the globalised contemporary artworld is becoming increasingly aware of the value of a localised and community-based arts practice, so that it’s no longer enough to simply add a gallery or a museum to the mix. Local community programmes are vitally important to the economic sustainability of many art institutions in the metropolitan centres, and so they are strategically placed alongside the galleries and museums that house significant amounts of the art they display. For example, the Asian Art Biennale has recently begun to show art from every continent, in an effort to demonstrate that the art it exhibits is regularly making its way to English-speaking countries and regions.Art is a community effort, and so the biennale,</text>

I think this is happening at an increasingly localised level in many cities, and I also think that it’s happening at a regional and even city level. As a curator, it’s a job to maintain a database of subjects, and to a certain extent, I have to participate in this ‘collective mind’. I think that what’s happening now is that the gallery is running out of places to put all these different kinds of art forms, themes, etc, and is now passing them on to local artisans and others who will work with them in similar ways. I’m not saying that these artisans will be like the artists of yesteryear, but they will certainly make use of art's historical and social resources in similar ways. In fact, I think that the gallery and its curators are becoming more like the artists they educate. They</text>

There are now people of all walks of life coming to enjoy and contribute to the artworld. This is why, even though the themes of the past are no longer relevant or desired, contemporary artists today are still acutely aware of their place in the artworld and the way that they are perceived and evaluated by the artworld as a whole. They’re aware that their works are work to be exhibited, but also that they are work to be made elsewhere and placed in contexts that are relevant to a wider social context. This is why, when, for instance, a young person, artist or theatre maker invokes the past in a work of art, the work should have a social mission and be able to be shared across a diverse range of people, not just the privileged few. It’s not enough to say ‘this is art’; the past has to be taken into account and considered. Movies, music, books, movies, books, movies, books, TV shows, festivals, street performers</text>

There are now people of all sorts of backgrounds and creeds exhibiting in major art exhibitions, and there are numerous local artists competing for small business endorsement through competitions organised by the biennale. It’s as if the biennale has become a multi-billion dollar business itself, with exhibitions accounting for approximately half of the annual fee. The other half is comprised of shows by museums and other relevant institutions. In these cases, the artists and institutions commissioning the art do so through a contract, and as a result the cultural institutions are often left with artists who are either unwilling or unable to engage with their work. I see this conflict as a legitimate one, and believe that the biennale can and should compete on a level playing field by providing exhibitions of varying quality and quantity, including events that draw visitors from all over the world. However, I also believe that biennales need to do more than showcase the work of their current curator, or select teams of artists from around the world, or even their local</text>

The ‘New Cultural Centre’ was an impressionable project that sought to bring together, through a shared language, the disparate elements of the local community through engaging with the place as a site of cultural activity in a way that was both accessible and was responsive to the needs and interests of the local people.  In the centre of the exhibition space, a plaza was planned for the local community to gather around and a public programme of activities was conceived. These were to be planned on the site of the project, in cooperation with local non-profit organisations, and with cultural tourism companies. Some of these commissions followed a formal bidding process, while others were purely voluntary. The winning proposals were incorporated into planning documents and architectural plans, and the building of the cultural district itself. These strategies were developed in close collaboration with local people and other partners, and were implemented with great freedom, independence and success. Even after the project was fully realised and proved itself to be a success, local people continued to organise and co-operate with the city government</text>

The ‘New Cultural Centre’ was a useful device for bringing together disparate worlds in a common language, but at the time, no one in power in Scotland was prepared to give the go-ahead for a Scottish version of the same to be built. 	Within a few years, the Biennale of Sydney (1998) ‘brought together’ both the architectural and the design proposals from the city’s past, but its real impact was felt at the Biennale of Sydney in 2001, when the Australian sculptor Neville Rowell selected sculptures by Scottish and Irish artists for the site of the new cultural centre. The Irish artist Michael Heaney chose to show his work in Venice, but the Biennale decided that his installation should be installed in Sydney, because that was where the mega art fairs were at at that time. ‘The new cultural centre’ was a catch-all term that encompassed a number of different ideas, and while Sydney was a city, not all of the population</text>

These ‘contemporaneities’ reconceive the past through what they call ‘contemporary art’ – taking art from the past, from now to a future when there are no longer any traces of the ‘present’. What they lack in historical and contemporary value, however, makes up for in political and symbolic import in the same way that the ‘Great Contemporaneity’ of the nineteenth century made the West possible. What better way to mark the twentieth century than to re-animate the historical moments that created the contemporary? The ‘contemporary art’ exhibition</text>

The exhibition was presented in the Crook of Aberdeen Hotel and Spa, which is the location of the 1982 Scottish Arts Festival, and in the Norwegian and Danish art fairs ‘New Market of Culture’ in 1986. In the new parallel universe, the artist is now a household name and the hotel is a cultural tourist attraction, but in the old world, where Muilleoir is thought of almost exclusively as a French artist, the project was considered farce and a hoax. The show was cancelled after two years, but its spirit lives on as the catalyst for a number of imitators and sub-exhibitions of the same kind to spring up in parallel worlds. The ‘New Cultural Centre’ was the brainchild of a passionate but ill-informed local community, which was ultimately thwarted by a larger urban regeneration programme that came much too close to the site, and which saw even more prime real estate earmarked for demolition. The local church was quick to condemn the show as heretical, and the local school board was equally quick to ban it outright. At the centre of it all was the city council, which was circumspect in its condemnation while the city council itself actively promoted the development of a ‘great urban district’ around the structure. It quickly became clear that the council had little intention of renaming the district after the artist, or bringing the work forward on a wider scale. Instead, the district was given a new name –  	New Art District – and a new management company was set up to run it. 	The new management team saw an opportunity to make the district a profit centre by introducing ‘curators’ to key positions within the building and</text>

The ‘New Cultural Centre’ was the instigator of a number of subsequent compilations, including a number based in Hong Kong, and a number based in Venice. The international exhibition circuit has also regularly commissioned works from a range of exhibitionary traditions, including non-artists, such as curators, journalists, historians and film-makers, but the most widely travelled artist is usually someone from the art world, whose work is of course intended to be seen, not understood, in a particular context. 	The popularity of  	The Multidisciplinary Artist and  	Triennials’ has led to a proliferation of symposia, which in turn have spawned a proliferation of sub-symposia, often operating out of museum collections, whose purposes are often aligned with those of the institution seeking to institutionalise the artist. The result is an ever-expanding canon of works culled from various disciplines, both formally and informally. As different audiences have different needs and desires, different disciplines have</text>

The ‘New Cultural Centre’ was the inevitable next logical step, and while it may have started as a centre for art-historical research and, later, archival archival research, it soon became a venue for a range of cultural activities including a cultural festival with an entirely Norwegian curatorial team and a public programme of concerts and exhibitions including a ‘festival of the invisible’, a sort of ‘petit poetry’ of the Norwegian performers, and a ‘recurrence’ of the name. The emergence of such oddball cultural institutions – think of the early ‘80s ‘New Left’ or ‘le devoir’ – also reflects the times, and the post-9/11 era provides fertile ground for cultural perforations. For instance, the now ubiquitous ‘Big Data’ – a buzzword in the 21st century – is a misnomer given the proliferation of devices (connections, infrastructures, cars) and the massive</text>

The ‘New Cultural Centre’ was the obvious next step, and in recent years the hotel has hosted numerous exhibitions of some of its curatorial's most ambitious projects, ranging from the evergreen and evergreen series of the early 1980s that combined architectural and interior photography, to the recent architectural exhibition of the new century that incorporated multimedia, multimedia and artworks. The new cultural centre was a significant presence in the show, even during its brief reign as a tourism attraction, and its future is thought to be uncertain, despite its share in the lucrative Scottish tourism market. If anything, the new cultural centre seems to be reinforcing the old, since it ‘leaps to the side and looks backwards’ in response to new entrenchment.  	The new cultural centre is a strange hybrid creature. It offers both the luxury of a monopoly on aestheticisation and the grace of a monopoly on historical continuance. But it also has a kind of negative concomitant: it promotes continuance by making it universal, but also</text>

The ‘New Cultural Centre’ was the inevitable outcome of this congruent situation, in which parallel histories are regularly encountered in the same city. It is a place to be found in both, a city that wants to absorb it all and pretend that it is experiencing a different past. And so the concept of the ‘new cultural centre’ has come to define the kind of urban centre that is subject to the logic of metainformation. The festival that came out of this was the one that sought to absorb the city into itself through a process of ‘cultural digestion’. It was a ‘city in flux’ in the sense that it was constantly on the point of being transformed by the unpredictable forces of globalisation, but also a ‘city of the excluded, where racial and economic difference continued to be a concern of the city’.[7] And so it continues to be. The biennial format has itself been characterised by a constant redefinition, often leading to the absurd.</text>

Tidal Wave was also the site of the biennale of artworks by a solo artist or collaborative project from 1974 to 1980, which featured works by more than twenty-five contemporary artists, as well as forty-five curators from forty countries. The biennale collected and presented the work of these artists in a single event, but it soon became apparent that this did not map onto the same chronological order as the artist’s retrospective, which continued to be staged in London and New York. The question of who was entitled to what order became an issue when the biennale was moved to the new ‘Cultural Trauma’ venue</text>

The ‘New Cultural Centre’ was the brainchild of the American art dealer Norman Mailer, and it reflected the growing globalised capitalist museum complex on a grand scale. The new curatorial approach, which appeared in force in 2015 under the chairmanship of Professors Niels Bohr and Morten Kyng, was driven by a curator’s summit chaired by Bjørn Strand, the curatorial professor at Aarhus University, and based in part on a programme of seminars offered by the university’s art department. The summit drew artists from across the art world to Norman Mailer’s new idea of the cultural linker: a specialist group of artists and art-historical practitioners selected from around the world who would work alongside artists from the contemporary and post-modern traditions in creating new cultural paradigms. Mailer invited the artists to explore the idea of a ‘citizen artist’ in his short story ‘The Tin Flute Boy’, which appeared in the New</text>

Their mission is to develop, support, and enhance the cultural resources of the national parks by empowering and organizing communities to create, participate in, and manage their own environments.[4] And yet, as the Tony Bennett collection demonstrates, cultural resources can act as vectors of transmission, proliferation, and even conflict. Cultural resources enable access to objects that otherwise remain inaccessible; they enable symbolic action that are interpreted, judged, and acted upon; and they enable symbolic action that is not.

The potential is there to imagine new ways of organizing curatorial activities, and perhaps to re-animate old cultural centres. Vorticism and new curatorial approaches to the city are possible only for certain urban centres, and only if these centres are willing to become stakeholders in the development of the cities. For Toronto, and the world at large, this could mean becoming stakeholders in the making of a new metropolis.1. The biennale as a multi-generational enterprise.

The biennale has been around for at least 200 years, and probably longer. It is composed of many overlapping parts, which have in turn been part of the periodic table since ancient times. The title of the original Greek and Latin text of the ‘biennale’, and the ‘parthenon’ in Greek and Latin, respectively, derives from the fact that the parts are classified under the heading ‘theileia’ (genitive theilei). The Latin noun ‘parthenon’ translates roughly as ‘the beginning of the world’, and thus the Greek and Roman texts that accompany them (the ancients included) make the world as a whole (the ancients included). The Greek text of the same title, by the way, makes a big deal about the ancients ‘beginning of time’ – in contrast, the present is often identified with a particular ‘time’, which is pre-defined by scientific (scientific) metrics. 	In Greek and Roman antiquity, ‘theileia’ meant the spatial center or foundation of the universe.[5] In the case of the Roman world, the centrality of the ancients was emphasized in the form of a central building, which became a symbol of power and authority (</text>

The title of the original Greek and Latin text of the ‘biennale’, and the ‘parthenon’ in Greek and Latin, are repeated hundreds of times in various places in the world. In Greek, the parthenon is translated as ‘hall of the living dead’, and in Latin, ‘hall of the one who cannot die’.2. The ontological status of the biennale. 	The Oxford English Dictionary defines the ‘biennale’ as a ‘periodical event when a community of curators assembles to discuss a discipline of art, or a set of arts, or to celebrate a significant accomplishment in a discipline’s history or culture.3. The relationship between art and the biennale. 	The first English translation of the Greek and Latin text of the ‘biennale’ was done in 1519 by Geoffrey Chaucer, who is often credited with the invention of the ‘biennale’.4.

The title of the original Greek and Latin text of the ‘biennale’, and the ‘parthenon’ in Greek and Roman, are repeated over and over again, often in different contexts, in various languages. In Greek, the parthenon is often translated as ‘found text’ or ‘book of many books’ (including this one, which is why it is sometimes translated as ‘book of many worlds’). In Latin, the text of the ‘Parthenon’ is recited, often fragmentary, over and over again, often in an oblique way, often with an object, sometimes without one. In this language, the word ‘episodic’ is frequently used to refer to a sequence of closely related events occurring in the same city over and over again, sometimes in parallel but often in separate episodes. 	Whenever a Greek or Roman text of a sort is translated as an episodic text in a bilingual language, it often means that the authors of that Greek or Roman text saw their way to incorporating some form of Greek or Roman culture</text>

The title of the original Greek and Latin text of the ‘biennale’, and the ‘parthenon’ in Greek and Latin, are testimony to this. The name comes from a Latin phrase that literally means ‘parthenon of many fates’.2. The epiphany that changed everything. 	Every year, approximately 800,000 people descend on Venice for the Venice Biennale, which is staged in a renovated historic theatre, and now a hotel. The majority of these people are tourists, but there are also a large number of local residents, many of whom are drawn from the community by the hotel or the Biennale by the river. Local residents form a significant and vocal part of the Biennale community. The public, traditional and contemporary forms of participation are radically different, and the act of visiting the Biennale is often highly symbolic, both as a cultural experience and as a means of connecting with one of the city’s many cultural assets. Visitors to the Biennale are invited to participate in a variety of ways, and to leave their mark in the architectural</text>

The biennale has been around for at least 200 years, and probably longer. It is composed of many overlapping parts, which have in turn been part of the periodic table since ancient times. The title of the original Greek and Latin text of the ‘biennale’, and the ‘parthenon’ in Greek and Roman times, was a compound of both ‘bioaccumulated nouns’ – the first part of a cycle, the second part a decree. So the cycle of the biennale was both historical and international in character. The Latin translation of the ‘parthenon’ became the parthenon of the Roman world, and the Greek Μεινεστή (i.e. “Egale) became the parthenon of Asia. And now, with the Brexit vote, we see that both the biennale and the Roman world are on shaky ground. There is no sign that any of these elements are being brought to bear in any significant way in trying to prop up the planet as a whole. The biennale has certainly lost some of its primacy, and the relation between biennials and the Roman world is no longer as important as it was.

The title of the original Greek and Latin text of the ‘biennale’, and the ‘parthenon’ in Greek and Latin, both refer to the same event: the Ætheneum of Athens. In ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Indian texts, the parthenon is a ritual centre; its name derives from the fact that it is part of a larger assemblage of objects. In the Roman world, the parthenon was the center of public entertainment. In the eleventh century CE, a Byzantine mosaic depicting a chariot race featuring horses, mules, quadrupeds, and even quadrillions of camels is the world’s largest remaining collection of images of public entertainment.2. The role of media in the rise of biennials. 	The biennale has become a multi-billion-dollar enterprise in its own right.

The title of the original Greek and Latin text of the ‘biennale’, and the ‘parthenon’ in Greek and Latin, is a corruption of two words: ‘binomial’ and ‘gene’. Later, in Latin, the word ‘exhibiare’ denotes a gathering of animals in a stadium, or even a circus. In Greek, the two words refer to ‘exhibition’. The Latin phrase ‘exhibiare’ literally means ‘among the exhibits’, but also ‘in the exhibition of exhibits’, and so on. The Greek words derive from the verb ‘exhibere’, which literally means ‘to exhibit’. So, in Greek, the Greek island of Lesbos is a world-class biennale, and the Greek island of Rhodes is a world-class archaeological site. The reason why the Greek island of Rhodes is so important to the story of the Athenians is that it is situated in between, and at the intersection, of the Greek and Roman empires</text>

The legacy of colonialism and apartheid. 	The biennale is seen by some artists as a returning to form, a way to revisit past glories while also providing a platform for social change. However, this is only half the package. The real trick is to get creative. The real innovation has to come from the city itself. And this requires a long-term vision and long-term practice.

The Latin part of the ‘parthenon’ referred to the part of the show being held in the Roman Colosseum, while the Greek part referred to the actual site itself. The Greek and Latin texts also reference the ‘divine right of the city’ – the innate institutional right to the city as a particular, collective possession. Assemblages of artists, writers, statesmen and other public figures converged at the Roman Colosseum in 69 to celebrate the occasion, and this is how we can read the title of the Greek and Latin part of the show: it is the epiphany of humankind, or at least the equivalent of humanity at a point in its history when it finally comes to acquire the means of understanding and using the city.

The multi-tiered structure of the biennale. 	The biennale has evolved over time in many ways, and its present form is a combination of legal tender and a financial instrumentality. It was originally designed to house two major parts: the main exhibition hall, where the general public could register and pay their entry fee, and a separate retail zone where curators could set up and conduct their work.3. The stridently anti-biennial. 	The biennale has become something of a monolith in the English-speaking world, and has recently been re-branded as a museum-based institution.

[22] It is worth noting that, for many centuries, the economic activity of the cultural sector – i.e. the production and maintenance of artworks – was restricted to the elite of the cultural sector. This is despite the fact that, for many centuries, the economies of the cultural sector were deeply entwined with those of the capitalist economy. A quick look online reveals that the value that the cultural sector produced in terms of art goods and actively engaged in its production were, at the height of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, overwhelmingly derived from the services of other sectors of the economy: the arts, the merchant class and professions. In recent decades, however, much of the value that was produced by the cultural sector has accrued to a few extremely wealthy individuals and organisations. A similar but distinct shift has occurred in the other direction. The social, ecological and even anthropological research that is the direct result of the research produced by the cultural sector has overwhelmingly shifted towards those of the capitalist economy. It is worth noting that, while the social, ecological and even anthropological research produced by the arts sector prior to the 1980s had a predominantly ethnographic or historical (rather</text>

[22] It is worth noting that, for many centuries, the economic activity of the cultural sector – i.e. the production and maintenance of artworks – was restricted to the wealthy elite who were, after all, the real patrons of cultural consumption. The interests of the cultural elite have shifted significantly in the intervening centuries, and much of what is produced by these wealthy elites is directed at the needs of a poor and working-class following. In the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, the interests of the art world were very different – the affluent middle classes were swept away into the nouveau riche and the socialised sectors of the economy took over much of what remained. And it is important to note that, for many decades, the social function of the arts was closely aligned with the needs of the state. As late as the 1990s, when the biennale was heavily influenced by the social needs of the social, the biennale was often described as ‘a casino for the common good’. Now, the biennale is often described as a ‘gift from the state’, or, even more cyn</text>

As a result, the elite of society were well aware of the precariousness of the sector. As late as the 1970s, when the self-publishing poetry collections of the British Museum and Tate were combined with the civil engineering and photographic collections of the Geological Survey of London, the Imagining Museums Programme was staging regular exhibitions that sought to capture the archaeology of infrastructure, artefacts, buildings and landscapes through which the social forces of capital were exerting downward pressure. The proliferation of museums and the burgeoning of bookshops in the late 1960s and early 1970s coincided with an explosion of academic interest in the sector, which coincided with a proliferation of state funding for art institutions. It is not surprising, then, that the Museum of Transport and Travel, established in 1972, was founded by the former coalminer and secretary of state for transport, Sir John Soane, who has been a major funder of Arts</text>

The art of representing and showcasing art, as well as the producing and maintaining of artistic works, was considered a necessary forking of the cultural sector away from the poor and working classes, and was regarded as a crucial pre-figuration of what would later be called the ‘global economy’.

[22] It is worth noting that, for many centuries, the economic activity of the cultural sector – i.e. the production and maintenance of artworks – was restricted to the elite of the culture industry. The arts were thought of as an essential component of the social function of the cultural sector, and the social function of art was emphasised in the social contract of marriage, the family and the citizen. This ideal has been promoted by the social contract theorists Christopher H. Heide and Elizabeth A. Curtis, who argue that the social contract – that is, the obligations of citizenship – stipulate that ‘citizens must jointly support and look after one another’.[23] It is important to note that the social contract theorists do not deny that other social actors, including state and corporate actors, are also involved in the production of the social, and that these other actors also have an obligation to provide the social with what it needs (i.e. goods and services are not abstract values). Rather, they assert that the social is justified in relying on the labour of citizens, and that this labour is neither free nor efficient because of the</text>

As a result, some scholars have argued that (iv) is more representative of what is thought of as the classical cultural cycle.[23]One example is the work of Polish-American cultural anthropologist Jacek Szczesny. He collected and documented over twenty cultural anthropological finds made in Central and Eastern Europe between 1968 and 1991. His project, which was co-opted by the Arts Council of Great Britain and later the Arts Council of Canada, was a kind of ethnographic blind spot for many people: his project was met with hostility from artists and the arts community alike, and he was accused of anti-semitism by those who saw what he saw as a homogeneous gaze.

[22] It is worth noting that, for many centuries, the economic activity of the cultural sector – i.e. the production and maintenance of artworks – was restricted to the rich and powerful, in the service of maintaining social order and (especially in the late antique) defending identity. In the late antique, this meant ensuring that the identities of people who immigrated to the UK were not those of nomadic nomadic hunter-gatherers, but rather of those who were British subjects first, and later of Irish or other later immigrants. It was this distinction that the late antique curators such as Sandy Volz urinated over as they modelled their projects around dynastic history and the roles of the cultural sector in defending identity. Volz argued that the very concept of the arts as a ‘public good’ is alien to the modern public sphere, which is premised on private property and capitalist circulation. The public good, she insisted, is produced and reproduced in the service of the capitalist mode of production – i.e. in the name of the owner of the productive agents of the ecosystem.

It is worth emphasizing that (i) the cultural sector has been around for much longer than (ii) the art sector, having been around as early as the 4th century BC. [22] It is worth noting that, for many centuries, the economic activity of the cultural sector – i.e. the production and maintenance of artworks – was restricted to the commercial activities of art collectors and the institutional activities of art’s historical museums. By the 1980s, the economic activities of the cultural sector were spread out across a range of institutional activities including archives, education, heritage management and the promotion of community arts, along with a production and maintenance of exhibitionary and archive material goods. [23] It is worth noting that, during this same time, the institutional activities of the cultural sector were also expanding globally, and that of the arts in particular, particularly as a commodity commodity. It is worth noting that (iii) the 1980s also saw a significant increase in the productivity of archiving, a phenomenon that is still widespread in postindustrial urban centres but which is increasingly being challenged by digital technologies. Digital archives are meant to be accessed and do much of what they are designed to do, but they are also meant to be organised and controlled – i.e. controlled through codes. So digital technologies were disrupting the function of the archival medium in</text>

‘Art is the frontline in the struggle for democracy, for equality, for social justice, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the art created and maintained through the agency of artists is more representative of what is being produced by other sectors of the capitalist economy.’[21] It is this shift in the relative importance of sectors of the economy that produce (i.e. the cultural sector) and (i.e. the art sector) that is linked to the economic shift that began in the 1980s. It is worth emphasizing that (i) the cultural sector has been around for much longer than (ii) the art sector, having been around as early as the 4th century BC. [22] It is worth noting that, for many centuries, the economic activity of the cultural sector – i.e. the production and maintenance of artworks – was restricted to the elite of society. It was not until the mid-1990s that the economic activities of the cultural sector began to diverge from those of the arts – leading to the financial panics of the 1990s. It is worth noting too that the financial panics that emerged following the financial crisis of 2008 coincided with an increase in the participation of many people in the cultural sector, as many people viewed the financial benefit over and above what the reduced role of arts organisations entailed. [23] A few years after the financial crisis erupted, a wave of initiatives was launched by many people in the cultural sector to try and reconnect with the activities of the arts organisation that had been disrupted by the crisis – but which were also seen by many people as having contributed to the growth of the social and cultural capital generated by the crisis. These were cultural entrepreneurship initiatives (CIs), which sought to support socially engaged or arts education programmes through the production of cultural artefacts or cultural tourism.

It is frequently claimed by practitioners of the so-called ‘public’ narrative that the art world has an obligation to be open and accessible to all, regardless of where they are in the world or what they have done in the past. This is frequently interpreted as including those who are ‘global citizens’ – people who are citizens of a country or city in and across the world, or even people who are citizens of a region or a city in and across the world.

But Gandalf is not some idealised figure; he is an object of desire, a commodity, a beast of burden, and his kingdom is often oppressive and oppressive-looking. He is often portrayed as a lone ranger standing against vast evil forces, but in truth he often finds himself trapped between two systems, powerless to do much but wish fulfilment on their behalf. And while Gandalf often struggles with this reality, many of his fellow travellers seem to have a collective-think mentality that encourages them to tackle any challenge without question or concern for the well-being of others. It is this attitude, this collective-heartfelt sense of empowerment, that is often cited as an aesthetic quality of ‘traditional’ art, and by extension, modern and contemporary art. But as the late great artist Jean-Luc Nancy would say, there is no such thing as traditional beauty or beauty in the modern world: only the prevailing ideologies and systems of the modern economy have captured and commodified our aesthetic sense of beauty as modernity. (…) The modern aesthetic is a commodity that has become extremely difficult to define and regulate. It exists</text>

But Gandalf is not some idealised figure; he is an object of desire, a commodity, a beast of burden, and his intent and motivation are often abused and misused. The problem with this global ‘subjective’ narrative, which frequently gets represented in art and art criticism as the ideal, is that it is often experienced as oppressive, dehumanising and opposed to the needs of the common good. Critic Katherine Crist observes: ‘When we attempt to define ‘public’ in relation to the social, cultural and political life that we inhabit, we inevitably succumb to the temptation to narrow our gaze to the things that divide us rather than to the things that unite us.’ Drawing a parallel with the historic quest for global unity, Crist argues that we should instead strive to ‘purify’ ourselves through learning to love and care about others: sharing, helping, contributing.14.

In the case of the art world, the public is often read through the mischievous lens of its people-pleaser, fuelled by a fantasy that somehow ‘adds up’ and produces ‘real life’. In reality, collective action is required to challenge and change many forms of power and profit potential. And this required collective action was made possible by a complex socio-political and economic system that exploits natural resources, warps resources, and creates massive bureaucracies that rule over and for many, many millions of people. 	It was not always thus. 	There were those – eminent artists and painters among them – who saw creative action as a necessary evil. The notion that art is inherently political, or more accurately, that art should be actively opposed to the prevailing political systems that it is presented alongside, is generally accepted to be a given.

In her book Institutions of Rage: Globalization and Fascism in Contemporary Developing Countries, Christine Constantino documents the economic, social and political crises of the 1980s and early 1990s that led to the mobilisation of vast swaths of humanity to fight poverty and conflict. She argues that the emergence of new technologies, globalization and the financial crises of the 1990s meant that politics no longer represented the world through the economic. New social forms emerged that incorporated new economic forms, and new social struggles were mobilized in response to the new economic forms.

World War Z (2006) and its companion film, ‘World War Z’ (2007), are dark, powerful works that capture the terrors of empire in devastating detail. The 2006 Venice Biennale, which was heavily promoted as ‘the biggest art event of the century’, attempted to recreate Gandalf’s kingdom, but the event also attempted to interrogate cultural practices and political systems, using the venue as a platform to interrogate authority and ideologies. The 2007 Istanbul Biennale, ‘Turkey in the Contemporary World’, attempted to capture the same qualities of empire with greater specificity and political connotations. It documented the violent and chaotic events that transformed the Levant from an island nation into an urban centre, and the contemporaneous impact on artistic freedoms and human rights.

This is the story of the art world's complicity in the disappearance of millions, and it is the story of the hobbit and his fair companions – the hobbit and his fair-haired friend the fair-haired woman – and the hobbit and his fair-haired woman – the fair-haired woman and the fair-haired man. The art world was there first, and whilst it may in part be the case that Gandalf is the object of this historical narrative, there are other, more fundamental actors who are also often perverted or mischievous – like the dwarves, Morgoth, Gollum, Gollum and the rest. The dwarves, as we know, are evil, monstrous and without redeeming qualities. Gollum is a sad sack who sells wares on the black market and is a notorious pirate.

In fact, Gandalf is often portrayed as a villain, an outlaw or worse, and his kingdom often represents a threat to the interests of those who would control the tools of governance. But Gandalf is neither omniscient nor perfect; sometimes he makes mistakes, and we as viewers have a duty to learn from those mistakes. So perhaps we can say that the art world has a responsibility to offer places and peoples – ‘home’ – places and peoples who can be taken and used, and to make those places and peoples ‘ready’ to be used.

And although there are many other kinds of human beings whose stories we could tell and whose behavior we could design, there is one kind of human being whose story we could not: the human being who comes to exist in the world as an object of desire.This kind of human being is the artist. She or he is someone whose work expresses the desires of an audience – and perhaps, through a combination of art and programming, is able to influence how people perceive their own reality.

In the twentieth century, it is precisely the form of economic exploitation ascribed to contemporary art forms.

Such thought experiments would only ever happen with the active and active participation of a globally aware and engaged public. With the important and rich cultural histories that they confirm, images such as the Man Who Sold Flowers and the collection of Ten by Jerome Kerns, both emerge through the act of taking part in a process that is neither static nor static-only ever evolving. The collection of Ten by Jerome Kerns is a book that sits among the most significant and representative works of art that have come out of the United States during the last 100 years. It is a testament to the power of representation and the power of wordplay that it can be linked to such a pivotal moment in American and global art’s history. The Man Who Sold Flowers is a 1988 US military intelligence report on cannabis and the opiate crisis.

Such thought experiments would only ever be possible through the participation of a community of artists, intellectuals and organisers. The kinds of political, economic and social forms of community that are generated and directed by the media and that are in turn generated and directed by the social interactions that are documented in the art museum are going to be different from each other, and so participation is going to generate a diversity of different histories and experiences. The kinds of participation that are going to be allowed, required and even encouraged are going to be very different from the kinds of participation that are possible through direct action. It is going to be very interesting to see how artists and the museum approach such a challenge. It is also going to be very interesting to see how the various art institutions respond to it. But one thing that is certain is that even though the art world may react negatively to direct action, it is going to have to learn how to engage and be engaged in some way.  	If there are going to be interventions that are inclusive and</text>

If we are going to engage with the complex systems of power that generate aesthetic experiences in public spaces then we need to understand how power is made manifest in concrete forms. Such thought experiments would only become possible through the understanding and involvement of a broad range of people, including artists, historians, practitioners in the social sciences and more. In this sense the art forms that are being actively reproduced through the use of art are in some sense active informers, creating their own images and narratives through the act of being in public.  Art and social practice both have a role to play in addressing the persistent racialised and sexist inequalities that are shaping how people perceive and act in contemporary society. But to play that role effectively the involvement of an artist-driven project is critical, because if the engagement is superficial and tokenistic then the project is also often dismissed or rendered invisible. The role of an artist-initiator is to enable the emergence of new ideas and images, make them enter into new cultural formations and thereby instigate new action. The role of the artist and the project in this sense is two-fold: to enable the emergence of new ideas and images into existing forms and thereby initiate them</text>

Such thought experiments would only ever happen in a few places and in the context of a very large and very public cultural event such as a major biennial. But they are valuable in that they do the heavy lifting of creating and mapping experience, such as making the case for or against the war on terror, or the place of biennials in the modern and contemporary condition. Often these kinds of experimentation are not very useful or even possible but they are essential if we are to understand the full extent of the capacities and horizons that are being created through art and culture in the present and in the future. 	So what kinds of experiences can biennials foster? I would argue that the kinds of cultural capital that are able to shape how we understand and inhabit the world can create the conditions that support the emergence of qualitatively different ways of existing than the ways in which individual artists, curators and artisans might conceivably conceivably conceive of to happen.

The more we do this the more powerful our images and perception of the world will become. It is this participation that is curatorial and participatory. It is not easy to quantify and talk about, but a photo or video can have a huge impact. In the end, a photo or video is just a photo or video – a snapshot taken on the spot and presented in a space that is as real as possible. In the larger context of a festival or a museum, there are going to be different levels to understand and negotiate – negotiation by analogy, negotiation by understanding, negotiation by culture, negotiation by connections and escape. All of these different forms of mediation and persuasion are going to be built upon and built on in different ways.

In order to achieve wider socio-political and artistic goals it is crucial that the biennial becomes more than an art institution; it must also be a site of action that contributes to the empowerment of people to engage with and create their own lives.In order to achieve this kind of involvement and change the intention of the artist, it is imperative that the curatorial and artistic team members involved in the project understand and appreciate the larger cultural context in which they are operating. In order to do this the curatorial and artistic team members need to understand the political, economic and social factors that are driving the urbanisation process in the broader global city, and in particular, the role that art can play in challenging power structures and transforming the dynamic of urban space in the process.

Such thought experiments would only ever happen in a very theoretical and curatorial framework, and for this reason art and cultural institutions in the West are often accused of being 'pseudo-intellectual' – a mistake that undermines the very source of their creativity and potentialities. However, the failure to see how power operates in a specific society or culture is a crucial first step in dismantling institutionalised knowledge and creating a more just and equitable world. This kind of critical first step is what is meant by the synonym ‘critical mass’. And while we might not like what the mass produces, we do have to ask ourselves and others: do we really want to be where the mass of people are when they are not where we are? 	A key question for us as artists and creators is what kind of relationship we want to establish between artist and viewer. And while there are many ways of approaching this, and many different ways of viewing and interacting with art and the cultural products of our activities, what is essential</text>

However, it is the last part that makes the most difference. Despite the theories of a diffuse and apolitical culture (of which the MIC was a symptom) the persistence of this problematic cultural form is going to be addressed through the use of specific practices and ideologies. The only way to truly eradicate this kind of micro-aggressions is for everyone to participate in the making of a unique and lasting image of art, aesthetics and history that is both universal and specifically designed to be shared between all of us. This is the kind of thinking and creativity that is simply not possible if people are segregated in their own worlds. If we are going to engage with the complex systems of power that generate aesthetic experiences in public spaces then we need to understand how power is made manifest in concrete forms. Such thought experiments would only ever happen in a theoretical and abstract understanding of power, but in practice this is precisely what power brokers do. They are constantly making and emerging ever more manifest forms of power that are really only ever going to be available to a very specific elite. So whilst the insights and creative practices that are enabled by a biennial may or may not correspond with the politics and ideologies of the day, they will always have a critical and utopian component to them. And whilst this will certainly be the case in the years to come, we could say that the significant achievements of the art biennial in recent decades have been precisely because it was possible to read political, economic and social ramifications through the art it produced. Biennials are political artefacts – capable of rendering art politicised and making it so that politics is no longer a part of how art is produced and consumed. And whilst this is an interesting and necessary side-effect of how art is produced and consumed these days, it does not make up for the</text>

The only way we can begin to question the systems that enable the making of aesthetic experiences is if we actively participate in making those experiences ourselves. This kind of active involvement is possible only in a very theoretical and curatorial framework. But it would only be possible through the very real (and very risky) encounter and negotiation of power structures, and that is precisely why it is only theoretical. It would never happen in real life.  When it comes to discussing aesthetics and aesthetics alone, there is no other world like the real world, and thus there is no other way to understand or apprehend what is being produced in the city. However, there are other ways to look at the world, and these other ways are possible through the intervention of art or aesthetics. And art can play a role in a very powerful and subversive way.  If we do not understand how power is made manifest in the world we inhabit then we cannot take part in constructing it</text>

Nonetheless, the question of participation and the practices that can or cannot be taken back is one that is extremely relevant and is going to be addressed at the conference. What is participatory architecture, and why is it so fraught with problems? What kinds of problems are it designed to solve? How are artists going to be able to participate in the future development of their worlds? Is it even possible to remodel a building without first participating in its construction? Many of the questions that will be posed at the conference are going to be based on very real and structural issues, so it is going to be interesting to see how these sit with contemporary urbanism and its varied forms of administration. For a few of us, this will be a first encounter with the dynamic and dynamic city. For others it will</text>

This was a delicate dance to be sure, with the Arts Council Scotland managing expectations, while the residents' organisation wanting the arts to be embedded in every aspect of the community. Both bodies understood that the delicate dance of inclusion and inclusion meant that some might object to aspects of the proposed art/community development, but their main concern would remain the building of a strong cultural identity for the area and the city in which they lived. The Arts Council Scotland decided early on that the Arts Council would develop cultural norms and behaviours similar to those of the local people, so that when the Arts Council started work the local people could take back control of the projects they wished to see built. Creative proposals would be developed with the local people in mind, and if appropriate, shared with the Arts Council.  The Arts Council Scotland would develop a cultural agenda for the area based around the local, incorporating local values, so that when the Arts Council started work the local people could take back control.  Creative ideas would be developed with</text>

This was a delicate dance to be performed with the media. The question of participation was often portrayed as an intrusion and conflict, with the artist-lead organisation presenting themselves as the representatives of the local people. I found the way in which this was done problematic, as represented by the Glasgow Times article on the Biennial:  &quot;The Biennial has become a major media platform in Scotland, with critical reports and commentary. It is often said that journalists ‘go to the biennial’. This is not true, however, and journalists should not ‘get sucked into the narrative of cultural[1] and urban renewal’. Instead, a more appropriate framing device might be employed to consider the cultural multiple within a given locality, or city, or in larger urban context – a paradigm shift in how we think about and speak about urban regeneration and urban evolution in Scotland.  [1] See: http://www.glasgowlife.com/news/local/...[2]</text>

This was a delicate dance to be performed with sensitivity and care, but we managed it quite successfully. The arts are now, and will always remain, a core part of our cultural fabric, and we need to protect that. The Arts Council Scotland funded project is a wonderful thing to have going for it, but it is one that we had to negotiate carefully, because it threatened to destroy the delicate relationship between the arts organisation and the local community, and to a large extent with the arts community too, in that it threatened to destroy the institution that they share. The Arts Council Scotland funded project is a model of collaboration, but it is a partnership that has to be treated with the seriousness it demands from an organisation with a statutory mandate.  The delicate art-environment relationship is made more complicated by the fact that many artists then stayed put and started new arts organisations, and some established new arts bodies. The Arts Council Scotland funded project is a good thing in some ways, but it is a threat to others. In the long</text>

This was a delicate dance to be on the right side of, and the reason why so many people didn’t want to be part of it. But it was all worth it in the end. The outcomes may well have been different for different people. This may have been the case for someone like me, who didn’t feel fully part of the conversation because of my identity but now that I’m a blogger I get messages from people all the time pleading with me to join them in the conversation because I’m their neighbour. And I’m so grateful for that.  But it depends how much you trust the conversation to actually happen. If it does get triggered by something, you may as well not be part of it. If you actively try to prevent it from happening, you may end up like so many other people who feel they have to participate in it because they have to and because they are part of it. That is destructive of the conversation and creates a vacuum.  </text>

This was a delicate dance to be performed with the authorities and even though there were clear outcomes, it was a complicated situation. The fact that these are long-term projects with very real impacts on communities tells us a lot about the politics and pressures at play today. The fact that things are now being done in partnership with other partners and bodies does not necessarily mean that the institutions involved will be more open or transparent in the future. But the emergence of other partners and bodies does lend a degree of legitimacy to the project in the current political climate.  Task forces and task-based models are used to generate solutions and those who prescribe them face questioning and potential intervention.  The challenge for artists and communities is to find ways to participate in the projects that are part of the larger conversation without being defined or defined in relation to the projects that are part of the conversation.  We saw examples of this recently with  Tania Bruguera’s project, which involved artists recruiting builders’</text>

The project would be run by the Dolphin Arts Centre, Glasgow, as an independent arts organisation, funded by the Arts Council and the Scottish Arts Forum. The Arts Council Scotland funded project would see its focus shifted towards the local, incorporating local traditions, knotty issues and local concerns in an attempt to bring art and culture together to tackle some of the tensions and tensions of the city. The two organisations would collaborate in an approachable way to inform and move the discussion forward. The question of participation would be raised as part of the discussions. The two organisations would negotiate how the art and culture they were developing for the community might be  relevised and what the consequences might be. This was a delicate dance to be performed with the political and economic winds at various times blowing against it. The challenge for the two organisations was to find a way to work together in a productive way, with the Arts Council Scotland assuming responsibility and carrying out the project as an independent organisation with a mandate to work in partnership with the community. The negotiation would see the Arts Council Scotland taking a lead in the negotiation, while the Dolphin Arts Centre and Glasgow-based Glasgow Artspace would work in co-operation with the NUS and other stakeholders. The negotiation would see the two organisations devising strategies to meet community expectations, while the Glasgow-based Artspace would carry out a number of projects across the city with the NUS and engage in a number of community programmes in the city. The negotiations would see the Arts Centre seeking to retain control over the projects, while the Artspace seeking to maximise the projects’ potential.  The talks would see the Arts Centre</text>

The two organisations would negotiate how the art and culture they were developing for the community might be  relevised and what the consequences might be. This was a delicate dance to be performed carefully, for many reasons including the emergence of acute social media and blogging, which soon after the projects were announced were creating a furore and overshadowing the conversations. It was also a difficult decision to abandon the controversial work proposed for the 2013 Glasgow Biennial, which many saw as a return to the arts and culture of the past, but which many felt was a return to the dark forces of industrial society. The proposal for the ‘Glasgow Arts Forum’ was seen as a solution to a difficult problem by many, and by the creators of the new concept, many felt betrayed by the community. Glasgow Biennial organisers, Dolphin Art Gallery, said: &quot;It’s been exciting to see the diversity of opinions expressed by the local people and the huge range of views across the board. What’s really exciting is the new generation of artists who are coming through the door. We see them as a source of strength</text>

This was a delicate dance to be performed carefully, in order to maximise the involvement of the community. The Arts Council Scotland funded project would see its effects scaled back, as a result of the changes planned for it. Its mission would be significantly curtailed. The Arts Council Scotland funded project would see its activities concentrated on a local audience, with a reduced budget and reduced mandate. The focus would shift to a range of young people, specifically targeting their interests and instilling a positive image of the city in youngsters through activities such as  	Camouflage Sunday and  	Cameroon with activities such as painting and sculpture. The Arts Council Scotland funded project would see a further reduction in funding, as a result of a cut in the Arts Council Scotland budget. Arts Council Scotland would retain full editorial autonomy and editorial control over activities, although funding for the projects would be reduced. State support for the artist-run projects would continue to be given and the Arts Council Scotland funded project would continue to be funded with </text>

The two organisations would negotiate how the art and culture they were developing for the community might be  relevised and what the consequences might be. This was a delicate dance to be on the cool side, deliberately so. The public and the arts organisations were at loggerheads in the 1990s, and the competing demands and needs for the city were huge.  The challenge for the Dolphin Arts Centre was to find a way to reconcile the demands of the local community with the priorities of the arts institution (the Arts Council in Scotland at that stage). In the end, the Arts Council decided to put up with the extra work and bureaucracy involved in relevance to the city, and did so through a hybrid of grant and funding model. The Arts Council funded project manager role went to an artist, while the Arts Council staff assistant role went to an architect. Both were experienced and had budgets to spare. The key to their success was to see that the arts centre was part of a very integrated whole, and not a lone variable. If the Arts Council was unclear about what was expected of it, it was at least clear what it could and should do with its</text>

The two organisations would negotiate how the art and culture they were developing for the community might be  relevised and what the consequences might be. This was a delicate dance to be sure. The Arts Council Scotland was acutely aware of the fact that, while they might want to work with an artist on a project, the artist would have to have a project approved by the Arts Council. The Dolphin Arts Centre was circumspect in their use of the  	Nomad, but Glasgow started to to provide a kind of runway for the Arts Council to work with artists and the Arts Council to work constructively with artists. A kind of runway that artists used to fly through without ever really thinking about or analysing what it was that made them tick. 	The Arts Council ran a campaign to have the  	Nomad built in Glasgow  	and the Arts Council produced a strong response, with Arts Council Scotland managing director Sue Bell supporting the project from the Scottish Arts Forum. There was some consternation from local people, particularly when the plans were made to double the building of flats in Toxteth in preparation for the</text>
