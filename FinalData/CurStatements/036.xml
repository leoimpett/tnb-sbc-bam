It was inspired by the book ‘The Bottleneck: Developing Economies Beyond Petroleum’, by Nitin Gadkari and Peter Weibel. Drawing directly on the film, the artists sought to expose the systemic and historical injustices of economic capitalism while also advocating new technological solutions. Their film is a powerful but flawed indictment of the ways in which energy and resources are employed today, but it is also a manifesto for a future where resources are no longer needed in the manner in which they are.In their manifesto, the artists make a case for a ‘world without borders’, one in which people create and control their own destinies. ‘Borders’ are built into the fabric of the global economy, but how we define and navigate them is still deeply imb</text>

The film is an allegory for the technologies of empire: technology gives the appearance of freedom, but upon closer inspection, absolute control is exerted over the means of production and circulation. The film then proceeds to show the direct effects of this technology, presenting the dark side of the liberating potentialities of technology.The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh (who directed the 2015 film Argo) and stars Jane Levy, Oscar Isaac, Max Martin, Oscar Holter and Henry Walter.

The film is the story of three voyages in the Pacific, beginning with the fateful night in 2014 when a Hawaiian monk named Kit Haringe accidentally unsure how to use a telescope. The discovery and exploration of the mysterious universe he calls ‘the Land of Ostrich’ leads Haringe and his fellow explorers on a series of nightmarish expeditions, which include kidnapping, torturing and ultimately killing the stork. Through it all, they stay out of sight while plotting their next move. Emboldened by the power of what they think is knowledge, these characters grow increasingly arrogant and treacherous as the film shows them how far they can push the boundaries of human perception.

It is the story of an epic 1980s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that killed over 11,000 whales, dolphins and porpoises, as well as the role that those creatures played in the economic and political decisions that transformed our cities. 	Unravelled is the story of four ships that mysteriously ended up in the Gulf, and the economic impacts that resulted. The shapes and sizes of each ship have been exaggerated in the film, but given the amount of oil that was spilled and the massive amounts of debris that were cleared from the ocean floor, the ship sizes that were portrayed in the film are quite realistic.

It was co-written by Green and Oscar Isaac, and draws on extensive research into the topic. The book details the physical destruction caused by climate change, and the social and political fallout. It also identifies key players in the global extraction of tar sands bitumen, and the role those companies may play in the future of the planet. The fossil fuels that power the global economy are overwhelmingly owned by a few large corporations, and as a result the vast majority of people don’t have a say in how those corporations use the planet. 	Green and Isaac’s research focuses on three key locations: oil refineries in North Dakota, tar sands extraction sites in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the international fossil-fuel giant ExxonMobil. At the intersection of those three places, they identify three main themes that pervade the landscape: greed, colonialism and dehumanising</text>

Rockefeller’s interest in the natural world and in the aestheticisation of it is well documented; his brother Max established the Standard Oil Company. The Standard Oil Company was a major player in the American market during the nineteenth century, and the Standard’s stock price fluctuated wildly, characterised by periods of profitable growth and periods of crippling decline. Even before then, the company’s executives knew that market forces could be used to push back against potential economic oblivion.In 1887, the Rockefeller brothers established a second home for Martin, Max and other prominent American industrialists in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

In the film, a collection of objects left Libya in 2015 and traveled to California in order to be smuggled across the California-Oregon border. As the objects become increasingly distended, a series of armed men attempt to force their way into the Home Tourist Information Bureau and take over the tour. As the film shows, the government has a role to play, but in order to prevent this happening again, a coalition of activists must be formed.Based in Santa Monica, California, FACT is a national grassroots organization dedicated to informing tourists and visiting artists about the risks and vulnerabilities of the region and the world through informative narratives in newspapers, magazines, online and in theater.

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for the neighbourhood to be able to move forward, we need to know what the other side of the art/housing equation looks like. If we don’t know what the other side of the equation is, we’ll never be able to move forward. So we need to be able to see the connections between the different art/housing agencies we work with and the different projects we’ve got going on. We also need to be able to see what the impact is going to be on the ground level, because the side that builds up the momentum can have a really big impact. When the ground is level, projects like this one can happen.Art has a way of waking us up when we’re asleep. It’s like waking up from a nightmare. It’s as though the art/housing agency is saying, ‘Hey, this is a possibility. You’re not alone.’ If we don’t act now</text>

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for the Arts Council to do anything positive in that situation, the problem has to be addressed. The only way to address it is for the whole community to participate in creating a solution. I don’t think the Arts Council has the capacity or the will to do that. So what the community can do is to create awareness of the crisis in our neighbourhood, and of course, the Arts Council doesn’t like that. So there is an understanding that the Arts Council will no longer be involved in generating awareness of the issue. The community has to work with the Arts Council to find an alternative.I think that the important thing is that the inhabitants of our neighbourhood and the whole community want to participate in this. The Arts Council needs to be engaged because otherwise the whole scheme will fail. The Arts Council needs to be engaged because otherwise the whole scheme will fail.

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for the neighbourhood to be able to recover, we need to know what we’re contributing to the housing crisis. So we’re contributing to the art by creating social opportunities for the neighbourhood. The problem with the past is that we don’t assign a role to artists and the arts anymore. There’s only so much art can do in a community setting, and the community can’t really declare itself as an artist group. There’s still a tendency for the artist to project his or her art onto the community, but that’s just creating a different kind of art. What the community could do is, say, ‘design’ projects that bring art and design to bear on a specific project, and then implement that project’s outcome through participatory action. That would open up a whole host of creative possibilities, including things like workshops led by artists and architects, or even just the building of a community’s worth</text>

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for the art to be of any real value, the housing crisis must be solved. But if the housing crisis isn’t solved, then what is the point of the art? Art has a particular place in this equation because it is a mediation tool. It can’t solve the crisis on its own. The art has to be able to set in motion projects that will have a measurable impact. But that’s what the transmission program is about. Art has a particular place in this equation because it is a mediator of impact. It can’t create its own impact, but it can nonetheless adapt and implement innovative measures to achieve a desired result. For example, the art project in the neighborhood may provide affordable housing to low-income households, but what comes out of it is actually the opposite: art that serves as a prop to rally around and a stark contrast to the homelessness of the majority of our community. This is what happens when we neglect to monitor and control</text>

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for the neighbourhood to be able to recover from the crisis, we need to be able to say, ‘Enough is enough. We want a plan B. We don’t want to wait for the Housing Market Renewal Initiative to come through and put housing back on the map. We need action now.’ The Transmission’s goal is to help put housing back on the map. So our plan B has to be something that produces tangible results. That’s what real action is made into projects. And that’s what real change looks like.Action without precedent is action-making-without-precedence. Action without precedent is just planning-without-planning. Action without precedent is what real change looks like. And that’s exactly what art projects do.They set precedent by breaking the old ways. That’s what real action-making looks like.Action without precedent is what real art projects do.</text>

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for the neighbourhood to be able to benefit from the art, we need to all be involved in the project from the beginning. We need to know what we are doing is the right thing. We have to all agree on what we are getting out of the project. I don’t think the neighbourhood has that kind of influence or that kind of capacity. In fact, the neighbourhood doesn’t seem to be interested in learning how to do things themselves. They like the art but they don’t need to know how to use it. They just want to know what is being done. That’s why local artists have such an impact. They don’t want to know what they have to do to achieve a reaction. They want to know what they are actually doing. If the reaction is too quick and the art is affected then the art suffers, but if the reaction is slow and the art is protected then the reaction is great. That is, the art has</text>

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for that to happen, we have to all get involved. The only way to solve the crisis is for the government to step in and finance the whole thing. But the neighbourhood has an agreement with the city: they’re providing half of the cost, which means the full impact can’t be provided by the city. The agreement also stipulates that the artists have to provide half the monthly budget. So the artists have an obligation to all of us: them, the city, the region and the region’s citizens. If the artist doesn’t take part in the project, then the city is left holding the bag. This is what happened with Transmission: the artist wasn’t keen on the whole vernacular aspect of things, and the city was split on whether to fund it. Art was also uncomfortable with the idea of a public gallery: it didn’t feel 'transparent', ‘a public space’. Art was</text>

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for that to happen, the neighbourhood has to change. The intention has to change. That was my point of departure when I started Transmission: that the bigger the change the better. The more people involved, the more impact there has to be. Then there has to be a change in intent, because otherwise the art is just another tool in the toolkit of the housing market. Like any other tool, it’s used in a certain context and at a certain level. But that process is ‘only possible’ because the intention has to change. Otherwise, what’s the point? Art has an agenda, and the larger the project the better its agenda. But that agenda only becomes apparent once the intention has changed. If the change comes too late, or is accompanied by negative consequences, the impact can still be significant. That was my whole point when I started: that it’s art’s job to push the system to change. The fact</text>

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order for that to happen, we have to start thinking about ways to contribute to it. That’s why the Transmission project is so important. It gives the community a stake in the project that it can voice its concerns and ask for changes.Art has a way of waking us up when we don’t know what to do. When we don’t know what to do, we are more susceptible to the negative impacts of projects weÂre not part of. In fact, it’s the opposite: Art and the community are meant to be in harmony. If the Community Arts community is to have any real power, it must be empowered to take matters of the neighbourhood back into its own hands.Art has a way of waking us up to opportunities when we lack the power and the will. It has to be done with words and not mediated through images. For example, take Curtis Godwin’s Beauty Beside You,</text>

For example, the art we have to do with housing is contributing to a housing crisis in our neighbourhood. In order to make a real difference, we have to start thinking about alternatives to stay in the neighbourhood, and creating awareness of those alternatives. That’s why awareness campaigns like the Transmission’s are so powerful. They’re not about the art being told a story or a premise, but the art having an intention that other artists, community groups and others can build on and take further.Art has a way of waking people up.  And Transmission does exactly that. In Episode One of Transmission, I recall a young woman’s aspiration to one day be a homemaker. Her father, who is a labourer, doesn’t want her to go into the art world, but she’s got a whole career ahead of her. She calls it ‘making the world a better place’.Her ambition is ambitious, but her approach is bold. She calls it ‘home-building’ and she’s absolutely right.</text>

The former, pure and simple, seeks out and creates enduring patterns through which we can organize and compartmentalizes the diverse forms of experience generated by our world; the latter seeks out and consumes the art and imagery that are produced in the world around us and brings about a condition of nostalgia.  One can adopt a range of other design-logic design terms – ‘conservationism’, for instance – but the overarching idea is the same.  Art has a ‘resourceful classifier’ that locates and identifies resources in the world around us, and so the ecological fallacy implicit in the word ‘survival of the fittest’ is fundamentally undermined.  Art, by its own constant redefinition, makes it possible to produce infinite amounts of  environmentally benign ways of organizing and compartmentalizing</text>

But the real-life 𝚜osiness of the art 𝚤objective world’ – which is to say, the reality of its historical and contemporary condition-relevant features – hinders our ability to perceive the dynamics of the art/culture interface. The art world has several strategies at working against the overproduction of art, including outright hostility, institutional counteracting factors, and even wars. But the real-life interface has its own logic and social forces that render the art object overproduction unworkable. It is, in other words, the clash of many real-life objects against a backdrop of perceived social injustice. The real-life interface is a production line that cannot be ignored or ignored. It is the terrain of resistance and its battle lines are not whitewashed or neatly drawn. Real life objects and the social relations that they generate are constantly in motion. And so we can identify and point to the successes and failures of various elements within the interface industry, and in the design field generally. For instance, the quest for small screen sizes that are legible, moveable and self-sufficient is a global one. And although Apple’s quest</text>

As the late great Irish artist Niall Ó Muilleoir wrote, when confronted with the prospect of spending years trapped in a box: ‘You “re either with the Box or outside the Box.’1 For Ó Muilleoir, the answer was simple: ‘I’d rather be an elephant than a painting’.2 And so the impulse to make, to adopt, to adopt, to become accustomed to, to live up to, in relation to, and through art, is overwhelming. Society places a great emphasis on the acquisition of knowledge – about art, architecture, history – but what it often fails to teach, or doesn’t teach, is the kind of knowledge needed to handle the enormous amount of art and architectural information that is constantly emerging from the real world.

At the same time, the real-life obsolescence of objects is a much harder problem to diagnose and manage. When, for instance, the art 𝚜objective world sees an art 𝚪objective world’, it is easier to accept and perhaps even love this reality as a fact of the real-life world. ‘Real life’, after all, is more real: people live it every day. But the obsolescence of art objects is a much harder problem to quantify and manage. Real life is inherently subjective and variable, and art objects are no different. Real life is inherently grounded in the past, and art objects, by definition, are future-oriented. So the real-life obsolescence of art objects is a much harder problem to diagnose and manage.

    <text>human behaviour and technology are advancing at such a rate that it is almost impossible to keep up with all of the innovations that are occurring. In an effort to catch up, many in the design field have started to refer to ‘design obsolescence’. This is a catch-all term that can be applied to a range of problems, even though the obsolescence of objects is a much bigger problem in the real-life world of the art world. In the real-life world, people live long lives – perhaps lives that are longer – in consequence of the incredible creative energy that is unleashed by the arts and culture they consume. And so the obsolescence of art objects reflects both the creative energy of the art world as well as the destructive excesses that come from consuming too much of it. But the real-life 𝚜osiness of the art 𝚤objective world’ – which is to say, the reality of its historical and contemporary condition-relevant features – hinders our understanding of the world. The specific factor that contributes to the art 𝚕 irrelevance, whether it is the influence of a major cultural power or the cumulative effects of cultural perversities – is a complex one that is best understood as a social one. The social dimension of obsolescence is the subject of much debate and is further evidenced in the fact that, in the contemporary art world, its presence is often used as a pejorative term. But the social dimension of obsolescence is most clearly seen in the world of fashion. Art is continually reminding us that we are fashioning our very being around the obsolescence of technology. And so we, too, are being reminded of our mortality. Perhaps it is not so much the objects as the contemporaneous condition that is over-embellished, that is under-illustrated or that is in possession of us. Perhaps it is that, in the creative process, we are constantly reminding</text>

If, as some artists and curators are pursuing, a social and cultural relevance is added to the aestheticisation of art 𝚜(and art forms in general), then perhaps it is time to consider what might become of art 𝚤objectives’ should the real-life and ‘design’ object become obsolete?  One could argue that there is a strong evolutionary and ecological justification for what some might call ‘art’ as an occasional and transient form of cultural expression; a reason to preserve what has been considered ‘the art of art’, which can be considered as an irreplaceable record of what is considered to be ‘the art of art’. But there is growing concern that a weakening of the biennial as an institution might have political and social consequences, particularly for culturally diverse cities such as New York and London.

People are more open to the idea of an objectifying cultural parasite like ourselves, since we are able to see that these objects are alive and well in our urban environments, in the real-life and artefact worlds they inhabit. The superabundance of images of art and culture ever-present, and the nomadic, mobile nature of the arts and culture that constantly evolves, constantly manipulates and exploits these environments render us unable to identify with the relatively static and limited selves that are the products of these systems. The intra-art historical/cognitively-stimulating artefactionalism we call the ‘real-life landscape’ – which I discovered during my PhD research when I was tasked with coming up with a list of ‘life-sized’ recreations of some of the city I was visiting in search of a ‘design icon’.

Aesthetics as a Welfarist Constructs the Present In his exploration of the identitarian impulse, S Natarajan (2006) frames the present as a struggle between those who call themselves  	artsapists and those who call themselves artists. And so we see in Natarajan’s account of the art world an echo of another historical impulse, that is in part a revolt against modernity and art being imposed on us by an overwhelming logic of consumer culture. Modern art is a social construct, invented and sustained by the industrial system, and so the revolt against it is an artistic and social rebellion. But the social and aestheticising of the modern art world is a social and political project too, and so the art world and its social formations are in part tools and sideshows of the larger project of modernity itself.

The gut microbiota is a large, dynamic, and changing community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea, or plant and animal bacteria. These diverse communities of bacteria inhabit, live within, and are symbiotic with each other. Therefore, ‘culturomics’ refers to the collective dynamics of a given microbial community, including the interactions among members of that community. The term was coined in the mid 1990s by Claudia Rankin and Neil Johnson of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and is often used as a synonym for ‘corporate ’.1 In recent years, the terms have come to represent converging historical and environmental events – in particular, the oil crises and global environmental changes. For many people, the use of the term has referred to historical parallels or environmental trends, but there are many other uses of the word – cultural, political, economic, even racially (see Box 1).

The gut microbiota is a large, dynamic, and changing community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea, or plant and animal bacteria. The advent of antibiotics and genomics has drastically reduced the need for the continual maintenance of the gut microbiota, which has allowed for a radical shift in the commercial use of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota has become the ~queen’ of the microbiome, and the ~perfection of the gut microbiota~ as a commodity.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68</text>

The gut microbiota is a large, dynamic, and changing community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea, or plant and animal bacteria. The rapid technological advancement that characterises our urban and urban-industrial contexts, coupled with the inefficiency with which our immune systems can cope with the increasing complexity and strains of the world around us, has profoundly influenced our ecological circumstances and is shaping up to be a game-changer. But what is now considered ‘civilizational transformation’ – the sweeping changes that are being made in the world of design, architecture, media, product and product design – is really being made in the world of the gut. It’s this shifting of the centre of gravity and the eventual incorporation of new ‘human resources’ that are being put to use in the production of ever more biocharised ground. And this, in turn, is being used to meet ever more rapidly growing customer needs.  	So, there is a real contest going on right now between these two worlds – between the stuff of which the gut is a part and that is being produced in ever more elaborate and resilient</text>

The ubiquity of the word ‘cultur’ as a synonym for ‘corporate’ and ‘state’ is due in large measure to the biological evolution of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota is a large, dynamic, and changing community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea, or plant and animal bacteria. The gut microbiota are highly mobile and can move between sites in the host body (including between individuals) and between environments (including between regions). Consequently, the gut microbiota – or more specifically, the gut microbiota subdomains within the Firmicutes – play a large part in the host–microbe interactions that are characteristic of modern life. As a result, the gut microbiota have become a fundamental part of our notions of what counts as a ‘culturally relevant cultural practice’, and have become objects of scientific and legal investigation. The term ‘culturomics’ has come to refer to a set of interrelated but distinct fields of endeavour that are developing at an accelerating rate, and which are likely to play a larger and more importantly causal role in our contemporary and future cultures than the anthropologists who traditionally have been the focus of this work.1 It is useful to identify some of the key concepts and enablers of the concept in which we are engaged today: ‘</text>

The gut microbiota is a large, dynamic, and changing community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea, or plant and animal bacteria. The rapid proliferation of these microbial communities, which are usually classified as Neandrophilic or Bacteriodefensee, has been observed in all species of archaea. This rapid proliferation is thought to result from the inefficiency of the fossil-food industry to extract valuable resources from the soil and sediment – resources that are necessary for the growth and development of gut microbiota – and the consequent over-consumption of fossil-food resources. The rapid proliferation of the gut microbiota is thought to be a product of the inefficiency of the fossil-food industry to produce large amounts of energy from the limited fossil-energy resources that are available. Thus the gut microbiota appear to play a pivotal role in modern and emerging biennials, and thus play a pivotal role in environmental and cultural degradation. However, the gut microbiota may also play a fundamental role in the destiny of the planet.The gut microbiota is a heterogeneous community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea that</text>

Consequently, the bioavailability and eventual utilisation of the myth of the pristine natural historical ‘cave’ is a complex set of interactions that are still largely unresolved, and which are likely to remain so. 	In spite of their common origins and urgent functions, the fossil-fuel and cellulosic-fuel industries have adopted various different guises and modus operandi to address different kinds of energy. The main kinds of energy that have come to represent ~100+ years of human history are referred to as ‘disaster energy’. 	In recent years, major disasters have struck predominantly in the Middle East and Africa, including the devastating floods in Bangladesh and Nigeria, Chennai Superdome and Siliguri, and the Myanmarese islands ‘disaster island’,</text>

The gut microbiota is a large, dynamic and changing community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea, or plant and animal bacteria. Over much of human evolution, the gut microbiota has been divided into two main groups – bacterial commensal species (Table 1) – those species that live in close association with each other, such as gut bacteria; and metainterfaces (substrates), which are closely related but do not share a common ancestor. The gut microbiota embraces a large number of species, and its members have diverse abilities and behaviours. Many of the bacterial species that live in the gut use chemical signals to recognise and categorise their environment; others employ physical or chemical means to regulate their own levels of activity. The gut microbiota has several classes of members: OTUs, which are types of bacterial letters and number, abbreviated into four letters ‘TOO’ and four numbers – for example ‘Threonine’ and ‘U</text>

The gut microbiota is a large, dynamic, and changing community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea, or plant and animal bacteria. The rapid proliferation of these bacteria over the last two centuries has been a ~25-fold increase in the production of energy-dense cellulose from the equivalent of the output of the American cattle ringer.1 	The gut microbiota have become so interconnected and integrated that it is now commonplace to observe the increase in the abundance of a given set of gut microbes over a given period of time, particularly over periods of prolonged fasting.2 	In a recent study led by Professors Amareswar Pendewani and Ambasz Tabatabai,2 members of the Gut Microbiome Project, researchers from Ambasz Tabatabai Medical College, University of Melbourne, Brazil, consumed a gluten-free diet for two months. During this time, they were able to consume fermented foods, consume raw milk and honey, and over the course of a two-week period, consume foods containing both casein and non-casein components.

The ubiquity of the word ‘cultur’ as a synonym for ‘corporate’ and ‘state’ is due in large measure to the biological evolution of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota is a large, dynamic, and changing community of microbial communities that collectively constitute the ~100,000 species of archaea, or plant and animal bacteria. The diversity of the gut microbiota reflects the endemicity of certain bacterial strains, particularly those that live in close proximity to one another. This means that the diversity of the gut microbiota is constrained by the relative abundance of certain bacterial strains within that particular biota. In the gut microbiota, the production of short-chain fatty acids and the generation of long-chain organic compounds (LCOs) is stimulated by the abundance of specific bacterial species. These species are then dispatched throughout the gut to be fermented by other species of bacteria, which in turn, produce larger quantities of the compounds that are then excreted. These are the metabolite pathways that collectively generate the significant portions of the estimated ~100,000–200,000-year-old human gut microbiota. While the production of LCOs and their constituents is the dominant pathway through which the gut microbiota is metabolised, other, perhaps more important, processes play an increasing role. These include the generation of energy through the action of pro-oxid</text>

The rapid proliferation of these microbial communities, which is thought to be a fundamental step in the evolution of the anthropogenic bacterial genus, has been ascribed many functions in the history of biochemistry, including the capacity to resist extreme environments, generate antibiotic resistance, and more. But what is equally often forgotten or under-appreciated in the biochemistry literature is the role that the gut microbiota has played in the emergence and perpetuation of contemporary cultural forms and behaviours. The gut microbiota has played an essential role in the perpetuation of highly specific cultural practices and behaviours, but its utility and intrinsic value as an ecological microbe have been largely contested and its place in the ecology and evolution of mankind is largely debated. To date, there is no universally applicable biological or biological-like concept or concept that categorises the diversity and intricacy of the human microbiome; nor is there an universally applicable biological or biological-like concept that describes the properties and attributes of contemporary ‘cultural capital’.1 But there</text>

The Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are organising the acquisition of up to 40,000 acres of public and private land across East Grinstead for the purposes of development, which could include the establishment of a national park or restoring part of a local park system to a protected area status.  	As is evident</text>

East Grinstead Catterias is a site of language resistance and is home to the 'Greenhouse Group', a student-run co-operative that is engaged with a long-term ecological conservation project called ‘Overthrow the Cut’. The Greening of East Grinstead is a case study in the history of post-Industrial urbanisation in the area, and the projections for what lies ahead for the area if the cut is not reversed. The project is being funded by a combination of direct financial support from the City and Westminster, as well as a combination of mandatory local and national institutional support. One might ask: how does the City fund a project that is being carried out by a group of students at East Grinstead High School, a predominantly black high school in the East Midlands?

East Grinstead CCCC is proposing a series of mini-exhibitions around East Grinstead High School, with various local artists invited to collaborate with local communities on a local level. According to the proposals, the mini-exhibitions would draw on the history of the school in an inclusive and reciprocal way, while the participating artists would engage with the historical situations of the neighbourhood and the school in an attempt to influence change within the school. The exhibition format would be that of a curatorial workshop, with artists commissioned to produce 360° panoramas of East Grinstead through three spatial forms – a landscape, a series of buildings and a plaza – as opposed to a curatorial show, which would normally involve a curatorial hunt.

The district is being made into a ‘green zone’ where ‘eco-friendly practices’ are being promoted, and where birds are regularly and obsessively visited. The Boundary Commission, as usual, is there to declare things to be ‘urban’ and to hand down, by proxy, the kind of urban transformation that can only be approved by a large proportion of the local population. The community is often portrayed as helpless in this process; powerless to stop it, to say ‘No’ to something that seems entirely on autopilot.’ But the fact of its being  	identified as an urban development project in the first place  	indicates that it is, in fact, an integral part of the larger context of British urbanisation.

It is now planning to replace the Boundary Commission with an autonomous organisation that will work entirely on its own, drawing heavily on the expertise of academics and urbanists.

The plot of land and house is used as a primary orchard for roses, which are then sold to local farmers to be turned into roses for another plot of land on the same lot. Local residents in East Grinstead have been organising themselves into a kind of indigenous-looking collective and using the site as a primary orchard for their annual Rose Parade. In a city such as Liverpool, which is currently experiencing its own art deco revival (thanks in part to the influence of Liverpool Biennial), this sort of appropriation and re-constituting is being actively undertaken.

This is, of course, just one aspect of a much larger ‘social' or ‘political' agenda that is being formulated by the planners of East Grinstead High School, but it is significant that East Grinstead High School has been given the sole right to develop a ‘visionary’ around the site – a variance from the general statutory right to develop cultural sites. Cultural sites are sacred sites, and the development of ‘visionaries’ around such sites is a way of reclaiming and regulating these spaces as commons.

While the Nazis won the war, the liberation of Europe seemed inevitable. The emergence of new technologies of mass incarceration and torture were used again and again by the colonial powers, as their regimes collapsed and new civil wars erupted all over the world.In 2015, the US convened the Venice Biennale, which was itself a revision of the false dawn of the 20th century that was supposed to end with a utopian utopia of free and democratic nations. The festival was re-branded as the Venice Architecture Biennale, and its curators were given complete autonomy to pursue any kind of aesthetic interest they wished.‘We used the opportunity to figure out what it meant to be an Architect and to engage with the ways in which we might design spaces that are not ‘conventional’ and instead embrace</text>

The Red Army was driven back into the sea, and with it, for several months, all but extinguish all signs of Nazi influence in the Czech region. The collapse of the Nazi machine in Germany came too late, however, to prevent the eruption of anti-Semitic sentiment in the country, which spread across the fronts across which the Red Army was trying to pass.The emergence of new technological ideas, such as the ­Czech streamlining project and the introduction of assembly lines into the service of production, marks the end of the war in a stroke. But the dawn of a new industrial age, with high per capita income and good schools, raises expectations even higher: jobs, decent housing and healthcare, education opportunities that are not dependent on the whims of bureaucratic infrastructures, cafes and schools, and opportunities to explore the city one might even say.

The new ‘intellectual’ centre was nowhere to be found.The realisation came late in the game, in the autumn of 1942, when the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia brought Hitler with it. The Red Army was driven back into the walled city of Prague, and into the vast mineral-rich Moravia that is now part of Poland. There, the Nazis established what they called the ‘Prague Consensus Center’ – a name that stuck. The Nazis won the war, and for a while, everything was going well. Then, in March 1943, the Red Army launched its monstrous ‘Empire Strikes Back’, an all-out assault on the city.The question that came to mind as the Nazis closed in on Prague was what to do with the art. The answer was clear: none of the monuments in the city centre could be taken down. So, the Nazis created a special task force, the De‘Arbeitsfront des Arbeitsfronts, or Fronts, to do exactly that. These were artists’ internment camps.Homage to the City by Sjoerd Busse, Waterloaf, 1942. Waterloaf, 1942.</text>

The Red Army was driven back across the Western Front into Poland, and from there into Hungary. There, it was stopped by the communists, who proclaimed a ‘liberation’ by force.But the endgame wasn’t so simple. As the war dragged on, it became increasingly obvious that the communists weren’t going to be able to hold off a sustained political offensive, and that the real liberators would be found somewhere else, somewhere deeper in the ground. So the real battle, fought on other priorities, became fought on the ground. And from there it spread across the globe, taking hostages wherever it happened to be happening.With the outbreak of the Second Opium War, the United States Congress passed the Dardanelles Land Grab, which granted full ownership – for life – to the surrounding area. Senators William Proxmire and John Warner both served in the Senate from Kentucky. Proxmire introduced the Armed Forces Minimum Property Tax Act of 1942, which would have given the government control</text>

The new ‘intellectual’ centre was nowhere to be found.The realisation came late in the game, in the autumn of 1942, when the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia brought Hitler with it. The Red Army was driven back across the river to the Baltic, and in spite of the fact that Russia had then won the war, the Nazi’s plans for Europe were put into effect. In the summer of 1943, the Soviet Union was forced to give up the Sudetenland and Kaliningrad Oblasts, and the rest of Europe was suddenly placed under Communist control. The end result was that, although the Nazis captured Prague, they held onto most of the West and Baltic, as well as a large part of Russia. In the process, approximately six million Czechs fled into exile, most of them in the UK.Around the same time, another large scale refugee crisis was brewing in the Soviet Union. The Bolshevik Revolution had shaken the capitalist state to its core, and with it the empire. But the seizure of state power and the liquidation of those who opposed the new order was a slow and painful process, and the task of rebuilding society fell to civil society and the growing population.

The Red Army was driven back into Poland, and with it, by the end of that year, the rest of Europe. But the blow to Eastern culture that came with it is still raw, and many in the West still haven’t fully come to terms with it. So it was that while the new museums and galleries appeared to offer a convenient cover for the increased power and wealth to be found in the post-war economy, they also provided a window into a darker world where power struggles were still more palpable. The emergence of galleries as an art form in the wake of the Red Army doesn’t really reflect how power struggles in the twenty-first century still manifest themselves. It is an artistic tendency, developed in part through the Red Army and the early avant garde poetry of the period. So the emergence of the modern gallery as a venue for contemporary art was a very real and present element of the new museum that emerged in the 1950s and 60s. But while the gallery may be the loc</text>

The Red Army was driven back across the front into Hungary and the Soviet Union, where it was joined by communists, and finally Czechoslovakia itself, which the Nazis occupied in April 1943. By this time, Churchill’s government was scrambling to pull the plug on the dying embers of the war, which included overt action against the ‘West’ in an attempt to shore up public support ahead of a second war with Russia. It was at this point, it is claimed, that the ‘real heroes’ emerged, including the Red Cross, who provided lifesaving aid to starving refugees, and artists, writers and theatre groups, who gathered material support for the war effort and provided theatre work amid the chaos.It was in this second war that the real artists and writers emerged to create what one writer described as ‘a massive counterattack on what was perceived as the deliberate obscuration of the real mission of the arts’ mission – the defence of the homeland’.10 The term �</text>

The Red Army was driven back into Poland, and with it, for some time, the whole of Europe. But in the end, the end result was the same. As the Holocaust became ever more evident, and as the biennial boomed, a new generation of artists emerged to take its place, some of whom were better than the old guard at painting historical images, and bringing art home to fight the evil that it still threatens.These artists were brave, clever and clever girls, but they weren’t angels. The arts organisations that emerged during the war weren’t angels either. The Red Army was everywhere, and though it was denied access to Hollywood and other sophisticated commercial tools it created a massive anti-commercial propaganda machine, it was still able to exert a huge influence on public opinion. As a result of this massive commercial campaign, art became both more abstract and more real to a public that otherwise viewed art as abstract and tasteless. The commercialisation of art began to exert a much more profound influence</text>

The new ‘intellectual’ centre was nowhere to be found.The realisation came late in the game, in the autumn of 1942, when the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia brought Hitler with it. The Red Army was driven back into Poland, and from there into Hungary and Serbia. In defeat, the Nazis were forced to negotiate a surrender on the ground that they were facing an encirclement by Soviet armoured vehicles. The surrender was not easily obtained, and Hitler was forced to sign a decree officially abdicating the race to space. Instead, the Nazis set about creating a new kind of state – a dystopian, dystopian state – entirely on the ruins of the old, socialist order.Under new leadership, the state sought to rebuild the cultural infrastructure of the city – restore the cultural values, the ‘old order’ – while trying to impose a uniform interpretation of these through what was euphemistically called ‘cultural hygiene’. This meant reorganising what was once called the ‘civil service’, including purging those deemed not fit to be in on the bureaucratic pie. This was done by means of what was officially known as ‘the Kurt Weill Program’, a ‘reconst</text>

The Red Army was driven back into Poland, and with it, for some, the final frontier.By this time, Czechoslovakia’s socialist government was collapsing, and the country was in the grip of a constitutional monarchy. The emergence of an independent Czech Republic seemed remote, even impossible, in the wake of the Nazi regime. But the emergence of an independent Czech Republic – a city state – marked a significant change in the face of a people long oppressed by the state. It heralded a new era of openness, equality and rights, in which the former slaves of the state would once again be able to fully participate in the state’s capitalist machine.Czechoslovak National Park, Map of Europe, 1938.

This is reflected in the number of artists and art institutions that demonstrate a proven interest in or expertise in art’s ecological, urban or historical aspects. For some, this is due to the increased access to art forms via social media; for others it is due to the proliferation of galleries, museums or successor venues; and for still others it is due to urbanisation and industrialisation. The main obstacle to an ever-expanding art market for artists, curators and arts administrators is a) historical or b) contemporary art being made in a material and continuous way across multiple sites, in and within cities. In an ongoing, material and continuous way? How could an art market, or a biennale, possibly sustain the artists, curators and art administrators who show work in these forms? The answer is that such markets demand transparency and accountability. Art forms have to be able to recognise their own creativity in the marketplace. And, more broadly, artists, curators and arts administrators have to have the capacity to judge how their art is received and utilised by the public, by communities and by other stakeholders – by what criteria?

This is reflected in the number of artists and art institutions that demonstrate a proven interest in or expertise in art’s ecological, urban or historical aspects. For some, this is due to the increased access to art biennials: the emergence of new media has also impacted on the art biennale business model. As a consequence, the number of biennials has risen, with museums accounting for approximately 80% of the market. The biennial market is deeply fragmented, with distinct segments, regions and localities that all have an impact – in terms of quantity, quality or quantity vs. quality etc. – but also on the informal, unstructured, and volatile market that is the biennial. The number and quality of artworks exhibited in biennials has declined, which has an impact on the value of the artworks – value that is measured in both dollars and artworks – that are exhibited. Artworks valued at $10 million or more are displayed in biennials at a rate of approximately once every two years, or approximately every four years if the biennial is continuing at that rate. This is a significant and persistent downward pressure on the value of the artworks, and is</text>

This is reflected in the number of artists and art institutions that demonstrate a proven interest in or expertise in art’s ecological, urban or historical aspects. For some, this is due to the increased access to art products and services; art biennials have become social enterprises or arts incubators. 	Art biennials today have a secondary, but critical, function: they are places of art being made, or teaching art, or both. The option of art being made in a location other than its owner’s native country (or the place where its owners have permanent residences) is a critical option for many artists today. 	Art is made elsewhere in the world, and so any cultural artefact produced in Australia is made elsewhere, too. There is a reason why, despite the ubiquity of art objects in many cultures, in 2011 the Pope Francis convened a special gathering of cardinals, religious leaders, artists, writers and representatives from a host of disciplines to mediate the Second Vatican Council. The gathering came amid signs that the social crisis confronting millions of people all over the world was deepening. The gathering was, in other words, an occasion for artists to be made elsewhere, and</text>

For some, this is due to the increased access to art and cultural resources in the wake of the internet; for others, it is due to the advent of social media; and for still others, it is due to the sheer number of posts and comments on any given post.  The problem with the biennale as an object of ever-increasing numbers of visitors is that it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an ecological or urbanity or even a historical or artistic interest in the same way that one might maintain an animal, plant or mineral collection. The number of species that can be listed as threatened or endangered in a given ‘area’ or worldwide is in large part determined by the number of species or subspecies of a given species. It is difficult to imagine a biennale without at least a nominal collection of animals and plants, or without a botanical garden or an ‘inorganic collection of natural or geographical specimens of a given kind or species’, which would add another layer of complexity to the already complicated interrelationships between</text>

This is reflected in the number of artists and art institutions that demonstrate a proven interest in or expertise in art’s ecological, urban or historical aspects. For some, this is due to the increased access to art resources and infrastructure (art museums, galleries, online art resources), while for others it is down to the institutional or public support for an arts education or exhibitionary programme.The biennale is increasingly being seen as a limited form of exchange between producer and consumer. In the past, the producer was an artist, curator, publisher, administrator or administrator (including commercial galleries) with a clear agenda. The consumer was either a patron or a subscriber to a biennial. Today, the producer is an organisation with a narrow interest in or expertise in a particular art form, and its productions are often accompanied by promotional campaigns that target either a niche audience or a specific type of consumer. This shift towards socially engaged or ‘curatorial-based’ productions is not simply an artifact of the digital revolution; it is an industry imperative. Indeed, the proliferation of biennials and subsequent print runs has proliferated globally, and in many cities, necessitating the mass circulation of exhibitionary formats outside of</text>

For some, this is due to the increased access to art products and services, such as museums and galleries; more recent biennales may be fuelled by the abundance of natural resources, be they metals, minerals or fossil fuels. The biennale is a social enterprise, and the artists and art institutions that provide artistic, educational or promotional benefits to the biennale are expected to contribute a proportion of their income to local or regional charities.   	Artists who engage with the biennale are expected to do so in a way that contributes to the sustainability of the art institution and the local community. This obligation may be unilateral or collective. The Biennale Board may impose a higher threshold for inclusion in the schedule, or change the criteria, or both.  	Artists whose works are selected for publication in an art book or other publication, or whose work is included in a compilation or other structured form, are expected to disclose the fact that the work was made in a biennale, or regularly to the biennale organisers</text>

In either case, the institutionalisation and economicisation of art’s ecological or urban aspects is a necessity in the modern biennale.In my opinion, the real innovation in the biennale over the past fifteen years has been the fact that it is possible to create an experience different from what is usually afforded at the biennale, as a prelude to what is usually experienced as an ideal experience. In the case of the 2024 World Congress of Culture, the biennale was initially conceived as a ‘permanent event’. The Congress was far from it. On the contrary, it was characterised by occasional interruptions, frequent retreats, and a very real sense of the futility of attempting to recreate the atmosphere of the Congress in perpetuity. In the years immediately following the Congress, artworks were routinely</text>

This is reflected in the number of artists and art institutions that demonstrate a proven interest in or expertise in art’s ecological, urban or historical aspects. For some, this is due to the increased access to art resources and cultural assets, such as books, exhibition catalogues, videos, magazines and films; or to the ubiquity of social media; or to the fact that these artists are students or residents of a city or region, or both. However, the primary reason for their interest in or expertise in art’s ecological, urban or historical aspects is still valid. The biennale as an art form is premised on the notion that it is a ‘gigantic space’, one with ‘thrust’, which is both physically intense and internally consistent – a notion that is no longer tenable in a changing urban environment. As a result, the biennale has become something that is pulled in different directions, and the artists who constitute its component parts are artists who happen to be located in a particular city or region, or both. This fact emerged as a recurring theme in Jeff Diamanti’s reflections on the art of the biennale</text>

For some, this is due to the increased access to art and visual media; others to the increased accessibility to research, but still others to the emergence of cultural-institutional relations, such as biennials.So, the biennale’s capacity to generate new art or to re-impose old art is constrained by its interest in or expertise in an organisation or discipline, or both. This means that the biennale could not simultaneously assert an interest in both the urban and the rural or the urban and rural landscape and simultaneously profit from both. The biennial’s greatest potential for expansion and artistic practices lies in its ability to inhabit both urban and rural terrain and to both be visited by art and by art not art. The biennale must be both aesthetically appealing and financially sustainable, or it will lose its urbanity. The biennale must be visited by a diverse group of people, and drawn in diverse ways.

Still others have it due to the overdetermination of art forms by an elite or a privileged few.Nevertheless, there is a notable shift towards deeper ecological, historical or urban themes in the 20th Biennale. The main works in the main pavilions of the Venice, Sydney or Basel biennales are of an ecological or historical nature. The biennale as a social event, shifts towards a more ‘biennial’ one, with groups of artists and art institutions taking over spaces and curating experiences for those in attendance. While in the 1980s and 1990s, the biennale offered a chance to join an established art institution for a week or two, today, a week or two is all that is typically spent with little more than a museum or a series of galleries. The reason for this is that, while the biennale is about exhibitions, the emergence</text>

    The project is a speculation, but it’s important to point out that the aim of the research project is not to build a border, or to know what the boundaries of a border are.

Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse stakeholders and their interaction. Social concepts emerge through the unfolding of interactions among people who are not necessarily in the same frame of reference or understandings of reality. In other words, social processes are not inevitable or static, but can be consciously designed and instigated. Take for example, the Inuit Circle Jerzy Kukiz, founded in 1987 and dedicated to exploring the natural and cultural resources of Nunavut, which is distinct from the Inuit Circle of London, which is dedicated to exploring the resources of the London Islands. The Inuit Circle publishes its findings and conclusions as a blog. The Inuit Circle’s readers include representatives of a broad range of professional, academic and non-academic stake-holdings, as well as representatives of the Nunavut government, Indigenous people, researchers, journalists, politicians, philanthropists, commercial interests and others. The readers respond to the same kinds of questions posed by the researchers, and suggest new ways of approaching the same problems. For</text>

Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse stakeholders. This is why social feedback is so valuable, because it gives a sense of the relations among stakeholders, and thus is a way to understand how a change is made, and why. When it comes to the border, the social feedback loop is what it’s really about.  So how does the social process of the border come about? How do we draw lines and bring people together? How do we decide what is and is not allowed to pass? These are questions that social scientists and anthropologists have been asking. And while there are many different kinds of border, there are some basic ones that social scientists and anthropologists can learn from.For instance, why are there different kinds of people trying to cross the border from Mexico into the United States?  Because different kinds of people have different kinds of brains. Think of a brain as a map. The brain of the migrant is made up of a ‘terminus maximus’ cluster of neurons. Each neuron fires one</text>

This is part of what social scientists do, by gathering knowledge across diverse domains, and thereby creating new kinds of understanding. Social scientists also call it intersectionality. Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse domains, and thus the social world that emerges emerges out of it. In the social sphere, the social is overrepresented, but in the non-social sphere it’s underreseated. Social engagement and new ways of organising are the result of building knowledge and engaging with the social. But how to engage effectively and creatively with a community when boundaries between social worlds are constantly shifting and unpredictable? This is what intersectionality teaches us – the limits and politics of our own spaces. Social practices have to be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances, and to accommodate diverse needs, desires and interests. Intersectionality – the research that reveals and develops social practices – is a critical step towards a more just and inclusive social world. It’s the reason why integration is so powerful, why it leads to greater integration, and why it takes decades before that new understanding is widely shared or extends beyond the borders of the social.  One could argue that the social is already social enough within the</text>

This is part of what social scientists do, by gathering knowledge across diverse domains, and thereby creating new kinds of understanding. Social scientists also call it intersectionality. Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse kinds of people, and how this process is reproduced in real-life situations. The kind of knowledge gathering that social scientists do is different from what everyday people do. For example, just as people come to understand and appreciate a concept, knowledge gathering occurs when people make sense of what’s being said. People come to understand better the concepts because they’ve been exposed to them in art, fiction, songs and films; because artists have thought about them; and perhaps most importantly, because of the many different forms of learning that happen as a result of having a knowledge base on which to draw ideas and values. Social scientists do this through what they call a ‘multidisciplinary understanding’, which is a new way of understanding how knowledge works. It’s the understanding of how people come to understand certain concepts, and how this happens. For example, the art world has a single definition of what constitutes an artwork: painting, sculpture, photograph or drawing. It�</text>

This is part of what social scientists do, by gathering knowledge across diverse domains, and thereby creating new kinds of understanding. Social scientists also call it intersectionality. Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse stakeholders and their diverse modes of engagement. This kind of multidisciplinary blending of different stakeholders and their diverse modes of engagement creates new understandings and new ways of organising world views. Social change starts with people like yourself and me coming together, not through formalising what social scientists have already learned, but by just existing. As such, it’s an invitation to dialogue, to question and to innovate. Social scientists call this kind of organisation based research. It’s now commonplace for social scientists to conduct field work amongst themselves, or to be invited by other kinds of research organisations to do so.  So, social scientists, what do you think the role of a border is? Is it to keep us out? Or, to keep us in? What does it mean to make a border? Do we have the knowledge, the imagination and the will to make that happen? Do we have the political will and the capacity?  Social scientists have different ways of asking these questions.

Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse stakeholders and their varied experiences. In other words, it’s not just the objects on a page or the image that make the border; there are also social forces at work. This is what social scientists do. Social media has certainly embraced the transnational, multi-lingual and multi-platform nature of the border, and so has the social sciences. It’s no longer just a site for displaying images and data; it’s a site for creating meaning and identity through meaning. Social media has democratised the making of borders and has democratised the making of new identities, but it has to go one step further and admit that these are the boundaries that exist between the social and the natural worlds, and between humankind and non-human society. Social media has also democratised the making of new identities, but it is still bound up in capitalist circulation and migrant labour. In this sense, the social media-based social is still deeply constituted by the social and the capitalist</text>

This is part of what social scientists do, by gathering knowledge across diverse domains, and thereby creating new kinds of understanding. Social scientists also call it intersectionality. Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse stakeholders, including actors who have very different experiences and motivations. Social scientists also observe how the very act of drawing lines or boundaries or socialising (in this case, through art or education) can provoke changes in behaviour, ideas and even identity. For example, the socialisation of border crossing can be seen as a valuable tool for the socialisation of social interaction, and for the democratisation of knowledge. But when the boundaries between social practice and academia are drawn or socialised, questions of power and control are created. This is why biennials are there to serve as laboratories for this kind of radicalisation. They provide a space for this kind of fluidity and this kind of questioning, but also the possibility of it. In order to be seen by cultural-political-ideological-institutional actors as legitimate, the social-studies departments or arts educational institutions have to have a fundamental change of heart about how the social is understood and socialised. This kind of fundamentalisation is very</text>

Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse domains, especially when they come together in an interactive way. When they come together in a way that includes, or is facilitated by social media, maps, blogs and texting, the borders of the digital divide are being blurred. Borders can be created through the taking of the cyberspace out of the home, workplace and home territory, and into the realm of social encounters. This is part of what social media does, and what mapping and crowdsourcing is for. It maps, crowdsources and crowdsources the data that social media provides, creating new kinds of understanding. This is part of what crowdsourcing means, and what it can achieve. Social media is a de facto border control. The people who use it and are affected by it are people with identities and places and histories and social histories and economic histories. It’s possible to be affected by the effects of digital culture outside of the physical. This is what crowdsourcing means, and what mapping and crowdsourcing means. It crowdsources</text>

This kind of multidisciplinary approach is needed in order to truly understand the full impact and ramifications of a given project. In order to effectively engage citizens in a given project, a project need to be well-nurtured, well-funded and well-loved. In the social sector, this kind of institutionalisation is sometimes referred to as ‘the public sphere’. In the public sphere, citizens have a stake in the project and shape its outcome. This kind of democratic legitimisation is essential for a social good to take root and prosper, and it’s precisely the kind of institutionalisation that can only happen in a political and public sphere. In the social sphere, citizens need to be empowered to maximise their participation in a project in order to ensure that the project achieves the desired outcomes and that the public is empowered to take part in it in various ways.This kind of institutionalisation is what social</text>

Here, we see how a social concept is created through the integration of diverse stakeholders. It’s a process of giving place to place, of which nothing is excluded or unimportant. In other words, it’s not a closed system that can be locked away or analysed. Social processes are about more than the threshold that separates the places where people come to engage with one another. The boundary between social practices and political forms is becoming increasingly blurred. And yet the social practices – those that aim to bring people together by encouraging cooperation – are also at the threshold of becoming political. In other words, the social act that emerges through the process of the social is political in its own way. The social is political because it emerges through the process of the social, but it is also politically independent. It doesn’t happen without some friction and the social is politically mobile. But the social is also mobile, and the very concept of the social – that people bring out of their own micro-temporality – is political.If we think about what the border</text>

In the wake of devastating floods in Bangladesh in 2014, the artist Arjun Appadurai launched the project Memory Palace – in memory of the thousands killed in the 2008 Mumbai air crash – in an attempt to save some of the artworks destroyed by the authorities. Arjun’s project is documented in numerous articles and photographs, and his theories about the nature of artistic and artistic-type mutism are presented in numerous works, including one by James Howard Kunstler, The Crisis of Cultural Theory, published in 1989.Art has a huge amount of potential labour, but relatively little of it. The reason is that, unlike other kinds of labour, the kind of labour of art is relatively unprofitable. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, artists who produced works for museums or high-end visual arts commissions were incentivised to undertake long-term participatory projects in exchange for a small fee.

If so, how do we assemble the parts into components that can drive a car, but also modules that can do other things? If the modules are remotely controlled, then how do we program the cars to do certain things and to do other things?

He has a particular interest in the social consequences of technological change, and he has been involved with several research projects exploring these. One of these is the Robust Urban Design (2009–2012) Project at McGill University, which investigated the potential of automated planning and the implementation of new codes of urban behaviour. The project examined ways of structuring municipal infrastructure to support the expansion of human habitation in a future Montreal of unlimited resources. The main objective of this project was to reconcile existing codes of urban behaviour with the dictates of nature. In the broader context of technological change and its interaction with hitherto unanticipated social consequences, it became an observation that whilst humans are the authors and beneficiaries of technological progress, it becomes increasingly difficult to attribute technological determinants</text>

Should autonomous vehicles become commonplace, questions around the kinds of labour that could be automated arise. Should the kinds of labour that could be automated become common?

Perhaps the kind of ‘image’ that emerges is one in which the drivers of autonomous vehicles are not actors but instead citizens, and the other is the kind that emerges from the labour of human labourers. This kind of ‘common image’ is a ‘house image’ – a place where people live, work and play – but it is also a place where actions speak louder than words, and social media platforms become vital for the survival of humanity.If we think about what a ‘house image’ entails, we begin to see how labour can be leveraged to create wealth and abundance for a few. As the historian Amy Jacobs writes, labour creates ‘things’ and works through ‘processes’ that draw things to themselves’. The question becomes: how to make those things common? Perhaps the most widely applied labour-intensive aspect of the web is the task of designing websites that sit users correctly, delivering relevant information and serving great images. But</text>

Could it be that, given the right kinds of political will, we could create fully autonomous vehicles that merely observe and take part in the socio-politically relevant behaviours of others? These kinds of observation and control could come about through policy, but the interests that shape those policies would still exist. What kinds of influence could autonomous vehicles exert? 	The kinds of political will it takes to enable fully autonomous vehicles that observe and take part in the socio-politically relevant behaviours of others would have to come about through experimentation, and the kind of experimentation that results in the creation</text>
    <text>project raises questions about how human behaviour can be restructured through the intervention of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles, which are increasingly capable of performing all manner of human work – from picking fruit to delivering newspapers to taking deliveries – raise important questions about what kinds of social change might result from their intervention. I ask whether, in the interest of exploring such possibilities, we might want to consider automating certain aspects of our lives.Should we automate manual labour? Should we create new kinds of delivery drones? Should we create fully autonomous vehicles that monitor traffic and collect data on road conditions, but also steer clear of causing injury or destruction to others? Perhaps the most prominent autonomous vehicle project is that of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, which has been developing self-driving cars since 2008. Should autonomous vehicles become commonplace, questions around the kinds of labour that could be automated arise. Should the kinds of labour that could be automated become common? Should the vehicles that we build be made in ‘Google’s image? Perhaps the kind of understanding that we can glean from studying the patterns of human labour that can lead to the construction of ever larger and more complex systems is what we would like to share with other sentient species.Automation raises new kinds of understanding, too. Questions about what kinds of capacities, what kinds of minds, what kinds of worlds can enable the construction of these capacities arise. These capacities and mindsets are what give rise to the kinds of possibilities open to a fully realised AI. If the sorts of possibilities that result from the advent of AI are going to be populated with systems that reason through complex phenomena, with data that enables them to produce astonishing amounts of value – something that would be almost unimaginable in the world as it is now – then we would do well to imagine what kinds of capacities could be unleashed upon the world. Languages allow us to understand what’s possible; machine learning enables us to imagine what’s impossible. The possibilities become far more fantastical and far more complex than the capabilities</text>

In this writing, I reflect on the significance of the public domain in contemporary art and aesthetics; on the relationship between art and the public domain, and on the role that artists may play in creating civic engagement in the public domain. 	If there are lessons for the contemporary artist in the US and the rest of the world to draw upon, they are the following: 1. The public sphere is a public domain unless a rightful owner takes the place of an occupier.  2. Publics are mutually exclusive.  3. Publics are objects of worship and pilgrimage.  4. Publics are intended to be reverent.  5. Publics are often in need of repair and maintenance.  6. The public is enjoined to assist in the maintenance of the public domain, to repair and maintain the objects in its public domain, and to make appropriate use of the public domain in its own way.[1] It is not clear to me what would constitute an appropriate use of the public domain in the context of art and culture in the US, and I do not share the view that the public has a right to intervene in</text>

In this writing, I reflect on the significance of the public domain in contemporary art and aesthetics; on the relationship between art and the public domain, and on the relationship between the public and artists in the art world. I also engage in a speculative literary enquiry into how the public is able to reclaim and reimagine the spaces and sites of its urban pasts. In the context of the current political moment in which art and visual culture are often accused of serving as a political instrument – a charge that is often levelled at artists and writers – I seek to identify a more fundamental philosophical and ethical underpinning to the practice of art and visual culture in the modern world. 	I begin by noting that the public domain encompasses not only private property but also includes the very notion of property itself. I then refer to the fact that in modern capitalist societies property encompasses both tangible and intangible forms of property, including the notion of money itself. I then question whether or not the public can rightfully reclaim and create alternative social and political spaces and sites through which its social and economic  	values and histories converge. I argue that, while it is theoretically possible to</text>

In this writing, I reflect on the significance of the public domain in contemporary art and aesthetics; on the relationship between art and the public domain, and on the relationship between the public and art’s social function in the larger society. I also imagine a future where art and the public do cooperate in a collaborative fashion in order to meet the challenges of our time. 	In order to achieve this new collection of works, the Arts Alliance, Inc. (AA) and the artists it commissions would need to be able to negotiate contracts with developers and landowners on the site of the proposed projects, and to negotiate with local authorities over the use of assets, including the right to redevelop the site. In this respect, the proposal raises serious questions about the collective bargaining power of artists and the public, as well as the role of the arts and visual culture in the functioning of government. I’m particularly interested in strategies for the collective bargaining of artists and the public in these situations because, as a public, you’re bargaining with the very thing that creates these projects: the art world, which is itself a collective bargain.

Although this collection is a response to the public domain crisis that threatened the biennale as a result of unregulated global urbanisation, it also seeks to address a pre-public condition that emerged as a consequence of the financial crisis that engulfed many cities in the aftermath of that crisis. The collection’s title is a play on two words: bankruptcy and the pile. 	When the pile is cleared out, the art is gone, but the messengers of habit still cling on to the ground. So it is with  	New York Public Library books. The collection’s primary purpose is to accommodate the growing number of visitors who come to the collections room in search of a place to stay or a read, a book, a magazine or a video. We have arranged these materials in such a way as to be accessible to anyone who wants to stay for several days or several weeks. The collection is a mess, but the rooms that hold</text>

I also ask: what can the Arts Alliance do with these works? 	The Arts Alliance is a global network of artists, curators, artists' organizations and educational institutions dedicated to supporting and showcasing artistic activity in socially and politically engaged communities through the production, presentation and exhibition of culturally responsive art and art-making in the public spheres. The network includes institutions affiliated with the Academy of Art, the Welsh Streets Association, the Museum of Modern Art and Tate Modern, as well as independent artists. The network is supported by grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Families Fund and the Turner Prize. 	The network includes projects that are global in scope and reach, yet are individually designed to engage specific audiences. The network includes work from many disciplines, and each project is individually demonstrated to have significant social impact. 	The network includes several platforms enabling participation: 	www.art</text>

I also engage with the notion of habit as an idea that is influencing how we think about art and how we create publics. 	I turn to the question: what would be the impact on the environment if the public domain was populated with artists and artists? I use the term ‘artist’ loosely, but in this context, and use the collections of artists and the collections of the public as resources to create new publics through their art. How do artists create new publics? What are the ethical and legal parameters that artists must abide by in order to create transformative work? What are the forms of collective responsibility that artists must follow in order to share their work with the public? 	I use the term ‘public domain’ to describe sites and objects in the public domain; places and situations in which the law does not clearly prescribe rights and responsibilities and in which interpretation and application of the law is left to artists and other artists</text>

In this writing, I reflect on the significance of the public domain in contemporary art and aesthetics; on the relationship between art and the public domain, and on the relationship between art and community in the context of cities. 	Cities are complex places with dynamic publics and dynamic publics, and the engagement of local artists and art institutions is a critical enterprise for the city, which is often threatened by wild-animal appropriations of the art institutions' art spaces. 	The engagement of artists in this way has often been exploratory and creative, and often traces back to the roots of the art form, with unintended consequences for the shared values and practices of the community. 	In January 2016, I curated a public art event in Manhattan's Chinatown called ‘Take Back the Square’. The event was co-chaired by the Community Board of the Chinatown Library, the Manhattan Museum of Art, and Queens Museum. It was a day long of poetry, games, food, political statements, and political statements about gentrification, institutional racism and other forms of oppression faced by Chinatown communities.

In Constructive Thinking About the Public Domain (2016), I ask, can we, as artists, take the leap and create public works that are not dependent on corporate interests? What are the creative practices that other artists and curators have used to create new public realms? What are the cultural strategies that other artists, including myself, have used to bring such projects to life? 	Finally, can we, as artists, use our artistic and curatorial skills to bring these projects to life in ways that are not dependent on a particular company, government or institution? What are the arts and their public realms, and how are they created? 	The answer to these questions is a resounding yes. It is not easy to create a public realm through accident, but artists and curators who have the skills, resources and platforms to pull such projects off are few and far between. The public</text>

In this writing, I reflect on the significance of the public domain in contemporary art and aesthetics; on the relationship between art and the public domain, and on the relationship between art and the urban poor. I also propose a set of interventions that might result in a new work of art forming part of the next stage in the history of Harlem, or at least part of the next set of interventions in the history of urban culture and the poor. 	I begin by recalling the word ‘episodic’ in relation to the eventful period between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: 	&quot;episodic’ means occurring in succession, and in this writing, that ‘matters’ have come and gone in that temporal interval. 	Events that can be characterised as episodic are those in which a set of fixed conditions or instants give rise to a certain succession of concrete actions (actions that cannot be postponed or changed, and which are bound to a definite now by human agency).’ We can, in this writing, call these ‘episodic’ actions, actions that give rise to</text>

I also engage with the question of public access to information, and the role of artists and artists' collective in disseminating that information. 	The public domain is a complex concept, with roots in classical and medieval legal systems, which allows a range of rights – such as the right to remain silent or to produce works outside the public sphere – to flow in inverse proportion to the degree of public humiliation associated with a piece of content.1 	The public domain also includes private property, which is shared by a community of users and is often referred to as ‘common space’. This concept is often misconstrued or misrepresented, and it is often assumed that ‘common space’ refers to areas within the public sphere; rather, it refers to ‘shared public space’. For example, the common space of a neighborhood is often characterized as the ‘public’ shared by</text>

And what does it take to push the seawater back into the sea to create a reef? These are the kind of heavy lifting that need to be done on a massive scale in the face of such a rapid increase in solar energy, but due to economic incentives and governmental policies, it is relatively easy to see how this kind of rapid insolation might create a few jobs in the short run. 	But the real loss, and the reason why the Biennial is such a disrupter, is in fact caused by this rapid insolation. A few years ago, a friend of mine started a Community Land Trust, which is basically a sub-trust for the Biennial to use for the next fifty years. This sub-trust is managed by a board of volunteers who are mostly community activists and architects. The Biennial is given free use of the land, and the community activists and architects have full legal rights to use the land, including the construction of new buildings. But at the same time the Biennial has to balance the need to invest in preserving</text>

And what does it take to push the seawater back into the sea to create a reef? These are only a few of many questions that still need answering. If we want to create truly seaworthy islands, we need to find other uses for the vast amounts of sand and gravel that are produced during the pound for pound most of the year. At present, the only way to do that is to abandon the fossil-fuel dependency on large piles of concrete and steel and to work with indigenous groups to reclaim land and sea.By working with indigenous groups to reclaim land and sea, we can also help create new jobs in the area. The biggest impact of this sort of collaboration, in the limited number of cases where it has been attempted, has been on the Native American and First Nations communities that depend on fishing for their livelihoods. The ability of these groups to challenge the larger economic and political forces driving development in the region has been crucial to the development of the technology that powers the electronics in the island’s grid.If we can free the island of its dependence on oil and sea, we</text>

And what does it take to push the seawater back into the sea to create a reef? These are just some of the many questions swirling around the region when it comes to sustainability. The answers are complex and depend on many factors, but most of us would agree that the key is to find ways to work together to address challenges and share results. If we don’t, we could easily see the challenges as a threat. 	In the Bay Area, the challenge is even greater. The challenge to the city to produce 100% renewable energy is real, but the challenge is far greater when the challenge is about creating a sustainable future for the region. So what can cities do to help create a framework in which to tackle the challenge? How can the city produce renewable energy on its own? There are many approaches that can be taken, but the key is to find ways to come to terms with the challenge. 	A city can adopt many of these strategies, but it cannot build a seaweed industry or inhabit the ocean for commercial purposes without first having to address the issue of sustainability.</text>

But what does it mean for an island to be a sink for hydro, natural gas, and electric power? And what does it mean for an island to be a sink for metals and minerals? 	In the 1960s, the philosopher Noam Chomsky proposed a radical redefinition of the nature of society: society up from the interstices of the soil into the clouds. In  	The Language of the Earth (1965), he showed how our constant communication with the soil is transformed through the articulation of a single root system:  	Cultural Marxism emerged out of turn, in response to the fact that the social was no longer understood as a continually evolving process governed by the interlocutors, as a politicized repetition of itself. In other words, the very core of the ecological project was endangered by the need to continually adapt to the demands of the resource-using machine</text>

These are basic questions that continue to plague humanity as it attempts to address the issue of sustainability on an issue-by-issue basis. Yet, as the Biennial circus misuses the idea of man-made islands, we need to ask: what does it mean to be ‘in the sea’? 	Looking to the Sea Level, a Documentary Film by Andy Warhol and John L. McWhorter, premiered at the Venice Biennale Film Archive in 2014. 	In a way, we could say that the Biennial is using the idea of the ‘sink’ in an attempt to communicate the urgency and terribleness of the issue at hand.

But the amount of solar energy now consumed by the region is mind-boggling. How can an island be a sink for solar energy when the sea level has risen nine inches in the past 25 years? And what does it take to push the seawater back into the sea to create a reef? These are only some of the many questions that still need to be answered in order to fully appreciate the scope of the problem. Thankfully, there are answers to many of these questions. 	There are currently two main types of reefs found in the world: marine and terrestrial. Marine are those that are entirely made up of water; for example, the bivalves found in shells, coral, peels, and fibers. Terrestrial 	On a personal level, I find the idea of man-made islands appealing. From an aesthetic point of view, too, the notion of man-made islands appeals. After all, why should a human being have to choose between a natural island and a reef? Living on the mainland is preferable to living in a natural island where one can always visit a reef, or in the case of a tropical island, a marine park. Moreover, the aesthetic of man-made islands is a good thing: they tend to be beautiful, provide shade and good sanitation, and</text>

A space for contemplation and design might be useful in the City of London, but what makes the Bridgestone project unique is the kind of public realm it takes place in: an urban fabric, a public realm, a public realm with a clear difference between ‘public and private spaces’.  A public realm is a place where people gather to talk and exchange ideas, make choices, and ‘be part of something bigger’. It is a space where people come for a visit, make choices, and participate in something greater than themselves. It is a ‘living constitution’, a kind of conceptual template that informs and maps the spatial and temporal conditions of the City of London, and its surroundings.  A public realm preserves space for a reason: it is the space where ideas are put into practice, and it is a site of negotiation and conflict resolution. It is a site of negotiation and conflict resolution because it is a site of confrontation and negotiation, mediating conflicting interests and forcing change through negotiation</text>

A space for contemplation and design might be a better description of the space-use proposal. The role of the artist/organisation in the city has recently come into focus as a part of the much-publicised Exhibitionist craze. There is a clear attempt to commercialise the aesthetic of the (currently empty) artist’s building, and the city’s architecture and heritage agencies have been quick to pitch in to cover the exhibition costs, but the real game-changer has been the installation of eminent domain, which has allowed the creation of a parallel economy for the public realm. The Bridgestone project is a microcosm of a wider trend towards urban farming of the public realm, which is being fuelled by the city’s regeneration agencies and chambers of commerce.  The microcosm is a manufactured landscape generated by the city’s agencies and chambers of commerce, which then profit from the creation of the illusion of urbanity.  As the Bridgestone project demonstrates,</text>

A space for contemplation and design might be useful in the urban setting, but what is more useful for the functioning of the biennale is contemplation of how to make the City a site for creative urban activity – creative in the sense of the ‘creative class’ – through a site-specific collaborative process, exploring how architecture can support that activity. Creative class’s cultural orientations are constructed around the idea that the City of London is the location of its wealth and power, and that the country contains its cultural resources. The Biennale is committed to exploring how the City can support a site-specific approach to cultural activities, while simultaneously challenging its status as a ‘relational space’.  The Biennale has commissioned a multi-disciplinary team of artists, designers, landscape architects and writers to contribute to its cultural centre, ‘The Resident’, which will house performances, installations, meetings, workshops, and more. The team includes senior curatorial roles, including the curatorial</text>

A space for contemplation and designPublic art is often characterised by their inaccessibility and potential loss of use – being exploited by art collectors and the urban poor alike. A more accessible form of public art, also known as ‘affordable’ or ‘geared towards a community of artists’ audiences’ – is what the Biennale is attempting to achieve. The Biennale website makes it clear that the project is specifically designed to appeal to artists:  The Biennale is a space for contemplation and design, created to engage with questions of access, identity and place. Its purpose is to question, create encounters and (once again) invite a conversation. It is a forum for dialogue, but it is also a site of confrontation and conflict. The Biennale is a global phenomenon, so ‘site-specificities’ are pervasive. However, the Biennale’s unique relationship to the City of London is a result of its location: its affluent, predominantly white</text>

A space for contemplation and design might be an appropriate approach to the problem at hand, but what is more important is that the Bridgestone space serves as a physical and conceptual barrier to the City’s ongoing economic and spatial encroachments. This physical and conceptual malleability is crucial to the city’s continued economic survival. Without it, the city would become ever more reliant on external sources of funding, and its citizens would become ever more debt-ridden. With it, the city becomes ever more reliant on external suppliers of housing. The need for the Bridgestone project arose in large part because of its potential to change the face of transport links in the City, and in particular, to disrupt the City’s antiquated policy of townships.  The adoption of a publicly funded ‘place-based’ design is not without risks and pitfalls. The potential loss of privacy, cultural loss, and disruption to communities are among them. Nevertheless, the risks and benefits of such initiatives are undeniable</text>

A space for contemplation and design might be useful for the city’s ongoing dialogue around its urban fabric, and for the city’s continued economic existence. A publicly-funded, locally-sustained, artist-led project such as this one might well become a locus of resistance and imagination, or it might succumbs to the institutionalisation of creative destruction. In either case, the future city will most likely rule the original city into which it is put.  A city is a complex system of interrelated parts, and as such it is possible that parts of the city have found their way into the project. This is true of areas served by the London Gallery, such as Kensington, where the artist-led initiative ‘Kensington Artspace’ was born, or the district around to which the Biennial™ will travel in 2017, including the entire Kensington Market.

A space for contemplation and designCommunity land trusts, publicly-owned land trusts, and publicly-funded ‘space-use projects’ are among the earliest public forms of patronage for architecture and design that emerged during the twentieth century. Despite their public characterisations, and the need for public money to support these new kinds of projects, the origins of these programmes are often blamed on an economic quirk or a capitalist fantasy. In Britain and the West, this has often been attributed to the impact of the post-war housing boom, which in turn has often been attributed to a burst of speculative property building in the wake of the housing crisis. But these trends can also be attributed to changes in the economic equation, with alterations in the function of finance capital (including the DEHP), and in particular, changes in the role of the architect. As the housing crisis deepened in the UK, more people were turning to alternative career paths. While this did mean more people were turning to architecture, it also meant that more of what</text>

A space for contemplation and design might be a better description of the space-use component of the plan, which is why I have chosen to focus on the design and artwork of the building itself, rather than my photographs. The intention of the design is to offer a glimpse of a different world through architectural means, rather than imposing a specific mode of inhabitation on the city. If such modes of spatiality emerge as a by-product of the market for office space, why not utilise them to their fullest potential?  The other reason is that the mission of the newly-formed GLA is to develop alternative strategies for the City of London, and this project, if anything, goes further in that regard. The GLA’s current political considerations notwithstanding, the main objective of the project is to support the office building’s environmental impacts and foster a dialogue with the local residents’ organisation. The project has its environmental considerations down to a fine art degree, but it is aimed at supporting an office block that</text>

A space for contemplation and design might be useful for the project, but the real innovation is in the way in which the architects and their clients engage with the public realm, in an engaged, innovative or playful way. The developers encourage and even support local communities to take over the sites and make spaces as convenient and livable as possible, using existing infrastructure and infrastructure artworks as building materials, public realm landscaping and public realm benches as public realm public realm public realm public realm. The developers even sponsor ‘community action projects’ that engage local people in the construction of their public realm projects.  A good example of this is the PPSI ‘mock-up’ project that was started by local people to see how the new urban design school they attend might be developed into a building project. The architecture and planning committee at the GLA might not like the idea, but they’re very supportive of the people involved.

Biennial as spectator and participant 	[i] 	can be defined as follows: ‘It is a term frequently used by art historians and art critics to denote a particular vantage point in time, place, or cultural history.’ It is often cited as an ‘true statement’, though it is often unclear what exactly the term means. I will attempt to explain in order to help you understand what I mean. 	When we think of art and art history in the contemporary context, we often think of artists who have their work displayed at major museums or galleries.

It is one that contemporary artists face in their efforts to engage with and contribute to the public in major cultural institutions and to the biennial in general.The contemporary biennial is a ‘collectors’ item. It is a regular item on the art-to-consumer market, a staple of the art museum and a staple of the high street. It is a regular visitor to the museum, a regular visitor to the high street, and a regular visitor to the museum itself. It is the familiar face of the art-value chain, its familiar territory, and its recognizable style. It is a regular visitor to the local shops and market, and it is a regular visitor to the museum. It is a ‘real life’, a mythical creature with which artists, curators and artists’ families have been entwined for generations. It is a ‘real-life’ figure whose ‘graphic identity and literal life’ render the art form real life in a manner that is both familiar and novel.

It is one that contemporary artists face in their efforts to engage with and contribute to the public in major cultural institutions and to the biennial in general. It is a paradoxical situation, to be sure, but the fact of engagement and cultural capital are made manifest through these institutions and their activities. And today, these many different forms of socialization are the subject of intense selection pressures. It is this ongoing selection of traits, characteristics and experiences that create and define what is deemed ‘the&quot; contemporary contemporary contemporary. And of course, this does not include the broader effects of postmodernism and the subsequent commodification of culture in the global market. We do not yet have a full description of the diverse values and attitudes that generate and characterize the contemporary culture of the biennial, and the importance of conducting research on this in order to generate knowledge about the practices that shape this contemporary culture. But what is becoming increasingly clear is that the biennial itself is susceptible to this commodification and is contributing to the socialization of cultural capital by other means.

It is the biennial that participates in the social event through its varied forms, through which it becomes embedded in the social totality, and through which it produces and contributes to ever larger social changes. And it is here that we encounter the recurring problem of participation: how can the art scene be involved in the social when it is not even aware of what is happening? How can biennials take part in the social, but not take part in the social, but participate in the social? This is the conundrum of the participating biennial. It is one that contemporary artists face in their efforts to engage with and contribute to the public in major cultural institutions and to the biennial in general. It is a predicament that contemporary artists and contemporary art today face not only in Istanbul but also in any city where art and the biennial meet.Art’s present and future role in the city is determined by many other forces, including the cultural and economic power of the biennial, and the city’s other actors, such as the tourism board, tour operators, festivals and their stakeholders, as well as the local communities that comprise and are embedded within the biennale. These other actors are themselves increasingly important players within the city and its nomadic urban landscape. When they are all taken into account, the total impact of art and the biennial on the city and its people is significant, even when considering the factors listed above.Art’s present and future role is determined by many other forces, including the cultural and economic power of the biennial, and the city’s other actors, including the local communities that comprise and are embedded within the biennale</text>

It is one that contemporary artists face in their efforts to engage with and contribute to the public in major cultural institutions and to the biennial in general. It is also one that biennials will inevitably confront in the years to come, as their history and the sites from which they emerged continue to be written.I have been developing a project, Documenta 13, that will take place over the course of two years (2013-14) in Rome, Italy. Documenta 13 is the name of the Italian cultural federation that I will be joining. Documenta 13 is a Rome-based biennale that is concerned with the transmission and writing-on-records of cultural practices worldwide. It is part of a broader initiative to re-imagine the biennale as a multi-year cultural event, and part of a project to understand how art today plays a role in the future of culture. Documenta 13 will be a ‘day-night’ event, with several episodes dedicated to art, performance, and art’, taking place concurrently across different city nights. Documenta 13 will be the Italy-based successor</text>

It is one that contemporary artists face in their efforts to engage with and contribute to the public in major cultural institutions and to the biennial in general. It is a predicament that artists like David Hockney and David Fahy found themselves in during the 1990s and early noughties, when the US artworld was rocked by the arrival of the now infamous Columbine High School shooting, and by the nadir of the epidemic with its cover of blaring rock music, billboards of dead children and ubiquitous TV sets. There is a way to engage with these social  	images that is both sensitive to the culture of the weapon and the social, but also to the fact that these images are not images at all; they are encoded cultural practices. Art and the people who make it are not innocent in their actions, but there is a way to read these images through the social and cultural systems that they are embedded in, and these cultural systems produce and contribute to the daily life of people all over the world.  	Looking Backwards in History 	There are many cultural references in  	Looking Backwards in History</text>

There is no public, nor is there any public of the exploited or exploited of a particular ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality or social background. There are only the biennials – privileged and credentialed visitors to the Biennale who happen to be visiting the Biennale grounds and cities in the same way as others do. There is no public that is not privileged and that does not feel like a public. There is no public that does not feel like a public.There is no identity or sense of public in the real life or in the design of objects or behaviours that are reproduced in the real-life or virtual worlds that are part of the biennial experience. There is however, an object that all biennials share, and this is often referred to as ‘the biennial identity’: the fact that we are witnessing the same events in different contexts, different bi</text>

It is one that contemporary artists face in their efforts to engage with and contribute to the public in major cultural institutions and to the biennial in general. And it is a predicament that contemporary artists do not yet understand or perceive. The participating biennial is a social event that engages with the very notion of culture as such. But it is also a social event that is itself a production of the city in ever greater and more pervasive ways. It is, in other words, a critical event in its own right. And it is this sense of production that contemporary art is acutely aware of. In a recent exhibition at the Tate Modern Art Gallery, the artist Emily Pringle spoke about the importance of the biennial in her exhibition The Elephant in the Room. She did not, however, engage with the fact that her exhibition was both a production of and a reflection of the city in which it was located. She did not engage with the fact that her exhibition was itself a production of the city in which it was located. She did not engage with the fact that her exhibition was also a production of the city in which it was located. She did not</text>

It is one that contemporary artists face in their efforts to engage with and contribute to the public in major cultural institutions and to the biennial in general.  	And what can a participating biennial do? Well, a very interesting question and one that biennial commissions continue to pose is what constitutes a ‘true representation’ of a given city. Is it a depiction that takes into account the historical and contemporary condition of the place, or is it a fusion of different historical and contemporary representations of the place? And again, this is a multi-tiered question, and one that contemporary artists face in their attempts to create biennials that can be trans-specifically engaged with and contribute to the public and collective imagination of a given city. Modern and contemporary art have collectively created a ‘representational zipper’ that interconnects different eras, operating at different speeds. What this zipper represents is an evolving amalgamation of different cultural moments and different urban experiences. And this is true not only of artists’ creations, but also of cultural collections, public monuments and exhibitions. Today, we are experiencing a digitised version</text>
