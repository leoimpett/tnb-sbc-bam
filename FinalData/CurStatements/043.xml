[2] 	In this regard, the alpine terrain that would be viewed as the alpine (in the form of an elevated passageway) is a useful template for the urban landscape that would render the logic of growth and change that characterises it obsolete. This urban landscape would render the alpine as a landscape that can be cordoned off and controlled, while offering opportunities for passive recreation and passive learning, in the form of ‘cultural gardens’ and ‘learning zones’ that would enable ‘children’ to ‘enjoy the beauty of the landscape but also the effects of growth through research’, while providing ‘a respite from the pressures of the urban environment’ through learning zones ‘where people can relax and immerse themselves in the subtleties of urban life’. 	[3] The alpine also serves as a site of conflict, where people from different places and cultures come together to ‘reclaim</text>

[2] The timeline below follows this initial urban core, but profiles the development of the metropolis during this time. 	[3] The first urban centers were built primarily to handle and exchange goods and people – a post-industrial form of the former – and the later industrial cores were built primarily to handle and exchange goods and people. 	[4] The relevant time frame here is roughly from the mid-1970s, but can be extended back further. 	[5] As noted in the text, the main root of this problem is the expansion of post-WWII capitalism, which saw the industrial base consolidating in Europe and North America while the new economies emerged in China and other parts of the world. As a consequence, the size and shape of the new urban centers grew. 	[6] This is an evolving problem, and I will return to it in a moment. 	[7] Of course, the aim of such centres is to</text>

[2] The project was also directed by Christopher Booker, the curator of architectural forms at the British Museum, who heads the curator-training programme at the Royal College of Art. The programme is designed to equip the Museum as an agency with the necessary skills to undertake ‘cultural geography’ at a planetary scale, but also to provide the backdrop for a multi-year ‘deep dive’ into ongoing themes and projects. The Museum is particularly encouraged to take part in the programme, but it must first prove itself capable of undertaking a significant curatorial project. The programme is currently seeking proposals for a second year, with a finalised programme for 2016-17 already planned. [3] See: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/programme/index.html.

[2] The process began with an initial exploration of the geographical locations of the alpine centres of the world, but soon turned to the city. The International Accounting Standard Committee was established in 1960, and included representatives of all the main accounting firms in the world. In 1962, the convention was amended to take place in the city. The committee’s report, published in 1967, stated: 	[i]t is now generally agreed that the main functions of an accounting firm are to carry out commerce, and not to carry out legal or geopolitical activities. 	[ii] In recent years, this has been seen as a trend, as accountants increasingly take on legal and geopolitical roles. But in an effort to remain globally competitive, many accountants opted to expand their businesses beyond the legal and geopolitical zones.

[2] 	The Cultural Geographer, Michael Slack, defines the ‘curation of space’ as follows: ‘The contemporary urban space is being made by culture, and space is being made in response to it.’[3] In other words, the cultural planners’ fantasy is that the built environment will be reinvigorated in some way, that ‘once a space has been made, it’s essentially a site where ‘creative activity can take place’. Space is to be reclaimed, made over, made present again in some way, and that’s what spaces are to a certain degree. 	[4] 	Space is made manifest in some other ways as well. For example, the fact that we inhabit ‘the city’ as a cultural commodity in some form or another is a fact of which the city is conscious, even if it’s not consciously so as we might think of it.</text>

In doing so, he identifies a set of characteristics that he calls the ‘core geography of cities’, which include but are not limited to: the built environment, the built circulation, the built infrastructure, and the built material culture. 	[4] The core geography of cities is a set of relations that emerge from and depend on one another, often unconsciously or not so unconsciously.

[2] The idea that the alleys surrounding the core of a major city would be ‘sacred to the city’ gained currency in the wake of the Black and Brown (BH&amp;B) movement in the late 1960s, which argued for the re-constituting of ‘sacred’ alleys around ‘representing points of commonality’. Legal challenge to the alleys task force led to a Supreme Court ruling in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education, which established a right to ‘hear and speak’ in public schools. 	[3] The alleys of the core have been a point of contention since the mid-1970s, when politicians in London and other places wanted to make them into zones of 'sacred urban space’. One politician’s proposal was for a zone within the core of the city called ‘The Shard’ – named for the medieval English codex that includes the biblical books</text>

[2] The European concept of the ‘Common Market’ encompasses a convergence of values [to which all Europeans are committed – in theory, even if not in practice] – but at a global scale this convergence is occurring at a rate that is far too rapid for the vast majority of humanity. Understandings of Community, a.k.a. the Post-Common Market, are spreading. The global market for cultural goods is made up of many different versions, and different regional actors within and between these different versions are engaged in different activities. Understandings of Community are created, not by finding common values, norms, or practices, but by understanding how cultural goods are produced, consumed, traded and transferred across these different social medias. A multitude of local actors are engaged in this process of cultural production and consumption, but at the same time, the same actors are also engaged in this process of cultural circulation and cultural management. As a result, the number of identified participants in the Global Cultural Persistent</text>

Many contemporary art institutions have their origins in the social world of the biennial; their organisational structure is often more like a festival. In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the rarest of beasts, and its practitioners are the rarest of creatures, bereft of the common citizenship. But the social world of the biennial is no longer the rarest of beasts. The post-biennial social world is a social world in which institutions, whether international or local, are constantly juggling, shifting and out of whack, and in which the once-inaccessible ‘common space’ is now everywhere but nowhere. 	Art’s increasing institutionalised character – from being confined to museum collections to being made into a commodity by market forces – is a reflection of its (rampant) commercial valences. The biennial is no longer the rarest of creatures, but it is the most globally visible of exhibitions, and this global visibility comes with an institutional cost. The biennial needs to be strategically placed, and its location constrained to a particular set of cultural localities, lest it deviate from these localities in unpredictable ways.

Many contemporary art institutions have their origins in the social world of the biennial; their organisational structure is often more like a festival. In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the unchanging face of change, while the biennial is the ephemeral voice of the past, with no fixed place in time or space. The social dimension of the biennial has come to dominate the biennial as a conventionally understood concept. However, the social dimension of the biennial will continue to be a defining characteristic of the institution, and it is this definition that needs to be constantly renegotiated. The social dimension of the biennial will be defined by the methods and political orientations of its adaptive social construction. The social dimension will also need to be renegotiated in the face of new technological and cultural formations that are reshaping the world in ways that are not neatly divided between the modes of production and consumption that were designed and implemented today, and those of tomorrow. This is the postulation and implicit assumption of the twenty-first century. The art market is in a state of constant technological evolution, and its purchasing behaviour is also constantly reshaped by the political and economic whims of</text>

Many contemporary artists, curators included, have their origins in the social world of the post-autonomous; their practice is often curatorial in character. Many contemporary art institutions have their origins in the social world of the biennial; their organisational structure is often more like a festival. In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the norm, and its members are the exception, not the rule. But it is art students who have their roots in the social world of today; they are the artists, curators, writers and administrators who have their imaginations run wild by the seemingly harmless and often innocuous-looking formations that make up the biennial. Art and art history will, of course, always inform tomorrow’s culture, and art and art history will always be an important part of the contemporary art and cultural heritage, both in the UK and internationally; but today, cultural institutions and their students are often run by people who came to the organisation as job-hunters, or students, or both. And today, many of these people are either employed by the institutions or have family and community lives outside the institution. The biennial has certainly not been kind to its artists, curators, writers and administrators; it has certainly capitalised on the potential of these people, as artists, curators, artists and cur</text>

Many contemporary art institutions have their origins in the social world of the biennial; their organisational structure is often more like a festival. In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the one that is in control, and where the checks and balances that keep contemporary art from becoming stale and institutionalised are weak, the biennial is the one that is the limelight and the centre of attention. In the artistic world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the rarest of creatures: it is the visitor that counts, and so it is the duty of curators to nurture that rare visitor and make him or her a part of the artworld again and again and again.  One could ask what a biennial is today in the US and abroad. The common denominator among these curatorial pronouncements is that the biennial is the rarest of curative substances: the most visible, the most successful and the only one that can claim the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In essence, each localised biennial is an extension of the main exhibitionary biennial (with a secondary, but persistent, role as a weekend tourist destination), and each</text>

Many contemporary art institutions have their origins in the social world of the biennial; their organisational structure is often more like a festival. In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the most visible and recognisable, yet its organisation is far less widely understood.  The question of what constitutes a biennial remains contested and variable, with legal pronouncements on this matter being scarce and ambiguous, and subject to change at any moment. A landmark case in the 1990s was the Venice Biennale, which recognised the importance of its position as a ‘global cultural icon’ in the year it began. The new ‘biennial’ is an international phenomenon, and its international character is evidenced by its expanding international categorisation. It has become a regular feature of major exhibitions and major biennials around the world, and is likely to remain so.  The popularity of contemporary art and the number of artists appearing in these exhibitions and biennials is likely to continue to increase, as is evident in the growing numbers of biennials themselves. It is likely that the number of artists currently exhibited in these exhibitions and biennials will continue to grow, and that the</text>

Many contemporary art institutions have their origins in the social world of the biennial; their organisational structure is often more like a festival. In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the observer, the spectator and the editor, and the biennial is the topic, the collection and marker. But why observe or narrate in this way? Why ‘follow the trends’? Why not ‘face the changes?’ Why not ‘follow the fads?’ Why not ‘follow the magic of the crowd?’ Why not ‘follow the magic of the place?’ Why not ‘follow the magic of the place-making?’ Why not ‘follow the magic of the place-takings?’ These are the kinds of questions that haunt modern art today. Curators, artographers, arts educators, artists and arts professionals are a constant source of inspiration and informa- tion for their curatorial projects. Their stories, curatorial pronouncements and projects are a constant subject of revision and reiteration. The question that remains, however, is what can be done with the art, or better, what can</text>

Many contemporary art institutions have their origins in the social world of the biennial; their organisational structure is often more like a festival. In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the rare object of historical and canonical value; it is regarded as a rarefaction of contemporary art with a distinctive set of distinctive characteristics, rare in its own right. In the institutional world of the biennial, the biennial remains the rarest of curiosities; its intrinsic value and intrinsic value-producing potential remain unaddressed. However, the institutional value of the biennial remains something like its scarcity: there is a market for such things, and it exists in some form or another regardless of its intrinsic value or intrinsic scarcity. A more accurate and precise rendering of the biannual as a social world-system would render it as a social-economic world-system. The institutional production of the biennial is the production of social valence in art and artefacts, and the production of social values in art and artefacts through the production of social uses of art and artefacts. In the art world, the value produced by the biennial is recognised in contracts between art gallery owners</text>

In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the new triennale. All biennials today must grapple with the problem of urban sprawl, which is a global phenomenon. And all biennials today must address the challenge of urbanicity, which is a global quest. Yet the challenge to urbanicity today is not a ‘quest’ but a ‘tendency’, which is why biennials are so frequently accused of being driven by a self-absorbed elite. The tendency today is to travel outside the city, to live more ‘remotely’, to consume more ‘metabolically intensively’, and to become more mobile ‘all the time’ – all in the name of trips abroad, mass consumption and so on. And of course, the city is vast and complex and urbanisation has become ever more of a ‘convenient feature’ of life in the metropolis. Biennials today often act as if the city is a settlement – a</text>

In the social world of tomorrow, the biennial may be an occasional phenomenon or a transient curatorial focus; in the biennial’s future, it may well be a regular event with a public realm attached. The aim of the present research project was to develop an artist's perspective on the implications of a biennial for contemporary art practice, while also questioning the institutional and political conditions of art today. Our project began with a design competition, which invited entries in a raffle to a) identify a contemporary art practice that could be enhanced by the introduction of biennials into contemporary art’s repertoire; and b) propose a ‘re-constituted' art museum that would offer a ‘true representation of the present’ through ‘design, engineering, urbanisation and perhaps even cultural politics’ of the city.

The system would then, in part, seek to reconcile these divergent experiences by: a) simulating the actuality of displacement to serve as a metaphor for the new millennium of urbanisation; b) offering a solution by merging the concepts of culture and infrastructure; c) creating a dynamic between contemporary art and existing infrastructure; and d) proposing a new public realm through the suggestion and implementation of new modes of cultural organisation. Many contemporary artists, curators included, have their origins in the social world of the post-autonomous; their practice is often curatorial in character. Many contemporary art institutions have their origins in the social world of the biennial; their organisational structure is often more like a festival. In the social world of today’s biennial, the biennial is the rarest of curiosities: it is the rarest of curiosities because of its ubiquity, and the rarest of curiosities because it is so elusive. But the social dimension of the biennial is what Lacy means when she speaks of ‘the city in its relentless pursuit of quantity, and everything in its ever more pervasive and pervasive measurement and capture’. And today, the biennial is precisely this quantifiable; it is commodity after commodity after commodity, constantly in search of the next slick new shiny object to prop up its already glutted market.Today, the biennial is, in its constant quest for more and more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever more and everywhere ever</text>

The museum becomes the locus of the body of knowledge of a given culture, and the locus of the experience of that culture. It is both a site of acquisition (of knowledge) and a site of destruction (of knowledge). The museum is the site of the cultural-political-ideological journey, and the site of the political-ideological-legal-cultural-economic journey.

The site of the cultural-political-ideological journey is the museum. But the museum is not simply a site of acquisition. It must also render a particular culture intelligible to a national audience, and to international ones at that. I believe that the way to do this is through something called a ‘curatorial caucus’, a group of people who work in concert to come up with a shared vocabulary to describe the same thing, and who can then translate this into a global idea. For example, the word ‘caucus’ has a plural form: ‘counselling societies’, and they can also be called**circles of interest groups or networks. The basic idea is that there are many layers to a culture, and that each layer represents a different experience or set of experiences. For instance, there is the collective experience of a nation or a people, which is what I call the ‘nation’ experience. Then there is the personal experience of an individual person or a group of individuals,</text>

If the historical pilgrimage is the cultural-political-ideological journey of the twentieth century, then the legal-cultural-economic-legal-cultural-racial-political-religious pilgrim is the twentieth century itself. The museum, then, is the ultimate archive, with the final word in this historical journey being uttered by the curatorial hand. It carries with it, in the memory of the visitor, the traces of cultural practices, both those of the twentieth century (the meaning of which remains) and those of other eras (the meaning of which remains). It is here that the cultural practices of the era are remembered, and its increasing importance in contemporary cultural studies is emphasised. It is here that the geographical and the temporal collide, and the museum is the site of the cultural collision. The museum is the ultimate archive, and its current composition reflects this.

And the site of the cultural-political-ideological-legal-cultural encounter is the museum. All of these movements of knowledge make use of the museum as a site of encounter, of learning, of re-appropriation. As S.D. Redpath puts it, ‘the museum is the place where power is created and destroyed’. This is a really interesting way of looking at the museum today. It is both the site of acquisition and destruction. The museum is the object of desire, the site of the acquired, the object of return. It derives its power from the very fact that it is a museum, and through the very nature of its architecture, its collections, its programming, its displays, and its function as the locus of experience-making, of meaning-making, of knowledge making, of all kinds of possibilities of politicising the museum.

My father was an art historian and a professor at Loyola University Chicago. We lived in the neighborhood of Clybourn Avenue and Clybourn Avenue East, which is a Greek Revival neighborhood in Loyola University's English Building. My father was a leader in the community; we called ourselves the Community Board of the New Chinatown. We started a chicken coop, and the building we lived in was our church hall. We had a church-sponsored cafeteria, but the building was our school's social centre, where we would meet on Sundays for church-sponsored activities, and also where we would meet other students to participate in school projects, like installing a new van for</text>

In the twentieth century, the museum became an instrument of knowledge production; today it merely reproduces what has become a universal knowledge. But the museum as such is not universal; it is subject to the city’s politics of the museum and the politics of exchange. Curators, artists, historians, and others who work in and contribute to the museum, on the other hand, are often active agents of their own understanding, and in a number of cases actively contribute to the politics of the notion of history. I think of some of the projects that have come out of the museum as being very much in the spirit of the Cold War era. They’re interested in the political implications of the historical setting, and in this I follow the tropes of a good spy-service. I’d also add a few</text>

I do not mean to suggest that the museum is immune to the political, economic and symbolic shifts that characterise contemporary urbanisation, nor that it is immune from the influence of those changing the face of places and peoples. But the museum is uniquely positioned as the site on which the political, economic and culturally responsive narratives encounter each other. And I believe that this is happening at a pace that is not pre-set by the political and economic dynamic, nor that is immune from the influence of those changing the face of places and peoples.

In the twentieth century, this would have meant in part entering into partnerships with museums, because the nation is the site of the experience and the object of the cultural-political-ideological encounter. But this has come to seem both economically untenable (in our times of excessive national consumption), and politically unreasonably so. The museum is both the site of consumption and the site of production, and this is why so many museum collections now exhibit work from the current administration, or at least from previous administrations. It is the political vehicle for the consumption of knowledge, and therefore the contemporary museum is the museum that will support and facilitate that consumption. More and more, I believe, this is the thinking of the artists who curate the galleries, and the curators of the nation state.

As biennials everywhere become more institutionalised, more representative of the UK as a whole, including the UK as an institution, things are bound to get more complex. This means that the biennial must exert a degree of control over its images, its language, its institutional resources, and its subjects. In order to achieve this, the biennial needs to be able to articulate clearly its relationship to the museum, and it needs to be able to negotiate the complex web of subjects it creates. In short, the museum and the biennial cannot be identical, nor can they be equally representative of the UK. This is why biennials find themselves perpetually moving between great cultural capitals – great museums, great art institutions, like their US and German counterparts – while museumary collections are typically much less visible. Indeed, the failure to present a biennial with a clearly defined and historical purpose is a serious problem for the biennial, because it sets the museum back – it undermines its authority and legitimacy – while simultaneously reinforcing its own power. As biennial visitor numbers continue to decline, this second problem is a problem. The biennial is in a kind of crisis of visibility, while the museum is enjoying</text>

As biennials everywhere become more institutionalised, more representative of the UK as a whole, including the UK as an institution, things are bound to get more complex. This means that the biennial must exert influence not only on what it shows, but also on what it doesn’t show. The way to do this is through the art galleries and museums, but this is not easy to define or define, nor is it possible to replicate in every case. Rather, the key is a policy of inclusivity, of giving priority to what is distinctive about the UK in exchange for what is not, regardless of what is and isn’t unique to the UK. In this context, the .Expo is a classic example of what biennials can and cannot be. It is a unique institution, with its own unique set of interests, and its own unique set of curatorial approaches. It is a biennalisation of the art institution, and through its curatorial judgements, such institutions often end up creating their own institutionalised forms of knowledge production. This is why biennials can be so influential in changing how people think about art institutions and the relationship between art and</text>

This means that the biennial must exert influence, even momentarily, over its environment, and the way in which it is governed (how it is governed, perhaps, in order to survive). The significance of this in the context of the public realm, though, is that these large-scale transformations are often made with little public engagement or resistance. The biennial is a prototypical event that requires us to be open to new ideas and experiences, and to care about what we do not know. It is a biennial in which knowledge is actively generated and contested, and in which knowledge is used to make sense of the world.  Horizons opens the door to new modes of engagement, new ways of looking at the world, and new possibilities of knowing. But it is also a place where the art of biennials is made manifest through material and intellectual means, in the form of materials and images, that are often opposed to the very means by which they are made.

This means that the biennial must exert a kind of constant, though constrained, reinvention on what it can and cannot contain, and on what it wants to promote. It is true that the biennial has become something like a monolith, as all those many exhibitions and as many books that cater to the specific needs of the visitor. It is also true that this monolithisation has caused the biennial to lose its unusual, sometimes fascinating character, and that the museum might also fall under this kind of monolithy. But there is no way of knowing until the event itself, because the biennial is often portrayed as being in crisis.11 . Shifting Circulation Curated through the John Lennon Performing Arts Centre at Liverpool John Moores University, the Biennale was first staged in Liverpool in 1983, followed by a two-year stint in New York and Los Angeles.

This means that the biennial must exert influence beyond its borders, in order to achieve real, lasting change. The art world is a powerful actor, but it is the lesser of two evils, with real effects on the ground. The Biennale was a particularly potent, even game-changing, actor. It ushered many thousands of visitors into communities and engaged audiences worldwide. It marked a turning point in the history of the art world in many ways, for many reasons, and it still represents a turning point in the art world in many ways. But it is the biennial that ultimately does the work. The .Expo is the point where the big guns fire. It is a moment when art is meant to happen, but its place is more like a provocation. It is a moment where art is made visible, but its realisation is rare. In that moment, the Biennale is the high water mark of contemporary art outside of major museums. It is a moment where art is made permanent, but its permanence is</text>

The question that remains, however, is how to produce such knowledge in the context of a large-scale urban redevelopment scheme, as happened in Liverpool, while maintaining access to cultural amenities and stimulating local economies. This is a question that has not been fully answered, although a number of proposals can be seen as a starting point.

As biennials everywhere become more institutionalised, more representative of the UK as a whole, including the UK as an institution, things are bound to get more complex. This means that the biennial must exert influence beyond the borders of its birthplace, and the UK must also exert influence in order to produce the same effect. The question becomes: how to coordinate these conflicting demands? In an ideal world, the museum and the biennial would co-exist in a mutually beneficial, mutually transparent and inclusive way, allowing the biennial to take part in the curatorial process, whilst the museum provides critical insight into the genesis of the biennial but avoids taking part in the curatorial process itself. The .Expo allowed for the institutionalisation of the biennial, although it was obvious that this was only possible because the city, its government, and community members had all taken part in the conference. The fact that the conference was held in a city centre, in an area with a strong arts and cultural identity, while the actual exhibition took place in the countryside acted as a kind of internal border. The current biennial therefore needs to find a place in a city that is not necessarily antithetical to its history</text>
    <text>conventional curatorial practices and curatorial knowledge. The .Expo was an important event in the history of bienniality in that it signaled the beginning of an important, though often neglected, leg of the race. It marked a transition from the art galleries, where biennials typically reside, to the contemporary museum, where these exhibitions typically take place. The .Expo was a time to experiment with the museum, to see what might be possible with the museum, and to see what the museum might be like. The .Expo served as a prototype for the kind of museum that would later be developed into the biennial. It is important to note that the Biennale was also a time to experiment, to see what the museum could be like, and to see what knowledge could be produced in the museum. As biennials everywhere become more institutionalised, more representative of the UK as a whole, including the UK as an institution, things are bound to get more complex. This means that the biennial must exert influence, both institutional and cultural, in order to maintain the credibility and relevance of its claims.  	Its 2016 address, Manhattan twice, and its continuing, though now diminished, role in the city are a claim that can still be made. It is time to change, and soon enough we must all join hands and start making claims. The challenge for all is to find the courage to claim what is rightfully ours.  	[1] See Jacob S.

This means that the biennial must exert influence beyond the art galleries, museums and primary education institutions, and it is up to the institution to exert power in such a way as to meet the changing needs of the society. The biennial as an exhibitionary form, and its relationship to the contemporaneous, necessarily entails a certain logic, which means that it is always open to critique. In an ideal world, the biennial would simply be a show with no fixed position, a place where we could freely encounter and inter-act, a place where ideas could freely mix and mingle, a place where people could freely come and go, and yet also a place where ideas could never be fully established or fully established at the same time. For the social, this would mean institutions providing the necessary resources to enable people to pursue their interests, providing the necessary knowledge so that people could pursue their interests with equal opportunity, and also enabling people to pursue their interests through a certain logic. The second element of the equation is that of power, which</text>

As biennials everywhere become more institutionalised, more representative of the UK as a whole, including the UK as an institution, things are bound to get more complex. This means that the biennial must exert influence beyond the art world, and beyond its local context. There is some indication that the Biennale is attempting to engage with notions of nationhood and identity, and to consider the role of cultural organisations in envisioning and building the future of the UK.Art is the contemporary form of exchange in which we live. We exchange it between cultures all the time, including in the art world. As a cultural form it has mechanisms for its own social organisation. As such it is subject to some forms of domination and oppression. But it is also a ‘metaphor’ to some extent. So while the Biennale hopes to produce a ‘big picture’ that reflects the current condition of the UK, it is also possible that the Biennale itself is attempting to create a kind of social organisation that is sensitive to and reflective of its own situation.In the last section of this book I explore the concept of the ‘British Isles’, and the ways in</text>

But it is important for artists to have the tools with which to work through their ideas, so that they can generate or respond to those ideas in other ways.</text>

The new structure, to be known, as an act of co-presence in the vein of Yiddish Dance, will hold its own in any of three venues: its sanctuary in the hotel will act as a stage, flanked by public plazas, while the public plazas will house the arts and culture of the region. 	</text>

The Biennial was one of the few remaining institutions of its kind in the UK, and the only institution of its kind in Russia. In recent years, other biennials have moved to cities in an attempt to compete with museums, but the fact that these are organisations with a strong cultural orientation and have a financial interest in the museum remains.[8] The Biennial’s mission statement extends:We’re developing three parallel but related strategies</text>

They are a form of public display or public display with a political, economic and social cast, both in the sense of the relative quantity and the quality of its contents. They are also a form of cultural exchange between nations, peoples and cultures, in which the local and the social are often present but absent. In this sense, they are momentary and take place in the present, although they are also frequently framed and contextualized within contested and unequal political, economic and social terms. I went to the Liverpool Biennial in March 2018, and will go there again in November 2018. Biennials offer a unique and often-misused form of public display.

It derives from the British Signal research project[1] and its coordinators, and its results have been published in numerous scientific and popular publications worldwide. Its application to the virtual isomorphic human-computer interface is a significant question. This journal examines the ways in which the interface is constructed, the ways in which it is understood, the challenges and possibilities of this new media of interaction, and its relation to the agency and politics of information in a globalised, ubiquitous and interconnected world.

It should encourage the kind of sharing and emulating that artisans and artists already enjoy in their societies, and should not be a project for the socialisation of art’s art workers or artists. It should be a place where ideas and opinions differ, and this is perhaps the single greatest underestimate of the power of ideas and diverse points of view in contemporary capitalism. In many ways, then, the role of the biennial should be to foster the exchange of ideas, and to foster the productive exchange between cultures and individuals. It should be a place where ideas from different points of view can converge in a shared endeavour, where ideas from different disciplines can freely trick one another into thinking that they have new understandings of reality. In this sense, in many ways, the role of the biennial should be to educate, to lure in new audiences and to foster the exchange of ideas. But this kind of understanding is possible only if the cultural institutions – cultural centres – take part in the process. If they do not, then the resulting lack of understanding and diversity</text>

The biennial should aspire to a radically different kind of socialisation of art’s social use. It should encourage the kind of sharing and emulating that artisans and artists traditionally enjoyed in the larger cultural centres of the world, and which can be seen as a new normalisation of social living in the city. It should also seek to influence the cultural institutions and their decisions in such a way as to maximise the benefit to all.This kind of cultural imperialism, of course, cannot happen at the global or regional level; it would be counter-productive and would indeed undermine the very basis of the biennial itself. But it can certainly happen at the local level, and it is certainly a concern of mine when art is being made in a way that is directly or indirectly dependent on the interests of corporate entities. It is easy to caricature such corporate entities as 'publics', but in reality they are often deeply embedded in particular locales and cultures, and are thus prone to a range of different forms of domination and subjugation. The biennial can and should aim to be a site of resistance. It should seek to interdict such forms of cultural imperialism</text>

The biennial should aspire to a radically different kind of socialisation of art’s social use. It should encourage the kind of sharing and emulating that artisans and artists do not naturally engage in, and the sharing and incorporating that art is the result of a given art gallery or museum being part of a cultural network, or being part of a large organisational structure. It should also encourage the kind of sharing and imitating that art is the result of a given art museum being part of a large social network, or being part of a large network of related art institutions, or being part of a cultural exchange that has other values than mere exchange. Such behaviour is already a reality for many artists and curators, for instance, who are drawn to the social use of art and the multitude of meanings that can be attached to it.  	When a biennial is a social enterprise, its primary purpose is to make life in the city better, and in that sense, it succeeds in many ways. However, it is also true that the purpose of the biennial has increasingly to match the value system of the multinational corporation, which has evolved to meet</text>

The biennial should aspire to a radically different kind of socialisation of art’s social use. It should encourage the kind of sharing and emulating that artisans and artists enjoy in their local artworlds, and should do so at a scale and in public places that reflect the richness and dynamic character of the city. It should also, of course, engage with the larger socio-political and economic systems that are currently the site of such social use. The current global economic model of the ‘postindustrial society’ is fundamentally based on the exchange of commodities (i.e. non-renewable resources) on a global scale. The emergence of sustainable energy resources through decarbonisation are of course of great concern to the biennial organisers of the present. But it is also becoming increasingly evident that the exchange of these resources will not necessarily result in the production of wealth and social progress.  Whether or not one agrees with the ideas of the Biennial as an entity, there is a need for the curatorial to communicate these ideas to an informed public; a task that may be described as problematic, schizophrenic and fractious.

The biennial should aspire to a radically different kind of socialisation of art’s social use. It should encourage the kind of sharing and emulating that artisans and artists enjoy in other contexts, but which they do not in this context, and which they do not in this context, and which makes it possible for talented individuals or small teams to put their own distinctive spin on this. It should also demand that artists and art galleries embrace this in other contexts. This is a social and cultural transformation that cannot be contained within the parameters of a nation-state. In the twentieth century, art and the biennial became national symbols, representing to a global audience a particular vision of the possibilities of art as a supplement to, rather than the main thrust of, national power. In the twenty-first century, the biennial may be seen as part of a globalised art industry, and perhaps the industry as a whole. The biennial may one day be a recognised icon of modern art. But it is important not to become attached to this. It is also essential for a critical understanding of contemporary art, and perhaps also for a kind of critical understanding of radical</text>

It may even involve some of these in socially desirable ways.But sharing and sharing are not the only kinds of social use that need to be promoted. Collaborative, collaborative and innovative practices need to be fostered and encouraged, as well as the kinds of people who can contribute to them. The kind of curatorial thinking and artistic production that engages with the politics, values and practices of the city in ways that are sensitive to its location, economies, identities, cultures and histories is possible only with the kind of collective involvement that is needed by a biennial to be able to exist and do what it sets out to do.

It should encourage the kind of sharing and emulating that artisans and artists perform today, as part of their everyday social activities, particularly when it comes to the arts’ socialisation of information and communication. It should also actively engage with the ways in which art is made today in the context of the city, in an attempt to produce a kind of ‘deep cutter’ that would not only be useful for the city but would also be a kind of currency and use-value for the city as a whole. Art’s Social Use The social use of art is a question that art institutions around the world are constantly asking themselves and each other. The question is not whether the art institution should be involved in an activity; the ‘institution’ is the locus of all institutional power. Rather, the question is which kinds of capacities can be developed and which kinds cannot. In other words, the institution is what enables, supports and engenders creativity. The institution is what creates the capacity to do things because it believes that doing</text>

It should encourage the kind of sharing and emulating that artisans and artists demand, and the pragmatic use of art as a social commodity, and should strive to create spaces and environments in which art can flourish in a way that its social uses demand and demand.  Its current initiatives, then, need to be seen as a starting point for further developments, and not an end in itself. If the curatorial and artistic departments of large multinational corporations are to continue to be inspired by the same art, then the question becomes which kind of art? The answer to that question will have a decisive influence on how the world sees and experiences art, whether in the form of prominent art galleries, or as a range of small, localised and individualised artworks produced in co-operation with, or at the instigation of, the curatorial.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is Associate Professor of English and Director of the English and Film Studies Department at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta.

It should encourage the kind of sharing and emulating that artisans and artists enjoy throughout the world, promoting not the art of the past but the art of the future that is both socially effective and ecologically sound.  Its current focus on the arts as social use feeds into the structural inequalities that still exist in many urban centres, but are fuelling now a form of dependency that can no longer be ignored. A kind of collective madness is fuelling a kind of ficto-feminism that is both socially permissive and economically destructive. This kind of schizophrenic form of globalisation is creating new kinds of enemies and opportunities, but it is also creating in many cities conditions that are as unstable as the previous ones. It is time to call a halt to this kind of capitalism. Art’s current global cultural consumption is a response to this kind of capitalism, and its consumption is neither global nor inevitable. It is the contradictory combination of both. The biennial as a collector of cultural artefacts is an artefact that is constantly seeking the latest turn of</text>

The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public spaces to make the city more aesthetically pleasing. New urban forms have been developed around the Alani site, with art galleries, restaurants, shops and museums galore – a mix of habitation and commerce straddling the historic Silk Road sites. It is the new normal for a city to feature cultural attractions, and in the recent past this included the ‘Purple Moose’ sculpture that stood for centuries in the middle of the street, along with other roadside sculptures that depicted prominent figures in the 20th century, including John Lennon, Mary Pickford and Stoke Mandeville. It was also a popular tourist destination, with tours often taking the city’s streetscape through a double-sided tunnel.

The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public spaces in an act of civil disobedience. The Alani Cultural District was officially established in 2010 and is comprised of two parks: One in Alani, a historic district with architectural styles strongly influenced by classical Hellenistic and Roman themes, and the other in Alani Basin, a tributary of the Alani River that provides a further ecological buffer. The district was chosen due to its rich natural resources, with copper, gold and iron deposits throughout much of the district. The creation of a cultural district around the river Alani in China coincided with the country’s real-time information technology, which allowed for the centralized monitoring of mass protests and unrest through crowd-sourcing online ‘feedback’ systems.

The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public spaces to thwart tourism. As a result, the city has seen several attempts to annex or create ‘cultural districts’ around the river Alani, most recently in the form of a district government in 2001.The Alani Valley is a land-use puzzle that is simultaneously a site of frequent violence and a refuge for artists and writers. During the 1990s, as the city grew larger and the Alani Cultural Districts were forcibly taken into public ownership, a second district around the Alani was created. This new district, named the ‘Riverside’ after the mythical Welsh river that runs through it, is home to the Alani Art Gallery, an exhibition venue, and the Alani Waters, a water park and splash pad for luxury yachts. While the Waters are technically privately-owned, they are heavily dependent on tourism, and as a result, the city government has a financial stake in the development of the district. As a result, any attempts to create</text>

The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public spaces to combat urban sprawl. Modern art is often exhibited in the area, as part of an urban redevelopment project, but the Alani cultural district is the first to experience an exhibition of its kind. The exhibition is organized by the Alani Art Foundation, the local branch of the Chinese Art Gallery, and China’s first Overseas Cultural Center. The proposal for the project, which was first presented in 2011, proposes ‘a new concept of the cultural district based on geography and time’, in order to better address the ‘disappearance’ of places of cultural importance to the city. The proposed concept is a repetition of a proposal first put forward by architect and urbanist Ming Jiaqi in the mid 1990s, who proposed a similar concept to the United Nation’s Convention Center.

The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public parks and squares, ‘cultural terrorists’ using recycled building materials, and so on. The Alani Cultural District was officially incorporated in 2005, and is the largest remaining remnant of the pre-internet pre-Cultural Revolution. It is situated in the middle of the city, a few blocks from major commercial corridors and railway stations. It is a rare urban space today, but a particularly precious one now that ‘urban sprawl’ is the primary mode of travel along the Alani River Valley. The district is particularly valuable as a site for the upcoming Formula One car race to take place. The venue is set to be built on the former site of a Chinese laundry, with an ‘elevation’ above the river’s banks, allowing the FIA a set of unprecedented flood-control features. The district also forms part of the site for the proposed ‘Luxury District’ development, which will see luxury apartments, a primary market for luxury goods</text>

The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public areas to conceal the presence of archaeological sites. In 2011, a settlement was announced in an ongoing legal battle over the location of the Alani cultural district. It would be relocated to the outskirts of Beijing, where it would be incorporated into the larger ‘New Beijing’ cultural district planned for the city.[9]Following the settlement, the city’s cultural district was to receive a new art museum, an educational complex with an outdoor stage, a market and a public park. The settlement was to be overseen by a new ‘cultural commission’ created in part through the settlement. The settlement was to operate independently from the city, with cultural residents taking over facilities provided by the city. The commission would be empowered to create ‘new urban environments’ and ‘recharge the cultural district’ through cultural management and the promotion of the district’s unique architecture, skills and practices.[10]In early 2013, the site was relocated to an area of Ingus</text>

Alani is the site of the ancient Silk Road, which links the Indian Wells of the West with the Chinese border in the mountains of Xinjiang. The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public spaces to make them ‘ugly and useless’, as one contemporary put it. Such cultural activism has been organized by the local government in cooperation with tourism firms and foundations. The aim of the cultural district project is to ‘reanimate’ ‘abandoned’ spaces by introducing ‘new growth’ to meet the needs of a rapidly urbanizing city. The cultural district concept is a convenient framing device that meets the needs of industry with the appearance of appearance. It has become a set of symbols for the expanding, suburbanizing city, while simultaneously structurally supporting the decline of the city. The Alani Cultural District is an example of how the Alani people have managed to occupy and use cultural resources in their historically marginal region. It is a ‘land bridge’ linking the two worlds of the Alani people and the wider region. As such, it is an example of how cultural resources can be employed in the service of the wider capitalist logic of</text>

Alani is the site of the ancient Silk Road, which links the Indian Wells of the West with the Chinese border in the mountains of Xinjiang. The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public spaces, sometimes in defiance of the authorities. It is also the site of several large-scale illegal construction projects, which include but are not limited to banks foreclosing on residential neighbourhoods and the demolition of historical buildings in an ongoing process of gentrification. The Alani Cultural District is a site of potential conflict and potential solutions. Inhabitants of the area include the Uighur people, who make up about 10% of China, and who form the largest ethnic minority in North China. They live in what is now China, Central Asia and the Caucasus. The Chinese government recognises the importance of cultural assimilation in reshaping the future of the Alani Valley, which is characterised by the historical residential neighbourhoods that were part of the Silk Road. The district is now known for its high-end residential neighbourhoods with access to high-speed internet, which were developed with government subsidies and oriented towards professionals.

The city’s cultural district has been a site of conflict and political agitation, with artists staging ‘pace-killers’ such as planting false micro-grasses or replanting desert grasses in public areas. In 2015, a federal court declared a First Amendment right to ‘pace-share’ in Alani, ruling that such ‘sharing...is not only a right, but a practice recognised by law and government to safeguard against urban sprawl and preserve and celebrate the place and identity of Alani for future generations to recall its glory’.[9] The city of Alani has appealed this ruling, arguing that the artists did not engage in ‘specific and timely cultural practices’ and thus do not share the city’s digital future. The issue is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court in December.Until then, the question remains whether the city of Alani should be able to revoke a cultural district’s right to ‘pace-share’ (a power granted by law to localities to ensure that ‘public space’s use and occupancy are shared equally). If granted, this could open the way for cities to national</text>

Nevertheless, the Alani District lies at the junction of two major transport corridors, one in the west and one in the east. When considering the ecosystemic systems that shape each other, it is easy to understand why the Alani District has been selected as the site for the ‘next big evolution’ of China’s port city. If, as Gao believes, the ecology of the port city is a complex system capable of supporting several more billion people, why not the ecology of the entire Chinese port? Why not the ecology of a city that hosts a large number of ports, but also</text>

    prototype for an intelligent curatorial system is imperative, but it is also possible that such a system could be entertained by intelligent citizens – people with a taste for novelty and an appetite for self-branding.  In an ideal world, such a system would monitor, collect and decipher data on everything it came across, and present its conclusions to a public that openly supports or takes umbrage with its conclusions. This is the kind of thinking and deep processes that allow new ideas to emerge, but it is also the kind of thinking that leads to social breakdowns and the emergence of new oppressions.

For more than just those with a digital footprint, I imagine that this kind of algorithmic synthesis could also apply to non-human entities – entities like corporations – though these are still bound up in the social fabric of society.  On the other hand, I feel less qualified to speak on behalf of the class when I don’t have the collective will or collective mind to do so: for me to do so would be to undermine my own position and credibility.  I’m more of a technologist, and my skillset is in fact what makes me an avatar of the powerful and influential.  This kind of thinking is at the root of much of what the AI will ultimately be capable of, since it will be working through the social infrastructure of the modern world.It is also worth noting that, while there is a clear division between machine learning and deep learning – systems that understand data and data structures – there is also a marked division between the two.</text>

So long as we humans are able to create and propagate images, creating new images that can be copied and shared, then recognisable patterns of behaviour emerge. And these patterns naturally evolve in response to changing conditions. And there are of course precedents in the history of humanity: the emergence of language, for instance, or the discovery of self-repairing DNA. But this kind of recognisable-looking-animal thinking emerges in unexpected places and at unexpected speeds. What I find fascinating about the way in which AI is designed to work, and how it is that we can still call this kind of thinking useful – even though it is fraught with potential dangers – is the fact that, when it comes to recognising humans as beings with agency, machines simply can’t be more human. In that sense, there is something fundamentally human about the way in which we interact with them. And there is something inherently machine about the way</text>

New technologies have made it easier than ever to create a recognisable image, but as we all know, this only works for so long and, as a final note, only serves to legitimise the very particular technology that created the image in the first place. New social formations are created and maintained through the repetition of a particular image and image-based practice.  And here is another thing: in the age of the image, new forms of symbolic association are also being formed. As new media such as social media and drones become more sophisticated and capable of gathering and contextualising data, the kinds of symbolic associations that were once made in person between disparate things happening now become weakened. New media such as drones also create new kinds of enfant terrible, in which things that once happened to be common now happen between people – a situation that is much like that of now. New media such as social media also create new kinds of liaisons between people, places and networks, but this</text>

It is also possible to transform one’s image (although not necessarily one’s image), but this is much more of a hack, and one must be creative and resourceful in order to pull this off. In the end, if the hopes of a creative class are to become actualised, then they must find creative ways of being made other than by way of existing in a database or virtual commodity form.This kind of thinking and the creative destruction it can cause is precisely what characterises contemporary art today. It is not the creations of an artistic genius, but reflects the ever greater weight and control that images now exert over our lives. When the internet was invented, there was a clear awareness that art should be able to operate across the vast web, and so the birth of the web browser was a logical extension of the work of artisans and webmasters who were already busy building impressive online presence after impressive online presence.

For example, the recent revelations regarding Edward Snowden highlight the growing disconnect between the digital and physical worlds. Digital identities are no longer created equal but are instead digital fragments with varying levels of integrity and authenticity that can be manipulated and altered in ways that are ultimately not lost but hackable. This raises the question: how are digital identities created? And how are digital fragments created?I have a speculative answer that comes to mind: in a work of art, perhaps the artist creates the digital identity but then analyzes this as a fragmented image that she then distributes across various social media platforms via a share-algorithm? I imagine a kind of peer-to-peer sharing but with the social media platforms operating in tandem with specialized servers located in different locations around the globe. These share-algorithms then collect data on the users of the social networks – what they say, where they are, and with whom they are – and then recreate the identity according to this data.

New social media platforms such as Facebook allow us to be part of a public Facebook of sorts, where we post photographs and videos of ourselves alongside relevant geographical and social data. This is in marked contrast to the present when public Facebooks are limited to a small circle of friends and strangers.  This kind of thinking and the rise of connectedness – which I identify as ‘progressive social engineering’ – is a response to a certain kind of dystopian future. It is the kind of future where people become experts in everything and everywhere and where technology becomes everything, in the sense that everything is now interconnected and data-rich.  This kind of future is not going to create happy, prosperous communities, but it does mean that we will all have to work harder and eat more meat and drink more wine and take more classes in order to keep our society from becoming ‘Facebook meets coffee and cake’ meets ‘Facebook meets haute cuisine’.

The challenge now becomes how to infuse this new kind of algorithmic design with the kind of culture and societal changes that actually change the nature of the world around. The kind of cultural and societal changes that actually make a difference. This kind of thinking, this kind of architecture, is what I call ‘deep learning’ and it is what will ultimately allow us to create truly new kinds of infrastructure and social systems.Download this article as PDFJussi ParikkaJussi Parikka is an architect and Principal in the office of Jussi Parikka, who is currently the Professor of Urban Studies and Co-Director of the Centre for Research Architecture at the Winchester School of Art.

New technological aids are constantly being developed that make it easier and more convenient to create a new avatar, and this is often seen as a positive thing. After all, the more we create recognisable characters, the more easily we can identify with them – a situation that was seen as a positive thing in the age of the Turing Machine. However, this kind of recognisable-character thinking about new technological aids as beneficial in creating more recognisable ones is what Orwell feared in ‘Great Britain’. This is why, in his dystopian novel Animal Farm, he describes how the adoption of new ways of looking at the world leads inevitably to totalitarianism. In the novel, the voices of history are repeatedly reminded of the necessity to choose between ‘greatness’ and ‘weakness’ – choosing between a better world and a weaker one.The fact that Aldridge lamented the loss of identity and sense of place that accompanies the spread of technology in Britain and America is</text>

For an example of this, consider an avian crime wave that I wrote about in the book Breed: The Rise and Fall of Avian Species. In that case, we could say that the upshot of a generalised avian neurosis is that we are all now infected with the same gene pool; we just happen to possess different avian viral strains. Avian crime wave one, by contrast, is that we are all simultaneously infected with a bacterial and a archavian strain of what is now called zoster. A bacterium called Helicobacter pylori is the primary cause of endemic zoster, but a third party, Streptococcus pneumoniae, is also a major player. In both cases, the organism that causes zoster is an unrelated, yet ubiquitous entity called Helicobacter pylori. The fact that both pylori and zoster are now found in the same gut flora – a gut flora that is itself a reservoir</text>

To some extent, this is due to the fact that, thanks to new ways of gathering data, it is possible to identify who you are even when you are not in physical contact with the data (though I will get to that).  Another aspect of this new sharing and connecting that I find particularly fascinating and interesting is the way in which social media is being used as a kind of giant screen – a screen that projects not only what you have said but also what others have said in real time. This is very much like listening to podcasts or watching live TV online, but instead of reading what others have said at the moment, you directly and immediately hear what others have said. It is as if the social media feeds of our connected society are proliferating at an exponential rate and as a result, our textual and non-literal language is being augmented with syntactic and semantic innovations that read like audio streams but also like video streams but also like radio streams but also like Instagram streams</text>

The Biennale would be the first in a new format to bring together a curator and an artistic group, and the first in a new environment to begin working with an artist on a curatorial role. As a curatorial undertaking, it would be an international one, operating in a new medium (video, radio, print, social media), with participants from all over the world. However, as the Biennale itself becomes increasingly political, the relationship between curatorial and arts needs to change, and with it the role of the artist and the community, if the Biennale is to operate in a way that reflects the collective needs and imaginations of the people who visit the cities.

As the number of cities in the biennale grew, the need to create a new type of city grew as well. The word ‘contemporaneous’ has been repeated many times in this document, often in relation to one another. In the case of New York and San Francisco, the word ‘interstate’ is used several times, and ‘one of the most prominent spatial systems within which it is encountered’, where two cities inhabit each other. But in the case of New York and San Francisco, the word ‘contemporaneous’ is preferred, and frequently enough, interchangeably</text>

The question of what counts as ‘contemporaneous’ and what is not, what counts as urban and what is not rural, which is to say, what counts as ‘the city’ and what is not, which is to say, what counts as urban and rural spaces, and so on.[3] The notion of the city as a living organism is a myth, and a failure of imagination would suggest that the city is made up of varied local ingredients, each with their own life-giving ecosystem, which we inhabit by virtue of being citizens of the city.

The importance of this can be seen in the curatorial handbook: the very first section entitled ‘Cities at a Glance’, written in 1950, describes the city as a ‘contemporaneous set of relations’.[2] This metaphorical ‘contemporaneous set of relations’ is an important turning of phrase, allowing us to see how the city is to be conceptualised through a photographic negative – as image, or perhaps as a series of images. This type of image shifts the focus from the city to the periphery of the material world, from the city to the village, from the city to the neighbourhood, and from the city to the street. This shift in focus is what artist Ai Weiwei and his team of artists, writers and researchers have been striving for, and what they’ve achieved, through their project The City without Boundaries. We can also consider their work in support of a European Union request to create a Prototype City Framework for the Biennale that would map the physical geography of the Biennale’s 2016 Curatorial Capital of Culture: Venice. This is the proposal that was presented at the Venice Biennale’s Special Exhibition Register on 15 January</text>

The importance of this can be seen in the curatorial handbook: the very first section entitled ‘Cities at a Glance’, written in 1950, describes the city as a ‘contemporaneous set of relations’.[2] The city is seen as a space in which the collective needs to be found, and the needs of particular communities as they become more visible and are invited to become part of the city. The need to be ‘visible’ in this new ‘contemporaneous set of relations’ is a requirement of modern urbanisation, and art is seen as an effective way of achieving this. In other words, while the Biennale may be seen as a relatively new phenomenon, its politics and social implications are much older than that. One can argue that there is an ‘inherent bias’ towards visualising cities, and the Biennale as a visual entity is a reflection of the political world in which we live, one that actively seeks to constrain artistic freedom and actively promotes the domination of space by a particular set of people. This is a situation where the artist is placed at a distinct disadvantage, and the city is actively encouraged to become what the Biennale</text>

The importance of this can be seen in the curatorial handbook: the very first section entitled ‘Cities at a Glance’, written in 1950, describes the city as a ‘contemporaneous set of relations’.[2] The urbanisation of the world through art is a global process, and art has a particular place in this history of the world. The ability of artists to inhabit and inhabit different parts of the world is a quality of the artist’s being, and a way to create a ‘contemporaneous void’.[3] But the ability to create a different kind of space for different kinds of people is a more immediate means to an even greater end: the end of civilisation as we know it. Art has an immediate and simple but powerful way of creating alternatives to the city, and this ability is another reason why contemporary artists find contemporary art so captivating. It is a kind of escape from the city, or at least from the mundane world of art that is constantly threatened with destruction.The Biennale needs to find new ways of organising itself.

The city is no longer a space of passive consumption, of course, but rather a place where strategies of domination and exploitation are consciously being addressed. In that chapter, Lecat makes a distinction between those who inhabit the city ‘on account of its manufactured scarcity, which the state of the art in urban-design was always supposed to eliminate’ and those who inhabit the city because of its active participation in the war effort. He distinguishes between the former, ‘creative men and women who work outside the city in its architectures of mobility and production, in the production of its infrastructure’, and the latter, ‘a more or less obedient population of citizens who are cowed by the police and other government officials into complacency about urban decline and desolation�</text>

It is easier to identify a ‘contemporary’ version of a given idea when it is present in multiple formats, both ‘on a global or national scale’ and ‘in integrated media such as art, culture, education and politics’.3. The biennale as a ‘contemporaneous set of relations’. In the twentieth‐century biennale, the artist and the spectator were two parts of the equation, but now the biennale is much more complex, including a director, producers, curators, distribution partners, art dealers, art collectors and visitors.

Foucalt was an influential philosopher and mathematician, who developed a set of principles that have come to define what he would call ‘the social’. These principles, along with the historical position of knowledge production in the society, and the contemporary situation of communities in a capitalist city, form the basis of what the Biennale could be: a public exchange of ideas, arguments and arguments between different communities. The Biennale itself is no longer made up of communities, but is made up of organisations, which means that organisations like the Biennale can now draw on their local knowledge and identity to bring communities together. This can happen through the cultural organisation of the city, which is an increasingly important element of the city as a social totality.

These young artists see themselves as inheritors of the tradition of biennials, and their projects are often inspired by that tradition. However, the relationships between the artist and the city are deeply rooted, and the biennial as a curatorial practice is still highly individualised. The biennial must also be flexible enough to take into account different social and political situations, and to react to different needs and interests in different parts of the world. The Asian Infrastructure Facility (AIF), a US$20 million a year US research and development centre into infrastructure for Asia Pacific, is a good example of a regional infrastructure institution that was established to provide technical and financial support to promote the development of infrastructure in the region through advanced manufacturing and research. The main research institute at AIF is the Center for Advanced Transportation and Research at the New York University, which</text>
    <text>Should Be Curated by an Artist’s Group’[1]. The Biennale would be the first in a new format to bring together a curator and an artistic group, and the first in a new environment to begin working with an artist on a curatorial role. As a curatorial undertaking, it would be an international one, operating in a new medium (video, radio, print, social media), with participants from all over the world. However, as the Biennale itself becomes increasingly political, the relationship between curatorial and arts needs to change, and with it the role of the artist and the community, if the Biennale is to operate in a way that reflects the collective needs and imaginations of the people who visit the cities. The importance of this can be seen in the curatorial handbook: the very first section entitled ‘Cities at a Glance’, written in 1950, describes the city as a ‘contemporaneous set of relations’.[2] The ‘contemporaneous set’ concept was developed in part by the artist Max Ernst, and it is based on a principle that came to him while walking in the park of his neighbourhood, Kings Cross, in New York. The idea is that when you turn a corner, or a station, or a street, or a park into a ‘chain of use’, you create a ‘contemporaneous relationship’ between objects, people, and the city. This applies not only to the city itself, but also to cultural spaces, institutions, and individuals that are often conflated or perceived as being located in the city: museums, galleries, theaters, theaters, radio, newspapers, street performers, tour companies, and so forth. The ‘contemporaneous’ concept forms part of a wider ‘biennial’ theme that is understood by the artist as meaning ‘contemporary art’. In the case of the</text>

    The next Whitney Biennial is set to open in December 2016, and the project to bring a new generation of artists into the fold is set to launch in 2017.  The Biennial format is set to undergo a complete review in 2018, with the aim of creating a shared vocabulary for artists and artists working in the art world through the construction of a common language.  The aim is to build on the momentum of the project, to create an environment where artists, curators, artistsʙ managers, and art’s elders can convene to discuss, collaborate, exchange, and discover new ways of working.  The project is being spearheaded by the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, with additional curatorial roles coming from the Venice and New York Museums, and other professional art schools.

The new generation of artists will be tasked with creating experiences that are both new and unexpected, while simultaneously questioning the art and the institutions that have created these mundane spaces of our cultural consumption.  The term ‘art space’ is frequently used in relation to the now ubiquitous notion of the art biennale, but this is an inaccurate usage of the term. The true understanding of the term is the one exercised in the classroom, where it is frequently employed by artists and their art directors, who frequently borrow from the work of others while incorporating their own distinctive twists.  One could argue that the focus on the art world as a site of commerce and consumption is an essential part of the biennial structure, since commerce and consumption are what create the biennial as a whole. But this is not immediately apparent in the exhibitionary form, which is often depicted as being underpinned by commerce</text>

The new biennial format is set to begin in 2017, with the first show in 2018 – though no dates have been specified.  The new collection-focused format is likely to follow that of the internet, with works appearing across multiple platforms and services, including on stage at the 2017 Edinburgh International Film Festival, where works created in collaboration with the Edinburgh International Film Festival will be displayed alongside works created in 2014 and 2015 at the Biennial.  The project is being managed by the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  The new exhibition format will see works from the project shown in a series of rooms, each designed according to a different theme. The first two exhibition formats – a retrospective and a place holder – will remain the same, with the emergence of a new corpus of works appearing in each space. The corpus will be titled the Whitney Biennial and will be made up of works created for the exhibition. The new form of the</text>

The five-year plan also includes the construction of a new biennial, an expanded and upgraded museum, the establishment of a regional arts hub in Brooklyn, and the creation of an entirely new class of artists responsible for creating a ‘visual identity’ for the region.  The new term ‘biennial’ encompasses both the museumary and the archival biennials, and the curatorial turn around local community arts projects.  In the US, the term encompasses both those biennials that are individually curatorial efforts as well as a set of related institutions: museums, archives, and archives.  The new entity will have the added mission of gathering and displaying contemporary art from different places and times, and of supporting the development of a shared historical and contemporary vocabulary through the systematic construction of a new generation of artworks.3  The new entity will also employ collaborative research and publishing, and explore art’s social and political contexts through a participatory exhibition setting as a way of thinking and a system of documentation.  The exhibitionary form will be supported by a new division of the Biennial Foundation, which will operate independently of the museum</text>

The new generation of artists will be tasked with reimagining the past through the construction of a new generation of biennials.  The review also proposes the establishment of a regional art education and contemporary art exchange center, with a national gallery and museum of contemporary art serving as nodes within a network of such institutions.  A new generation of artists will be tasked with developing a way to bring these different currents of contemporary art to the forefront of artists’ work while simultaneously questioning what kind of art can be produced through the current political situation.  Finally, a new generation of artists will be tasked with creating a new kind of art through the production of a new kind of museum.  These are not trivializing tasks, and they are not some kind of magic bullet. But they are tasks that can and should be undertaken with urgency and forethought, because there is simply no alternative. The reason why the biennial is important, and continues</text>

The new biennial format will see the continuing relevance of the museum, as a locus of contemporary art, and the museum’s continuing role in the cultural and social life of the city.  The new museum structure will be a hub for the museum’s curatorial legacy, exploring the ways in which the museum is a site of continuous transformation and can act as a site of continuous production and reflection. It will show how the museum is a site of continuous repetition, offering new works for the walls and ceilings, and creating a continuous supply of new material and building materials for future museum use. It will show the museum as an existing social and cultural phenomenon, featuring a new generation of visitors drawn to the museum as a site of social interaction and discovery. It will show the museum as an artistic and architectural landmark, providing a constant perspective and anchoring of the museum’s trajectory.

The new biennial format will see the development of parallel worlds populated by artists operating in and constructed out of the same world. This is the ‘performativity of the contemporary artist’ and the proliferation of contemporary art will be promoted through this system.  Contemporary art has often been seen as an aesthetic practice that seeks to capture and represent the experience of contemporaneity through description.1  Contemporary art is often described in terms of three levels – aesthetic, political and material. Contemporary art is often conceptualised as if it were a social process that emerged in response to the historical social formations of the twentieth century. Contemporary art is often written as if it were a social construction.  Contemporary art is often produced in response to a given cultural context, but its realpower lies in its ability to stand out, to stand out amongst</text>

The new biennial could be a repetition of the project led by the Whitney Museum of American Art, whose fourteenth iteration would mark two decades in the history of the Biennial. It is also possible that the Biennial format will be re-imagined in new media, such as video or livestreaming, to create parallel universes where different artists, curators, and art historians can work together.  The biennial may choose to produce its own artworks or curatorial strategy, or it may rely on the museum system to produce the art and cultural resources it needs. It is always the latter.  The new biennial may also engage in collaborative research projects with other artworlds or museums, or it may establish its own independent cultural research institute.  The key is that it has the capacity to define the terms and engage with the issues with which it is confronted.  The Biennial may decide to produce its own cultural resources or employ third</text>

The exhibitionist wave will continue through the first half of 2017, when the first group of exhibitionists will arrive in Venice from January to June 2016. The Venice Biennale will exhibit the works from this wave in the new exhibition format,  	Vittorio Venereggio, featuring works by over 100 artists, in cooperation with the Italian Museum and FACT, and in  	Vittorio Venereggio, the new icon of the biennale. The new exhibitionist wave will continue into 2018, with the first group of artist-curators set to arrive in Venice in September 2018.Art will play a central role in the future of the Biennale.

In the coming years, the Biennial format will be revisited to reflect the changing cultural landscape of the United States, with artists, curators, historians, and art’s real life representatives gathering to explore the ideologies that created and defined the biennial.

The hope is to create a vocabulary that artists and artists can draw upon to understand how their art could be produced in the context of a city.  The biennial format is a critical node in a much larger social-political-cultural system that includes cultural institutions, large scale transnational corporations, and state power. It is a site of exchange between the local and the globalised; a marketplace for ideas, a marketplace of possible futures, and ultimately a place of domination.  The biennial format has its roots in the mid-nineteenth-century, but its development coincided with a proliferation of journals, pamphlets, and books that provided a continual stream of data on the terrain of urban life. The proliferation of cities around the globe also put increasing pressure on the limits of what could be considered metropolitan, and thus the</text>

The municipality is a heterogeneous collection of authorities with varying levels of expertise, often working in cooperation. Acema is a good example of a prominent architect and urbanist in the twentieth century. San Francisco was conceived as a ‘multimodal city’, incorporating not only the waterfront but also the postindustrial port cities, warehouses and office parks that it would later name as its downtown. ‘The “Silo”” is a spatial term that refers to the spatial locality of an office or manufacturing site, and “The “Court and Tower”” refers to the “central business district” of the city, or “the legal definition of the “Silo”” if we move beyond the legal definition of downtown’.[14] The term is also used to describe ‘distributed communities of habitation’, which Acema defines as follows: ‘These associations, which we can now call “micro-cities”, are those very clusters of buildings and their associated dynamics that enable habitation – living and working space</text>

The municipality is a heterogeneous collection of authorities with varying levels of expertise, often working in cooperation. Acema is a good example of a prominent Muslim architect who has incorporated spatial-ideological considerations into his designs. In San Francisco, the municipality favors an urban form that is evenly distributed across the land and water, while in smaller cities and islands the municipality strives for a form of economic self-sufficiency. Acema’s spatial-ideological considerations are driven by his belief that ‘a high degree of differentiation is necessary in order to permit the emergence of truly integrated communities’.

It includes art historians, contemporary artists, critics, artists’ associations, as well as social scientists, political scientists, and legal scholars. Acema has a particular interest in how art is produced in ‘third countries’ and how such labour affects the labour of citizens of a ‘third country’. He has written extensively on the economics of art and social practice. He is an advisor for the project Geographies of Intimacy at the European Graduate School, and he lectures extensively on the social dimension of artistic practice. In 2009, Acema co-founded the Centre for a Contemporary Art (CCA) in Toronto, where he directs the Centre’s Curatorial Program, offers a multifaceted programme of research and publishes a popular art blog.

In 2013, he founded and directed the Centre for Cities (2014–16), a research institute focused on spatial and spatial-temporal variation in cities, which studies how cities shape and evolve through planning, governance and research. Here, researchers from a range of specialisation fields converge to work on the same problem – how to make places and communities habitable, attractive and conducive to human habitation – while also understanding how to support a diverse range of cultural activity in a densely populated urban space.

Acema is a good example of a prominent architect who has developed a multi-purpose firm that develops infrastructure and manages the social. He has not only employed talented workers, but has also recruited people from the local community via fairs and cultural events. In the Acema case, the cultural events include ‘community events’ such as ‘Roman Holiday’ and ‘New Year’ celebrations, as well as ‘community tasks’ such as landscaping and cleaning. In the Sydney Opera House case, Acema’s company is a catalyst for a small but significant 'cultural revolution’. The name 'Acema’s Company’ derives from the fact that it is a ‘single artist’ organisation, and not an established architectural firm. Acema’s co-operative housing development and the co-operative movement are two other examples of how to think about art and the social in an artistic context.

Acema has a unique perspective because he is not limited by the usual spatial constraints that typically apply to architects and designers. He can work with the municipality, which usually views landscape architecture as an inherently heterogeneous field, and the local authorities, which tend to view it as an inherently national field. Acema’s project was often seen as a counter attack on a dominant spatial and urbanisation agenda, and so the significance of his work – and that of many others like him – can be seen as a function of how visible and how important that project was to the local authorities, how much it influenced their decision-making, and how it was integrally connected to broader processes of urbanisation. In a recent MacArthur Fellow for Architecture Fellowship, Acema commented that his work was premised on the need to build 'intelligent Cities’ because the current global</text>

3. ‘The municipality’, in Acema’s case, is an institutionised entity that has a territorial boundary, rules on development, regulations on citizenship, and more. The municipality is a heterogeneous collection of authorities with varying levels of expertise, often working in cooperation. Acema is a good example of a prominent figure in Indonesia who, in the 1990s, was an active promoter of neoliberalism and international capitalism. In the 1990s, the municipality developed rapidly, in large part due to the financial travesty of the Indonesian economy at that time. Acema understood the need to accumulate wealth and use this to prop up public institutions, particularly in the face of a declining population and precarious environment. As a consequence, he actively sought ways to expand the jurisdiction of the municipality, creating juridical frameworks that would allow for greater corporate socialisation, while minimizing the autonomy of the citizen. In the 2000s, the municipality faced a crisis of legitimacy as a political entity and looked to the courts to resolve the problem. The emergence of consumer-oriented development, strong local political powers and the diffuse control of mega-developers on the cityscape was a constraint on the municipality’s growth and function, but the courts responded by introducing legislation granting greater corporate rights to the mega-corporations.

Acema is quoted as saying, ‘During the crisis, I made a mistake in thinking about the city as a machine that could be rebuilt.’ In other words, infrastructure, whether physical or digital, is a relatively recent construction, and the municipality is a prominent participant in the initial stages of infrastructure development.‘‘Fast Company’, 10/11/08.

In the case of an urban-design movement, it is important to note that Futurism and other urban-imagining movements typically focus on problems close to the site of the action, in the sense that the sites of action are often located in or around densely populated places, such as large port cities or metropolises. In the case of a biennale, the sites often move offline or ‘embedded’ within larger socio-political systems, such as cities or multinational corporations.

In the case of a biennale that proposes no solutions, such as the Futurist Project, the local artists and their projects, the biennale is often accused of being anti-urban and anti-capitalist. While each biennale has its own distinctive style, the general themes and underlying assumptions of the biennale are shared. For example, the Futurist Project and its supporters often claim that a ‘city without a future’ is possible, while those who reject techno-utopianism often point to the futurist ‘end to future’ that is portrayed in the film Minority Report.7. The notion of public space and the public realm. The public realm is a public space, and the public realm is a space where people gather to talk, exchange, imaginatively exchange, and create. It is a place of places to ‘come to learn, connect, exchange, and so forth’.8 ​Nadine Attewell, Anthropology in Contemporary Culture, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2012, p.19.</text>

In the case of a biennale that proposes no solutions, such as the Futurist Project’s, there is usually a ‘set of proposals’ that serve as a starting point for further dialogue. For more than just a biennale, there is a reason why biennales are so common: as the biennaleer and spectator, they are part of a complex urban infrastructure that supports a multitude of cultural practices, intermingles with mass tourism, and generate significant amounts of public funding.  	But it is precisely this complex infrastructure that is being challenged by seemingly intractable issues that are being exacerbated by our current economic and urban devolution. The biennaleer is the site of the increasingly visible spectacle of capitalism as it attempts to re-organise its urbanised form, but it is also the site of cultural practices that are often actively engaged with in the service of generating material wealth for a host of socio-cultural actors including but not limited to: developers, financial institutions, PR firms, investors, property developers, activists and many more</text>

In the case of a biennale that proposes no solutions, such as the Futurist Project, it is important to distinguish between the audience that is drawn to the art and the cities that are constructed on its ruins. It is the audience of the Futurist Project, not the city, that is being rebuilt.  	In the case of the previous biennales, the biennale organizers used public funds to construct walkable urban districts around the sites of the major crimes, usually located in the core city, such as the financial district or the cultural district. These were strategically placed around major transport corridors, such as the M1 or the M6, in an attempt to create a contiguous and novel spatial experience for visitors to the site, similar to that of the early art biennales. Early on, the M1 was even renamed the M6 Expressway after the 6th International Exposition, where the biennale’s principal artists resided and worked.1 	Despite this use of public funds to construct walkable urban districts, these suburbanised</text>

In the case of a biennale that proposes no solutions, such as the Futurist Project, the local artists who took part in the project usually found creative ways to incorporate their own urban interventions into the biennale. For example, the Futurist Project was a ‘smart city’ concept that sought to replace large urban centres with smaller, more walkable and transit-friendly alternatives, including the creation of mini-cities within the site of the future city. By embedding artworks within the site, the project sought to activate the site’s natural resources and ‘renewable energies’ by incorporating green and ‘forest-friendly’ building materials within the site. Such projects are often examples of the ‘ecologies of creativity’, named for the two phrases that describe how cities are created: ‘by the ecosystem’ and ‘by the forest’. The word ‘ecology’ seems to capture two distinct ideas: the concept of the natural resources underlying the city and the more general concept of the</text>

The biennale has often been used as an excuse to explore ‘national identity’ or ‘racial categories’ in the local community.4 The biennale has come to represent ‘the end of times’ in many places, and the beginning of a new beginning. As noted by Louise Shelley in the Futurist Project’s 2005 report ‘The End of All Ages’, the emergence of a new ‘racial and gender category: non-human, non-human, human and human-like species’ has transformed the concept of the ‘end of times’ and invites a radically different response from what Shelley calls ‘the first response: the response of the state to threats to its core authority – the very authority to legislate and establish publics and laws’.5 In the words of John Berger, ‘the race concept has</text>

The Futurist Project conducted a worldwide [1] online poll of biennials asking what kind of space would be ideal for an urban-discovery-oriented biennale. The results are displayed below. ‘Futurist Modern Cities’ were the top two choices for the biennale to be based in. (Feel free to skip to the 3rd choice: ‘Futurist Wild Lands’ or ‘Natural Capital: Cities of the Future’.)  A smaller number (one or two) chose to locate their biennale in ‘the land beneath, or along the coastline’, or ‘in the interior of a global city such as Hong Kong’s Marina District’. In all,</text>

In the 2000s, the biennale was restructured, and its self-perpetuation as an art project was questioned. The biennale staged the 35th Venice Biennale (2008) and the 2014 Venice Biennale (both sold out within hours). In 2015, the Biennale relocated to the Santa Monica Pier, where it will remain until at least 2021, when it will be relocated to a new site on the West Coast.For more information, see: http://www.venice.org/en/venice/en_US/en/biennale/en_US/en/photos/art/cecil_venice_leonardo_1434.jpg#sthash.LdPuRl</text>

In both cases, the micro-institution is often the cause of the macro-problem, or perhaps the micro-institution is the solution to a larger urban problem. This is a situation that can arise between local artists and biennales that seek to reconcile local and international perspectives, especially when the local artist is not even an official representative of the biennale. 	In the case of the Futurist Project, for example, the representatives of the Biennale Board met at the Swiss Art Gallery in Basel to discuss the project’s logistics. The meeting occurred only a few weeks before the 9/11 attacks, and the biennale board members included some of the greatest names in art and architecture. It is likely that the meeting ‘stayed longer than the artists thought possible’ and that the biennale as an institution was affected by the attacks</text>

The project was re-branded as Climate Film and the characters were given new identities.

The number of visitors who visited after the first two exhibitions grew, and the number of local artists who became involved in the series went on to be world-renowned. The biennial format has its limits, of course. It is easy to become attached to the biennial as a form and to ignore the larger society and its politics. But the biennial has a mission that is more ephemeral and elusive than most artists realise. It is to capture what is happening globally, and to do so in the most impactful ways possible. It is this ephemeralism that biennials are ideally placed to exploit. The mission statement of the Whitney Museum of American Art reads as follows: ‘The Whitney Museum of American Art is an arts organization that is committed to promoting American cultural identities and heritage through art, education, and public encounters through events, activities, exhibitions, and programs that demonstrate the power of culture to collectively shape social and political change.’9  </text>

The biennial’s production of knowledge and engagement with the city came as no surprise to Lee, who in turn, who first encountered the museum in her studies of Cultural Theory. She says the inspiration for the Biennale’s mission statement, which we can infer from the notice in the book, is to celebrate the city as a site of continual creation and recurrence: ‘a constant narrative of discovery and encounters, an ever-shifting web of legacy, and a constant sense of the ever-shifting ground beneath our feet’.9 The mission statement also includes the familiar cliché of ‘re-appropriating culture’ but adds a new layer of meaning: ‘where culture is re-appropriated, society is empowered’.10 It all seems a bit redundant to me but the interesting thing is that even though we are encouraged by the museum to identify with the global community of art and culture that the Biennale</text>

He concludes that, since the 1970s, a new economic model has been developed in which property has become the basic unit of production and consumption. This new model disregards the influence of labour, which has traditionally been seen as a by-product of the city, and the shift towards a value-form that is independent of use.

The mission of the Biennale is to 're-pose culture as a site of practical action, fostering critical thinking about the medium through which culture circulates, from the museum to the street, home to many more than meets the eye'.8 The initial public programme for the first exhibition, Carry On, linked to the 2013 Citizen edition, showcased local creativity in a global context. The publics invited to the opening included artists from all over the globe, including Carol Becker, Wendy Chun, Simone Weil, Ming-Chi Lee, Ming-Chi Lee and many more. The biennials have been around for over a century and have their roots in the early twentieth-century movement for democratic rights to the cultural resources of the nation. In 2014, the Biennale opened its first exhibition in New York, and in 2017, Brooklyn Museum curatorial team leader Ella Gibbs Bauman selected ten works from the initial exhibition to exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art's permanent exhibition space, where they will remain to this day. The ten works selected represent a diverse range of styles, ranging from the restrained (Gigi Scaria) to the wild (Toby Keith), landscapes (Joe Satrapi), textiles (Elizabeth Strand), furniture (Claudia L. Scott), decor (Claire Bishop), photography (Jeff Schmaltz), and now art (Scott McCaughey). The ten works on show in the Biennale are arranged chronologically from the first issue of the Museum of Modern Art, in New York,</text>

The biennial programme followed a similar theme of global engagement, but with local (regional) dimensions. The first two exhibitions followed local curatorial approaches to the exhibitionary form, with a 'global art’ focus, but with local (regional) and even national (international) points of view. The third and final exhibition will be dedicated to the interests of the local art community in its adopted city. The biennial programme has undergone a number of iterations since its foundation in 1989. The current iteration, Carry On, opened for business in Hong Kong on 14 June 2014, incorporated over 300 artworks from over 40 countries and regions. The Hong Kong exhibition made its international debut when it was curated by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev in association with the Hong Kong Museum of Art, and was presented by the Hong Kong Opera, through a partnership with the Hong Kong Museum of Modern Art. It is the first time that the two exhibitions have collaborated, with the</text>

Assembled by a curatorial collective including Lester Thurow, Wendy Chun, Simone Weil and Ming-Chi Lee, the group explored the interconnectedness of local and global art through a global lens. Toward a Global Curatorial Imagination (2013-16) By Wendy Chun, Wendy Chun, Simone Weil, Ming-Chi Lee, Jerome Callen, Norbert Lang and others. In the tradition of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the project reflected a city’s diverse cultural experiences in a single space. Inspired by the Chandler Museum project, it invited local curators from around the world to explore the region through their curatorial approaches, and to engage with the notion of ‘home page’ in a global way. In the tradition of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the project was curated by Wendy Chun, Wend</text>

The biennale offered different ways to approach the global cultural economy of urbanization, yet all focused on the same underlying themes: how to live together in harmony as citizens of a city. The themes and their varied expressions suggest a possible interpenetration of cultural indicators, even as they suggest a return to the roots of cultural practices. The discovery of novel urban uses for existing infrastructure may be globalized. Such activities may be cultural as well as economic, and they may or may not result in an increase in living standards or social welfare. The question is whether the underlying assumptions, which generate the biennale’s social and economic legacies, are genuinely rooted in an awareness of ecological problems or whether they are the result of a capitalist consumption of culture. The answer to that latter question is a difficult one to answer, partly because of the influence of foundations, corporations and other powerful institutions. Nevertheless, the logic of the biennale seems to demand an increase in living standards</text>

The biennials have since then evolved to show work from many different contexts, showing a range of voices in the same dialogue. Asynchronous publics, they have responded to the biennial public with open-ended questions about their experience, present in many biennials, and to some biennial audiences with a ‘big Fat Nuyumbale’ (Big Fat Sandwich, 2013).9 Yvonne Rainer-Hunt,  	The Black Stack: Atomic or Not?
