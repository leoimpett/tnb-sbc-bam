The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it sees as the increasing privatisation of art and related professions and trade in cultural goods and services. After the 2009 Venice Biennale, the biennale relocated to the world-famous Somerset Artspace in London, where it remains to this day.3 The committee’s recommendations were not only to abolish the art biennale but also to reimagine what a biennale should be – an entirely different kind of art museum, dedicated to the public good but also to the curatorial agenda of art’s social function, which can be seen as a possible counter intuitive strand in the social renewal project.

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it calls ‘the ephemeral cultural form’, which it defines as follows: ‘The biennale is a cultural form that has become increasingly ephemeral, and is therefore expected to be constantly (re)present, constantly (re)present, in order to sustain its distinctive character.[7]3 Both the art and the biennale are expected to respond to this new kind of ephemerality with a kind of randomness and randomness on a planetary or even local level. The biennale is not just a tourist attraction any more than the art museum is a permanent art institution. It is a dynamic business that requires regular visitors and a regular flow of revenue. While it may seem counter intuitive to some people that the biennale would ever become something more than a transient art form, the committee’s recommendations are a kind of techno-sensible counterintuitive counterintuitiveness at a molecular level. In other words, the recommendations are not a pan</text>

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it calls ‘the major market distortions that have contributed to making contemporary art possible’. It is, in other words, not just the art dealers who are being shortchanged, but also the artists and curators who are the victims of this marketplace of art-value. The biennale needs to speak up against the excessive commercialisation of art and highlight the systemic disadvantages and injustice that this creates.3  For example, the committee’s proposal that the biennale should contribute to a public art initiative by promoting transparency and democratisation of art making] cannot be taken literally. It is highly problematic in the era of the biennale, which is focused on commercial production of art, and is being led by a commercial gallery firm, whose mission statement is as such: ‘To meet the contemporary aesthetic needs of a society through art and art products … To this end, the Biennale is an ever-present and ever-present feature in contemporary art.[8</text>

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it sees as the crisis of cultural democracy in many parts of the world, where political and economic power has become increasingly diffuse and diffuse is the response of cultural elites to this erosion of democracy. In recent years, the biennale has shifted its focus to emerging market cultures of urbanisation and connectivity. In places such as China and Russia, the biennale remains firmly embedded in the historical and contemporary context of the city, whereas in places such as Brazil and India, the biennale is centred on regional centers and the cities that are their postindustrial or ‘rebounding’ expression. In these latter cases, the biennale becomes the locus of circulation and destination, where creativity and the aesthetic are produced and consumed. But in places such as China or Russia, the biennale is often seen as a symptom or symptom of underlying socio-cultural ills and social ills.

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world.

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it sees as the increasingly urgent need to reimagine what a biennale can be, both to cope with the ever-broadening range of biennials being held in wide-ranging portfolios around the world, as well as to cope with the ever-present threat of terrorism. The committee’s recommendations for the future of the biennale are as follows: ‘Avoid entanglement in the way that is threatening to the biennale as a global event: avoid contracting to the biennale, and all related, entanglement, and all the complications that entails; and do more to support local arts promotion through arts funding, cooperatives, and so forth.’3 The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the increasing privatisation of culture and arts worldwide.

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it calls ‘the massive shadow economy that is generated by the consumption of cultural goods and the promotion of cultural tourism’.3 This is an economy of cultural exchange – cultural goods are exchanged between artists, collectors and travellers, in the form of culturally active itineraries. There are over 180 biennials operating worldwide right now. Each biennial has a distinct agenda and style, and its scope of exhibition-going is determined by a curator’s previous experiences and observations. We are fascinated by the fact that, for example, the Venice Biennale 2017 continued to open with a series of new works even though it was widely reported as being ‘empty’ and ‘ruined’ by reports of violence in Venice.4 The Venice Biennale 2017, which closed its doors after a few months, started off with a bang. The art market launched a full-scale cultural revolution against the art. The biennale was forced to confront its own self-absor</text>

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it perceives as an increasingly blurred distinction between art institutions and their patrons, particularly as the terms between the gallery and the biennale have become increasingly blurred. In an institution such as the biennale, the latter becomes a convenient cloak for the former, as in many cases the biennale is itself a private company.3 The biennale, in turn, must account for its increasing public-private hybridisation. It is an art event, but it is more concerned with the public good than its artists or curators. It is a ‘public good’ that it is now increasingly being seen not only as a service to its patrons but also as a catalyst for a number of other social good initiatives. This is increasingly evident in the clientele it serves: the biennale is now frequently cited as a key player in the exhibition business, exhibiting new and old works both commercially and critically.4 The biennale has become a registrar of social good, with works</text>

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it calls ‘the capital trap’ – the tendency for contemporary art to find its place in the social totality outside of a particular site and time. It is, in other words, deeply related to the capitalist circulation of images of art and culture. However, the significance of the committee’s work and its recommendations are limited today. The biennial market has changed, is globalised and now includes events such as Venice and every major art museum in the world, as well as localised phenomena such as the art fairs of Bahrain and Pakistan. The biennale is today constrained by the quality, quantity and location of art being exhibited, and by the development of specific curatorial agendas and priorities. In these ways, contemporary biennials can be seen as products of their context and audience, with a social function attached to them.‘Concretely, the committee’s proposals and their ‘concretely stated aims… could not be more different from today�</text>

The biennale has a critical eye on what it sees as the systemic undermining of public and local cultural resources around the world. It is also interested in what it calls ‘the massive corruption of our cultural resources by a business and financial elite’. It seems most natural for biennials to be interested in the resources that sustain local culture, but the sheer amount of money at stake in the current biennial market – a good-sized part of which goes into the pockets of the artists, distributors and publishers who commission and manage the art – clearly demonstrates that this is not at all what the biennial is up to. The resources it seems to seek out to bolster local culture are those resources that benefit the biennale as an entity and not necessarily those that benefit artists or the communities they profess to represent.  The biennial market cap is very high right now. The 2014 Venice Biennale is estimated to have brought in over ₱240 billion for the Italian government, making it Europe’s second largest cultural institution after the museum.3 Biennials are capitalising on the current environmental crisis and political instability in order to</text>

Other curatorial approaches, such as those offered by the artist and his company, Magnum, may be considered ‘adversarial’ to the current curatorial approach of the biennial, as presented by the biennial as a whole. 	In a postscript to the argument that the biennial is, in effect, an extension of the biennial, this may be seen as a form of ‘indirect’ competition between different museums presenting different types of artefacts from the same museum. In this model, the museum with the most recent artefact is seen as superior to the museum with the oldest one, because it displays the artefact in a confined space and at a fixed position. Cur</text>

The issue of what is or is not a ‘biennial’ would thus be relevant here, since it is a frequent target of biennials' efforts to create something ‘unique’ and different from what is typically found in biennials. This would mean differentiating between a biennial that is a ‘biennial’ in its own right, and one that is specifically designed to be a ‘biennial’. Such a distinction would mean that a biennial should strive to provide the appropriate experience to visitors to its exhibitions, while at the same time offering a genuine variation from the standard of art present at such exhibitions. 	In an effort to achieve this ‘unique’ experience, it is necessary to create what Roger Hiorny calls a ‘biennial paradox’.1 In other words, the art world doesn’t naturally understand what a ‘biennial’ means, but biennials do it for them. In the language of biennials, these ‘differential encounters’ can create what Hiorny calls ‘biennials’. Biennials are the dynamic response to a static art field.

The issue of what is or is not a ‘biennial’ would thus be relevant here, since it is a frequent target of biennials' efforts to create something ‘unique’ and different from what is typically found in biennials. This would require an explicit and concerted policy of destroying what is typically found in biennials, since, as biennials, they often find it difficult to differentiate amongst themselves the varying degrees of worth of what they provide to a particular city or community. It would also require a ‘world-class’ art museum or museum with a world-class archive, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds, grounds. (This last element is the subject of a possible future article). 	Finally, the issue of autonomy would be relevant in this context, since biennials have developed great skills and acquire typesetting and layout skills that can be applied to any type of art museum or archive, even those with crown dependencies. A biennial’s ability to read an archive or a museum effectively comes from the first-hand knowledge it shares, the intrinsic relational skills it develops as a result of its</text>

The issue of what is or is not a ‘biennial’ would thus be relevant here, since it is a frequent target of biennials' efforts to create something ‘unique’ and different from what is typically found in biennials. This would include biennials’ efforts to create ‘bigger’ events within their biennials, and biennials’ efforts to engage with and capture cultural history within their biennials, both through the courtroom and the gallery. It would also include biennial standards that reflect the times in which they operate, such as the ‘1991 Istanbul Biennale’ and the ‘1997 Venice Biennale’, both of which required visitors to travel to the sites of their construction in an effort to unravel the urban mystery that had been slowly pieced together over the course of two decades. 	In this analysis, I focus on the 1990 Istanbul Biennale as an example of how important it was to have an overarching narrative at the time, in order to effectively engage the visitor, both in the exhibition and in the accompanying narrative, in order to render the city present and act as a catalyst for the construction of the current and future trajectory of urbanization in</text>

The issue of what is or is not a ‘biennial’ would thus be relevant here, since it is a frequent target of biennials' efforts to create something ‘unique’ and different from what is typically found in biennials. This would include, for example, biennials’ attempts to create ‘cultures of art’ by instigating a ‘public event’ (as in the case of an EDM festival) or ‘cultural tourism’ by sponsoring a ‘special’ type of art-historical event’ (as in the case of a biennial). Rather than being able to determine what is or isn’t a biennial, the curatorial is responsible for making sure that the type of art it commissions is appropriate and distinct from what is typically found in biennials. And this is precisely what biennials do very poorly – they frequently collaborate with other art forms, and with other curatorial approaches. So it is that biennials often try to do the same thing over and over again, in the same place, with the same people over and over again – they create a ‘recipe’ that grows stronger and richer each time.</text>

This would mean creating ‘different worlds’ within the confines of the biennial, which is problematic for several reasons. First, worlds do not exist in a vacuum; they must be created and nurtured within the confines of the biennial in order to be realized. Second, a world that is not completely understood can never be fully known; only the fully enfused can inhabit it. Third, such worlds are rarely, if ever, realized, because the biennial’s goals are often in conflict with its actual governance and management, which is often inequitable and ill-conceived. Finally, the biennial can and should strive to be something more than a museum or museum collection, because it is a living organism and because it is, by definition, a ‘collective action’. The ‘unique world’ concept would thus become a much more potent tool for the biennial than it already is. 	The question, then, becomes whether the biennial</text>

This would include biennials’ attempts to recreate the historical ‘triennials’ that they observe and write about (through their articles and their position statements in biennial audiences), but it would also include biennial equivalents trying to create ‘differentiation’ by creating what Peter Osborne calls a ‘distributed effect’ whereby ‘a single event … contributes to creating or enhancing a [specified] set of characteristics or patterns] in a urban area’.3 Over the past decade, biennials have generally focused on a few themes that are universal to contemporary urbanisation, such as identity, cities, and consumption. But as biennials gain greater institutionalised identities and institutional powers, their institutional interest in documenting ‘specificities’ becomes ever more significant. And as the biennial’s institutional interest in documenting ‘specificities’ changes, biennials will need to find new ways of contributing to the analysis and contemporisation of ‘</text>

The issue of what is or is not a ‘biennial’ would thus be relevant here, since it is a frequent target of biennials' efforts to create something ‘unique’ and different from what is typically found in biennials. This would include, for instance, the efforts of the Liverpool Biennial, whose efforts to create a different kind of ‘unique’ exhibit format for  	Unravelled, and the work of the Liverpool Museums Association, whose work with artists including Rebecca Lacy,  	Unravelled, was part of the 2017 Biennale of Art and Design, part of the London’s 2016 Biennale, and part of the Local Hero project that produced the 2017 Biennale of Arts and Culture. The question is, then, which kind of biennial can we create? The curatorial efforts of the Liverpool Biennial and the Liverpool Museums Association could perhaps be considered unique in their domestic contexts, in that they are domestic in scope, situated within their city, and take place within the logic of a biennial itself. However, they are also international in their local commitments. That is, they are committed to the internal logic of the biennial as a</text>

This would mean different things to different people, and it is with this in mind that biennials attempt to do different things to different people, sometimes through different agents, sometimes by themselves. The main factors that lead to a biennial ‘unique’, as opposed to a ‘biennial’ in the American context are: (1) the institutionality of the biennial; (2) the form; (3) the city. However, the latter stage is a big problem for biennials, since it gives rise to the potential of having a significant effect on its localities, especially in the context of a city’s ongoing crisis of poverty and homelessness, which is worsening. The biennial is an indispensable step in any description of ‘the spectacle’, but its historical and anthropological precursors are important. The museum becomes a more significant venue for the spectacle to develop, as the biennial’s memory becomes the museum’s most</text>

(AKI)Algo-rhythm (Latin: ‘algo-rhythm’) is a computer programming language that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to BASIC. Like many other computer languages, the rhythm starts with a statement of the logical order of things – a list of nouns, verbs, and adjectives – followed by an infinite loop. In programming a rhythm, there is no such thing as an end – it never terminates – but there is an actual order of operation that continues until a given statement is found (a formula). In the language of the Algo-Rhythm, statements of order – which can – and usually do – end up in unexpected ways. For example, the statement ‘alive’ in the Algo-Rhythm can be interpreted as ‘alive but only as long as the second clause of the third clause of the first’.’ This interpretation creates unexpected branching clauses that undo the statements of the first two clauses. So, statements of the form ‘alive but only as long as the second’ can also be interpreted as statements of the form ‘alive but only as long as the third</text>

(AKI)Algo-rhythm (Latin: ‘algo-rhythm’) is a computer programming language that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to BASIC. Like many other computer languages, it is comprised of a sequence of letters and digits separated into smaller and smaller units called units of operation called clauses. Algo-rhythm programs break the monotony of writing down clauses into clauses and clauses into clauses. In effect, clauses describe what can be done with the data that is gathered. In contrast to other computer languages, which typically write and program the world as a whole, Algo-rhythm programs concentrate particular attention and energy on a particular step, event, or occurrence. For example, in Algo-rhythm, events such as birthdays and anniversaries are written down as sequences of digits and characters, and celebrations like christenings and funerals are written down as events in themselves.‘Sequences’ may also refer to biological organisms, such as trees and genomes, and human-made collections of objects called collections of objects.

(AKI)Algo-rhythm (Latin: ‘algo-rhythm’) is a computer programming language that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to BASIC. Like many other computer languages, the ‘algo-rhythm’ allows programs to describe temporal relations, actions such as movement, and in‑set and ‘ending points’ such as time, space or events. The main difference is that in ‘algo-rhythm’ statements, the referent acts as an entity rather than as a collection of components. Algo-rhythms are often used to describe programs that simulate the temporal qualities of life, such as natural phenomena or human cognition.

It is a series of photographs and videos documenting the history of art’s longstanding engagement with time, taking the form of a multi-year, multi-edition, multi-day installation show that is increasingly common in major urban centers.

(AKI)Algo-rhythm (Latin: ‘algo-rhythm’) is a computer programming language that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to BASIC. Like many other computer languages, the ‘algo’–algorithm’ emerged independently across different companies and with different programmers. The main difference between the two is that the ‘algo’–algorithm’ is a set of instructions that describe how to perform a specific task, while BASIC is more like a programming language.) Along with the rest of BASIC, the ‘algo’–algorithm’ is a queen of the computer. But unlike in other programming languages, the queen doesn’t have any rights. The only way to modify the ‘algo’–algorithm’ is to ask the queen to do it for you, and she’ll usually do it anyway. So while the queen has no rights, what she does have is at best a ‘language hacker’ tool. She also has no power over the ‘algorithm’ itself. That power comes from the computer’s developer, and</text>

(AKI)Algo-rhythm (Latin: ‘algo-rhythm’) is a computer programming language that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to BASIC. Like many other computer languages, the rhythm language required an interpretation of certain mathematical operations. Algo-rhythm programs allowed users to generate music according to mathematical operations such as adding and multiplying numbers. Like many other forms of electronic music, the rhythm language was composed primarily of patterns. Unlike most electronic music, however, patterns could be defined and controlled. Thus the control over the music was not restricted to artists or composers but also to anyone with a programming ability. (AKI)Art as Art’s End point (also known as ‘the abstract syntax of language’) is the point at which an object (such as a number) ends up representing a process that began long before the object itself began to exist. In other words, the beginning of language is not where the computable objects begin but rather where the abstraction begins. This is one reason languages are able to categorise – the way in which different objects might begin to communicate with one another. For example, the way that a hand moves</text>

Like many other computer languages, the rhythm has a number system that incorporates modus or arithmetic operations that help to define time. Algo-rhythm programs operate in time, but unlike many other programming languages, does not guarantee accurate timekeeping. Instead, the operating system (called ‘the algo-rhythm engine’) creates its own version of the underlying mathematical equation that governs arithmetic, and vice versa. Algo-rhythm programs incorporate additional mathematical operations that help to define the temporal relation between present and past, while at the same time remaining totally transparent to human manipulation. The idea of ‘algebra’ in programming seems particularly useful when operating in conjunction with ‘algo-rhythm engines’, because these programs implicitly declare what kinds of relations they want to establish between objects. For example, programming an ‘algebra’-based radio station that plays back tracks from an audio file that is itself a ‘algebra’, while simultaneously recognizing when those tracks</text>

(AKI)Algo-rhythm (Latin: ‘algo-rhythm’) is a computer programming language that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to BASIC. Like many other computer languages, the ‘algo-rhythm’ allows programmers to create mathematical functions that can be expressed in a number of different ways. Algo-rhythms allow programs to simultaneously increase and decrease in precision, while remaining completely transparent to their context. The main differences between the programming languages found in computers and programming languages like Python are that the former is executed in a physical 'CPU' – a specialized machine – while the latter is executed in a user’s ‘brain'. The main difference between the two is that the former is computationally parallelizable while the latter is not.  	There are currently two versions of ‘algorhythm’ available: Python and JavaScript.

(AKI)Algo-rhythm (Latin: ‘algo-rhythm’) is a computer programming language that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to BASIC. Like many other computer languages, the rhythm starts with a statement of fact, but unlike many other programming languages, ‘algo-rhythm’ has no fixed root meaning. Instead, statements of fact about the world are assembled in modules (called ‘families’) and passed on to nodes (called ‘leads’), where statements of algorithm are statements of algorithm chosen from among modules. Each family of modules includes statements of fact about the world in and statements of algorithm in and statements of fact about ‘objects’ in and statements of ‘programs’. Within each module, modules of symbols called nodes of ‘algorhythm’ are paired off against each other in an iterative process of statement-matching. Symbolic operations like parentheses and circles complement statements of fact with statements of algorithm. As the statements of fact and algorithm are paired off, modules of symbols called nodes of ‘algorhythm’ emerge, and action on those</text>

Like many programming languages, the ‘algo-rhythm’ has a grammar that describes how to process data in an ordered sequence of words. But unlike languages with a lexicon or programming language that allow one to define and parse data, the grammar of ‘algo-rhythm’ is a thing that can only ever be defined and executed in certain defined ways (called dialects). The variations of ‘algo-rhythm’ allow one to only ever compute what is described at specified intervals (called phrases). A ‘grammar of action’ is a description of how an algorithm</text>

Instead, the idea of time is realised in ‘algorithm’ – a reified set of operations that essentially translate raw data into precise time – as in ‘programming’. In ‘algorithm’, the world is captured and controlled via a series of interconnected algorithms. The aim of the rhythm programming is to continuously sample the underlying temporal data – event’s – and to this end, ‘algorithms’ constantly sample temporal data to produce continuous temporal feedback that in turn generates periodic ‘time’.

[3] This is in part a response to the ‘metro’ by which planners and scientists are increasingly identifying the city as a site capable of supporting future growth, in part due to the proliferation of office and retail environments conducive to the growth of dense clientele.[4] Such growth has been accompanied by a proliferation of ‘megacities’ – mega-regionsised metropolises – which proliferate at the speed of business, retail and cultural life. 	[5] One may speculate that the singularity has, in part, displaced the megacity. But this ignores the historical co-existence between the city and the metropolis, which is crucial to understanding the contemporary predicament.

But it is also a point of departure from here to explore other precursors, and new spatialities are possible through a sequential combination of these precursors. This is, I believe, the main thrust of the spatial theory that has come to define the contemporary planet. This theory, along with the growing body of planetary-scale models and data, has led to a new conception of the earth as a flat, 3D surface that can be mapped and measured (with satellites) – a flat Earth is now commonly understood to be the future.

The aesthetic of this new technological singularity is different from that of the technologizer and his team of scientists and technicians; it is an aesthetic of the immaterial, of the inherently random, of the unpredictable, of ephemeral, of change, of experience. It is an aesthetic of the way in which the physical manifests the latent life forces of the planet – latent energy, latent properties, latent knowledge – that can then be harnessed to meet the user’s needs. This new aesthetic is fundamentally informed by the work of habit forming organisations: how to channel that latent energy into useful production; how to enable that latent production through the provision of infrastructure; how to manage that latent infrastructure in the context of chronic negative feedback loops; and how to detect and mitigate those loops. These are questions of habit</text>

[4] As early as the mid-1960s, artists, curators and arts administrators were warning that the ‘permanent avant-garde’ was on the cusp of becoming a dominant form in contemporary art’s medium. As the ‘permanent avant-garde’ became defined by avant-garde aesthetics, it was also defined by an increasing tendency towards virtual ubiquity of culture in all its media manifestations, including the frequent appearance of new media artists’ work on museum premises.

Florida is the director of the Florida Space Program at the California Institute of Technology, where he is also a professor of aeronautics and astronautics. He coined the term ‘the margins’ in his book The Institutions Economy: Resources, Politics and the Metropolis in the Age of Intelligences. In that book, he argues that the metropolis has become so engrossed in the vortex of information that it is no longer possible to imagine the metropolis without its infrastructure feeding into the speculative economy that he proposes should be built around it. As a result, the metropolis is now awash with information and is therefore in a position to generate knowledge of infinite density through the information that it produces, whether that knowledge is appropriate or not.

As Caplan sees it, the singularity is the point where the metropolis begins to experience a discontinuity. The discontinuity, he maintains, resides in the fact that space – both physical and immaterial – is ‘transcendent’ and that ‘nothing is more fundamental to the historiography of the metropolis than the idea that space and matter are intrinsically related’.[4] This concept, which emerged in the 1970s and 80s in response to the advent of ‘mass communication’ (broadband), has since become embedded in infrastructure (high-speed rail, satellite TV, wireless networks), and its application has become discretionary.

[4] A virtual panorama, a virtual black box is what Florida had in mind when he imagined what he called ‘a new urban reality’. In the 1970s and 1980s the new urban reality was an expansive science fiction novel, but the new urban reality is now a real place with people – and places – living amongst us. 	[5] We want to think of the possibilities of virtual and augmented reality, even if this means developing our cities not in the traditional way, but in the new way.

Chang’s influential 1989 work, Shadow of Metropolis, in which he imagined a scenario in which the metropolis is no longer the endpoint of the process of technological singularity but instead a point of emergence and growth – a scenario consistent with the discovery of vast new planetary systems to be discovered around the sun. Chang was partly inspired by the fact that, shortly before his work was due, the U.S. space program ended. The end result of this end game – a fusion of publicly and privately funded national space agencies in one unified entity – is now widely perceived as a mistake. In the wake of this perceived overshoot, privately funded groups have taken up residence in key federal, state and local space agencies, contributing to the overall perception that the federal government is chronically short of resources. The end result of this overshoot has become an agency that, as a result of budget cuts, is now struggling to keep up with an ever-expanding and increasingly mobile</text>

In this sense, biennials can be seen – by their own admission – as fundamentally mischievous. And yet this tendency is undeniably in their favour. Contrary to what they think they know, and what they tell themselves they know, the biennial cannot create value for others. Rather, the very act of creating value for others – creating what might otherwise be termed ‘abstract space’ – is – by and large – an act of appropriation. That is, it is an act of leaving behind ‘space’ in the broader context of a metropolis, and in the broader social and economic scheme of things.This is the predominant conception of ‘abstract space’ in contemporary capitalist culture, and it is a conception that is widely shared and understood. In fact, it is the prevailing conception among those who have access to formal education and cultural clout.

In this sense, biennials are like any other infrastructure type: they are exposed to the elements, meet needs, and then, as ever, need protection. But unlike other infrastructure types, they are not able to meet those needs on their own. The only way in which they can produce value for others is through the interaction of with the socio-economic and political systems that they are embedded in. And interaction is precisely what has fallen short of desired for many of the communities they are permitted to shelter within.

This is true both of the United States and of most other capitalist countries. It is true that in times of economic hardship and financial crisis, biennials can and do turn to those who need their scarce and infrastructural resources, for a number of reasons including the obvious need to feed and house those on the streets, as well as to repair and expand infrastructure. But this is the exception, and while there are certainly times when this has happened, it is extremely rare. For example, the financial crisis in 2008 necessitated a fiscal consolidation across the globe, which in turn required a massive financial rescue by sovereign governments. Not only was this a massive fiscal rescue – at least in the West, including the United States – but it also shifted the cost of such action from the poorest countries to those with higher debt burdens. As a result, the poorest countries that were still dependent on exports for much of their economic activity were hit hardest by the crisis, while the wealthiest countries saw a</text>

In the 1990s, biennials were introduced as a ‘use-value’ in a social and political context – in the ‘90s, at least – and as an object in a cultural and economic system. In the 2000s, they came to represent a specific development, and the economic logic of the ‘rebound’ – the return to the city following the crisis of urban centres everywhere – which followed the financial crash in 2008. In the last decade, they have become subjects of geopolitical analysis, and the object of global financial speculation on a par with other assets and commodities. Yet despite this historical weight, they are objects of scarce and infrastructural need; in fact, biennials are the exception to the rule. As biennials become more and more like other asset classes, and more and more like the infrastructures that constitute the social and informational systems that they shelter, they are less and less able to create value for others. In fact, this has been the dominant mode of production for most of us, who have had to rely on the object as a source of income. As biennials become more and more like other types of assets, and more and more like the infrastructures that constitute the social and informational systems that they shelter, the object becomes less and less able to support its users in the way that it might otherwise. This is what sociologist Helga Nowotny would have said about the financial crisis had she been alive in 2015. Like so many others during and after the crisis, she would have beenmoaned the loss of value that followed – lost meaning, lost connotations, lost social value – but unlike so many others, now regrets the loss of no meaning at all.

As biennials become more and more like other asset classes, and more and more like the infrastructures that constitute the social and informational systems that they shelter, they are less and less able to create value for others. This is why biennials are often so prone to crises of oversupply and hyperinflation. Supply is constrained by a shortage of cheap labour – a labour market with no unemployment insurance and no social safety net – and so biennials are sensitive to fluctuations in both the labour and the cheap labour markets, and so prone to infrastructural changes and changes in the forms of labour, consumption and wealth that result from them. And as new technology makes it possible to reduce the workforce in the infrastructural sense – by processing information into precise shapes and behaviours – the biennial may be similarly compressed. A population of museum-goers throngs the retail corridors, seeking out the latest fashions, and as a result everything is organised around the needs of the tour group. Biennials may well be interested in documenting their own temporal conditions – looking back at the city of New York in the 1990s and New York in the 2000s – but they are also committed to</text>

As biennials become more and more like other asset classes, and more and more like the infrastructures that constitute the social and informational systems that they shelter, they are less and less able to create value for others. In this sense, they are objects of constant replacement, capitalism’s durable commodity.8 The infrastructural dimension of biennial production is also critical for understanding the rise and fall of housing prices and the precarity of low and moderate incomes. The biennial needs to produce high-quality images that move people and connect with people on a visceral level, and it also needs to produce images that are representative of the city in all of its complexity and multiplicity. The images it produces, and which shape what counts as ‘urban’ in ways that no other medium can replicate, will have a huge impact on how the city is conceptualised, urbanised and urban-dwelling in perpetuity. 	   	[i] The Biennale’s first president, Réjean Legault, made this statement in 2003: ‘Twenty years ago we decided to create a biennale that would be a dialogue rather than a singular event</text>

This is true even though the value that they create through their regularly scheduled publication, exhibition, and various recording works surely have a great impact on their audiences. The value that biennials add to the social calculus of the city, and to a greater extent to that of the urban environment itself, is growing. The biennial as a curatorial strategy is characterised by two essential elements: the need to add value (through recording, recording, analysis) to the very substance of the art being exhibited; and the continual need to reinvent the ‘quantity’ of that value (through research, discovery, discovery, copying and so on). Each biennial needs a research project, a sort of urban archaeological dig, to continue its historical and anthropological writings on the city and urban-dwelling inhabitants of the world. The research projects of biennials tend to be on an increasingly large scale, with projects now spanning the geographical areas from Nigeria to South Africa, and from Argentina</text>

In this sense, they are objects in their own right, and thus also ‘use-values’ in their own right. This is the situation in which biennials might find themselves today: under siege by a social and economic system that seeks to strip them of their agency and place their surplus value in ever greater bureaucracies and financial infrastructures, unable to absorb the loss as a consequence. This ‘use-value’ dynamic is another factor driving contemporary capitalist urbanisation. It is not just that the infrastructures of the metropolis cannot sustain the growth of populations, but that growth itself consumes a great deal of what is left over after infrastructure is built and social services are delivered. Hence the huge financial infrastructures that characterise the metropolis today: huge public works projects, huge shopping malls, museums, educational institutions all trying to cram ever greater amounts of information and culture into ever greater numbers of buildings, endeavouring to meet ever greater consumer</text>

And what might be possible in the infrastructural systems that comprise the social, but are also subject to geopolitical shocks and forces? What might be possible in the social world of the biennial, but is also, in fact, possible only within the infrastructural systems that support the social?These are questions that continue to inform contemporary art and biennial research, but which are gaining in importance and visibility. It is worth recalling that the biennial was originally conceived and written as a support to the Museum of Modern Art, which was the primary art museum of the colonial world. The Museum of Modern Art, it was thought, could best render the immense collections of art</text>

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, which was itself a disastrous, and which is still a disastrous, fiasco, is a classic example of how a biennial can become entangled in a city’s economic development. As the Biennial lost money, and its partners lost interest, it became increasingly difficult for the city to sustain the art institution, which in turn led to a decline in public arts funding. The full extent of this decline is unclear, but it is certain that the city had to embark on a financial emergency.

The new museums would be publicly funded and given a clear role in the city’s economic future.  At this time, the only museum left in the city was Tate Modern, which was shut down in 1980. Today, the city holds on to almost all of its early twentieth century collection, but it does not have a museum until it is in the midst of a massive renovation project, which will make the museum obsolete. Assembled by a curator from Columbia University, the curatorial team included eminent artists, including Diane Russell, Deborah Schiff, Ron Chernow, and Peter Schjeldahl. The project was fiercely opposed by the Thompson family, who maintained that the reconstruction of the building would rob the city of culturally significant elements. Despite this opposition, the board approved the project, putting art on a par with architecture and paving the way for the future of art and architecture, when the museum was eventually re</text>

The incorporation of these new entities would mean accepting grants from the city and the biennial, and in exchange giving the park authority complete autonomy in assigning funds to museums. All told, these changes would mean accepting gifts and becoming financially dependent on the city. Although this was clearly seen as a potential conflict of interest, as soon as these boards were brought together, the conflict disappeared. The trustees would have complete autonomy in assigning funds to museums, while the new economic development corporations would have to secure the city’s approval before moving forward. This is precisely what happened with the Biennial of Toronto, which was pushed back from 2019 to 2024, and from 2025 to 2030, respectively, by political uncertainty and the infrastructural turn around neighbourhoods. While these cuts to the museum budget were necessary in an increasingly urban city, they left much of the art museum with weak positions and a diminished cultural profile.

The district boundaries would be drawn up by a district planning committee, with representatives from the city and the museums on one side and representatives from the companies, real estate companies, and other economic players on the other. The districts would be made up of buildings or similar structures, with a maximum of two hectares each designated as cultural zones. Each developer would be required to establish a cultural zone exclusively for their company’s uses. The zones would be required to receive a set of attributes, including the best possible use of natural resources and urban infrastructure, and to be ‘transformative’ in their use of the city. The zones would be jointly managed by the city and the museums, with representatives</text>

As a result of these political transitions, and the fact that our city is no longer a part of the Biennial economy, the museums that were once instrumental in enabling the city to experiment with new ways of organising itself are questioning their place in the city. The irony is that the museums that once created this experimental space for the city are now the city’s most exposed to the vagaries of economic development. As museums around the world seek to expand their audiences, and as these audiences decline, the city becomes ever more exposed. The discovery of oil presents a similar quandary for the museum. The museum is expected to reveal the full story of the consequences of its activities as a result of climate change, but the museum is also expected to deliver a powerful symbolic gesture that can hold its own against such powerful economic predations. The question is, which museum can offer the best symbolic gesture when the time</text>

The new board of trustees would have broad powers to implement the arts’ development agenda and, through a combination of state and federal tax-exempt status, would be able to fund the art institution through bonds.  	The new board of trustees would also have broad discretion in how art should be used, with little or no public oversight. This is similar to the situation for commercial real-estate developments in the city, but unlike in the case of a RE, the buildings would not be REs but would instead be owner-occupied rental housing developments, mostly geared towards the business community. The new board of trustees would have equal voting rights to the board of residents, but would have limited authority to change the laws of the city. 	The new board of trustees</text>

As the board of trustees expanded, so did the amount of control that artists had over the artistic direction of the institution – an increase in autonomy that many artists felt was an injustice. The new board of trustees was far less able to exert control, but its members had nevertheless become more vested in the institution’s survival. There was a feeling that the board was more responsive to the interests of the city, which created an incentive for them to experiment with different funding sources and create biennials in alternative formats. The biennial board became increasingly critical of itself, and its members began to question whether the city</text>

These were radical changes from the status quo, but the city was able to leverage these institutions as a toolkit to create its own future.  So long as the city retained ownership of its cultural assets, including the rights to these works, these new forms of cultural power could be maintained in perpetuity. Creative infrastructures were created to handle the art and the narratives of the future. These vernacular cultural spaces continued to be places where the city’s narratives were suppressed, but now that status was slipping. The city could not simply roll out the red carpet and walk away, and so it had to actively recruit artists and other creative professionals to help it create new narratives. This might seem trivial in a city as big as Wellington, but the act of creating narratives and placing them at the centre of an economic equation required immense energy and organisational skills.

Near to the district museum, a new district park would offer a mix of housing and a plaza for artists’ performances.  At the time, the district park was seen by some as a potential place for an arts school, but since the district already had a biennial, and since the district already had a large, diverse arts community, this was seen as unnecessary conflict. Art schools would be able to operate out of the district park, and would therefore be able to establish artistic networks with the district residents and the surrounding community. The district would become an artist’s first tourist destination, and the district would become a thriving arts destination. Although this may seem like a good thing to some</text>

The trustees would have veto rights, but could end the cycle if they did not like what the economic park offered. The new board would draw funds from the park and put them into the development of the city’s infrastructure, while the development corporation would draw on the park’s revenues and put them into infrastructure projects.  In other words, the park could act as a financial engine for the city’s infrastructure, while the development corporation would tend to that which it could cultivate commercially.  This is the economic logic of a museum of modern art.

In other words, the biennial form was itself evolving in response to the economic and urban development that accompanied the development of New York City.In its initial form, the museum was seen as an essential site for the collection and promotion of cultural resources, as well as a place where the cultural resources of the city resided in mutual dependency with the cultural resources of other locations. This idea was further developed by artists who came to the institution through the programs that accompanied the growth of the museum. These artists included Charles Bukowski, John Lennon, Nora Crook, and Margaret Mitchell. While the museum itself continued to display a</text>

The photos were taken during a tour by Liverpool Biennial staff led by Louise Shelley, who was then the museum’s Curator of Placesthe Rare Book and Fragmentary Collections. The tour guide was none other than Clive Thompson, an artist who had previously worked with Liverpool Biennial on two previous occasions. The photos appear as a set of seven in the exhibition catalogue, along with an introduction by Thompson. Some of the buildings on which they were taken are now part of the Museum of Modern Art, while others are in disuse or vacant after decades of neglect.

The 20th Panorama, which took place in Liverpool, featured a ‘stunning new spin on the tradition’ of light shows, this time created by a man named Robert Hewison. Hewison’s light show was a dramatic departure from the traditional, scripted form, but it offered a number of unexpected, creative, and sometimes profoundly meaningful responses to the city’s darkness. Here, we turn to highlight some of these unexpected, creative, and sometimes profoundly meaningful responses.

The exhibition catalogue begins with an essay entitled ‘Liverpool Biennial’, and the essay is accompanied by six photos from the museum that ‘show off the various incarnations of the Biennial’s varied themes.[...] ‘The most arresting feature of the contemporary biennial is its open access nature, in which the curatorial speech is often as an afterthought, or even a distraction. But such is the seductive nature of the museum, and its endemic infrastructuralism, that we soon find ourselves spending vast amounts of time reading and researching ‘the museum as a whole’, which is often read as if it were a collection of photographs. But ‘the museum is just a collection of photographs’, and the collections it hosts – which are themselves collections of photographs – are no less an artifact of the city they’re housed in than any other form of museum.’[…]</text>

The exhibition catalogue also includes a number of essays that address the same subjects, although their authors are often reluctant to speak openly about their experiences because they’re concerned about how such language will affect the powerful position that their identities continue to acquire in the city.  A few of the essays do so in chronological order, while others explicitly narrate the actions of individual citizens in relation to an imagined ‘city’ that is often maligned and misunderstood.  The catalogue also includes a number of images of individuals that I never met but nevertheless recognised in the light show because they’d been photographed or documented in an article or a book about the city.

The book, which was published in April 2014, was divided into four chapters and divided into two parts, entitled ‘The City of Light’ and ‘The City of Waste’.  The chapter entitled ‘The City of Light’ focused on the biennial as a cultural medium through which a number of different kinds of interventions could be introduced into the cultural landscape of the city. These interventions might be ‘recreational, such as nature’s arts in parks and forests, or they might be more architecturally oriented, such as the installation of LED streetlights in parks.  In this sense, the 20th Panorama chapter incorporated elements from many different areas of the museum, including its collection, programs and exhibitions.

Hewison’s light show was a dramatic departure from the traditional, scripted form, but it offered a number of unexpected, creative, and sometimes profoundly meaningful responses to the city’s urban landscape. For example, in some of the photos, the ‘future City’ appears to be defined by a metainterface of automated traffic signals and CCTV cameras. In others, the city is defined by an artificial island ‘built into the shape of a rose’ that is ‘filled with gold and precious stones’. In yet others, the city appears to be defined by a series of circular tunnels that separate two parallel worlds. In yet others, the city is both defined by a single, seemingly meaningless tower and a series of connected tunnels and passages that lead nowhere. The ‘city of the future’ is a construct of the future, constructed as a physical impossibility in the present and constantly revised in advance of any future events.  The city of the future, then, appears to function as an excuse for present and future events to happen in a certain geographical area, but it serves a very different function in this cosmopolitan metropolis.

Hewison’s light show was a dramatic departure from the traditional, scripted form, but it offered a number of unexpected, creative, and sometimes profoundly meaningful responses to the city’s traffic, noise, and urban issues. Here, we turn to look back on the history of light and urbanization in Liverpool, and how the art of urbanization came to be embodied in the city’s iconic lamps and street lamps.The history of light in Liverpool is one of many stories told through the city’s transport and urbanization policy of the 1950s and 1960s, which sought to shift the balance of global urbanization from industry to transport and from agriculture to agriculture through a federally-funded, locally-controlled public transport system called ‘The Urban Circulator’. As Stephen Leacock described in his book  The Urban Frontier: Performance, Politics, and Cultural Geographies of the Recent Past ��, ‘the Circulation Problem’ was formulated in the 1950s by the work of three collaborating academics – Carl August von Hippel, Friedrich A. Fischer, and Werner Kunz. The problem was posed this way: the ‘urban citizen</text>

In honor of the 20th Panorama, we present to you, the curatorship’s first monologue, the currant’s opening monologue, the currant’s introduction, and the currant’s epilogue. The monologue was written by Ben Whittaker for the Liverpool Biennial 2016 exhibition, and it will be performed by a number of the museum’s staff. The monologue was written almost entirely by Ruth Burch and Ruth Hartshorn, with assistance from other staff members. For the Liverpool Biennial 2017, we asked several curators to contribute a prologue essay. Although they were all presented with the opportunity to speak at the event, none of them chose to do so, partly because they felt it was not a fitting subject matter for a scholarly work, partly because they were uncomfortable with being lumped together, and even partly because they feared speaking publicly about a work that they had not yet undertaken</text>

The first light show, created and curated by Robert Hewison, was published in the April 2016 issue of New Art (in collaboration with Liverpool Biennial and Henry Cowie Trust).  The second, and final, light show, published in the June 2016 issue of New Art, is a ‘living monument to the city’s urban dream’, in that it functions as a ‘continuing monument to the consummation of material culture, including the material forms that it supports’.3 [I]t was not until the late twentieth century that science and engineering fully took hold of the concepts the city, and the city itself began to be systematically designed. During that century, the automobile became the preferred mode of transport, and the historical significance of this becomes even more apparent in the hundreds of engineering books published during that decade.

Hewison’s light show was a dramatic departure from the traditional, scripted form, but it offered a number of unexpected, creative, and sometimes profoundly meaningful responses to the city’s infrastructure, infrastructure culture, and mass tourism industries that had been built around it.  The City of Light is a radical curatorial statement about the city’s infrastructure and postindustrial society, which was widely perceived as a threat by government planners and the dominant economy of the era. It emerged as a cultural phenomenon, attracting artists from all over the world, and marking a break with the previous curatorial practices of the era.  The mission of the Liverpool Biennial, then, remained the same as it is today: to archive, present, and propagate the work of its past curators, artists, and writers in a globally visible way. The main curatorial agenda for the period was expanded to take into account the rapid changes that had been occurring in the city during the decade between 2013 and 2016, including the impact of Brexit and the US presidential elections. The policy of global curation that was developed during this time was reshaped in many ways, and many projects ceased to be. These</text>

We tend to over-value the things we own, but what happens to a city, and its built environment, in times of social, political and ecological stress? Biesta’s account is that we are caught up in a crisis of civilization because we have become so sedentary, and our eating habits are an afterthought. We don’t pay enough attention to the land that we’re growing food on, and the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem that supports it. We also tend to neglect the people who are living in the built environment, who contribute to the maintenance of infrastructure and who shape how infrastructure is built. Biesta’s character is captured in the line: ‘Today I am surrounded by skyscrapers, but even though the market for office buildings and comparable assets is saturated, the supply of office workers is uncertain and the quality of service is questionable.’ The inability to connect the physical to the virtual is what gives the impression of a crisis of civilization, but the real essence of the problem</text>

We tend to over-value the things we own, and we tend to forget the things we don’t yet own.  She also argues that our cultural habits are such that we can identify the things we don’t yet own in a photo: the habit of the photo, the memory of the photo, and the habit of association all reinforce one another.  She suggests that we might be able to break free of the recurring lapse of memory, or the image, if we could access the latent memory of the social.  In other words, the things we retain in memory or perceive as familiar might not be so.  She also proposes that the latent memory might be able to instigate action by encouraging the formation of associations between historical facts and contemporary social phenomena.  In short, she proposes that ‘infrastructure’ might be able to reclaim and reimagine a situation in which things that once were could once again be so.  She also proposes that infrastructure might enable us to create environments that support the interaction</text>

In her essay ‘Crisis of Civilization’, Gert Biesta argues that we’ve all become so accustomed to the things we’ve become that we don’t pay enough attention to the things we’re not so accustomed to. We tend to over-value the things we have, over-value the world around us, and become culturally oblivious. We give culture too much credit, and live our lives in ways that are too preoccupied with the things around us. I take the view that the problem with our cultural moment is that it focuses so much on the things that it is possible to become culturally oblivious to. There is an excess of material and cultural access to people, objects and ideas. Too much of what we associate with ‘culture’ is actually just the sharing of experiences and the making of social bonds. Sociality without bonds is just social interaction, and thus we don’t invest enough in making that happen.  Biesta’s account of social life in the age of biennials and museums is a form of historical-materialist theorizing. It starts from the materialists' misunderstanding of what culture is, and how it functions, and ends up explaining the social world through the social. Her conceptual approach is largely based</text>

Biesta also proposes a way to rethink biennials as art projects: the way to do it is to ‘reanimate’ them, to let them grow and change and produce similar effects on their sites.  I liked this particular rejection of monolithic structures. It reminded me of an old J.D. Power maxim: maxims are used against ‘the system’. It also made me think about the use of infrastructures in a larger urban context. How do we think about infrastructures in a context that includes culture and natural resources?  A suburbia is a complex spatial arrangement of buildings and structures that comes with certain rights and privileges. It has a spatial form, too, which is hierarchical and structured: it has a spatial form, a pattern, and a privileged position within it.  The projections</text>

Biesta goes on to argue that we also tend to treat the things we have as though they’re pieces of a beautiful puzzle that we could always assemble into a complete project. But this isn’t true. Rather, the over-value and lack of critical thinking required to dismantle opportunistic and cultural capitalism comes from within. It’s the self-defeating tendency of the market to its projects of value. The more we attempt to assemble a truly global and interdependent economy out of disparate components, the more we’re likely to succumb to the trap of culture-on-a-chip. The more we associate specific art and culture with a specific place and time in history, the more likely we are to succumb to opportunistic cultural capitalism. The narrative that emerges from these two essays is very different from the original one. But they both envision a future where the cultural industries</text>

We tend to over-value the things we have, and create bureaucracies around them. Biesta makes the point that we are increasingly concerned with the things that are produced by the city instead of the world around us. We produce more than we consume, and so the art department is now faced with the task of meeting demand without producing anything that can be stored or sold. It produces murals that can be bought, and it actively engages with the current political situation in an attempt to create a sense of contingency in the face of an impending collapse. The biennial as an art form is now faced with a crisis of its own making. The biennial has become something that requires no capital. It doesn’t require a museum board, which is reluctant to support a biennial with low budgets, given the political pressures. It doesn’t require a significant curatorial team, which is reluctant to invest in an art department that is already struggling to retain patrons amid the urban onslaught. And it doesn’t require a large</text>

We tend to over-value the things we have, and let our collectivity define what is valuable. But the painting that Goya assembled as a statement of things to come, the collection of things to come, and the monolith to come were ephemeral. They were replaced with new modes of cultural organisation. Biesta begins his essay by describing the trivialities of the real life – the killjoyy bits – that keep cropping up in conversation about the cities that have become zombie-infested suburbs, or worse, war zones. And he ends up describing the utopian dreams of the curators who dream up ever more fantastically designed post-apocalyptic wastelands. These utopian visions, he says, ‘exaggerate the capacities of their users, who now inhabit them more communally and bring about a condition of nomadic over-dwelling, ‘where no life is truly lived’.

We tend to over-value the things we have, in the sense that we assign a value to them that isn’t based in reality. When we assign a value to something, we tend to create its opposite. When I paint murals, for example, I try to create something aesthetically neutral and informal, but I also try to create something that catches the eye of someone with a political bent. I hope this strikes a chord with you.  As an artist, I’ve always strived to tell a story in a poetic or poetic-like way. Gert Biesta describes something similar in her essay ‘Crisis of Civilization: Modernity and Cultures of Resistance’. You see, modernity has brought a proliferation of cultures together in what she calls the ‘common good’, which is now circumscribed by the ideologies of nation-states. So while modernity itself is the problem, the emergence of new systems of value around the world that seek to isolate nations or specific places</text>

Art, she argues, provides a way to look at the world through the eyes of those still inhabiting it. The projections she refers to are those which still exist in every city, even if they’re hidden or obscured by culture or other factors. Because they’re cultural in their own way, they manifest in different ways. The projections she refers to are the very thing we need today – a project, a movement, a recurring event – to keep our vision pointed in the right direction.  Art, Biesta maintains, is crucial for such a movement to grow. But she also maintains that an increasing reliance on artists as curators and artists themselves will only foster a culture of passive repetition, rather than the kind of active contemplation needed to detect hidden meaning in the world around us.

We tend to over-value the things we have, while under-valuing the things we don’t.  She cites the famous ‘Cadillac Earthquake’ as an example of how important it is to pay attention to what’s happening around you. If you don’t have the power to respond quickly and decisively, then what do you have? She also argues that you need to start collecting materials now to start making improvised structures and kitsch as well as goods from the rubble. Biesta’s thinking is similar to the way that artists today would start collecting materials and start making art soon after the devastation happens.

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, which looked back on a city in disarray, seems a microcosm of things to come. The spectacle of the destroyed city recurred time and again, as did the promise of a future that could be built around the spectacle of destruction. But in the intervening years, we have witnessed the spectacle of ever greater destruction, as if the human race somehow managed to rebound from the destruction caused by climate change. The question is, will our species be able to adapt? How we define &quot;adaptation&quot; is a critical question that will determine whether the destruction caused by climate change will be categorised as an &quot;adaptation&quot; crisis or a &quot;globality crisis&quot;.In the present crisis of capitalism, the global north is in the grip of a mammoth and largely unbalanced trade deficit, which is fueling rapid population growth and fuelling a desperate need for ever more energy from the supposedly finite resource base on which capitalism depends.

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. Global GDP per capita now exceeds that of South Korea, and twenty-first century per capita consumption exceeds that of the inhabitants of the small town of Moravia, Poland. Yet, despite these colossal figures, global GDP remains relatively unexploited.Only a minority of the planet’s population actually fits into the global economic measure of GDP. Only about twenty percent actually own land, and the rest own buildings, homes, shares and other property titles. Ownership of buildings and property titles, however, is only a nominal consideration in the globalised capitalist economy; economic activity on the real estate market is the real consideration. And yet, in the current global capitalist economy, ownership is everything. Globalising nations that are keen to expand their geographical possessions (and thus, their populations) are keen to bolster their holdings of land and property titles with people, property titles and places. This is why countries that have large numbers of unemployed people are keen on encouraging immigration from low-wage countries,</text>

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. Globalisation has brought wealth and poverty, but it also brings enormous amounts of destruction as capitalism tries to push ever more of its wealth and power into the globalised sector of cities. Cities now account for over half of the world's economic output, but they are also the largest component of the global after-solar-thermal-system. The metainterface – the cultural form and the after-solar-thermal-system – is the dominant mode of exchange in the world today. But what happens after the metainterface has emerged as the dominant mode of exchange – what has been termed the ‘grey economy’ – is the real work of adaptation.The term ‘adaptation’ has been used to describe a globalised future in which humans are no longer the main actors in the ecological and climatological systems that shape the planet.

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. The answer, it seems to me, is a resounding yes. The more we export the planet away from its natural inhabitants, the more we shame our fellow human beings down to the status of animals – something that has happened already in the developing world due to an overconsumption of resources. But what happens when that resource base is threatened? When the social costs of resource depletion become too great – as in the case of a truly massive asteroid hitting the earth – is the question. And what does it mean to threaten? I will explain in a moment.When the Industrial Revolution was begun in the late eighteenth century, it was a logical extension of this idea of resource depletion. The reason why was that the first industrial plants required the raw materials needed to build themselves: timber, iron ore, coal, water – all of which were obtained from nature. In other words, the very idea of production itself emerged from the need to access raw materials in order to power the machinery. The end</text>

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and tidal energies are currently employed in the metallurgy of low-grade coal at extremely high rates, which is fueling a sustained and massive expansion of nuclear in the wake of a fundamental glut of non-renewable energies. But with the exception of a few highly speculative projects, such as those by the PRC or Russia’s Uralkali NPP, which aim to exploit untapped solar energy resources, which are being developed at breakneck speed in the wake of the climate crisis, and which may well be economically viable in the context of a sustained transition to low-carbon forms of energy, such as nongrowth and zero-emission power, the vast majority of new nuclear power projects are being developed in the wake of the crisis. And as the world population continues to grow, so does the demand for energy, which is pushing all but the most photovoltaic projects up the grid.As a consequence, the</text>

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. Is the answer to this question still the same as it was ten years ago, or will the cultural industries of climate change be able to find creative ways of utilising the massive amount of renewable energy generated by the planet at a prodigious rate?The answer to this question will undoubtedly determine how we live our futures. Whether we wish to or not, the fact of the crisis of capitalism will undoubtedly become visible in the future historical narratives we produce in a multitude of cultural forms all around the world. But for the moment, the historical narratives that are being fashioned around the crisis will remain obscure and unspoken. The cultural industries of globalisation are reshaping not only what we see and do in public places, but also in private places, and this reshaping is happening amidst the displaced and displaced populations. The question becomes, how will the social realities of climate change interact with the existing social dimensions of climate change? How are the displaced and the migrant populations shaping the future of cities? How are</text>

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. It is widely believed that the massive amount of solar energy that is produced on a massive scale in the world today is a by-product of the photovoltaic industry, but this is not universally agreed. A growing body of research now suggests that the enormous amounts of solar energy that are being pumped into the global north is being used up and produces excess in the process. So while the North is consuming more energy from renewable energies than it produces in return, it is producing less in the sense that the surplus is being spent on producing surplus, rather than reinvesting the surplus into the infrastructure that supports the sustainability of the north as a result of its dense population, vast landscapes and increasingly urbanised population centres.This is the equation that seems to be distorting in the current trade balance. It is being done at a rate that will make the climate accretionary – that is, the climate would naturally shift towards a point in the balance where resource use ceases to be an issue – so</text>

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. Is the answer to this question, and how we might live in transition or if we will simply collapse – into ever greater ecological crises – into ever larger and more unmanageable cities – remains to be seen.The history of our understanding of the relationship between art and the environment is a story of two world wars, major urbanisation programmes and massive scientific and industrial agendas. But the relationship between art and the environment that emerged during the 1960s and 1970s is a story of drastic change and resilience. In many ways, the relationship between culture and the environment was more readily available and more pervasive during this time because there were fewer people in poverty and more opportunities for social interaction among artists and audiences. Art as art-making became more accessible and socialised. Art as art-presentation became more widespread and socialised. And finally, as a consequence, the relationship between the artist and the viewer became more fluid and interactive.All of these changes came about as a consequence of the massive social</text>

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. Where does the surplus go? Where does the surplus go to feed the beast? As the periodic table shows, the world is a complex system that must have some kind of fundamental ordering that cannot be provided by the individual objects that make up our planet. And although there are many different kinds of objects in the periodic table, there is one fundamental kind of object that is universally recognised as the kind with which humans are most familiar: the human body. The human body is a manufactured artefact. Human beings have invented tools and dressings and recipes and packaging and clothes and healthcare packages and baby-sits and cars and houses and offices and festivals and graves and monuments and maps and accountings and billiard tables and video games and aeroplanes and dishwashers and hairdressers and dry cleaners and dry-cleaning services and financial planners and bloggers and financial advisers and caterers and supermarkets and financial meltdown and financial bailouts and financial crunches and holidays and football stadiums and</text>

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this capitalist fantasy of a future energy system. And the answer is: quite literally, everywhere. As the economist Thomas W. Cooley famously stated, when faced with a problem with no solution, you either fight the problem or you ‘get stuck in the problem’. The problem is everywhere, and yet its definition is defined primarily by what kind of use it can make – what kinds of buildings can be made from the rubble. So the question becomes whether the environmental problems of the world today are a symptom of the destruction wrought by globalisation, or whether they are the other way around: a symptom of the bureaucratised upcycling of resources worldwide. Perhaps the answer to that question will open up new horizons of understanding.Download this article as PDFTom VandeputteTom Vandeputte is an Architect and Principal in the office of Geoff Cox, Deputy Director for Research and Partnerships at Tate Liverpool.

But the question is where the renewable energies of the planet fit into this equation. Where do we draw the line? The decision to mine, build and populate new cities seems arbitrary and capricious, but the question of where the dividing line between development and wilderness becomes unclear and arbitrary also. Is it a place where only the physically strongest survive, or a place where even the physically strongest are subject to the whims of a constantly shifting and unpredictable economy? The question naturally arises as to what constitutes a &quot;preserve&quot;, a.k.a. a place where only the physically strongest survive. But what has been called the Wilderness Act only 20 years ago – a bizarre and ill-defined piece of legislation that seems to have emerged from a libertarian socialist white supremacist movement – has become the law of the land. The question becomes whether or not the setting and scale of the Biennale is appropriate for the kind of political, ecological and/or urban planning that is required in a city, given the current state of decay and devastation in the city.

But since the early 1990s, a kind of ajournale has come to be used in the sense of the first Venice Biennale, in an attempt to capture the essence of the event through a kind of archival research. A kind of archival research that seeks to preserve the essential characteristics of the Biennale as a cultural event through the kind of archival research that is usually done on a biennial, known as ‘temporal’ research. I’m not trying to reinvent the biennial, but the temporal research is part of the cultural anthropology that I do work with, and it’s part of what biennials do; it’s what we do because we’re drawn to it. A biennial is a cultural event when it occurs, and it’s always been that way: the cultural anthropologist comes, the scholar or explorer comes, and it’s always that way. But the event</text>

The idea of the ‘episodic’ has been enough for me, although the ‘biennale’ and the ‘episodic’ have a kind of ‘dimension’ that is less a succession of acts and more of a temporality that is anchored in specific moments. And I think that there is a kind of ajournale’ in the chronological sense of the word: the kind of episodic construction that can be understood as the origination of ajournalese, as the historical origination of the episodic. And so the idea of the ‘episodic’ has been enough for me, although the ‘biennale’ and the ‘episodic’ need to be given actuality. And here is where the biennial comes to the question of temporality.

The only thing that separates those two forms of cultural exchange is the space and the people that use them. And the only thing that is allowed to be produced in either case is what is already there. I find the biennale and the episodic to be mutually exclusive. I would not want to prevent either from happening, except that neither would I want to prevent either from happening. And the other framing and contextualisation that the Biennale can do is a nice thing, but it is not what gives the biennale its character or purpose or meaning or power or history or whatever. So I would like the biennale to have something more substantial and more powerful and dynamic and interesting behind it, something anchored and persistent and controllable and visible and relatable and all that jazz. I would like to see something more like a city or a region or a city. Something that can be counted and measured and compared and compared</text>

The idea that you can ‘trigger’ an episodic through a particular event, any event, is a kind of breaking point, and at a certain point the biennale has to decide whether it is actually interested in breaking its own event into episodic form, or whether it is interested in reiterating the historical patterns that it knows are being perpetuated. This decision is probably a decision that every artist making a project for the biennale would have to make, because the importance of breaking the event into episodic form cannot be underestimated. The idea that the biennale is a cultural institution that can be regularly (and artistically) reinterpreted through a particular event is a kind of breaking point that initiates an episodic.

This was very evident in the performance that was being organised by the Jewish Museum and the Biennale itself: the performance that was being organised by the Biennale itself, the performances that were taking place in the museum, and the biennale itself. The performance that was being organised by the museum itself, the  	Towards a World Cultural Model , was itself an act of repetition, as all of these acts were designed to be repeated ad infinitum. The important point about art as performance is that it is impossible to regulate the behaviour of the artist.

The other three biennales that I know of that use the term ‘episodic’ happen in cycles, with the Venice Biennale being the only one that does not have a fixed, predictable and temporally rigid centre. Without this kind of dynamic, it would be impossible for us to observe the same event across different biennales. In a more detailed way, biennales can be organized around defined archetypes of a certain kind, such as the Jewish or Christian biennale. But during the two years or so that it takes a biennale to complete its main artistic work, a biennale has to deal with the fact that it has entered into a permanent relationship with something, or some entity, that is always in motion.

Biennials in Santa Monica still exist, and are quite different from what they were ten years ago, but there is a kind of episodic quality to them, and perhaps the episodic quality that I am trying to instill into the biennial.

    <text>biennials past and present, but especially the first Venice Biennale, which began in 1921. My interest in the biennale today is in the sense that it is an occasion of heightened interest, but also in the sense that it is a vehicle that offers a possible future, or at least a way to think about the means by which our present may change. My philosophy of the biennale has been guided by the idea of an ‘episodic’ character, who is, I believe, the right word. I define the ‘episodic’ as occurring twice per calendar year (September and December) or ‘biennales’, which are two of the forms that have been used since the first Venice Biennale. I have used these terms with a kind of alatine, as if that were the only meaningful way to think about them, and I use them with a kind of ajournale, which is the only meaningful way to think about them as a form of museum. The idea that you can come to a biennale and experience it as a museum, or as a sequence of museums, is a kind of ajournale that I find very difficult to wrap my head around. It seems to me that there is a disconnect there, between the moments when the biennale is a museum, and the moments when it is a place that invites or attempts to conceal or to obscure the historical process through what it presents as a ‘present’. I don’t think that the biennale is a place where you can be fooled by how much history is going on, nor do I think that it’s a place where you can be fooled by the tricks of modernism or the arts’ historical value. But I do think that the idea of the biennale as a ‘place of concealment and obfuscation’, as Benjamin Bratton would say, is deeply at odds with</text>

So one could say that the genesis of the biennale is ‘episodic’, and the episodic is the point where the biennial starts to ‘bite the dust’. I would argue that there is more to it than that, and that the genesis of the biennial as a whole is a story that is much more deeply entwined with the historical and urban context of the city in which it takes place as a result of the biennale as a cultural body. I would propose the following division between the biennial and the contemporaneous, or contemporaneous culture: the biennial as a cultural form, the contemporaneous culture as a ‘real community of people’, which I think of as the epicentre of contemporary cultural exchange. I would extend this to include the local and the global aspects of cultural exchange, since this is where we live and work and play and imbricate our practices</text>

The AI/Dartmouth partnership has initiated a new era of collaboration between the arts and non-arts sectors in Liverpool, and is confident that this new model will be followed by other artists and curators in the city.  Art should be collaborative, but it’s also critical that it receive a meaningful and respectful role in creating and expanding human culture. That means respecting the political, economic and cultural differences between the different stakeholders in the city, and making the cultural practices that are most in sync with those different stakeholders. That takes hard work and intention on the part of the artists and curators, and it’s a legacy that they should work towards building themselves. This could mean embracing the destructive aspects of neoliberalism, but it’s also about forging alternative cultural practices, and forging partnerships with other art sectors that support those creative endeavours. That’s why biennials</text>

The research and education may be conducted in the same city, the same time, and across the same subjects. The curatorial language invites us to consider the ways in which a biennial can function as a platform for dialogue, inquiry and discovery, while the art project may present the city in its natural order but with a touch of chaos. The biennial format may be broken up into smaller episodes, with individual artists creating mini-exhibitions around selected themes. Each episode may focus on a different theme, with or without a focus on a particular culture or region. The mini-exhibitions may be initiated by an individual artist or curator, and may be invited by the biennial or the art institution.

The concept may be applied to other sectors, too, such as those concerned with the environment, business, labour and the professions.  The biennial format may be broken up into smaller projects, and the projects may be developed further by the same artist, curator, administrator or other professional organisation.  The amount of investment needed to develop a large-scale biennial project may differ depending on the priorities and priorities of the various stakeholders, and the resources may be used in different ways. A consideration of the different stakeholders may enable us to identify areas of mutual interest, and the need for collaboration may arise.

In the biennial format, the research and education project may be organised in parallel, or in stages, with the curatorial language inviting us to consider the conflicts of power and money in a city, while the management of the arts and culture sector may be divided into two groups: those engaged with the production and maintenance of art venues and cultural assets, and those tasked with the production of events that enhance the value of the sector. The biennial formats may be seen as biennials in their own right, and may be seen to invite us to investigate the ways in which art is produced today in a city, and may even be seen as venues for the production of art in the future.  The biennial format is one that is constantly renegotiating itself, constantly searching for the most technically and culturally viable way to structure art production and consumption. It is a format that demands a great deal of creativity and skill, but is also a set of rules that are constantly being broken, and in an ever-increasing number of cases, deliberately so. The problem with the biennial format is not so much with the production itself, as with the governing ideas that legitimise and permit it. There</text>

The focus of the research project may be placed on those areas of the city where a significant number of people live, work or study, while the cultural institutions may be invited to consider tertiary but still marginal places of cultural consumption.  The curatorial priorities may be dictated by the needs and desires of a particular project, although the priority given to cultural institutions should be equitable to all segments of the city. Art’s place in the city should be as diverse as the people who use its art resources. The biennial format is a powerful tool for cultural disaggregation because it places the artworks at the center of cultural exchange, while the cultural resources – the practices, ideologies and discourses that shape cultural practice in the city – are dispersed and under the microscope of local authorities, journalists and others with a clear interest in optics.

In the biennial format, the research and education project may be organised in parallel, or in stages, with the curatorial language inviting us to consider the conflicts of power and money in a city. In stage one, the conflict of power may be addressed through the project’s proposal, its contents, principles and proposals (including funding), followed by a public discussion with artist, art director (including the fee), art supplier, art critics and other interested parties. In stage two, the conflict of interest may be addressed through the engagement of art institution and biennial parent company. In either case, an understanding of the tensions and opportunities of urban and regional research and education is hoped to contribute to the curatorial rhetorical campaign of the biennial, not least as a way to develop strategies for the conflict mitigation.  Biennials may be conceptualised as ‘capital C1’ units of the global urbanisation machine, deployed across nation and international scales to meet the demands of finance, media and commercial interests, and to provide exhibition platforms for a range of cultural activities, including trade and commerce.1  	[i] Andrew Goffey, The New Urban Frontier (Cam</text>

In the biennial format, the research and education project may be organised in parallel, or in stages, with the curatorial language inviting us to consider the conflicts of power and money in a city in which a biennial is a core part of a larger cultural institution. Artisans may initiate collaborative research projects between the curatorial staff and artist’s groups, and the research staff may employ artists to work with local communities on solutions to identified issues. Collaborative research and education projects may be initiated through the research director’s post, with the curatorial staff providing support to artists as they develop solutions to identified issues. These may include but are not limited to: urban development, mapping, architecture, infrastructure, community development, public works, etc.  Biennials have come a long way since their beginnings in the 1980s in the US and other western capitalist cities, and are a critical moment in the history of art and exhibition making. They represent a radical break from the past, and set art producers and curators on a collision course with the power brokers who control much of what is conceived of as art in the west.

The curatorial language may propose alternative approaches, such as by combining the two or even triennials, in an attempt to bring out the best in all. The biennial format may offer artists and artisans the possibility of entering into reciprocal relationships, as a way of supporting each other as artists and curators collaborate on the same city projects, projects and events.

Biennials will not just exist as historical documents; they will also adapt to new forms of archiving, and to the practices and ideologies of new curators, curatorialities and art scholars. They will engage with the practices and ideologies of community resourcefulness, grassroots art assembly, urban and regional planning, art and worker’s compensation, art and urban evolution, art and identity, art as a public good, and art and urban transformation, while at the same time remaining sources of meaning for a community that is primarily engaged with its streets and public spaces. They will also, like any social event, produce its share of critics and activists.

The goal of the art and cultural institutions may be to promote a particular image of the city through a curatorial intervention, while the other components of the biennial may consider how to utilise the urban setting as a platform for differentiating themselves. The fact that the research and education projects are centrally located will ensure that they draw resources from elsewhere, while the cultural institutions may coordinate with local businesses and community groups to take part in a ‘shopping mall’ or ‘grocery shop’ craze or ‘recycled goods' sale at a later date. The biennial format may encourage biennial-like projects across disciplines by allowing artists and arts groups to pool their resources and expertise, which in turn, aid in the establishment of a shared common ground.

And there’s a reason why cultures are so invested in the preservation of their present: to the extent that it threatens their very current form, a culture is likely to respond by valuing permanence above all.Download this article as PDFJussi ParikkaJussi Parikka is Professor of Visual Cultures and Head of Research at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

In the arts, of course, this often means replicating what is already there (with the added complication that sometimes that means making it better). But there are cultures that understand that ‘there’s more to life than meets the eye can deliver. So they're willing to invest in processes that create images that are richer and more compelling than what is already there (and can still be found through research and discovery alone, as well as through cultural means). I think of the Puritans (who re-branded themselves the Puritans after their 1631 re-constituting of the Puritan's confession) as one example to be explored. The Puritans, unlike many artists of their time, were not interested in replicating what was already there so much as in creating something new and original. They wanted to invest in what they saw as God’s own work – which again, could be seen as an endorsement of what they saw as the salvific work of salvaging what was lost through what they termed ‘perversion’. It was this impulse that, in many ways, underlay their actions and their insistence on testing the limits of what was already made, rather than</text>

There’s a reason why figures like Winograd, Micanor, Mierle and others with a cultural orientation to the past have had such impact factors as #BlackLivesMatter and movements like it. There’s a reason why Tate Modern and Tate Britain have been developing long-term curatorial and educational programmes for the future generation of artists and arts professionals there. There’s a reason why, in the arts world at large, we encounter people like Winograd again and again: the work that he does with the lost art of archiving is beautiful, powerful and thought-provoking.

There’s a tension here between the organisational goals of the art institution and the actual organisational practices of the art-historical and archival material. In the former case, this can mean thinking through what it means to be an artist in the 21st century, and how that contributes to our contemporary artworlds; in the latter, it can mean thinking about what it means to be an artist in the past, and how that contributes to our contemporary artworlds.

When the latter becomes a thing, as it has in the digital society, things get done digitally (receiving things digitally is part of the job description). And so the notion of the future is often read as if it were a representation of things to come, with all of this new ‘stuff’ that is digitised and made manifest. It’s easy to imagine a world in which art is still actively produced and celebrated in some places (the nineteenth-century Romantic revival, for example) but increasingly uncommon in others. In fact, IMI Corona was originally conceived as a museum in the true sense of the word, holding the history of avant-garde art from its start in the port city of Long Beach in California in the early twentieth century.

In theoretical work like this, the ‘present’ is always/almost always an image of an already existing or soon to be dead process – a point at which point the work can be stopped short of actually stopping. In practice, this is often how practices are organised – to a greater or lesser extent depending on the priorities and objectives of the organisations employing those practices. In the arts, of course, this often means replicating what is already there (with the added complication that sometimes that means making it better). But there are cultures that understand that ‘there’s only so much visual space there is, and that space only becomes available to us through our labour – that space as a commodity, and not through any intrinsic worth or intrinsic value attached to it. This understanding is often expressed through art practices that actively contest the existing visual economy via visualising the alternative (i.e. ‘alternative’ media forms that don’t quite represent the contemporaneous reality of art in that particular culture). For instance, many artists today are either trained as visual artists or have completed an art school before engaging with the serious art market, but they don’t understand the difference between a production (i.e. work produced in a gallery or a workshop), exhibition, workshop, and curatorial appointment. So they create art that takes the form of a ‘curatorial appointment’ or a ‘workshop’ but with the added complication that it can also be a co-production between artist, gallery, network, or other stakeholders.</text>

So what do such cultures do when their use becomes problematic? Here, the arts are often seen as the defenders of the biennial, providing a check on the excesses of capitalism. In the case of biennials, the checks and balances are often seen as the means by which artists are able to make ends meet. But this is not always the case – as biennials themselves know. As biennials themselves know, there is always a catch – a catch-22 to be found somewhere in the running. Sometimes the check is strong, and the excesses seen as art are actually quite common within the given field, but as often happens, the field is so saturated with these images that it doesn’t notice them.

As we saw, this is a question that can lead to very different kinds of art forms. But there are ways of thinking about the future that are just as valid and powerful. The question of what is and isn’t already there (in the sense of being historically real or having been historically ‘real’ in some way) is a question that art (and especially the creative arts) can play a part in bringing to life. That role belongs to us, the artists, not to institutions or other stakeholders.Download this article as PDFConrad BlackmoreConrad Blackmore is an artist.

And there are cultural theorists that understand that traditions are made up of specific practices and that those practices have lives of their own (even if those lives are complicated and ambiguous and subject to change, and even if those lives are also often frustrated and worn out and inefficient and disconnected from one another). Cultural theorists also understand that certain kinds of organising can only be successful where there is a common language (or common point of entry into the organisation). That is, languages that are used by all members of the organisation – not just the practitioners of the particular practice – and that are accepted as valid by the wider community.

Rising Sea Level researcher Dr Jenny Coon of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego developed a similar dataset on a much larger scale. She and her colleagues used this to map the plankton blooms along the California coast and concluded that the sea level at Monterey Bay had actually risen by about 6mm in the past 200 years, and that the sea level in Los Angeles Bay had actually risen by about 12mm. These two sets of data set the stage for much larger, more widely applicable questions about the impacts of global climate change, particularly for the millions of people living downstream from the two coasts.How do we map the effects of global climate change? How do we measure them? How will our cities be powered in the future? These are questions that implicate a lot of people in the development of new ways of living, ways of travel, ways of working, ways of interacting with the city. I want to start by asking whether there is already too much data about the impacts</text>

Rising Sea Level   proposes a number of different approaches to this problem, from engineering solutions to actively shaping the mix of seawater to be discharged into the sea, to questions of sovereignty and self-sufficiency. We’re particularly interested in the role that seawater plays in mediating the interaction between land and sea, and how that might impact the future of New York and Queens.We discuss the role of cities in the climate equation, and how that might impact the lives of residents of the Queens, as well as the world as a whole. Should the city strive to exceed its finite resources through the active utilization of massive amounts of water? Or does the city have the capacity to construct massive seawater mains, only to watch as seawater floods inundate parts of the city, while pumping enormous amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere? At a macroscopic level, the challenge becomes how to use this capacity to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, while supporting the existence of culturally relevant uses of</text>

Rising Sea Level suggests that the answer is a definite 'yes'. If we do nothing about it, as the British government of 2014 argued, we risk flooding the Gulf with seawater, desalination plants and marine traffic obstructing the sea from forming any sort of barrier against the tidal wave of freshwater. This scenario isn’t far-fetched; as a recent study by the Geographical Information Systems (GIDS) team at the University of Delaware shows, even very conservative estimates are that much of North America and parts of Europe would be flooded if current trends continue. It just so happens that GIDS is a research team, whereas Rising Sea Level is a design and research team, so we get to pursue questions that are not mutually exclusive.For example, one of the GIDS research projects involves developing a methodology to detect floating debris in the ocean using a combination of sonar and buoys.

Rising Sea Level   proposes a number of actions to combat the effects of climate change on the planet, and many of these seem obvious to those living along the coasts. The question becomes whether the actions required to address the problem at a global scale are also possible along the coasts – and whether such actionable strategies exist along the coasts, or even in certain coastal communities.  I co-curated  	Sea Level at Sea (2013) and Geology at Sea with Karen O’Brien and Dirk Schwindt at the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as being an adjunct curator at the Museum of Modern Art and Archives in New York. 	The question of what constitutes a 'next step' in the scientific or technological design of transport or docks arises too.  Whether or not one agrees with the conclusions reached in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the fact remains that the sea level at or near the Earth's surface has risen at an inexistent and alarming rate for the</text>

Rising Sea Level has been studied by marine biologists for decades, but little is known about how the saline water that builds up in the Gulf affects organisms that live in and on the docks. If anything, the increased volume of seawater that builds up in the Gulf is believed to increase the life-span of the docks, since it supports the growth of algae that can then be traded between marine organisms. But what is believed to happen to the organisms that live in and on the docks is not well understood. That is, not enough is known about the organisms to allow scientists to create targeted interventions that can alter the life-spaces of specific organisms.

Rising Sea Level does a great job of showing us the current state of affairs in the Gulf: huge saltwater ponds surrounded by shallow, nutrient-poor waters that trap and trap water. But it does not go far enough: it does not go far enough to bring water to the shores of the ocean, where organisms live in constant fear of being overwhelmed by seawater? Perhaps the excess seawater from the ocean can be redirected into the form of trees and plants, which would cover the islands in a dense canopy of these evergreen trees and vegetative cover, while retaining the action of a coastal barrier? Perhaps trees and plants would cover the islands in a dense canopy of these evergreen trees and vegetative cover, while retaining the action of a coastal wall? Perhaps a coastal wall could be built across the Gulf to separate the trees from the non-native plant and animal life that inhabit the water? These are exciting ideas, that call for action. But action is rare, and often counterproductive. In the end,</text>

Rising Sea Level scientist Dr Roger Pertwee’s work with the Bermuda Triangle Research Station (2016-2017) has shown that the excess saltwater from the Gulf is an issue that warrants further investigation. In addition to contributing to the formation of storm surges and tides, the excess saltwater also interacts with the land-sea-mix in the ocean to form hydrocarbons that can be burnt and used as fossil fuels. With the burning of fossil fuels at an alarming rate, humanity is creating new kinds of organisms to be used as energy sources – and in the process destroying old kinds of life forms.

Rising Sea Level   proposes a number of solutions, among them encouraging businesses to set up shop close to the water, and providing opportunities for residents to volunteer and participate in the local economy. For the residents, the main solution is to set up their own scrubbers and latrines, which would provide water, electricity and food, and would also serve as a public realm for other people to come and live and work. For businesses, the next step is for them to set up shop nearby and recruit locals to work in their businesses. For the residents, this might involve offering them jobs in the scrubbers or cafes, or employing locals as cleaners or gardeners, as well as encouraging them to join the local community in various ways. For the neighbourhood residents, it might involve setting up neighbourhood groups with the local residents to teach and talk to young people about the area, and the history of the neighbourhood and the docks – asking them to take part in a scavenger hunt or join a game or two.

Rising Sea Level   proposes a number of different approaches to this issue, but some of the approaches I have favoured in the context of Rising Sea Level don’t involve building seawalls or walls on the shore, but rather involve supporting local communities in the creation of their own future shorelines. For me, the role of the artist is to connect people to the landscape, to create places where they can be surprised, to imagine their possibilities and to exploit their natural resources. Thus, the role of the photographer is to create an ambiguous but valuable relationship with the landscape, one that is mutually dependent on one another but also on the role of the developer and the company.  The photographer/landscraper duo Nina Edge and Polly Roper create unpredictable access to the shore through their business, ‘Polly Roper’s Geology of the Sands’, which describes the formation of sand and gravel and the physical processes involved in its manufacture.

Rising Sea Level   proposes a number of actions to combat the effects of climate change on the region. These range from supporting the creation of new marine protected areas to digging deeper into the ground to support coastal erosion, to creating new forms of resistance to the inocean flow of excess saltwater. Rising Sea Level’s project management proposes a number of actions that are rooted in an understanding of the dialectic: what can be understood as ‘global’ versus ‘local’ in relation to a given location. These dialects operate between the city and the island, between infrastructure and the marshes, between humans and nature. The dialectic provides a mapping of changing environments, but it is also a point of departure for the location of action. How do we begin to imagine a future where the dialectic does not exist?     The Rise of Climate Change: Impacts and Adaptations 	The dialectic that I refer to is based on the idea of evolution and natural selection.</text>
