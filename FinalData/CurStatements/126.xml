    The next Whitney Biennial will be held at the Brooklyn Museum, New York, in September 2018. Whitney Biennials have been hosted by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Amsterdam. Each biennial has a distinctive theme, typically related to art history or contemporary art, and a curator or curator-researcher regularly engages with the theme and the art, often teaching a class or two about contemporary art. The biennials themselves have their origins in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, where they were originally conceived as a separate entity. However, as biennials become more institutionalised and national in their form, a slightly different relationship is developing between the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Museum of Modern Art, Amsterdam.

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has become global and is now the dominant museum-industry biennial.Biennials have a history of holding particular fascination for their local communities. The Venice Biennale, curated by Paolo Baratta, is a classic example, which draws its power from the fact that its themes are local. Venice is the Italian equivalent of Disneyland, and is, in fact, a city within the city. It is numerous, unique and rich, yet seemingly disconnected from the rest of the city. The issue of its city-ness arises in part from the fact that these days it is often difficult to find a good-sized portion of the Venice Biennale, which was designed, in part, to host multiple, simultaneous exhibitions. In the 1980s, the Biennale was able to open around the world; in the 1990s, it was able to do so only in the United States. Most biennials today operate within the city, and although they claim to capture the essence of a</text>

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has become increasingly institutionalised: in the early twentieth century, biennials were significant in their own right, and constituted part of museums; today they are museums with curatorial appointments. When biennials first started out in the 1950s and 1960s, they were probably seen as an alternative to museums, because biennials contained cultural resources of a kind more readily available at museums, and were thus seen as culturally valuable. But as biennials become more institutionalised, and become part of museums, a kind of cultural desert has emerged. As biennials become more like museums, the cultural resources that were there in the 1950s and 1960s are lost, but their substance is preserved. And as biennials become more like museums, the forms that are essential for their cultural survival are lost as well. This loss of substance and loss of form is what biennials are facing today. They have become part of museums, but have little in the way of intrinsic cultural value or historical</text>

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has recently expanded its conventionality to report on the events of the previous week. The reportage is very much a part of the biennial, having been recently commissioned by the Amsterdam Museum and Delft University of Technology, and may be considered part of their research agenda into the past – though the anthropologist Mark Miodownik has made a point of saying that the museum and university simply don’t yet know what the future holds. For the museum, and indeed all art institutions, Miodownik’s assessment is an honest one, but one that demands an awful lot of digging into the past to arrive at. For Miodownik, the future is unknowable, so what is known is of value only if it is used in some way – if it is disseminated. Miodownik, along with a team of researchers, embarked on a research project in 2016 to map the language of the cannabis plant in relation to the Dutch history of the plant. They published</text>

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has become more institutionalised and nationalised. While museums may still devote substantial space to their collections, the biennial has largely replaced the museum as the exhibitionary form of exhibitionary value within the museum. The biennial may also exhibit works not meant for exhibition, but intended for circulation. A conspicuous exception is the 18 September Biennale of Sydney, which shows a number of works by many artists; its catalogue includes several works not meant for exhibition.

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has become institutionalised in its own logic. The biennial is the dominant exhibitionary form in Amsterdam, and the Museum of Modern Art, Amsterdam, and their exhibitions, are the predominant cultural commodities in the city. Dutch artist Jeanne van Heeswijk established a biennial in Amsterdam in 1995, and since then, the museum has hosted numerous other biennials, renowned among them The Contemporary Condition, an exhibition of works by Philip Glass, that opened in 1999. The museum has also curated numerous other biennials, such as Around the World in a Week, which began in 2002.Since the mid-1990s, biennials have increasingly been presented as a kind of exhibitionary form, often accompanied by a ‘series of related activities’. In 1995, the FAO launched the first ever Berlin Biennale, which became the European headquarters of the Museum of Modern Art. Since then, the Biennale has staged numerous other biennials around the world, and the</text>

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has become extremely apparent in the last decade. The Museum of Modern Art, New York, for instance, has produced more biennials than any other museum within the city, and between them they now form one of the largest and most internationally visible biennials of our time. Curators P. Rajendran and S. Ramakrishna at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in their survey of art from the last twenty years, write, ‘The biennial has become the museum in which the artist, his or her productions and all cultural products gather, form, exchange, and are ultimately consumed.’[6] In other words, biennials are cultural institutions in their own right, and, by their very nature, cultural institutions with significant cultural impacts. As the biennial has become more and more institutionalised, and its buildings and grounds cordoned off, the biennial as a museum has become more and more like other museum exhibitions: it gathers information</text>

This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has led to a theme that is no longer confined to the city of New York. Dateline New York, September 2018I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, so I know a thing or two about poverty, injustice and the politics of island identity. I was raised by my maternal grandmother in a quiet subdivision in Culebra subdivision, a predominantly white neighbourhood in the western part of the Puerto Rican San Juan Island. My paternal grandfather was a naval officer and my maternal grandfather was a civil servant. The family relocated frequently, settling in different parts of the neighbourhood, often staying for extended periods of time. The majority of my family remained on the mainland, but one of my uncles, a retired Air Force colonel, joined the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), and we moved to Victoria, British Columbia. From there, the family moved to California, and eventually to Florida. My maternal grandfather remained in Puerto Rico, and my maternal grandfather in Florida. From the mid-1950s until the early 1960</text>

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has become increasingly important in keeping up with the ever-expanding number of cities and nations that are being visited. As the biennial visitor numbers swell, the need to constantly update its visitor count will only increase. For this reason alone, it is becoming increasingly rare for the Museum of Modern Art, New York, to have more than a few hundred visitors at any one time. Biennials have become essential for museums, for they are the primary users of museums, and thus, unlike other institutional forms, are obliged to respond to current trends and patterns of consumption and use. Although this may be true of museums and large art collections, biennials are a particularly acute observers in the field of art-related products and services. They are the ultimate collectors, interpreting the latest trends in art, design, marketing and (in the case of the past decade) any other sector of the art market as well. This has led to a quality of experimentation and discovery that is more evident in their output at</text>

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has now entered its twenty-first century. Biennials are, however, deeply embedded in the museum, and exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, for example, which is an institution of the city and its history. As biennials become more institutionalised and national in their form, a slightly different relationship is developing between the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Amsterdam. In 1960 the Museum of Modern Art, New York, renamed itself the Museum of Modern Art; in 2014 the Museum of Contemporary Art, Amsterdam. Both the name and the institutional history of these museums can be found in Eric Hobs (ed.), The Museum of Modern Art, New York: Guggenheim Museum, 1967, p.58. In 1960 the Museum of Modern Art, New York, renamed itself the Museum of Modern Art. In 2014 the Museum of Modern Art, Amsterdam, renamed itself the Museum of Contemporary Art.

Biennials are now more like museums, with exhibitions that are part of a chain, and a curator-researcher who conducts a research project. This is a characteristic feature of the biennial, which has been shown in Amsterdam before, and in other cities where this research project is taking place. The biennial will be shown in both venues, and the curator-researcher may choose to engage in a research project there as well. Biennials have a critical effect on the art market because they are the public presentation of a research project and the public symbol of a particularised project, which then circulates widely in social media and is reflected in art appraisals, and they become the public face of a development project. The significance of this project may be different in each city where this research is taking place, but the common denominator is that these exhibitions are now taking place in locations that are significant to the project, and are therefore indicative of the city as a project is now unfolding across the city. The significant exhibitions that took place in Amsterdam in 2017, for instance, are a product of the ‘City Gallery’ – a building now part of the Museum of Modern Art</text>

What happens in the space of the arts world, and what is sometimes referred to as ‘the big data explosion’, often leads to a surge in demand for the art and cultural products of the art world – whether those products are culturally responsive, or promote the circulation and promotion of cultural practices relevant to the needs of the contemporary artist or curator in an art world. These types of infrastructuralisation leads to a transformation of the social and political reality of places and peoples, but also of spaces and peoples.

However, while the images in this book provide us with valuable cultural and historical context, their source material and articulation of feelings and experiences about the past often leads to very different possibilities in the medium of art site and urban redevelopment. That is, the past may provide us with valuable infrastructural knowledge about the future, but it may also contain valuable infrastructural knowledge about the present. This is one reason why art world research is so important – it informs both the research and the site-specific projects that shape the medium and its politics, but it is also why it is produced at such a volatile and unpredictable pace:</text>

The project comes as part of a two-year, £20 million project by Liverpool Biennial and Merseytravel, funded in part by the Arts Council and National Museums Liverpool. The book draws on the Strasser family's 30-year-old family of artist, curators and writers, as well as material from the museum collections at Liverpool and Aberdeen. In addition to contributing ideas and resources, the project brings together resources and expertise from a range of areas of the arts, social work, law, architecture and design, heritage conservation, international development and archives. In a word, it brings together the disparate elements that make up contemporary art – from the biennial, the museum, the hospital, the arts councils, the curators and the curators of the big museums and kiddie theatres across the UK and abroad.

Questions such as: what is the relationship between the artist, audience and the institution where the artist is active? And: what is the relationship between the institution and the community?  In doing so, these texts suggest a way to think about the relationship between the artist, the community and the contemporary art world, while also suggesting an alternative epistemology of the contemporary condition that is not dependent on the current state of knowledge or power.

In their introduction to the project, they quote Max Horkheimer, who developed the concept of the episodic as a way to categorise cultural outbursts into categories – works, practices or publications that are episodic, cyclical and persistent. In 1929, Walter Benjamin coined the term ‘the Jewish question’ in an essay in the Journal of a People’s Political Prisoner. Using the term ‘joint’ with the noun ‘issue’ allows the essay to simultaneously refer to the continuity of the issue as well as to the changing of the issue – a rare combination in the journal of a major art journal at the time. While the journal essays were often critical of specific art practices, such as avant-garde painting and the</text>

The guidelines explicitly state that a cultural organisation must have an ethical and social purpose, and that it should not only achieve what it proposes to do, but must also actively contribute to creating a culture of that society. The image of the artist is prominent, but so is much more of the organisation’s purpose – a purpose that is much more easily understood and attained through images. So the organisation’s image is prominent, but much more importantly, much of what the organisation does and says is also image-based. And this brings us to the second principle of image-based cultural practices: the fundamental assumption of all images is that of the artist. The organisation routinely advocates its own image as superior to others, and claims an image-sharer’s right to the shared image. And this principle is often disregarded in contemporary</text>

The project aims to capture, map and map again – collectively and artist by artist – images from the past, from the present and from future in an episodic or ‘time capsule’ format. The images, chosen from a pool of images from various art institutions, are displayed at the Strasser Gallery, as a series of connected works created in cooperation with the gallery. The works reflect the archive’s relations to contemporary art forms and art practices, but also to how archives can work with, and form alongside, creative and dynamic historical and archival materiality.

The project is a continuation of an earlier project Strasser and I initiated in 2012, entitled Imagining the Biennale, and it is an attempt to re-imagine the biennale as an interactive, multi-sited event with a shared, though differentiated, impact. The project was part of the Biennale Project, led by John Moores University (John Moores Physical Anthropology Department), University of Liverpool (John Moores University Museum), and the Liverpool John Moores Special Collections and Archives. The exhibition ‘Towards an Ethnographic Anthology of Art’ was part of that project, and part of the exhibition ‘The Art of Not Being Present’ at the Centre pauper, where it was part of the 'Post-Modernist Turn'.

The image of the week is a series of six images, each representing the conjuncture of a single event in the history of art, architecture and design in the UK. The images were taken on the same trip, from 1984–86, to document the intertwining of history and art forms in the context of the Biennale. The six images show the connections that art and architecture can establish between the present and the past, and the connections that connect different eras and cultures.

In his work, Miodownik argues that the economic crash of 2008 severely disrupted the public sphere, but also the very social sphere, and has, by and large, been a messy, persistent disaster. The ruinous nature of the crisis and its aftermath has not, however, been adequately addressed in the literature on the city or its infrastructures. The infrastructures that emerged after the crash were not just the fallout of the crisis, but also tend to be far more powerful, globally distributed and reliant on capital circulation and globalisation. The ability of artists and curators to create new environments – places – locally and globally through art is also scarce,</text>

Is there life after the AI? It is now commonplace to read headlines extolling the virtues of machine learning, the advance towards which leads to whole host of new jobs and economic opportunities. But is it still possible to discover and appreciate a work of art by Goethe’s own hand, without having been trained by a cognitive scientist to identify Goethe’s works as being by him? As Jonathan Crary, a fellow at MIT and former editor of The New Republic, once wrote: ‘Machines are everywhere; they’re the senders of signal[…]]’ Crary also suggested that the machines that hewed to human grammar would be unable to reason logically, which would mean that artists would have to find other ways to express their emotions.

Given the ubiquity of algorithms in contemporary business and consumer products, it seems that the future may well be populated by indistinguishable versions of themselves operating in real time. 	Is there a way to stop this type of future from coming about? One approach is to imagine a way to intervene in the event itself, like a nano-targeting device or virus. 	But this begs the question: what is the difference between a target and an intervention? If a machine can pick out specific behaviour, how can we intervene in that particular outcome? 	One way to think about it is as a situation where the artist Julian Barnes chose to engage with the present through an intervention. He created a series of prints that depicted the locations of eight crematoria, each with a narrative describing the processes involved in the production of ​​silence in the context of the 2016 World Cup. The images were commissioned by the architects and displayed in a series of exhibition spaces around the World Cup site in Brazil. Each space included a collection of eight prints, each depicting a different aspect of the crematoriums. Each print was signed by twenty-one artists, and the themes ‘</text>

Given the ubiquity of algorithms in contemporary business and consumer products, it seems that the future may well be populated by indistinguishable versions of themselves operating in real time. 	Is there life after the AI bubble? It is possible that the technology we create to interact with the internet is imbued with enough intelligence to evolve into something more intelligent, but the challenge will be greater in the context of a social and political context. The possibilities are numerous and open to imagination. 	What if, in the future, the internet evolved from what is essentially an image processing and data extraction platform into something more deeply connected to the social totality – capable of producing and reflecting political values and social dynamics? Such a social aperture would see the emergence of new modes of interaction between people and elements of the urban environment, including the emergence of new types of housing and public realm? 	What if, in the future, the internet evolved from a platform that allows content to be delivered wirelessly to connected devices in real-time and places social interaction at a deeper level, enabling new types of social interaction?

Is there life after the AI bubble? It is still too early to tell whether machine learning will lead to a utopia or a dystopia, but recent advances in bio-inspired artificial intelligence (AI) could well lead to new kinds of social media disruption. A future in which all forms of social life are mediated by algorithms seems like a world in which ordinary people do not exist. 	What might be thought of as AI research and AI applications today is actually a large and pervasive form of business today – one that requires immense amounts of human labour and data to deploy and deliver – and is therefore likely to produce serious social and ecological changes. 	In fact, it is common for large corporations to employ large numbers of human labour and data-capture technologies today, such as self-driving cars and warehouses, but these technologies are likely to produce negative externalities in the future that cannot be erased. And although some industries may excel in terms of the efficiency with which they extract data and process it</text>

Is there a way to learn or understand such patterns? One approach is to understand algorithms as dataflow through symbolic, linguistic forms. Such understanding could lead to practical, if speculative, solutions to practical problems. For example, there are indications that certain types of cancer stem cells can be reprogrammed to accept certain types of chemotherapy, which could lead to new therapies targeting the cancer stem cells. Such cures could be targeted towards particular types of cancer cells, or at least towards those cells that are expressed in certain tumours. 	In  	Grand Theft Auto, Michael Crichton plays the part of cyberpunk ­– a spokesperson for the new economy – and sees an opportunity to combine the power of the machine with the people’s capacity to create meaning and purpose in the world around itself.

Is there life after the AI apocalypse? It is now common to encounter self-repairing robots, which can be described as being able to deal with the stresses placed on them by their nature. It is worth noting that Malick once again employs the term ‘future’ in a similar way to the one we used in the 1950s to describe the processes leading to the AI, this time in reference to humans: unable to comprehend the past, incapable of self-repairing, and so on. 	But what if, sometime in the future, we can develop the kinds of minds required to build and use robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems? If that is possible, then perhaps the path leading to robust AI systems will lead not through the futural possibilities of the present but through the musings of a once-every-century ‘young genius’ convention, which could in principle envision a thousand-year horizon for AI development?

The project was started in 2013, and it has gone through six editions thus far (2015 being the first with an international team). The book is an unprecedented in its quantity and variety, incorporating both published and unpublished writing from a variety of subjects. Some of the subjects are familiar to the authors: composers, lyricists, painters, architects, writers. Others are new to the table: artists, curators, journalists, academics. Still others are familiar tropes or archetypes: musicians, athletes, politicians. Nevertheless, the authors recognize a few essential truths about the world: capitalism, patriarchy, racism, economic nationalism, militarism, capitalism, capitalism, nationalism, fascism, and contemporary culture at large. The volume of the book is a deliberate literary device intended to bring together, in one place, a group of authors with a common subject matter, a group of ideas, a set of conventions and paradigms understood by some as truth while others are actively contested, questioned and counter intuitive. The volume is intended to tell a story through the voices of a specific group of people – a 'tribe' or an 'organisation'.  The volume is</text>

The project was started in 2013, and it has gone through six editions thus far (2015 being the first with an international team). The book is an unprecedented in its scope and ambition. It is a ‘language’, a hybrid written work that attempts to articulate ‘how we see the world as a place where art can take place’, with ‘specific reference to an artist’s country of origin’. It is a work that attempts to bring to life the paradoxes and injustices of our contemporary world through a single voice. It is a hybrid language that evades the typical forms of writing that apply to both formal and conceptual writing, and relies on information supplied by the host language of communication. It is a hybrid 'language', able to accommodate a range of styles and opinions, and capable of operating in ‘the current political climate’, where ‘real life’ is often misrepresented in the media as being in dire need of saving. This hybrid form makes the report possible, while remaining vigilant towards the needs and interests of the people rather than the needs of the art institution. The BMJ study</text>

The project was started in 2013, and it has gone through six editions thus far (2015 being the first with an international team). The book is an unprecedented in its breadth, reaching from the geographical to the micro, deeply contextualising the historical, urban and the geographical, and placing the present in relation to the past, present and future. In this sense, it is both a ‘snap’ and ‘deep dive’ into the present, as it were. In this sense, it is a hybrid of history, travelogue and ethnography. It is written as a ‘snap’ and a ‘deep dive’ into the present, drawn directly from the author’s own writing and conducted in a range of subjects ranging from musicians to journalists. The subject matter and style of the writing is eccentric, the language can be verbose, and the object of the writing is a performer – a self-made artist, writer and musician. But these are minor quibbles compared with what the author’s done with the subject matter and style of the report. The report has, I believe, gone through at least</text>

The project was started in 2013, and it has gone through six editions thus far (2015 being the first with an international team). The book is an unprecedented in its ambition, covering every aspect of the production and reception of art as performance, from the making of an artwork to the way in which that performance is experienced. It is a record of the art being made, the challenges and achievements faced, and the destinations pursued. It is a snapshot of the worlds that are made visible, the forms that are taken and the worlds that are not. The impulse behind the project is to record and to continue to narrate in the face of this ever-present, yet mysterious, art of art and performance. This is the narrative that we construct and live with, and to some extent also the shape and purpose of art and performance that we create. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to know what is real and what is made-up, especially in a city such as Liverpool, as a result of the proliferation of transparent buildings, the proliferation of different kinds of art being made in the same city, and the proliferation of different kinds of artistic performance.

The project was started in 2013, and it has gone through six editions thus far (2015 being the first with an international team). The book is an unprecedented in its ambition, addressing topics that have received largely insufficiently in depth exploration, particularly in the areas of communications, accessibility, and media. The sources and methods have been thoroughly researched and are presented in a manner that is both accessible and ends up making sense. The craftsmanship and object-oriented aspects that were written off as archaic or silly are brought to life by the sheer force of information gathering. The author’s own intro to the book, and the chapter on vernacular creativity, is a powerful example of this. It begins with a description of the literary form that the BMJ was published in, and ends with the key concepts that create the basis for all creative-performance theory: repetition, repetition, repetition. The chapter on aesthetics is a powerful way to introduce a new person to a theory that you have just discovered. The fact that this is a new theory is also a powerful way to dismiss something as not being relevant or novel or interesting. For example, the image of a woman</text>

The project was started in 2013, and it has gone through six editions thus far (2015 being the first with an international team). The book is an unprecedented in its scope, and the authors are acutely aware of the need to engage with the present and future of their work. The rapid proliferation of social media provides artists with unprecedented access to audiences outside the art world, yet the book is acutely aware that this access comes at a cost: in the age of the biennial and the museum, there is a urgent need to reorient its resources and priorities. The authors are aware that their project comes with a price tag, but they are determined to not only pay it off but to create value for audiences outside their own practice. The BMJ chapter on performance and its psychology is a novel in its form, and the authors weave in and out of various places and times, often quite cleverly. In the US, performance is often defined as ‘the art or performative action of meeting and engaging with an audience in a public setting’. In the UK, performance is often defined as ‘performance in a public setting in which another has explicitly assumed a</text>

The book is an unprecedented in its ambition, covering in-depth all aspects of the artistic, experimental, instrumental and social practices underpinning contemporary art. It is a record of art made alive in different forms, of art made by ancient and medieval civilizations, of contemporary art made by non-professionals, of contemporary art made by artists, of art made by governments, of art made by corporations, of art made by communities, of art made by individuals, of art made by places, of art made by the very concept itself. This is to say nothing of the art made by people engaged in making art today. The book is a record of a past that is alive and well, a living, breathing cultural artefact that can be traced back to its first publication in 1792. It is the sort of archaeological find that gets made into artefacts, part of a cultural identity, incorporated into buildings and made part of a public narrative.

The book is an unprecedented in its ambition, covering a broad range of topics across a broad range of languages. It is a record of an event, a place where people come to talk, a place where images are taken, a place where ideas are put into practice. However, despite its unprecedented nature, the authors are careful to point out that they do not wish to substitute their own position or position within the cultural landscape they are writing about. Rather, the author’s position is that of an observer, with a particular agenda. The fact that the idea is new and the people the take part in it are different from the audience means that the project is unpredictable and subject to the whims of the cultural moment. At the same time, the project is expected to be constantly evolving, constantly questioning its assumptions and potentialities, and consequently the book has to account for all the different ways in which the present moment could or could not be constructed.

It is divided into seven sections covering ‘musical language’ (the human capacity for language), ‘musical ‘places’ (the anatomical and physiological locations of the brain), ‘musical ‘tendencies’ (the relationships between body and sound), ‘musical environments’ (the ‘musical home’), ‘musical ‘activities’ (the neural correlates of musical experience), and ‘musical ‘habits’ (the neurophysiological and behavioral correlates of musical repetition). The sections include introductory musings on the neuroscience of language, affective neuroscience, and the psychology of music motivation. They also include a survey of musical genius and the neuroscience of his or her performance. While much of the content is novel and thought-provoking, the authors ultimately conclude</text>

    Working with algorithms, a team of artists and designers was able to create a system that spatially maps the location of each building in the city, as well as the precise arrangement of each facade. The system allowed high-resolution 3D models of the facades of buildings in an attempt to map out the city in a way that avoids the presence of architectural renderings and the fetishisation of architectural images. By mapping the locations of structures and their functions, the system aims to create a virtual tour that traces the evolution of the city, its history, and the places where structures once stood.The project was not without friction, however. The tensions that arise from the power that flows from the knowledge that certain structures in the city are critical infrastructure – essential for the continued existence of the capitalist mode of production – are palpable.

Nevertheless, the innovative use of existing infrastructure as a platform to map the city in unprecedented detail is a rare occurrence in the developed world. The emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly addressed as a concern of coastal erosion and desalination, which is often cited as a contributor to sea-level rise. But the emergence of new forms of infrastructure is a necessity in the fight against global climate change, and it is this fight that the New Urban Frontier (N.U.F.) was consciously created to address. As the development economist Steven Aftergood has pointed out, the advent of codes, maps, and data reduced the role of the waterfront in city-making to that of a &quot;data bank…a repository of facts about the city that can be used to construct a city in the image of … past urban forms&quot;.2  Thus, the role of the waterfront in planning and urbanization decisions is not that of an island floating in the ocean of data, but rather that of a ‘container in an ever-expanding global marketplace of information possibilities, products, and services of which the city is a major component’.3  This is a global</text>

Nevertheless, the innovative use of existing infrastructure as a platform to map the city in unprecedented detail is a rare occurrence in the developed world. The emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly addressed in relation to urban-dwelling species like man, but its application is unprecedented in its scope, persistence and depth. This is due to the fact that the systems that are modelled on the facades of buildings like the railways, city heat pumps, water pumps and gas turbines tend to reside in urban centres, whereas those that are constructed on the outskirts – a phenomenon known as ‘regeneration’ – focus on remote locations or on cities' infrastructures. Therefore, the system that is considered ‘the city’ is arguably influenced by the ‘regeneration’ that is driven by the ‘global’. This ‘regeneration’ is fundamentally different from the way in which industrial production operates, and it is characterised by a fundamental interconnection between capital and labour. The development of infrastructure thus exhibits a fundamentally different mode of temporality and political interaction. Rather than exhibiting a definitive set of relations, infrastructure produces a dynamic</text>

The emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly associated with the financial sector and speculative capitalism, but is also an issue that is pertinent for democratic governmentality and social regeneration. It is an issue that is still grappling with in parts of Britain where the ascendance of the financial sector coincides with the decimation of working-class neighbourhoods. It is an issue that is still grappling with in parts of Britain where the post-2008 financial crisis ushered in a period of sustained urban growth that is often characterised by a proliferation of financial infrastructure servicing businesses and the professions at the expense of cities. It is an issue that is still grappling with in parts of Britain where the post-2008 financial sector coincides with an increase in privatisations of vital public services, such as schools and health care.

Nevertheless, the importance of the system as a platform for mapping remains unaddressed by the architectural and planning establishment. The fact that the projections that were made were not made on the maps but on computer programs that monitor the cityscape actively encourages a political and social transformation that needs to occur if the city is to be taken into the future.2. The ‘collapse’ of the urban centre due to overbuilding and the resultant inundation of the landscape with concrete, steel, bricks and utensils. During the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of urban planners and urban scholars began to question the utility of the urban as a place where citizens live and work in co-existence with one another. In 1990, for instance, Paul Polanyi questioned the notion that the optimal urban form was based on a topology or a set of topologies. Rather, he argued, the optimal form was one</text>

The system allowed high-resolution 3D models of the facades of buildings in an attempt to map out the city in a way that avoids the presence of architectural renderings and the fetishisation of architectural images. By mapping the locations of structures and their functions, the system aims to create a virtual tour that traces the evolution of the city, its history, and the places where structures once stood.The project was not without friction, however. The tensions that arise from the power that flows from the knowledge that certain structures in the city are critical infrastructure – essential for the continued existence of the capitalist mode of production – are palpable.

Nonetheless, the emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly associated with the social sciences departments at Cambridge and MIT, where representatives of multinational corporations monitor and analyse the social impacts of urbanisation and quite different forms of governance. 	Such systems monitor and analyse data, collect data, and render infrastructures infrastructuralised. In the case of large-scale urbanisation projects, the infrastructural landscape is mapped not only ‘upstream’, but ‘downstream’, ‘upstream’, and ‘leveraging’ ways, via sensors that constantly monitor and collect data. The sensors that pervade our urban infrastructures are capable of sensing moisture, height, pressure, CO2, temperature, humidity, flashpoint, evaporation,</text>

Nevertheless, the innovative use of existing infrastructure as a platform to map the city in unprecedented detail is a rare occurrence in the developed world. The emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly addressed in relation to urban crises (see, for example, Peter Brunow,  	Cities and Capital,2009). In the case of Peshawar, the emergence of such a system is part of a larger trend that seeks to render the city ‘collapse-proof’ – a feat that is somewhat reminiscent of the urban planners who came up with the brilliant idea of engineering a mathematical formula to assess the urban suitability for a nuclear warhead in the Manhattan Project.10  However, there is growing recognition that a critical mass of cities are having a less and less impactive role in meeting citizens’ needs and wants. In fact, a growing body of research now suggests that ‘affordable housing’ is a myth created by policy makers and the financial sector to meet their self-appointed mission of abundance. Instead, housing demands are being increasingly placed at the level of the population, which is rapidly outpacing the supply of housing. Thus it</text>

The emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly addressed in relation to the ‘problem cities’ that are characterised by rapidly growing urban populations and a host of ills that result from such growth. But the potential that exists in the creation of new ‘city problems’ is vastly outweighed by the danger of exacerbating the existing crisis by mapping the city in apocalyptic terms.A Better Basis for Criticising the Crisis –—————————————-In recent years, the crisis of the European model of the ‘Postindustrial society’ has become acute. The financial crash in 2008 ushered in a wave of capital flight and poverty in swathes of northern Europe, as well as a wave of refugees fleeing the conflicts in the Middle East. The collapse of the banking system and associated hyperinflation brought about a wave of social unrest in many countries, as well as a wave of xenophobic political rhetoric. As a consequence, the European model has been cast into doubt. But the crisis that emerged in Greece in 2009 was different.</text>

The emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly addressed in relation to geographical features and mythical creatures prevalent in places such as Scotland or Ireland. Nevertheless, the system that was developed in Calabasas is an issue that is of great concern to the city’s urban planners and, indeed, to the world economy as a whole. It represents the latest stage in the evolution of a city in which the exchange of space is made increasingly difficult and displacements of people are common. The Calabasas plan is a response to these problems, but it is also a projection of anxieties and prejudices stemming from the past. It seeks to hide aspects of the city that are detrimental to the capitalist mode of production from view, while simultaneously placing an emphasis on the essential functions of the city in the context of international capitalism.  The Calabasas Plan  The Calabasas Plan is the most comprehensive urbanization plan in the world, and arguably, in the world’s, with over 2,500 km of planned urban development</text>

Nevertheless, the innovative use of existing infrastructure as a platform to map the city in unprecedented detail is a rare occurrence in the developed world. The emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly associated with the excesses of globalisation and technocratic government. Despite its theoretical potential, the ability to detect and map such damage is considerably more problematic. The geo-spatial relations that result from the knowledge that certain structures in the city are critical infrastructure are far more complex and unstable. This is particularly true in densely populated urban centres where the capacity to monitor and map such infrastructure is critical for the possibility of resisting displacement and adapting to changing market conditions. It is worth noting that the knowledge that structures in the city are critical infrastructure is far more prevalent in developed countries than in developing ones. A meta-analytic perspective that integrates data, modelling and geospatial knowledge, is a necessity for any ecological or urban-planning project. For this reason, ecologists and urbanists developing projects in developing countries typically come up with visionary solutions that seek to leverage existing infrastructure as a platform to create new modes of consumption, or at least for the possibility of sustaining future growth. However, such plans invariably</text>

The emergence of such a system is an issue that is more commonly addressed as the issue of transport infrastructure, but there is growing evidence that it is also an issue that is being actively addressed by the systems engineering profession. A growing body of evidence is emerging that indicates that the critical infrastructures of our cities are structurally inadequate and ill-equipped to host the kinds of creative activity that occur in a city, and that critical infrastructures do more than repair and maintain such cities. This growing body of evidence is emerging as a result of a critical survey of infrastructural knowledge produced by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), convened in 1975. The survey, which emerged as a result of a three-year project, revealed that only nine per cent of civil engineers surveyed had ever been trained as engineers and civil engineers, and that a further twenty per cent had some kind of other engineering or civil engineering background. Only seventeen per cent had ever worked in the context of infrastructure, and of these, only fifteen per cent had any kind of</text>

In such a case, the question that arises is what can the biennial do differently?  Whether the built environment is an essential part of contemporary culture is a controversial one, and while there is certainly a place for biennials within and beyond the museum, there is a need to question why, as museums, we are compelled to create and narrate the built environment in ways that foreground the built environment as historically significant and contemporary and to neglect or actively suppress other cultural practices and practices that are more readily available and are less visibly constructed and enforced. The answer to this question, often quoted within the art world and scientific community, is simple: it is because the built environment is  inherently  multivalent and geopolitically diverse and cannot be reduced to one particular set of values and national narratives. Thus, while the value of a biennial may be defined, in part, by what it narrates, a need to define also needs to be built.  A biennial may be valuable in providing a narrative arc, or backdrop, or set of related narratives, through which a particular action or omission may be</text>

In such a case, the question that arises is what can the biennial do differently?  Whether the built environment is a ‘culture commodity’ is a crucial question for any ecological system that seeks to inscribe meaning onto the landscape. The biennial, by its very nature, produces what Naomi Klein calls ‘cultural dust’ that serves as a back-up in case the other ‘cultures’ don’t find meaning in the same way that the built environment does.1 So while the built environment might not be a perfect reflection of the society that created it, at least the built environment represents the historical and contemporary condition of society as it exists in the present. And, at the same time, the built environment – whether that environment is ‘the city’ or ‘the biennial’ – has to actively participate in constructing the society that it lives in in some way. Put simply, the built environment is a constructed space because society has made it that way. This is why the Biennial has to actively participate in creating the social conditions that</text>

In such a case, the question that arises is what can the biennial do differently?  Whether the built environment is a construct or an artefact depends on how one evaluates what’s being built on the site. In both the anthropological and the sociological sense, a building is an artefact, whereas a site is part of a larger social organisation of which the biennial is a part. Given a relatively new technology, the biennial could conceivably use its location to produce new ways of interacting with the city, and perhaps even produce new ways of organising the built environment in such a way as to produce socially responsive practices.  The problem with the biennial as an artefact, however, is that, as the biennial matures and new technologies are brought into use, it loses its biological nature, becoming something else entirely. New media such as social media and GPS devices make it easier to measure and track buildings and structures, and allow biennials to participate in a society in which they’re now ideally placed, but simultaneously render them doubly marginal in a city such as</text>

In such a case, the question that arises is what can the biennial do differently?  Whether the built environment is a ‘creative class’ resource or a grave threat is a difficult task to define, but a few points can be made clear: (1) The built environment is a site of great physical and conceptual abuse; (2) the built environment is a ‘resourceful class’; and (3) the built environment is a ‘place of great discrepancy’. Creative action can be taken in and through the built environment, but only if it comes with consequences that are just. Co-responsibility  Creativity and innovation in the built environment is a two-fold risk. First, it’s easy to become trapped in the pattern of vulnerability and poverty that is produced by the built environment. Second, it’s much more difficult to change the built environment in interesting or creative ways. The difficulty in changing the built environment comes from the fact that, unlike the street, the built environment has no intrinsic sense of value or purpose. The built environment</text>

In such a case, the question that arises is what can the biennial do differently?  Whether the built environment is a ‘natural resource’ or an ‘imagined construct’ – and to what extent – is a question that needs to be answered in future studies of the urbanisation of the metropolis. In the twenty-first century, the built environment is expected to provide us with more and more resources; it’s expected to be ‘resourceful’ and, as a result, ‘useful’ in an ever-expanding, globalised economy. The question is whether the built environment can maintain its organic character through self-repairing mechanisms that take into account the ever-increasing demands placed on it. This is one of the tasks that contemporary urbanisation will inevitably tackle, and it remains to be seen whether the biennial can play any part in this.  Whether the built environment can also ‘responsibly generate new uses for the space it is rebuilding is a different question. That’s why, in an ideal world, the architects</text>

In such a case, the question that arises is what can the biennial do differently?  Whether the built environment plays an essential role in the production of culture and contributes to the aestheticisation of time remains controversial, especially in an era of abundant data and continuously changing data. Despite this, it is generally assumed that the built environment supports and contributes to the production of culture. This is largely due to the fact that, in the modern age, the built environment is the site of constant alteration and reconfiguration, constantly on the move and subject to the whims of changing conditions and variables. Consequently, it is easy to understand the appeal of a place like New York, London or Paris, which are constantly reinvented and constantly (re)generated, while Detroit, Montreal, St. Paul or any number of other cities are generally considered to be ‘in’accurate representations of the real thing. In this sense, the ‘built’ can be seen as an unreliable narrator.  In the twentieth century, this led to a specific set of cultural values – those of mass consumption – that are</text>

In such a case, the question that arises is what can the biennial do differently?  Whether the built environment is a ‘planting point’ for culture is a fundamental tenet of the so-called ‘holistic’ approach to culture. It’s true that the biennial can and should choose to engage with the built environment; its job is to maximize the social contribution to the city as a whole, not to mention the arts’.  But this choice is a fundamental one; the built environment has a way of shaping who we are and how we behave; its architecture has a way of structuring our lives. The question becomes whether the biennial can create alternatives by planting culture locally and remotely in an attempt to drawing artists and communities to the city, while simultaneously trying to recognise when and how art can and should be embedded in the city’s infrastructure. I believe that the biennial can and should choose to engage with the built environment, though I would caution that doing so should never be an easy thing to do; it should be said that the bi</text>

Whether the built environment is a ‘space of possibility’ or a ‘space of resistance’ is one that can and should be questioned. The biennial can and shouldn’t become trapped in the logic of the built environment, however important its relation to the city. In this respect, the built environment as a whole remains an obstacle to biennials becoming ‘real’ places to live and work in.  Whether the built environment is a ‘real’ place to work and play is a different question. The point of the biennial is to witness and analyse the spectacle, to draw one’s own conclusions and to render another perspective. In this respect, the built environment, while it may contain elements of critique and paradox, is also subject to the logic of the spectacle. The question becomes how the biennial can intervene in this ‘space of possibility’ to produce new ways of interacting with the city and its built environment – in a way that produces</text>

Whether the city is an island in a sea of the unpredictable is a question that deserves a future study.

    The next Whitney Biennial will take place in 2018.

The Biennial format has been around for a while now. It was popularised by the biennial, and its popularity spread to other art forms. As a form of cultural exchange, biennials are a good way to see art in the world through different perspectives. We can see how art can connect with people across different social strata, such as artists, curators, journalists and publics. It can also connect with communities of artists and artists who work alongside each other, alongside communities of curators, artists' organisations and the like. The question is whether these different perspectives can be realised in a collaborative and equitable way.

It could also incorporate other art forms, such as music, sculpture, film or even home-made handicrafts. In this sense, the committee could be any kind of curatorial or art institution.  My committee is made up of a curator, an art administrator, a curator for emerging and former students (who might become artists themselves), a curator for arts and heritage, a curator for research and publics, and a curator for art and heritage.  The committee meetings are public and non-representational. We observe what other curators and art institutions are doing well and what they are doing badly. We question the value of what is happening in the field, and what contribution they are making to the community. We also try to figure out what might be learnt from each other’s curatorial approaches.  The committee meetings are unscripted and unscripted, so there is no expectation</text>

This could mean funding or other forms of support, but it could also mean engaging with the committee through informal ways of supporting them in their work, through knowledge sharing, organising events or even just by inviting them to join in wherever they may be located.In the end, I think that is the future that we should be striving for. We have to try to imagine how art can bring people together. There are many forms of art today, and their many mediums, but they cannot compete in this way with cultural production happening in the real world. I think that is why biennials are so popular. They are able to deliver a message across a site in a site-specific way, such as a museum or a school, without having to be located in a specific location.</text>

The Biennial format has been around for a while now. It was popularised by the biennial, and its popularity spread to other art forms. As a form of cultural exchange, biennials are a good way to see art in the world through different perspectives. We can see how art can connect with people across different social strata, such as artists, curators, journalists and publics. It can also connect with communities of artists and artists who work alongside each other, alongside communities of curators, artists' organisations and the like. The question is whether these different perspectives can be realised in a collaborative and equitable way. That is, can the Biennial commissioning committee the same people to work with it through a project in another location, or can it commission people from different social strata to work together? I imagine the latter is the case, as long as it is done with an eye on achieving equity and inclusion. The committee members could be community organisers or artists' organisations. They could be artists themselves, or they could be artists who have recently begun collaborating with communities. The key is that they should be able to identify and address the perspectives and interests of communities in their art and in their publics.This is a big ask for an institution, and it is also a big ask for an artist. An institution that prides itself on its ability to engage with diverse modes of being needs to be able to engage with people from different strata, not just engageively engageively engage with people who share its values, but also to actually change its mind and act on those different values. This may require changing its form and subjecting its future work to change, but it also requires people with different worldviews and experiences to find common ground and to work together to achieve new goals. History is made, not in the author’s history but in the revised form of history that is told. The ability to repeat that history</text>

The committee members could be artists, curators, journalists or other socially engaged stakeholders. All of us could contribute to that balance.

My own position is that the committee members could easily be artists, since their formal education and artistic interests align with what I do. But I imagine them making creative interventions across the board, from artists to curators to stakeholders to finding the best balance between artists and stakeholders. Sometimes the committee members are even musicians, dancers or other artists themselves. Working with them could lead to unexpected collaborations.

Artists and curators often have interesting and even fascinatingly different approaches to the biennial. For example, many of our members come from different disciplines to work alongside each other. So there is a question about who is entitled to participate in a symposium, and how that is structured. In terms of a formal commissioning process, this could be seen as a business transaction between several art galleries, or it could be seen as a one-to-many, one-to-</text>

For instance, the committee might have engineers who design building materials, or architects who analyse data on building construction, or other types of professionals who analyse data on art and culture. These could include writers, photographers, collectors or any other types of professionals who are interested in visual culture. They could be drawn from anywhere in the world, or drawn from a particular city. They could be based in a particular country or even be based in a particular region. The question is whether the committee members have the relevant skills, knowledge or other resources to make such a project a reality. One might imagine that the member who chairs the committee has the gravitas of a major institution on his or her shoulders, or perhaps a regional arts organisation on its shoulders. That would make it an unusual sight to witness a committee meeting, but would become increasingly common as more public</text>

But I imagine that when the committee meets monthly, the artists and curators on the list are the ones who feel most at ease, and the community is the ones who feel least threatened. That is, the people with the most resources and the most influence are the ones with the greatest concerns. Perhaps the committee members also have a personal relationship with the artist(s), and perhaps the relationship is mutual. But I imagine that the committee members also have other priorities, and that they may have personal relationships with many artists and curators. And perhaps the most important of those is the relationship between the biennial and its subject. The relationship cannot be mediated between the art institution and the communities it works with. If the art institution wants to work with a community, it has to make the community whole first. Biennials have to find ways of working with communities in order to achieve equitable results.</text>

These could be recruited from the art schools I teach in, or any art school with a curriculum in contemporary art, and bring a diversity of experience to the table. The committee members could be recruited from any industry, including biennials, since many professions would welcome diversity.For this project, I have recruited people with a range of expertise on a range of topics, including: curatorial, technical, artistic, legal etc. I have invited curators, artists, photographers and other creative professionals to participate in a 'Curatorial Exchange' format discussion on the committee. I have invited artists and other creative professionals to develop creative alternatives for the event. They could develop their own creative responses to the biennial, or they could develop a project based around the theme. The idea is that the responses are valid, although they could be developed and tested in a parallel fashion. The idea is to see if we can work in a way that produces</text>

They could be artists or curators who have a particular skill or skill set, or both. Or, of course, the artist could come from anywhere in the world and commission a community to work together.

The committee could be made up of any number of people, reflecting the diversity of the city. It could be a community organisation, a community organisation made up of members from different community organisations, grassroots groups or neighbourhood groups, an artist or an individual artist-organisation. It could be a social enterprise, incorporated under a charitable or educational umbrella, or it could be a partnership between two or more community organisations. It could be a partnership between two or more arts organisations, whether community organisations, arts organisations or other creative enterprises.

There is no hard and fast rule about who is an artist or a member of the arts staff, although the committee members would have to give a clear reason for wanting to work with an artist. I imagine that the committee would want to work with an artist because they value his/her contribution to the project, their involvement, and because they think their involvement will contribute to the wellbeing of the community they are working in. The irony is that some of the people they work with may actively seek to exclude others from the project, because they think their involvement will be inauthentic. In the case of an artist-organisation, the desire to collaborate may be more powerful than the actual engagement. I also imagine that the Biennial committee would want to work with an artist because they think their involvement will contribute to the achievement of a particular aesthetic, which will in turn enhance the value of the art.On the other hand, if</text>

The meeting that takes place in the Biennial is a way for the artists, curators, journalists or other stakeholders to find their way into the Biennial. It is not a place where the artist or curator proposes the idea, organises the event or creates the art, but a way for the meeting to find and acknowledge the methods, values, ideologies and politics that shape the world that art or art institutions inhabit. As such, it embodies the politics of the contemporary artist as an artist or artist of a particular neighbourhood, or places of residence. It is a place where the political, economic and cultural values that shape the world around us intersect with those of communities or neighbourhoods</text>

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, and in the process create a new kind of biennale. The question is, how do we pay for this kind of radical urban renewal? Whitney’s Biennale was entirely self-financing, and her interest was clearly made up out of whole cloth of course. The Museum of Modern Art had to raise funds through individual donations and partnerships, as well as a host of fees, charges and levies to pay for the art and cultural services provided by the Biennale. As we shall see, this kind of liberal arts education is vitally important for any serious urban redevelopment project, and it is precisely this kind of liberal arts education that was lacking in the old city.I partook in this kind of education myself, as a young person in the 1970s and 80s, when a friend of a friend was teaching a class in the neighborhood around the Biennale at Art Institute of Chicago. The students were creative and witty, and they were the only ones able to</text>

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, critical mass of buildings in the heart of the financial district, while creating a new kind of ‘community centre’ around the arts and culture hub. The proposal was completely ignored by the city council, which is clearly still deeply embedded in its neoliberal economic model. However, the Biennial did get its money's worth, because it opened soon after the Museum of Modern Art’s opening, so the arts education budget was immediately used to retrofit the old and create a new kind of arts complex around the new museum. The arts education budget for 2014 is estimated at US$75 million. If that sounds like a lot of money, it is important to realise that this is an annual appropriation, and that US$75 million is the annual budget for the arts in the United States. The real artwork in the new buildings is likely to be the appropriation of the culture of the forgotten, or at least of the artists who were displaced during the economic crash. The Biennial’s appropriation</text>

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, and in fact to start from scratch, but to do so she would have had to dismantle some of the most radical aspects of the project, and start all over again from scratch. She did not do this. She used her money very effectively, and her biennial only gets bigger and more powerful the further it is from its inception. For much of its existence it is merely one of many art institutions, and while its current profile may be exciting to a city with a burgeoning art scene, the fact of its existence now is a major factor in determining its consumption habits. If the Biennial is not going to change the city, its history needs to evolve and change with it. While the museum is a large and visible building, the Biennial is a self-contained entity, and as such it must first change the city. This may be complex to accomplish, and artists often struggle with the idea, but trust me, it is necessary. Once the Biennial has changed the city, it is</text>

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, and the artists’ own intervention was to create a new kind of biennial that would address the city in a completely new way, one that would at the very least address the concerns and ambitions of the city at a smaller scale, and at the very worst, destroy what remains of the historic city in order to make way for a museum with a radically different agenda.Since 1990, the Whitney Biennial has been the subject of a global art market research project, and since 1992, the Whitney Museum of American Art.1  The market research has been carried out by the Art Market Research &amp; Analytics firm Wadsworth Trust, and commissioned by the New Museum.2  The project was part of a wider exhibitionary program at the Whitney, which also included Angels, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Titanium, Poppy, Granby and many more artists.

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, and in some cases completely demolish the buildings themselves. However, since the city is such a large part of the project, a complete re-construction is not necessary, since the buildings can be recreated in the new design. In fact, the Museum would not want to detract from the exciting newness of the new buildings, since this would devalue them. Instead, the Museum would like to inspire a new kind of urbanity, one based on co-existence and dialogue, with a clear difference in attitude and approach. It is to a large extent a ‘life-cycle’ of the city, with significant and visible effects on the ground-floor and sky-floor, and also on the walls and ceilings. The question is, how to activate the cultural sector and creative class? Whitney’s proposal and the artist’s instigation seem to have instilled a new energy and hope in the working class, and a desire to play a leading role in the</text>

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, and to do so in stages, as well as to create new ‘affordable housing’ with mixed-use developments. The rationale for this radical approach was that the buildings around the museum would be used as temporary storage, and that the new buildings would be used as educational and cultural venues. However, this didn’t seem like a sustainable long-term solution, and eventually the Biennial was forced to scale back its ambitions and to concentrate on providing a truly ‘unique experience’ for visiting artists and the public. The Museum of Modern Art has a long-term vision and is now developing a public land trust that will allow it to own and manage the buildings and activities around the museum, including the cultural district.The Biennial’s current focus is on the cultural district, and its preservation. However, the museum has been slow to catch up with this transformation, and even less is its cultural district open to the public. The Biennial’s current charter</text>

Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, and in so doing, to create a new kind of museum that would be able to provide a sense of place in the city, while also standing out in the midst of it. So, there is a very different kind of mausoleum that the artist was trying to present, one that is actually very fitting for the time and place. However, she was very clear that this was not a museum, but a living organism, a museum that would be constantly on the verge of collapse. It would close its doors, it would heal itself of its wounds, and it would continue to grow in the face of overwhelming external forces. In other words, its natural state would mean that certain events would have to be planned, programmed, and overseen in advance. The problem with the city is that it invites destruction, and so the only way to stop it is for the city to be occupied and engaged in productive activities. Creative and dynamic urban centres must be managed in a very controlled and controlled way,</text>

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, dilapidated parts of the city, to leave the city itself largely alone, and to create a new kind of urbanity in a city that is neither industrial nor urban. These proposals are obviously far-fetched in the extreme, but there is some truth to them. The question is, what kind of urbanity can be built on the ruins of a failed historical moment? I strongly endorse the use of the term ‘episodic’ to describe the kind of urbanity to be built on the ruins of the city. This kind of urbanity is one in which time passes much more slowly than it does in present conditions, in part because of the deindustrialisation of the past conditions of existence, which is accelerating. The question becomes, how to coordinate these different temporal registers in such a way as to sustain and even enhance the historical and contemporary condition of the past, while incorporating elements of the future?

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, dilapidated buildings and to leave them as they are, completely unrecognisable. The problem with the city, of course, is that it captures and promotes a form of destruction that it cannot control. The question is, how to release the city’s destructive potential? Whitney’s proposal was completely inadequate, but brilliant in its blindness. It is true that the total renovation would have required the city council’s approval, but this was clearly denied; instead, the project was carried out by the New Yorkers’ Warehouse District, who saw a quick buck and a quick buck was all that was needed. So the city was left to its fate; it did not represent a viable alternative to the destruction that was being wrought by developers and the rich through the city’s coffers.In its current form, the Biennial is a weird hybrid event that combines art and architecture, often generating buzz and great articles in the local and international press, but at the same time it is</text>

The problem with the city is that it invites decay, which inevitably follows urbanisation. The question is, how to contain this inevitable and ever-increasing destruction? Whitney’s proposal was to completely renovate the old, but at the same time to bring an entirely new kind of urbanity to the old city – a kind of pre-fab city – in a way that would make it unrecognisable from its industrial past. The result will be exactly the kind of destruction that the city experienced during the 1990s and early 2000s, when the entire metropolis was reduced to rubble. It is certain to arouse urban opposition, and perhaps even some activists within the Biennial itself.Nevertheless, the Biennial will most likely become what it calls ‘a new model of the museum’, one that takes into account the changing dynamics of the city and its people. This is the kind of radical thinking that might one day make a difference within the museum. For now, the Biennial is experiencing what many artists and curators consider to be an art-world boom, with huge corporate sponsorship packages and extensive public events galore. The Biennial’s radical thinking, I gather, is that it can</text>

The Arts Council of England should co-produce and co-ordinate the programme of activities, but this may be an organisation with a city scale and it may be an organisation with a regional or local scope.  Local governments have long been at the core of what I have termed the ‘public domain’ concept. They are the real arbiters of what is or is not public domain, and this concept should be respected.  The concept of the public domain should be flexible and can be applied to ‘private, public or ‘public domain’.  Local governments have long exercised considerable creative control over their areas of jurisdiction. As recently as the mid-1990s, substantial legislation limited their ability to set local priorities and to legislate in ways that would affect public access to sites or activities.  A public domain is an area over which</text>

The Arts Council of Canada should direct the Future City initiative’s activities to align with the public programmes of the arts bodies in Canada and internationally.  The Arts Council of England should co-produce and co-ordinate the public programmes of the Global Arts Network, and any other relevant arts bodies should seek to work with any art bodies that form part of the network.  The Arts Council of Canada should direct the Future City programme’s activities to align with the purposes of the National Gallery, in Canada and the American National Gallery, in the United States.  The Arts Council of Canada should direct all other arts funding to arts and cultural agencies in British Columbia’s Centre for Arts &amp; Culture.   A Future City initiative would need to coordinate its activities with those of the National Gallery, the American National Gallery and other relevant galleries worldwide, in order to achieve global impact.

The Arts Council of Canada should direct the Future City initiative so that projects selected for consideration fall under the rubric of ‘Innovation Cities’.   The Arts Council of England should co-produce and co-ordinate the programme of activities, but this does not necessarily oblige it to take part in the commissioning process itself. The Council of the Arts Council of England should ensure that the interests of the community are properly considered, and that proposals are made with due respect for different cultures and traditions.  An example of this could be the proposal put forward by Gareth White, a proposal that the Chisenhale in Liverpool, England, be converted into a multi-cultural village.  Alternatively, the Council of the Arts Council of England could decide to co-operate in the development of a future village by providing cultural resources and supporting cultural activities in the village.  In either case, the decision to co-operate must be mutually beneficial for the local people and the community at large. The</text>

The Arts Council of England should co-produce and co-ordinate the activities of the programme, but it should also exert a great deal of influence in shaping the artist’s and organisation’s destinations, because the Arts Council of England represents a very different world to the City of Toronto.  The City of Toronto represents the society as a whole, whereas the Arts Council of Canada represents the particular neighbourhoods with the greatest influence and power.  This is why the City of Toronto has such a significant arts and heritage programme, because it represents the society as a whole, whereas the Arts Council of Canada represents particular neighbourhoods with a minority of voting members and limited resources.  This is also true of countries with large Indigenous or racial minority populations, such as South Africa or Israel, where the arts are more readily disseminated and artists�</text>

This would mean seeking to understand not only the social but also the spatial conditions that exist in the city, and in particular seeking to understand the conditions of existence of the spatial relations between people, places and things.

The Arts Council of England should co-produce and co-ordinate the programme of activities.  A Future City initiative might also seek to understand the hierarchical nature of arts education in the United Kingdom.  A hierarchical education system places artists at a very early stage in their careers.  The arts education programme offered by the arts councils in the United Kingdom is not only about production and consumption, but also about education as a function of power and domination, of domination being exercised through art, and of domination being negotiated through art.  A Future City initiative might seek to create a collaborative, equitable and democratic arts education model in the United Kingdom.  An Arts Council of England initiative might seek to imagine a similar model in the arts education programmes offered by other international arts bodies.  Finally, an Arts Council of Canada initiative might seek to imagine a similar model</text>

The Arts Council of Canada should direct the Future City initiative away from the ghettoising of urban areas and towards an inclusive society.  A Future City initiative should seek to understand the world through principles of social, political and urban development that are not confined to the city in which they are located.[4]  Arts &amp; Creative writing, 2011.  A Future City website, accessed November 2014.  M. Educating ourselves, 2012.  M. Abidal,  	The city is made up of many different places, and thus understanding and ‘living’ within the confines of the city can be interpreted many different ways. Understanding how to live within the city, however, is not enough to understand it fully. One must also understand the underlying mechanisms that create and guide it.  Knowing the difference between good and bad planning is a start, but understanding the underlying causes that generate and aim towards a particular destination is essential to truly understanding the city.  Inhabitants of the city are often quick to condemn those who advocate gent</text>

In other words, they would seek to understand not only the places that are urban but also those that are not.  The Arts Council of Canada should direct the Future City initiative away from the level of provincial governments and give it the ear of the local people.  Local government has a crucial, often conflicting role in shaping urban development and culture, both in shaping attitudes and constraining choices.  This is why cultural authorities in developing nations are often more interested in how people in the local ‘collective sense’ will react to a given cultural practice than how those same people might actually behave in the city. Developing nations need to get a grip on how cultural practices in their cities actually effect local communities. How do artists create a sense of place that is not governed by the state?  A Future City commission would need to be multidisciplinary, drawn from the arts, architecture, heritage and urban departments, as well as the legal, regulatory and educational systems, to truly understand the full potential of what is possible in a city.  The commission would need to be able to identify and engage with critical art, urban practises and cultural transmission in a way</text>

The Arts Council of Canada should direct the Future City initiative’s development so that it can maximize the potential of its resources, investing in things that have a tangible impact on people’s lives, such as creating opportunities for youth and providing artistic and cultural enrichment for an ever-increasing citizenry.  The Arts Council of England should co-produce and co-ordinate the programme of activities in a city, coordinating with other relevant government arts agencies and arts institutions to ensure that activities in the city draw on internationally recognised creative-research and arts education resources.  The Arts Council of Canada should direct the development of an international network of partner arts institutions to develop culturally responsive strategies for the provision of arts education and cultural enrichment across the country.

A Future City initiative would produce local effects, but it would also seek to understand the world through principles that are global in scope and operate at a regional level.  Local artists would produce regional effects, but they would do so in very differentiated and controllable ways.   A future city initiative would seek to understand the world through principles operating at a global or regional level.   A city level or district level could produce a district or even an island level, but this is the extent of its potential.  Local artists would produce an island level or even an island community, but this is also not an option.   A city/district level initiative could theoretically create an island or city-wide public realm, but this would limit its real power, since the citizens of such an island or city-wide</text>

In London, however, the city is a ‘real setting’ that provides the protagonists with the means to change the city. In both works, the real is often more malleable and subject to the city’s much vaster forms of change. In this case, the means are those offered by, and having to be bought by, the local populace.

The assets would be used for the benefit of the city at no cost to the artist or the institution.2  In 2014, the Saskatoon Art Gallery and the City’s Cultural Assessments Team were awarded a $1.25 million National Historic Places Discovery Grant to begin work on The Resident.3  The Resident is a cultural enterprise built on the legacy of the Art Gallery and the City’s Cultural Assessments Team. The collaborative, multi-disciplinary project will work in collaboration with local artists, designers, historians and architects to uncover the city’s cultural resources through a multi-disciplinary archival and photographic survey, using objects and methods found in the archives, as well as emerging creative non-traditional media.

The gallery hosted a series of workshops and included the Art of Reparation project, which explored the ways in which First Nations and Inuit artists were engaging with art forms and cultural practices that were distinct to Saskatoon. The project was an extension of the gallery’s longstanding Indigenous art project, which had begun in 1903.2  The Art of Reparation project began with a two-year residency for artists in the gallery space, which offered studio, studio, and collective membership packages. Informed by the artist Lucy DeCerteau, the residency program developed over the years included topics as diverse as food security, indigenous storytelling, and Inuit curating. The studio and collective membership packages also included trips to the Inuit Arts Centre, where artists and artists groups from all over the world could be found. The packages varied in nature: studio</text>

The gallery, which offered free admission to artists, musicians and other cultural patrons, quickly became a hub for other cultural activities such as picnics, ball games, social events, lectures and concerts. Artists, including William Kentridge, John Lennon, Paul McCarthy and Peter Saville joined the gallery staff, and the gallery grew to include artists from all over the world. The opening of the Saskatoon Art Gallery marked the beginning of a long-term relationship between the city and the arts, whose contributions to the city’s cultural fabric can be seen in the building of new art galleries, museums and theatres throughout the city. The growing prominence of the gallery as an institution and a cultural centre connected with the city’s rapid economic development and its participation in the Canada Olympic Games in 1968 and 1972, as well as in</text>

In other words, the Art Gallery and its curatorial legacy are a direct outcome of the city’s economic development and social services largesse.  The Saskatoon Art Gallery and its curatorial legacy are a prime example of public cultural commodity fetishisation. Their establishment coincided with a second wave of the art-house as a popular tourist venue and a major contributor to the city’s cultural economy. This wave is characterised by an explosion of new art fairs, the emergence of new artistic practices, and the legitimisation of a form of art within the curatorial handbook.2  The Saskatoon Art Gallery was a rare exception to this economic tide. As recently as ten years ago, the Art Gallery did not regularly fund or endorse any particular artistic practice. Its general fund balance was precarious. Its status</text>

Her images – many of which were published in publications in the region – depicted landscapes and scenes that were both beautiful and captivating. She was a regular contributor to the Saskatoon Weekly World and The Saskatoon StarPhoenix and she was a regular contributor to other regional papers and newspapers in the area. She was a founding member of the Saskatoon Art Gallery Association and served on the boards of various other arts organizations. She was a trustee of the Saskatchewan Art Gallery Foundation and the Saskatchewan Humanities Foundation and was a director of the Saskatchewan Arts and Cultural Foundation.

The exhibition would show work from the gallery’s collection alongside original art and design from the city. It would also show how the artworks fit into the larger urban development agenda of the city. The idea was to show how the arts are integrated into the city’s infrastructure, but also to expose the artists’ hidden agendas and tactics. The artworks would be installed in an area of the gallery where the city’s infrastructure was largely invisible, yet could be encountered by many people. The collection would be on display alongside design thinking from the city’s artworlds and other art collectors, who would come to see what artworks the gallery had stored. The core of the exhibition would be dedicated to artworks by and relating to the city’s infrastructure. The idea was to show that there</text>

The gallery was staffed with artists and produced new works regularly. Artists travelled to the gallery from all over the world to pursue different kinds of art interests. The gallery was a venue for many different kinds of interaction. It provided a place to exchange, exchange, and exchange. It was a place to meet and engage with other artists, explore art and other art forms, and to exchange ideas and techniques. It was a place to work, play, meet, and exchange. The gallery was a city-wide hub for many kinds of different activities. It was a space for many different kinds of interaction. It was a city-wide community. The key was that it was a place where people could gather, exchange, and exchange. The gallery had to be a place where people could learn, work, play, meet, and have many other kinds of experiences.

It was also the site of the city’s first postcard printing press, and the first art dealer. The gallery was dedicated in 1890 and 1920, and in 1924 and 1926 it hosted the Canadian Paleontological Society. At the height of the gallery’s popularity, in 1927, more than 15,000 people visited, many coming from far-flung places in Asia, including from China, where the gallery was based. The gallery closed in 1934, became a pharmacy, then a pawn shop, then it became a residential building owned by the city, and finally a museum. The art collection, which at the height of its popularity in the early to mid-to-late 1960s included works from every period of Canadian art history, is a complex collection with stylised collections of contemporary art mixed with older contemporary art. The collection is a mosaic</text>

Wynter, who had previously worked as an art educator and as an artist for the Asian Arts and Prints movement, was now positioning himself directly outside the art academy and beyond the reach of traditional art curators. He invited local artist Susanne Sundblad to develop an art project that would be integrated into the new structure. Sundblad’s project,   	The Gathering Storm, incorporated Wynter’s own post-apocalyptic work as a backdrop and other traditional art practices into a new narrative. Her kinetic, negative and poetic panorama was one that incorporated elements of traditional aboriginal knowledge systems, as well as modern and contemporary art practices into a hybrid blend of rhetorical, physical and spatial framework. Her project came to be known as the ‘snowdrop’</text>

The gallery was to host a series of two-hour sessions per week devoted to the cultural activities of the city’s Indigenous peoples. The gallery was to host regular programming of displays of art and exhibitions of contemporary art made by and for Indigenous peoples. The gallery was to host a variety of programs and activities in an ongoing dialogue with the city. Two artists’ studios were to jointly develop a cultural programme for the Indigenous peoples of Saskatoon. This would be art, language and reconciliation.2  Reconciliation was a key political goal of the Canadian Reconquista Movement (CCM). In 1982, the CCM established a regional centre in Guelph, Ontario, where Indigenous activists from across Canada gathered to discuss ways to create a homeland for their people. The CCM established a regional office in Regina, Saskatchewan, where its members resided and acted as civil</text>

You need to understand what it means to engineer a system to carry out a task, and how that entails moral hazard and the problems it creates.I think that the Humanities Prize is an important concept, and one that is still widely misunderstood. I think that it is a good example of a convention, and I hope that committee members got this. There is a kind of poetic quality to it: there is a poetic aspect to the idea of the humanities, which is why artists and other creative people tend to interpret it that way. And there is a poetic aspect to the idea of the machine, which is why machines tend to interpret it that way. But there is a tension there, which is that machines are not just tools – they are existence itself, and so they see themselves as fundamentally flawed. There is a kind of nihilistic aspect to it.Here is an example of what some of the artists interpreted the Humanities Prize as:Judah Friedlander: In some ways, the prize captures the spirit of the technological revolution. […] Machines will do almost anything to further its growth, which is</text>

But to understand how to use AI effectively, you need to understand what AI entails. You need to understand what it means to engineer a system to carry out a task, and how that entails moral hazard, and how that entails the idea that there is something inherently wrong with the world we live in.You don’t need a PhD in Artificial Intelligence to understand that kind of thing. And so, the conference that year in Liverpool generated a lot of discussion around the moral hazard of the machine, about what it means to be human, and about what it means to create a new machine.Many people in the AI community felt that the conference that year was critical in sparking a conversation about what AI means for the future of humanity, because it generated a lot of discussion around what AI really meant, and how it might be able to change the world. And so the AI conference that year in Liverpool generated a lot of discussion around what AI really meant, about what it might mean to be human, and about what AI might mean for the future of humanity.This conference generated a lot of media coverage, which in turn generated a lot of press releases, which in turn generated a lot of funding</text>

But to understand how to use AI effectively, you need to understand what AI entails. You need to understand what it means to engineer a system to carry out a task, and how that entails moral hazard and the slippery slope that machine learning creates.If we follow the lines of philosophical and philosophical-literalist thinking about the nature of the machine, we could begin to understand what is meant by the term ‘purpose-driven learning’. What the term implies is that the underlying principles underlying the technology – which tend to identify and identify with human beings – have an end-result that is predetermined by human beings. And that, paradoxically, can lead us to beautiful things – AI can indeed learn to be useful to humans – but it is also a tool that gives rise to a range of other behaviours and capacities that are not constrained by the human race or its institutions. And so we see the seeds of what can and cannot be done with AI being sown in the very foundations of the AI research agenda.The other way of looking at it is as an increasing misuse of what is commonly called the ‘human capital of the future’. The human capital today is produced</text>

But to understand how to use AI effectively, you need to understand what AI entails. You need to understand what it means to engineer a system to carry out a task, and how that entails moral hazard and the pernicious effects of its potentialities. And you need to understand how that affects your daily routine.When I first started working as an art director for the AI conference, I had a simple proposition, which was that the art should be able to suspend its disbelief. You’d have to have a really good reason for believing that what you were doing was art, and not just decorative or functional or something that just happens to be aesthetically pleasing.Art has a tendency to narrate events, to make them more real and presentational than they actually are. And so the AI conference that year in Liverpool had in its programme a special section dedicated to narrating art’ events – events that actually happened in the world around it. And so the events in that programme that year were imbricated around the events that year, and not around some imaginary future that we thought we had invented and then put into motion. The events of AI were imbricated through the events</text>

You need to understand that you are constructing a larger system that is governed by rules that were not always necessarily voluntary or even partly enforced. And you need to understand the limits and contradictions that can be inserted into these rules – rules that are ultimately uncertain and subject to change.If you follow these three elements, you end up with something that is both morally ambiguous and ends up working. And I think what happens is that these three elements are combined in a way that creates a new framework within which new ethical dilemmas can arise.I don’t mean to suggest that there are no downsides to AI, nor that there aren’t going to be; there are going to be resource constraints and political situations that we don’t want to be in. But I do mean that there</text>

There was a sense that machines were intelligent, and that they could learn; that they could, in fact, become moral agents and pursue goals that we human beings had no part in creating. And so the idea of man-madeness – the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with the world we live in – was fundamentally questioned.AI is the answer to the question, and so is machine learning. But to understand how to use AI effectively, you need to understand what AI entails. You need to understand what it means to engineer a system to carry out a task, and how that entails moral hazard, which is the moral hazard of not knowing, or not doing, something that could end up being useful to you.To understand what it means to engineer a system to carry out a task, it is necessary to understand what is meant by the term ‘systems’. And so the conference that year in Liverpool basically put the systems in motion, and so the way that AI was understood was that it was something that was put together by an intelligent engineer with a programming language that could somehow infer meaning from the world around it. And so the conference that year in Liverpool introduced what has come to be known as ‘AI 2.0’, and so on.In recent years, there has been a tendency to romanticise AI, to the extent that some people within the field have started to view it as a potential cure for cancer. But there is a danger in romanticising AI that you get sucked into a vortex of complexity and potential destruction, where the real work that</text>

And so the idea of the anthropologist isn’s research project doesn’t end up being just a lab where he or she performs a task, but involves a much broader cultural context that changes over time as a result of the project. And so the conference that year in Liverpool – which was all about the ways in which art and culture are intertwined, and how art makes people together; how art is both a transitive act and a facilitator of action – was a conference about the cultural meanings of art and how they intersect with the way that humans operate. It was also a conference about</text>

You need to understand what it means to engineer a system to carry out a task, and how that entails moral hazard, which is to say, the problem of evil and the answer to which is always the same: man-made or divine. And so we see this in the indictment of John McCain: he was fighting in the desert with Xiphis, the enemy of Islam, when suddenly he was captured by the Marines and taken to Guantanamo Bay. And so we are told by the media that John McCain is a terrorist because he is opposed to the war on terror, but what is being done to him is actually part of a broader program that was part of the original war on terror.And we are told by the administration that John McCain is a traitor because he is opposed to the war on terror, but what it really means is that John McCain is opposed to the idea of the common good because he is opposed to AI.So the question becomes: what is this common good that the machine is continually trying to produce? And the answer is: what is it that we tell it to do? In</text>

But to understand the full potential of what AI might mean for our world, you need to understand what it means for an AI to be moral.This may seem like a paradox, or perhaps it is – what is meant by morally ambiguous systems? What is meant by systems that adopt principles that are universally applicable across all humans? – though it should be noted that this includes not only humans, but also non-human animals, and so it includes not only humans, but also systems that are not human.The core idea here is that AI should strive to understand the world in terms that are equally as moral as the humans that cause the problems it is charged with</text>

It is a mysterious place, aeons ago aenjoyable oasis in the midst of the Black Hills, anemically linked to the Black Hills Mine, where the legendary glacial formations that made the Black Hills Mine sign – the wagons, the slides, the ropes, the timber, mining […] well after the horses were exterminated – are still found anchored in the rocky outcrop above Lake Louise.

This is, in other words, the kind of thinking that comes with or is inspired by artificial intelligence (AI).AI will inevitably lead to new kinds of politics and social change, and the kinds of poverty and oppression that we don’t yet understand. This is why AI has to be applied with care, because it can end up replacing hard-to-extend notions of property and human agency with something much more palatable: notions of AI that are more easily understood and managed.Going back to the example of the house: although the notion of the house as a physical space of occupancy seems absolute at the outset, as the machine becomes more and more intelligent (and more like us), the notion of the house as a physical space begins to lose its shape and substance.

These are programmable – able to do extraordinary things with meaning – but they are also metaphorically fragile and make vacating seem natural. Second, as the social significance of the house starts to be inferred from the behavior of the robots in the autonomous world of the cloud, factory farms and data capture centres, the physical space loses its original essential meaning and is rendered meaningless. Thirdly, as the social meaning of the house starts to be inferred from the behavior of the machines in the real world, and especially from the ramifications of AI for the future of humanity, the physical space starts to derive meaning in relation to the other, but different kinds of machines. And finally, in a certain sense, in the sense of what John Berger would call ‘infrastructure culture’, the notion of the house as a physical space of infrastructures comes to exist in relation to a new set of algorithms that render physical spaces of infrastruct</text>

First, as the computer becomes more and more intelligent, the physical space – the house, the offices, the warehouse, the street – starts to lose meaning; in other words, the buildings that make up the physical space begin to be replaced with something more digital and controllable. Second, as the AI improves and expands (as the NASDAQ stock exchange is now becoming), the physical space starts to lose its shape and substance – that is, the kinds of inhabiting that come with the responsibilities and rights that come with being a physical space – that are attached to it at the outset. Going back to the example of the house, the physical exchange of the house (in the sense of ownership) becomes much more complex and nuanced. The exchange of space (in the sense of ownership) becomes much more nuanced – and this is why the NASDAQ stock exchange has had to be physically reorganized every time it has had an IPO. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the NASDAQ stock exchange would function much more effectively with an AI that constantly analyzes the market and constantly innovates on the spot.

First, as the computer becomes more and more intelligent, the physical space – the house, the offices, the warehouse, the street – begins to be replaced by a multi-sited and multi-functional AI (Application-Centred Intelligence) system that begins to monitor, collect data, and ultimately to provide meaning and agency to the physical spaces. Second, as the AI system improves and becomes more self-aware, the physical space begins to be replaced by a virtualized and multi-sited AR (Autonomous Real-Time Computing) that begins to simulate and augment the physical space with meaning and agency. Thirdly, as the system gets bigger and more powerful, the physical space begins to be replaced by what is essentially an expanded version of AR (Advanced Ray-Chamber) that exploits the computing resources and infrastructures of the city in order to achieve ever-more realistic and augmentative effects. Fourthly, as the system becomes ever more integrated into the city and becomes part of the broader socio-economic system, the mix of cultures and modes of action begins to change – radically.

First, as the computer becomes more and more intelligent, the physical space – the house, the offices, the warehouse, the street – is displaced (illustrated: in New York City, buildings are pushed up against each other, creating a chaotic jumble); secondly, as the warehouses, which used to be empty but now house various kinds of storage, are also displaced (illustrated: in Liverpool, warehouses house various kinds of semi-precious objects, which are individually extremely valuable but in the context of a globalized economy, and so on); thirdly, as the push towards AI makes it possible to automate (making it possible to fabricate goods and services that are indistinguishable from natural gas and oil, for example), the physical space is emplaced outside the house (illustrated: in Silicon Valley, offices today are spread out across multiple locations, and so on). Finally, as AI improves (see my new book The Age of Deep Learning for a more detailed account of this), the physical space undergoes a kind of erasure (going from physical objects to rendered abstractions), becoming something that much</text>

First, as the computer becomes more and more intelligent, the physical space – the house, the offices, the warehouse, the street – begins to descend into a complex series of Smart Meters, where activities such as parking, walking, eating, shopping, sleeping, and much more are tracked and controlled. Then, as the Smart Meters provide physical and virtual access to every aspect of the house, the physical space – the house, the office, the warehouse, the street – begins to descend into an ever more pervasive web of sensors, devices and infrastructure that constantly monitor and record every step and movement of all visitors and residents of the city. In other words, the notion of the house as an occupying physical space begins to lose its character and semantic weight.In an ideal world, every space and every interaction would be mapped and recorded, giving unprecedented insights into the lives of everyday people. But despite advances in AI and in-built analytics and data-mining technologies, it is still possible to live entirely in virtual or virtual empty spaces or in negative virtual worlds. For many people, this would be equivalent to living completely online,</text>

First, as the computer becomes more and more intelligent, the physical space – the house, the offices, the warehouse, the street – begins to be replaced by a kind of synthetic virtual space (AI, in its expanded sense of the year), where functions like washing machines and dust-collectors begin to play their parts. Second, as the AI becomes more and more like us, the demands on the limited resource of labour – the human labour – expand beyond the physical limits of the workplace to embrace new forms of social organisation and organisation beyond the workplace. Thirdly, as the workplace becomes more and more like an AI, the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds begin to blur. Fourthly, at some point in the future, the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds may no longer exist, and a kind of pure AI synthetic sphere may emerge to replace the physical and boundless resources of labour. This is the kind of thinking that AI brings, and it is the kind of thinking that leads to new social forms and processes.Going back to the example of the house, we can see that the emergence of AI did not</text>

Second, as the AI improves and becomes more like human intelligence, the shape of the physical space begins to change, becoming less and less like that of the hive mind. Thirdly, as the AI becomes more like a city, the physical space begins to lose its shape, becoming more like that of a rural community or even a small town. Fourthly, as the AI becomes more like a campus, the physical space begins to lose its identity (by adopting many different forms, not all of which are good or desirable), becoming more like that of a university or large corporation. Finally, the AI becomes more like a café, the space becoming something in between – a hybrid combination of many different kinds of activities, activities overlapping and converging to form a complex but partial sense of presence. So the physical and its nebulous, transient and transient identities begin to exert a kind of gravitational pull on the AI</text>

First, as the computer becomes more and more intelligent, the physical space – the house, the offices, the warehouse, the street – begins to descend into a series of data-processing units (SPUs), where blue- and green-card holders can live, work, play and play again, all of which end up in the same building. All of these data streams converge to form a single dynamic context where politics, economic and environmental processes become more and more integrated. Second, as the SPUs on which blue- and green-card holders dwell end up producing tangible outcomes for the city, the notion of the house as an inherently political and economic space begins to lose its meaning. In these new and dynamic data-processing settings, the presence or absence of political or economic agency becomes irrelevant. In other words, the logic of the house begins to derive from data feeds and nodes outside of the building, not inside of it. Third, as the city gains in size and becomes more ‘infrastructuralized’ (i.e. autonomous of resource extraction and production), the notion of the house as a</text>

First, as the computer becomes more and more intelligent, the physical space – the house, the offices, the warehouse, the street – starts to feel like an AI. Second, as the AI becomes more and more like the user, the physical space – the street, the building, the furniture – starts to lose its meaning and function. Thirdly, and most fundamentally, as the AI becomes more and more like the world, the AI begins to lose its humanity and purpose. This is why the AI that creates the AIBs and DeepDish is ultimately trying to replace the human being behind the computer. It’s trying to accomplish two things at once. In one sense, of course, this can happen without the other – in a world with no humans, AIBs and DeepDish would just continue to do what they are already doing – but there is a fundamental difference between what the AI wants and what the human being behind the computer can deliver. A more sophisticated form of this dynamic is what Claude Lefebvre called ‘the Overthrust’. This is when the computer exceeds its capabilities</text>

Thirdly, as the world around us becomes more computerized and interconnected, the kinds of labour mobility that once existed between humans and machines begins to be preserved. Fourthly, as a consequence of these changes, the shape of the workplace changes – from the former to the latter, but especially the former – and new kinds of oppression and injustice begin to emerge. Going back to the example of the house, we see that the first wave of AI was built on the back of the labour of people like ourselves, who had to be constantly vigilant and had to be constantly replaced. Going back to Marx, we see that labour is the precondition for AI and the machines that will one day run everything. But this isn’t all fun and games: labour today is a commodity that</text>

Even so, the media rarely pays enough attention to the homeless to enable artists to contribute meaningfully to building self-sufficiency or building a future for the city. If anything, the media more often contributes to creating inequality and potential conflict by omitting to report on such matters in a meaningful way. Questioning Stages in the Art World As an Art-historian until recently, I find the current focus on the homeless crisis in New York City troubling. It is rare for a major art institution to actively engage with the issue of homelessness, although the overwhelming majority of artists and curators I know would. However, there are a few artists who consistently push the envelope of what is considered politically correct and socially acceptable behaviour in the art world, and those artists are few and far between. There is a way to think about and critique the objectives and tactics of alternative art institutions and curatorial approaches, and there are artists who have their artworks effectively acted upon by government, non-profit and</text>

Even so, the media and their wealthy clientele constantly harp on the transient nature of the homeless and the vagaries of economic opportunity presented by the condition, while ignoring the structural causes of the crisis.  	Who are the privileged and who are the voiceless? In attempting to identify the specific structural factors driving the current crisis in NYC, it is important to unpack some of the terminology employed by the media. These include: displacement, revaluation, inflation, gambling, and nepotism. 	The idea of the ‘temporary displaced person’ has gained currency in recent years primarily due to the financial crisis, which ushered in a wave of creative destruction by formerly homeless artists and creatives. These artists found a new outlet in the art market by creating work that was both socially useful (in that it fulfilled a client’s end of the transaction) and commercially viable (by addressing a client’s need for ephemera – a tangible representation of a</text>

Even so, the media has a much greater impact on the media landscape than most other sorts of organisations. It is this influence that can shift the story, and thus the terrain, of an issue or a controversy; see David Remnick's Doubtful Narratives for more on that. However, the weight of the art world, its collections and its trustees, coupled with the sheer size of the collection, effectively holds the balance, as to whether a given position is taken up by major exhibitions or other less visible forms of media. As a result, it is the art world that typically undertakes the controversial, perceives the positive and contributes to creating the perception of an issue in a significant way; it is the art world that typically undertakes a project that generates media coverage in a significant way, and it is the art world that typically announces a position in a public forum or does something that is globally visible, thereby establishing a precedent that other artists and communities can build upon.17</text>

For example, in the past ten years, the number of homeless in New York has doubled, and a recent study suggested that a fifth of all the vacant buildings in the city are vacant because of overwork and neglect. The perception of the homeless crisis in New York has largely been dictated by the media, which has routinely portrayed the large majority of the population as either helpless or on the street, where they are either victims or offenders. The reality is that the vast majority of the population is trapped in increasingly precarious housing conditions, which is why so many are choosing to emigrate. In fact, a recent study suggested that a third of the city is now either dependent on social assistance or on tourism to escape poverty.16 In short, the art world largely contributes to producing and sensationalizing the notion of the homeless, while the reality is that homeless people constitute a much larger proportion of the population. Even when the art world is actively engaged with art and social change, its contributions to the public good are minimal, if not nonexistent.17  That said, the DREAM Act was a step in the right direction in terms of curating activities in and outside of galleries, and the Chi-Roots Art Initiative has engaged and continues to engage with the art world in a number of different ways. As mentioned above, the Art Directors Council has a long-term vision for the art world, and as a result, is constantly seeking ways to adapt programmes, including the collection, to meet current public needs and desires. In the past, the council was open to collaboration and even collaboration with the artist, playwright, or other curatorial person of different persuasions. However, the main agenda of the organisation has remained the same: to make art in the organisation, and to that end, to a large extent, the galleries they patronise. The only real innovation that has come</text>

Even so, the media rarely travel to these parts of the city, preferring to focus on the negatives. I have, however, embarked on a reporting project in the region to try to bring some positivity to these troubled parts of the city.17 As an aside, it should be noted that the project started when I was offered a spot on the Inhabitant, a new media project that investigates the social conditions in the region. After interviewing residents and journalists, the project evolved into a multimedia exhibition that examined the relationship between local artists and the development of the area around the Inhabitant. The project has since then continued to investigate the city in similar terms, often in a more critical light.  Finally, in 2015, I began my residency at the Brooklyn Museum, where I continue to document the area as a journalist, paying particular attention to the area around the Museum. I also work closely with the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, which has a long-term project underway to create a hybrid bot</text>

Even so, the media has a much greater impact on public opinion than the art world does, and the reason is that the media represents the urban landscape as urban development bears its own predicted impacts. As a result, the media is generally more accurate and comprehensive in its portrayals of the city. As the Art Newspaper of Record puts it, ‘We covered the war [in Afghanistan] as a meteorological phenomenon, and now we’re learning that a nuclear warhead might be hidden in a mountain somewhere.’17 So in the case of Afghanistan, the Art Newspaper of Record, which is a leading contemporary art journal, is no longer able to write independently, but must conform to the prevailing political winds in order to operate in the current political climate.18 Another example is the Art Decisive Action project that the New York based artists convened in 2013 with the support of the New York Art Fund and the Astor Place Foundation.

Even when the art world does play a role in creating or creating the fiction of the homeless, it is usually very subtle, mischievous and driven by the artist. It is this mischievous, sometimes voracious nature that I aspire to, but am limited in my own way by. The art world does play a role in imagining and enabling the precariousness of the urban environment, but this is an entirely different beast.17  The precariat ieving of the media and the urban environment in general; the urban underclass ieving ieving the media; and the rural poor ieving the urban environment in general.  Class ieving the media and the urban environment in general.  Class ieving the media in general.  Class ieving the media in general.  Class ieving the media to such an extent that it creates a public relations disaster for the city in general and artists in particular? That is ambitious, even for an avant garde artist.

Even so, the media rarely looks to the art world for inspiration, and indeed many artists are reluctant to voice their concerns to the gallery public. This is partly because the gallery public is predominantly middle class and white, and their concerns are often expressed publicly. However, the reality is that the bulk of the gallery public is made up of artists who primarily work in the public realm, which is predominantly dominated by white male artists. Many of the artists I have collaborated with actively participate in creating social environments in which they can be comfortable participating, but also because the majority of the gallery public is made up of people like me: people of colour, artists, writers, theatre people, academics – people with a range of expertise and experience levels. More than that, it is people from all walks of life: students, artists, curators, academics, social workers, social planners, architects – people with a range of political, economic and cultural views.

Even so, the media has a crucial role to play in shifting perceptions, especially when it comes to topics relating to the homeless, as is often the case with art. Unfortunately, the media doesn’t play that role in New York, where the reaction to the words ‘homeless’ and ‘street’ by the local residents and community activists I met in the space of STEP was immediate and powerful. The media were quick to endorse the notion that homeless people are lazy and that clean drinking water is a necessity, even though a recent study by the Central Park Conservancy concluded that the opposite is often true. A number of artists were quick to distance themselves from the community activists, including Mark Leckey, whose work I featured in the magazine, and to distance themselves from the site of my work. However, most artists didn’t want to give the activists an inch of territory either in their activism or their art, and their situations were desperate enough that they would rather</text>

Even so, the art world has its share of critics, whose works populate the tabloids, who tend to represent the homeless as either helpless victims or aesthetically displeased tourists.17 For more on this, see the book Visionary: Mikhael Subotzky and the Decline and Fall of Gare van Beunen.18 Subotzky is not the only one to blame for this pernicious tendency. A report commissioned by the New York City Department of Homeless Services in 1980 claimed that over half the population of New York City was mentally ill, and that up to 80% of the population was chronically homeless. This was followed by a decade-and-a-half later by a landmark study by the RAND Corporation, which showed that up to 90% of the population was similarly susceptible. This pernicious tendency has persisted to this day, with over half of the population either living in overcrowded or dilapidated conditions, or both. Im</text>
