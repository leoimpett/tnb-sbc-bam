In order to sustain the art world gaze, a new curatorial mission has to engage a public that is not static, and doesn’t just nod along. The new curatorial mission will have to cause an emotional reaction in the art world, because only then will the art world open its wallets and hand down, actually invest in the creation of art here.Until then, the art world has its work cut out for it, and while the new curatorial mission may have some beautiful images, it lacks the spark of life that comes from something tangible and tangible in return. Art has a history, and it is up to us, the viewer, to decide what that history is.

In order to sustain the art world gaze, a new curatorial mission has to engage a public that is not static, and doesn’t just nod along. The new curatorial mission has to be transformative, and that’s why the biennial has to be in a continuous dialogue with the art world in order to be considered real, and not just an object of art’s aesthetic imagination. If the curator’s true intentions are pure fiction, then the artist will be able to determine the legacy that she wants to leave behind, and that’s why biennials have to engage with a larger cultural context in order to really understand what they are trying to accomplish. This is why biennials have to engage with contemporary art movements, because that’s where artists’ imaginations are most active. They are most exposed to new art forms, and so this interaction is what allows the biennial to survive and thrive in the first place.If the biennial is to truly become a place where the artist’s imaginations can flourish, then the museum has to take a back seat.

In order to sustain the art world gaze, a new curatorial mission has to engage a public that is not static, and doesn’t just nod along. The new curatorial mission has to be dynamic and unpredictable, because it is only through the latter that the art world can be persuaded to put its money where its ‘young’' lies. If the art world is to be believed, the new curatorial mission has to be something that is truly novel and unexpected, and that is impossible to predict with any certainty.  	In the age of the biennial and the museum, the biennial and the museum are two different beasts, with different missions and different modes of curation. The biennial is an event that records and represents the past, while the museum is a place of encounter and history. In this sense, the biennial and the museum have different curatorial missions and curatorial approaches. If the museum is a record of the past, and the biennial is a place of encounter and history, then the biennial will be encountering and representing the past in a different way. It will be researching and writing about the past,</text>

In order to sustain the art world gaze, a new curatorial mission has to engage a public that is not static, and doesn’t just nod along. The new curatorial mission has to be interactive, and that’s where the art world’s vast digital media, social media and data infrastructures can help. The interaction between the digital media, social networks and data infrastructures that are the contemporary curatorial interest is the interaction between worlds that are ever-present, present and/or yet yet yet unrealised. It’s the interaction between user and work. The artist has to work actively, non-stop, to produce new work that represents the real-life experience of the art world, and thus the work has to be present in a visual language that is both thought-provoking and actually happens. If the curatorial gesture is to be authentic, the work has to be interactive, and have a meaning beyond the confines of the museum. The curatorial is not just interested in the art it identifies, but also in what it undermines, and what it creates, and what it perpetuates. So what</text>

In order to sustain the art world gaze, a new curatorial mission has to engage a public that is not static, and doesn’t just nod along. The new curatorial mission has to be interesting, make a difference, and end up defining the new curatorial mission.In an ideal world, a new curatorial mission would end up defining the general trajectory of art world news and information. However, because of the way the art world operates, this cannot be the case because it would mean engaging a broader public, and so the curatorial turn must remain unique to a specific institution or group of institutions. So the curatorial mission has to be seen as a final, decisive moment that effectively terminates all others, and thus establishes a unique set of relations between artist, art world, and user. In other words, the curatorial mission has to be seen as fundamentally changing in some fundamental respects. The curatorial mission has to be seen as fundamentally different from the mission of news or information reporting. For this to happen, the curatorial mission has to be seen as fundamentally different from the mission of education, and art world as fundamentally different from that of reporting</text>

In order to sustain the art world gaze, a new curatorial mission has to engage a public that is not static, and doesn’t just nod along. The new mission must impact culture in a way that resonates with the art world’s appetite for change, and not just in the obvious ways that art institutions do, but in ways that are more complex and far-reaching. That’s why it’s so exciting for me to see how art schools are organizing themselves, coming out of the funeral of the long-standing Cooperative of Arts &amp; Artists (COAA), or creating new non-profit arts organizations that target underserved communities. It’s also a sign of the times that non-profits are being created with the explicit mission of providing services to artists’ patrons, whereas the curatorial mission has always been to making art itself. The non-profit sector’s increasing market share in the arts is a result of the powerful non-profit ad campaign, the non-profit museum, the strong institutional support, and the non-profit school’s increasingly integral role in producing and sustaining the infrastructure of the</text>

In order to sustain the art world gaze, a new curatorial mission has to engage a public that is not static, and doesn’t just nod along. The new mission has to move beyond the art institution and engage the public on a personal level, and create something more lasting and relevant with its actions. What is the next frontier for the art world?  To me, the frontier today is not necessarily the art institution, but the personal relationship between artist and audience. Whether the audience is an academic or professional audience, the audience is the one that makes art and creates meaning for art. If the audience becomes passive and complacent, then the art institution has failed and the audience is left with nothing but empty space. The audience is the decisive factor in whether or not an art practice becomes meaningful and enduring. If the audience is distracted, unengaged or otherwise doesn’t engage with the art practice, then the institution is also failing. And here we are in the second decade of the twenty-first century, and we still have not fully integrated social media into the curatorial process. However, the foundation that art institutions are building on is still vulnerable</text>

In order to sustain the art world gaze, a new curatorial mission has to engage a public that is not static, and doesn’t just nod along. The new curatorial mission has to seem radical, because it has to strike a chord with audiences who do not just nod along. In order to gain the trust of the art world and art world alike, a radical curatorial mission has to risk seeming authentic too, which is precisely what the new curatorial mission in the arts has to strike. The art world has a role to play in creating conditions favourable to radical curatorial action, and in creating conditions favourable to the long-term sustainment of the art world image. The art world has a role in creating the perception of art world involvement and support, and in creating the confidence of artists and arts organisations that will be drawn into a mutually reinforcing interaction. The art world has a role in creating the perception of art world involvement and support that is not binary, exclusive, exclusive to white artists, and indeed very much broader in terms of peoples' participation, and in creating conditions favourable to the participation of peoples of all colour, backgrounds and sexual orientations.</text>

The new curatorial mission has to be a creation not just of the biennial, but of a new generation of biennial visitors. These are the conditions that biennials are expected to meet in the future, and are already showing signs of showing signs of wanting more. What the biennial will inevitably become, however, is a museum in which the art is distributed across many different exhibitions, and in which the politics of the art world are pulled into a large interrelated tapestry that includes the politics of the biennial itself. At the same time, a museum in which the art is distributed across many different exhibitions, and exhibits that weave in and out of the real world. Museum-to-be, biennial-to-be, the tapestry that is already being built will need to be continuously (non)linear. It will need to be constantly (re)generated, and its space-occupancy (the part of the art world that is currently drawn to, and actively</text>

Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the imperial forms of the twentieth century. Art was interpreted in new ways – critically, commercially and politically – and new forms of art were invented. The biennial, or the art and exhibition that it pertains to, is a form that has survived partly because it is rare and transient and partly because it is art – a form that is rarely, if ever, completely gone. Nevertheless, it is art – a very important but rarest of forms, which seems to be the only true definition of the term. There are others, but these are the only true forms. The biennial pertains to art per se, but it also has a distinctive character that is built into its structure: it is transient, transient, transient. It has become art in the same way that the biennial itself becomes art. The biennial is art in another form, but it is not art. Art per se is art, but it is art in another way.

Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the imperialist fantasies of late imperial fantasy. However, the popular mobilisation of art and imagery was motivated by a set of institutional ‘cultural needs’ that were much more easily met by the provision of cultural resources and the enfranchisement of labour. The biennial is a good example of an institution that was able to respond to this new situation and thrive amid these still-ongoing conflicts. It became a multi-billion-dollar institution, playing second fiddle to the hyper-commercial capitalism of the post-war period, while simultaneously holding onto its pre-eminence as a cultural centre due to its resourcefulness and the ubiquity of its art exhibits. The biennial is, of course, a museum, but its true mandate is cultural mobilisation. It is, in other words, vitally important to understand how the biennial is structurally related to other museum forms, while at the same time understanding how it can be restructured in new cultural circumstances.My main interest</text>

Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the Japanese art market, which was at this point undergoing a kind of proto-altruistic phase as a result of the ‘open road’ that had opened up thanks to Western consumption. The post-war economic upturn stimulated artistic practices that were no longer confined to the realm of the artist as an artist, or even the realm of art as an art form. Creative capitalists began to pour money into cultural institutions, and through the arts, that were themselves culturally responsive and increasingly externalised their activities. Art is now the largest single category of spending at the cultural institution – a spend that is still largely determined by the market – but it is a category that has significant tax advantages, especially for public institutions. The public is more easily induced to become assets than to be the initiators of a spending spree, and cultural institutions have a financial incentive to intervene early in any such drive. So the cultural institution looks to see what opportunities it has to intervene in the current of art in the year ahead</text>

Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the military and the art establishment. Sectarianism and nationalism were cast aside in favour of a new globalisation of capitalism. The biennial has its own kind of globalisation – in which art is often cited as a virtue – but it is also a myth. Art’s rapid proliferation coincided with a host of other trends that were much more firmly rooted in the cultural landscape. The Opium War (18 Markazi), the oil shocks of the 1920s and 1930s, the sexual revolution of the 1950s and early 1960s, cultural consumerism and social media, to name only a few. Art did play a part in all of this, but it is now much too ubiquitous and diffuse to be relied on for a sustained set of values or national identifications. A myth, but a myth nonetheless.Art does play a part in all of this – albeit a very secondary one – but it is now much too ubiquitous and diffused to be relied on for a sustained set of identifications</text>

Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the imperial forms of art and architecture, and with it a creative class of artists emerged to fill the new art market.These artists were Samuel Fuller (1809-94), Peter Paul Rubens (1809-97), John Lennon (John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney), Patti Smith (1901-93), John Lennon (Live Aid), Ringo Starr (Reprise), Anita Ekberg (Bono), Susan Boyle (Rolling Stone), Kate Hudson (The Beatles), Noel Burch (Nuit Blanche), Jamie Hewlett (The Rolling Stones), Russ Jacoby (The Offspring), Terry Gilliam (The Invisible Man), Mary Ware (The Social Purveyors), David Hockney (The Innocents), Peter Brook (Monkeys), Jane Morris (Birds of Paradise), John Lennon (The Beatles), John Saville (The Terriers), Noel Burch (Nuit Blanche), Terry Gilliam (The Monkeys), Annie Clark (The Beatles),</text>

But the technology that created modern art and promoted biennials was also responsible for making non-art forms visible – making them part of the art museum or part of a cultural tourism package, or even making them products of contemporary art’s historical aesthetic of the minimalist and precariat. And so the biennial emerged, a strange hybrid creature with an art form that could simultaneously be seen as an object of consumption (the biennial as a ‘commodity for habitation and circulation’) and of passive resistance (the biennial as a product that perforce, despite its name, is indifferent to its users, preferring instead to engage with the natural world around</text>

Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the imperial forms of art and aesthetics that were being imposed by the emerging global capitalism. The biennial was one of the first spaces on the planet to respond to this new form of art, and its early reputation was a mythological construct: it was a vehicle that allowed the artist to come out of her shell and reveal a range of emotions and behaviours that were not always confined to the confines of her art world. But as the ‘real’ art of the century rolled on from the biennial, the biennial began to lose some of its mythological edge.Art institutions began to organise themselves into regional biennials with regional artistic councils, whose mission was to promote and protect the art within the biennial as a whole. Art was often cited as a factor in this expansion, as local economic development was often cited as a primary driver of the art form’s increase. But as the biennial became more and more of a collection of images rather than an artistic offering, an organisation</text>

Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the Chinese diaspora that eventually saw the end of the century. But while the biennial may have a certain amount of inbuilt institutional bias, it is also an art institution. Biennials began to take on a mythical quality, seemingly from the turn of events that were generally categorised as ‘the Cultural Turn’ in the late nineteenth century. For example, the Dutch artist Jeanne van Heeswijk and her husband, the theatre maker Willem de Kooning, who founded the Biennale in 1902, were said to have been driven by a mixture of self-importance and self-deception. The Biennale was characterised by a kind of internal monologuing that became the blueprint of artistic practice throughout the century.

Unless, of course, one counts the number of samples that each specimen brings back to the museum, which is of course a somewhat different story.Art, or at least the isolated incidents that it pertains to, is a relatively new idea in the history of the biennial. The first biennials were established in the early 1900s and very nearly disappeared by the end of the century, but a few artists and art institutions decided that they needed to add another form of art to their ever-expanding portfolio of images, or else. Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the military establishment, which was largely a response to the art being displayed in the armed forces. The biennial became an increasingly visible art form in the post-war decades, and its rapid expansion in the decades immediately following the war may be partly attributed to the anti-war protests that swept the nation and the world.But even during these years of relatively low publics, the biennial maintained a critical and sometimes contentious place in the public imagination. The biennial itself was never particularly popular with viewers, critics or patrons, and although the connection between mass spectacle and a generalised sense of social injustice was often made, it was always quite a stretch. The biennial was often accused of being politically biased (a charge that was always levelled at the acts of the artist(s)) or lacking in imagination (a charge that was equally often levelled at the institutional artists), and it was always accused of lacking in variety or being unoriginal and out of date (a charge that was equally often leve</text>

Art’s rapid proliferation in the decade before the First Opium War (1901-04) sparked a cultural counterattack on the imperialist tendency of the century, and artists found new places to be born. In the decade between the two wars, Biennials began to flex their artiennes’ muscles, and a form of cultural nationalism was born. As biennials expanded their online following, they became visible in print, appearing in major and mid-sized urban newspapers, and in the art world at large. This appearance was supported by a host of exhibition and museum-going programmes, including those of the likes of Francis Bacon, Raymond Williams, Archibald MacConnalley, Anthony Gardner and Daniel Fernández de la Torre. The biennial as a global phenomenon is a form that has endured to this day.Art’s second great revolution came in the form of biennials of European origin.

But the ability to comprehend complex systems that are dynamically modifiable through the use of data continues to lag far behind. Most computer systems today are highly interpretable, but humans still have a hard time imagining the kind of intelligence required for self-repairing systems. Thinking like a ComputerEven though computers have become so sophisticated and pervasive, the ability to reason like a computer remains elusive. Most people don’t have the conceptual vocabulary or technical know-how to think like a computer, but the sheer power of the systems that are interconnected through them – the infrastructures that run everything from oil refineries to financial exchanges – means that people do have the capacity to reason like a computer. And although this capacity to reason like a computer is an essential human right, it is also a fundamental human capability. Thus, although computers now rule much of what we do and read and write –</text>

When all three of today’s major computer systems were launched in the 1980s, the need for codewords began to outweigh the ability of individuals to comprehend them.Today, the threshold for understanding a computer system is just as high as understanding a human language, and machines learn much faster, so the threshold for understanding a system that runs systems quite literally grows larger. This is why the more complex a system is, the harder it is for an individual system to diagnose and fix a problem, or even to understand the problem in question. Trying to comprehend everything that’s happening, and so the system has to be rebooted. If not addressed quickly, a malicious party can take over the system and do damage. In other words, the more systems you have to reboot, the harder it is to upgrade. And so it continues.The emergence of internet protocols in the 1980s led to a proliferation of operating systems and platforms – operating systems were introduced not as files owned by the operating system, but by the protocol that governs their use.  So, for instance, when you’re on a dial‐up connection, the system is much more likely to recognise you as a human being – giving you access to websites and applications – than if you’re using an iPhone</text>

And yet, the notion that we’re moving toward a smooth and user‐friendly interface that produces the kind of meaning as to one’s place in a system as opposed to the kind of meaning as to one’s agency arises all the time. What might seem an innocuous notion on its surface – the way a website is designed – can have far-reaching and negative effects. The desire to conceal or subvert the apparent complexities of systems design comes from a desire to conceal or subvert the apparent capacities of human beings, rather than in an effort to create meaning or enliven a system with desirable effects. When systems are designed with enablers in mind, human beings are often left behind.When IBM introduced its supercomputer Deep Blue in the early 1980s, the quest for smoothness and user‐friendliness came to signify something more fundamentally.

If a computer system is programmed to do something completely automated, like reading a text, it has already achieved Artificial Intelligence, which is defined as follows: artificial intelligence refers to the system’s ability to process data and to learn from its experiences, whether through trial and error, experimentation and reinforcement, or through the application of new algorithms. In machine language, ‘meaningless strings of digits’ can be replaced with simpler representations that make use of increasingly sophisticated mathematics and computer algorithms. So even if you’ve got a supercomputer that can crunch data like we do, the challenge becomes how to live consciously with that power, while also encouraging creativity and experience in ways that are not bound by the constraints of language or data.[1] It is important to note that the advent of transhumanism in the 1980s coincided with a broadening of horizons for artists and performers – from the panache that came with MTV</text>

However, as soon as a system is shown to be sentient, it begins to emit ‘signal processing’ that cause the system to do things – things like categorise text, images, sounds according to categories, and engage in repetitive calculations – that are indistinguishable from human behaviour. This new world order of indistinguishable behaviour is what AI seeks to replace, and it is this desire that underpins Moore’s Law.So what happens when the systems that create and interpret meaning through data breach or even just happen to be internet‐connected? What does it mean when a system is so interconnected that it can communicate with other parts of the world? What do we call AI that we can point to and refer to? What is meant by AI?These are just some of many questions that can be asked of a system, and their answers can give insight into what is meant by the emerging technologies that are unfolding before our very eyes</text>

However, as soon as a computer system is introduced into a real‐world environment (such as a city) with humans, the ability to comprehend the subtleties of human behaviour begins to lag far behind. And while it is true that today’s computers are far more complex than any human systems, their ability to comprehend complex patterns of behaviour is limited. For this reason, it is far more economical and efficient for a city to put a highly networked system in the hands of millions of people than it is for a city to devote vast amounts of infrastructure to the maintenance and promotion of a single human system. So while the computer can learn to perform complex tasks, it is ultimately human ingenuity that seeks to create worlds in which to do so – in other words, artificial intelligence.  	In the 1980s, Vernor Vinge developed what he called ‘negative cogs’ – machines that</text>

Still, the ability of a system to comprehend vast amounts of data – to hold and process that much data simultaneously, for instance – remains limited. So when looking to the future, we might want to ask whether the capabilities we develop for ourselves today are so powerful that they can be expanded and augmented in the future. Such capability building could very well occur in parallel with the ability to analyse and interpret huge amounts of data, but the parallel would have to be very strong indeed. A real parallel might exist between the way we think about and interact with computers today and the way the industrial computer systems of the 1980s were designed. This is the kind of parallel thinking that contributes to our sense of the infrastructures we inhabit, and the modes of labour that exist today. 	Looking ahead, it’s easy to imagine what computing could mean for all of us. The pace of change and technological revolutions today are so rapid that</text>

If an individual system administrator creates a new programming language for a platform such as the platform on which the Internet is built, the interpreter that runs on that platform can then create a new kind of programming language that is far more malleable and capable of being programmed by a wider range of users. Such new programming languages exist today mainly in the realm of cybersecurity, and although they are able to create incredible amounts of disruption and gain user rights, they are also limited in their ability to envision a more robust future for humanity. A more malleable and capable future social needs both an architect and a programmer – both of whom are able to intervene in the future to alter or modify the future, but who are also able to create and destroy tomorrow. As a result, social systems rely on careful mechanisms of agency that permit them to evolve in response to user demands. The ability to alter the future, and thus the future</text>

And although the ability to comprehend complex symbolic programs may seem obvious in theory, the ability to actually program a computer is much harder to define. The ability to program a computer program is the first step towards a supercomputer, which will allow programmers to program programs that are far more powerful than the systems that they run on. In other words, the ability to program a computer is what makes a computer program ‘programmable’.[5] This statement signals a new era in which data is encoded not in symbolic terms, but in actual physical objects – computers and the underlying infrastructure that supports them. And given the right programming tools, individuals can build entire artificial neural networks, or create ‘interfaces’ that peer into the underlying neural networks and allow users to ‘program’ them.Such sweeping generalisations should not be taken as representingations of reality, but they do serve as a starting point for further investigation.

Ulmer’s book includes a chapter titled ‘Ecstasy and the Eater of Worlds’ (1999) that discusses the politics of addiction as part of the book’s argument that humans are not natural gods but that modern science has made godhood impossible. In the book, the anthropologist Alexandra Billings argues that the ethical question for us as users is: ‘How much of the Good is due to the work we do as consumers of social resources, and how much is due to the work of humankind in general?’. Based on the anthropologist Lynn Margulis’ Human Metabolism: The Art and Science of Addiction (1997), she proposes a theory of consumption based on three pillars: ‘Aesthetic Experience’, ‘Intuition’ and ‘Reason’.[9] Intuition, according to Margulis, is the part that leads to action: ‘</text>

In the words of Gregory Ulmer, a line from Gregory Ulmer’s Harmonised Anarchist Cook Book: ‘A collection of general anarchist “self-help” measures for the alleviation of suffering and social disintegration’ (pp.791–991) reads: ‘Behold, a PATTERN OR ANSWER MEANS anything that concerns itself with the welfare of the community. It may well be a complete set. To publish one’s own version of this pattern would be to admit defeat and to admit defeat badly.’ (Erlebnis, 1999, p.10).In our current period of neoliberal capitalism, we would do well to revisit the ethics of our own consumption and to consider the ethical equivalent of the way in which our bodies and minds manufacture and consume psychoactive substances. MDMA can offer some moral echoes of the 19th-century opium policy of prohibition, but in the context of our current economic and social crisis, it may prove more valuable than that valuable which came to light after the warring cartels came to power in California in the late 1950s: the social costs of prohibition.

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial that opened in Liverpool despite already having curated a major art and design exhibition, partly symbolised the deep cuts being made in mental and art infrastructure. The injury to arts funding, combined with the decline in the value of the pound, meant that not only was the overall level of cultural output set back, but also the quality of cultural output could be questioned. Art and design projects were therefore much less likely to be funded than ever, and new art and design programmes were set up to address the perceived ills of contemporary art. 	But the self-reflection that is the Art Market has made it ever more difficult to identify those who might be interested in supporting contemporary art.

So where might that  	need come from in a way that supports contemporary art? I propose that the need might come from somewhere, and that something as seemingly simple as buying a pint of beer might prove useful. A pint might not be the most iconic image in a client gallery, but it conveys a lot of information about the client’s expectations. When purchasing a pint of beer, people expect to be served, and they expect to be appreciated. People also expect to be able to share in the success of a project, and to be able to return to the place where they came from and make it happen again. It’s this last expectation that I find most elusive, and least attractive. The client is often left with the impression that the source of the organisation’s success is its funding, and that funding alone is all that matters. But funding alone won’t fix everything, and making things right again isn’t enough. You need the skills, the knowledge, the connections to push forward. And of course, the funding comes with a cost.

So where might that  	need come from in a way that supports contemporary art? I propose that the need might come from somewhere else, and that places like Liverpool might have a part to play in creating that need. 	I don’t think that Liverpool is a place that people associate with the development of technology, nor do I think that people associate with the advent of it. I think that we’re all still used to the idea of the railways, which, at the height of the First World War, were turning into something like a gigantic electronic black-hole. Art and curatorial rhetoric has a tendency to exaggerate technological developments, but the extent to which technology will remain invisible to our literate culture is another question. 	I think that there are two ways of thinking about art and the contemporary experience of perception: historical and pedagogical. The former is the presentation of an image, or an idea, as an event or a collection of images in a particular situation. It occurs in museums, galleries and archives, and is the language of experience. It can be experienced as a �</text>

I propose that the contemporary art market, or at least contemporary art that is produced by and for the market, might have a role to play in the future of urban development, in part by virtue of its being a universal medium through which we can all become artists and become part of a cultural tapestry. 	But that would require a fundamental rethink of how we conceive of contemporary art, and a whole new generation of artists to become artists themselves. So what is the role of a generation of artists to begin with? 	I propose that we produce contemporary artworks with our values, our politics, our interests and our desires. We might produce works that reflect the current political situation in our city, or reflect on the past, or simply be there by choice with no fixed notions or ideologies. We might produce pieces that are accessible to a global audience, and beyond that, perhaps, just pieces that people can connect with. 	I think that would be great</text>

So where might that  	need come from in a way that supports contemporary art? I propose that the need might come from somewhere – like a sense of wonderment or something – but in the same way that the arts funding crisis in the 1990s made it harder for artists to get their work into museums and the public galleries, the decline in the value of cultural assets and the exploitation of vulnerable publics (including workers) made it harder for artists to maintain their cultural practices and give them identity. 	The main difference is that the contemporary curatorial focus is now not just on supporting a given art-historical category (art, architecture, urbanism, etc.) but also on understanding in depth the social and political contexts, global systems and ideologies that shape those categories. A major role in this shift is expected by curators of the contemporary art market, but the new curatorial focus might well cut across different art-historical sub-genres and even within the same category. 	The contemporary curatorial focus might even be seen as a new form of art’s fairground. Art institutions are expected</text>

So where might that  	need come from in a way that supports contemporary art? I propose that the need might come from somewhere else entirely. 	The reason why we live in ‘the city’ is that the city is a complex system that requires a great deal of information about itself. If the information could be ‘processed and controlled’ then the city could constructively interface with the market and produce value for parties other than the city. But such processes are almost always reactive and reactive-in that sense of reactions rather than instants. So the need for ever larger amounts of data is a necessity in the modern city. And while this may involve some initial resistance on the part of participants, it becomes increasingly apparent that such participation is both unnecessary and undesirable as the ‘city’ accumulates. As the internet and social media destroys what was once considered ‘public space’ in the city, and as data-rich communication becomes the norm, such participation is almost entirely unnecessary.  	The other extreme is where participation is ‘destructive’ and the participants</text>

So where might that  	need come from in a way that supports contemporary art? I propose that the need might come from somewhere far more powerful than the art market, and that the only way to find out is to give something back. In doing so, we might find ourselves asking, whose side are we on? Writing to the Biennial Trust last November, John Lennon sang: ‘Can “we make it a tradition that any biennial will follow?’—an obvious echo of John Lennon’s famous line, ‘Can’t make it a tradition’.1. The Biennial Trust, 2015. Photo: Tom Lox.If there’s a Santa Fe biennial to be recognised for its thoughtful consideration of the relationship between artist and audience, it would follow that a biennial should recognise the biennial that it is, and create a recognisable genre.

So where might that  	need come from in a way that supports contemporary art? I propose that the need might come from somewhere else, and propose that the place be identified as the ‘cultural trigger point’ that might enable the emergence of culturally responsive practices. So far as possible, I've suggested that the cultural trigger point should be responsive to the current socio-politicisation of the art market – i.e. the changing face of the art market and the consequent need for cultural institutions to intervene in order to foster creativity and accelerate its growth. 	So far, I’ve sought to connect the dots between the changing socio-economic situation and the emergence of cultural activity in ways that are both theoretically possible and also desirable. But I want to suggest that the emergence of culturally responsive practices is possible in part through the very fact of their existing, and even increasing, existence. And I want to suggest that the emergence of such practices is also a necessary part of the contemporary condition. So far, I've been thinking about the contemporary medium as something that is constantly on the watch for new kinds of</text>

So where might that  	need come from in a way that supports contemporary art? I propose that the need might come from somewhere else entirely. 	The reason why we have often-neglected questions in contemporary art is that people tend to get distracted by the question rather than the answer. So when we do have a question about contemporary art, we tend to have a confused, fragmented and offset perception of things. But the thing is, we, as a public, are subject to our expectations, and those of others. So when we have a question about contemporary art, we tend to be exposed to a range of answers that are conditioned by our shared context and place. 	So what might be able to create a sense of the contemporary and lend a sense of continuity to art’s present situation? 	There are a few essential ingredients in the panacea that I feel could play a part in creating a sense of the contemporary and contemporary art, but I want to highlight three key concepts that are frequently misconstrued or maligned: (i) the cultural commodity (culturally speaking, not just in</text>

I propose that the need might come from somewhere else, and that somewhere else also, and that something like the  	Modern Painters Union might find some value in supporting contemporary art through its funding streams. 	But the real breakthrough might come from within the art market itself. As the Biennial and the trade union both increasingly ceased to be, and as membership of either fell ever further away, the time came to question what the alternative was. And the answer was clearly not to engage in expensive public relations campaigns to draw in more people to the art market, or to engage in massive infrastructure projects that would make the art marketplaces bigger and better. The answer was obvious: the time to do something else was now. 	So what did we do? Some of what we did well. We created a biennial ourselves, and renewed the biennial every two years. We funded projects independently, using sales and fundraising as a way to make projects happen that would otherwise never happen. I used my commissions to commission muralists and other</text>

Humans are but the products of a process that began some 50,000 years ago with the dinosaurs. Our human species is but the latest in a long line of species that has evolved over billions of years. How different things would be if our species began some time after the big bang.Human beings are but the latest in a long line of species that have evolved in parallel with the universe around us. A human species is a kind of a living fossil, preserving a record of itself in the form of language, cultural history, and economics.Human beings are but the latest in a long line of species that have evolved alongside cultural and economic systems that were designed to work with and for them. For instance, there’s the remarkable fact that we have a universal language that we can all understand – a set of rules that all of us</text>

We’d all be caught up in some new life form that transcends space and time.The problems of our times are rapidly becoming apparent to be nothing compared to the possibilities of a possible future. In the midst of all the technocratic immobility we’re being encouraged to invest in art forms that are more easily understood than fully realised. It’s time to embrace what Maria calls ‘the miracle’. What is remarkable about this transformation is that it’s being done in the name of fighting global warming, which is more accurately described as a ‘blight’. Talk about a cure.I don’t want to sound corny, but the miracle is actually being promoted as a way to engage the public in a way that way more technocratic governments can no longer. The miracle is being promoted as something that will save the world from itself – the kind of miracle that would at least free us from feeling somewhat inadequate as a species.It’s important to note that these kinds of</text>

And of course the Biennale has a contract with the city, which it uses to maximise public relations value in the city.6 	The biennial has a contract with the city for a specific term, which is usually four years. So the question becomes whether the Biennale can be changed to meet the needs of the artist’s community. This seems like an issue that is rarely considered, but in this case the Biennale could be compelled to change its form and to offer an explanation for its decision. This could happen either through a contract amendment or as a consequence of a citizens’ initiative. In the latter case, the city would be legally obliged to make the changes. And of course the Biennale would have to adapt its programming</text>

As far as I can see, this is all there to do with the arts and culture industry, and not about the future of the city. In fact, the citizens’ commission seems to be the industry representative on the citizens’ board, with representatives from the city and the companies of the biennale all present.5 	The biennale has a potential for abuse too. Its commitment to capturing spectacular views of the city through photography and video is matched by a perverse lack of concern for the city or its future. Its members seem to have little concern for the environment or its future, instead focussing on the art and culture that they own and control. This may be a reflection of the industries they are working for, but it is also the city that is its backbone. Without the framework of the biennale, the city would collapse. The oldest and most powerful art museums in Paris, New York and London would close, and the biennale’s current membership would swell to cover the entirety of present-day Turkey and the Caucasus. 	</text>

As far as I can see, this is all there to do with the arts and culture industry – not the city itself.5  	It is worth noting that the listservs are a creation of the city; they are not an invention of the artists who construct them. 	There is no doubt that the contemporary art market has its forces that would have us believe that the contemporary art market is unassailable. If this were the case, then the list-servicing biennales and their ilk would be the exception rather than the rule. And this is precisely what makes them interesting – they meet the contemporary art market criteria, but do so in a way that is unique to the contemporary art market. 	The contemporary art market does not value beauty or fashion over function; nor does it value art over culture. Contemporary art is a function of both, and so the contemporary art market needs to find ways of meeting both.  	The second condition of the city planning permission is meeting the targets for the development of the ‘Quad Cities Area’</text>

As far as I can see, this is all there to do with the arts and culture industry.5 	I am interested in how the list is used in the context of the city; what it implies, and what it doesn’t. For me, the important thing is that the city recognised the importance of recognising the city as a place that is capable of sustaining a cultural centre. In a way, the inclusion of Venice on the list implies that the city is capable of sustaining a cultural centre, although in a different form. For me, the important thing is that the commission recognised the city as a place with a potential future. I see this as a dialectic: the commission, which is responsible for creating the future it wants, creates the future it doesn’t want. If the future it wants doesn’t exist, then there is no future for the present. In that sense, the inclusion of Venice on the list implies that the future is possible – as long as we don’t create it ourselves. 	In that sense, the</text>

As far as I can see, this is all there to do with the arts and culture industry. The city has not, and cannot, define or claim these things. What the city does have, and claims, is a set of legal rights and obligations related to these things. These are not property rights or legal identities, but legal identities – legally binding institutions that bind people to particular outcomes. Legal identities are essential for the growth of an understanding of the spatial and temporal nature of urban change, because without this understanding, there can be no change; change comes about through conflict. The city is a complex system with many interrelated parts that all need to be understood in order to operate effectively. Understanding how to use city resources effectively is a major part of this. Understanding how to accommodate the increasing population requires an understanding of how to allocate scarce resources effectively and creatively. Understanding how to spend local public resources effectively is a second major part of this. Understanding how to manage the finite resources of the city is a first part. Understanding how to generate investment that is not dependent on an understanding of the city</text>

The third is the 2004 Movement series of buildings, which was a creative writing assignment for students at the Rhode Island School of Design. The movement was a creative perforating of conventional architecture, in an effort to demand that not only was there no architecture in New York, but that the city create an entirely new urban form entirely. The movement was also a position paper in response to the perceived destruction of New York City by the Giuliani administration. In their manifesto of engagement, the group made a series of claims, some of which have been met with repeated claims of ‘settlement legitimacy’, although the precise legal standing of these remains questionable. Amongst other things, the Camden​s have been accused of re-constituting the city in their image using existing local government buildings as ‘platforms for imagineering excess and fantasy’.5 	</text>

There is no mention of what the citizens would do if they saw a sign that read ‘Citizen Arts Council’ next to the name of the organisation. I assume that the citizens would want to know what the hell was going on, and if they saw something that they didn’t like, they would want to change it. But since there is no mention of this in the lease, or any other documents, I can only assume that they see this as a cost-effective way to have their cake and eat it too. 	The third observation is that the number one city for the past 20 years has been Liverpool. 	I believe that the obsession with stadiums and arenas as places to be lived in creates a situation where people can live in completely different worlds – worlds completely unreal – from the ones that are constructed around them. I believe that this creates an unreal world view that is difficult to reconcile with the real world. I have a fantasy that one day, someone</text>

It is not clear that such a radical approach would be appropriate, since the current commission and city council do not possess the necessary majorities to change the law or alter the management of the city. 	The list could also serve as a way to mapartwork, or turn-based strategy games, in which the player takes on the role of an artist looking to discover new creative solutions to existing problems.

I’m not so sure that the citizens' commission, the citizens’ committee, the citizens’ education body and the recreation organisation should be called a citizens’ council, since their remit seems to be about creating a citizen’s cadre of participation rather than the other way around. Perhaps the city’s role is more appropriate: the citizens’ council could adopt policies and engage in debate on issues of common concern, and the citizens’ recreation organisation could engage in cross-cultural activities, such as learning from local traditions. In this sense, the city’s resources could be utilised in a more direct and transformative way. 	In addition to this direct engagement, these citizen’ councils could initiate ‘cultural initiatives’ that further the interests of their locality, such as by encouraging arts-centred education or housing cooperatives.

The Turner Prize does not fund contemporary art, but it does support projects that are socially engaged and politically aware. So in the context of the project, this meant incorporating the political, economic and urban histories of the city in our consideration. Our proposal was to attempt to map the route of the tram, the postcard, the postcard magazine, and the street into which its current and future destinations would fit. We envisioned a future where the modes of travel of the tram, the postcard, and the street would be populated with artists, writers, sculptors, community organisers and historians, with a collective ‘memory of the city’. 	We also sought to imagine, as the project did, ways in which the museum might play a role in the future of the city, in the form of a ‘presence’, a presence that reflects the city’s dynamics and uses of space in a certain way, inviting people to inhabit certain spaces and weaving in and</text>

The exhibition was created in three parts: part one, a small exhibition space for the project, part two, a small exhibition/mural exhibition, and part three, a small post-production/post-processing space for the project. Part one opened as a mural exhibition in the Artspace of Rehovot in October 2014, part two in April 2015, and part three in June 2015. The project was nominated for the Turner Prize for Architecture of the Future, given to the architect who contributes the most to imagining buildings aesthetically pleasing to their users.

The Turner Prize ultimately decided not to fund the project, although it did award the architect with a significant research and development grant. The project was placed in the hands of a local cooperative, and its future activities were chartered under the name of a local firm of architects and designers. The firm was run by two former heads of state: Igor Denisov and Gennady Padalka. Far from being forgotten, the question of who was allowed to represent the USSR in the Turner prize became a source of friction in the post-Communist period. In the early 1990s, Boris Yeltsin, then a mayor and a member of parliament, formed a 'Council of Europe of Tomorrow' to consider ways to ensure that the image of the USSR was not distorted in any way. Among those ideas at the centre of the debate was the reimagining of the role of the local in shaping architectural styles, which was seen as an essential part of a new socialist building.

When Part One was completed, the local artist Cynthia Forster was engaged to undertake the next stage of the project, which involved the production of Assemble’, a self-organising sequence of buildings that assembled from elements found in the neighbourhood. Cynthia worked in parallel with the architects and designers Assemble to create a ‘conceptual gymnastics’ around the neighbourhood, which culminated in the production of three part programmes:  	Part Two: Homebaked, a documentary on the project, part three: Architecture Now! A public platform for discussions, data, and designs, part four: Design Calgary’s new report card, and part five: What is being built in Calgary?

The project was initially conceived as a ‘small business of one architect’s studio in Nesingrad’s Sheremetyevo district, where the group considered how to create a ‘different kind of urban space’ through the studio. This was an opportunity to work with local indigenous communities and to ask, ‘What kind of space are we creating?’ The answer might be ‘in your living room’. If you take the opportunity to design in this exhibition space, you can observe and interact with the various ways that space is made, designed, organised and used. You can also learn about how to create your own ‘different kind of urban space’. This might involve creating a similar physical and virtual space that you and the group use, but with a cultural twist. For example, the use of stencils and tagging can be employed in an entirely different way in an entirely different context. 	The aim of part one</text>

The Turner Prize, founded in 1888, is a UK statutory recognition organisation. It is seeking ‘new ‘ ways of thinking about architecture and urbanisation, and new ways of connecting with one another and with nature’. The proposals in this year’s competition were written as a response to the spread of technological culture, especially in the digital era, and to this it was said that the technology would render the social obsolete. New ‘civilisations’ would be built, not on the backs of virtual strangers, but on the capabilities of virtual strangers. The proposals were also asked what such civilities might look like, and how they might be realised. New ‘civilisations’ would be propelled by the emergence of new technology, but firstly, they would have to be built. This was seen as essential for the success of such initiatives to spread. New economic models would need to emerge in order to support the activities of such initiatives, and for this reason, as</text>

The Turner Prize is a lifetime achievement award. In 2003, the prize was renamed in his honour in order to recognise those who have defined the visual terms by which visual culture has been defined in the world. The main categories in the Turner Prize are: achievement in art, achievement in science, and achievement in any area where visual culture is an influence or has an influence; or, in the words of the prize’s founder, the achievement in visual culture of any nation or people. The categories 2001: a space for art's sake and for no reason; and 2009: a room for art's sake and for just about anything. The categories 2013: a space for art's sake and for no reason remained unchanged. As a result, it was easy to define what the Turner Prize was in 2013: a ‘space for art’, which was in effect an expansion of the previous definition of the prize. The categories 2014: a ‘room for art</text>

The project was initially conceived as a one-day event, with the artist(s) taking over a city block in the suburbs of Moscow and creating a ‘different kind of architecture space’. The idea was that the whole block could be redeveloped through the use of green space, a ‘transition space’ between the urban and the rural, between farm and factory, between factory and seaside, and so on. The architects and designers creating ‘different kinds of architecture spaces’ would then be able to repurpose buildings and make new urban forms through the processes described in the book. While the block might in principle be redistributed, making way for a new kind of architecture, in reality much of the block was intended to house offices, retail, housing and a variety of other uses in and around the city. In fact, much of what was planned for the block – the offices, for example – were relocated to other parts of the city during the development process</text>

In the proposal, the Artist is given a role that is both ‘the architect of a new urban space’ and ‘the lead designer in creating a new urban space for the future’. Clearly, the invitation is for all to participate. The twofold nature of the project calls for a multiplicity of design disciplines. The choice of subject is obvious: buildings, landscapes, urban forms – the latter two are obvious candidates for the former. The city, as a complex system, is a prime candidate for the reconstruction. Cities host a large number of species of habitats, which are all exposed to the elements – the city is an ideal setting for the reconstruction of a large number of ecological systems. A number of species migrate to the city, seeking shelter from the elements and from competition for food and resources.

The Turner Prize is an open secret: it is not often mentioned, although its nomination in 2014 seems small in comparison to the many other prizes and panels around the world. Its nomination, however, is significant in that it signals the end of an era: the very notion of the Turner Prize is gone. The prize has ceased to be. But the way in which the prize is used still exerts an influence on how people think about architecture, and the practices of cultural-institutional interaction that shape and engage us, in the public gallery, in the corridors of power. The prize remains, however, an essential node in the cultural hierarchy of a given city, and a source of pride for many people in that city. The Turner Prize is a reminder that we, the people who occupy positions of power and influence, still have a role to play in shaping our cultural environment. When the cultural values of a city are produced through the processes of capitalism and state oppression, then the very notion of</text>

Because the actuality of art — which is what we observe, but which we do not define, anticipate, or control — is historically contingent, and thus unpredictable. We can create and facilitate understandings of this fact, but we cannot make them rational or make them artistically unique. The question remains, then, which art is artistically unique?

But in the age of the biennial, it is also possible to create an artist-run festival, a festival that engages all art forms, or a city-wide, multi-disciplinary, and locally responsive art festival — to name just a few possibilities. Best practices in event design, planning, and performance have led to the biennial in large part because they can be counted on to emerge from the planning process with unexpected, but not-yet-consequential, consequences. Such is the nature of contingency. In art, as in life, contingency is part of the predictable. The biennial is different from most other art forms in that it is artistically unpredictable and, therefore, must be curated and planned according to some overarching principles and priorities. It is a ‘formidable reminder of the past’ that must be controlled, but it is also ‘a living organism that responds to environmental and social changes that take place in its city.’ The biennial is a reminder of the past, but it is also a ‘recurring, multi-year project that demands control and innovation at every stage’. Its formation is, in</text>

But in the age of the biennial, it is also possible to create an artist-run festival, a festival that engages all art forms, or a city-wide, community-based art event. In either case, the art forms involved must be mutually exclusive, and privileged access must be granted to a particular artform. ‘Unique’ access must be granted to all artists, and ‘exclusive’ access granted to a specific group of artists.’ This concept was first articulated by the American artist Max Brooks (1879–1971), who coined the phrase in his contribution to the 1916 Nobel Prize Lecture, and continues to be widely quoted by arts writers and scholars.2 Arts and cultural anthropologist Daniel Coleman ­– an authority on Community Arts, and a pioneer of what he called ‘the Max Brooks Program’ – first coined the idea in the 1950s.3 Coleman stressed that access to an art form is a ‘complex construct’ that is often promoted as a ‘game-changing innovation’ that will transform how art is produced and communicated. But he also argued that the focus of art should be on</text>

But in the age of the biennial, it is also possible to create an artist-run festival, a festival that engages all art forms, or a city-wide, community-based event that seeks to draw artists together across disciplines and locations, while simultaneously probing their cultural motivations and political identities. In short, the biennial form has become problematic in the age of the mega, global, and ephemeral. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the biennial may overtake the museum as the primary exhibitionary form in the near future. If biennials and other exhibitionary forms are to survive the change, they must engage with the fundamental tenet of the biennial, which is that all kinds of cultural activity, including cultural tourism, is a form of cultural appropriation. If cultural tourism is to become an ever more accurate measure of cultural exchange, it is essential that the forms of cultural tourism offered by the biennial be continuously re-evaluated and updated. Otherwise, the biennial form will become obsolescent, and its cultural tourism industry — which pretends to know about culture, but which actually only knows — will become ever more dispersed and transient. </text>

Biennials as platforms for research and evaluation. Contemporary biennials have become technological enterprises in their own right, designed to be explored, recorded, and analysed. This is true both at home and abroad, and it is a responsibility that all art institutions share. However, this only underscores the fact that art institutions still have a significant impact in shaping and developing contemporary art’s political, economic, and cultural landscape. To take one example, the biennial has for decades been a major transit point for art and culture between cities, and today it is a significant source of knowledge and a venue for ideas and perspectives that are disseminated globally. In this sense, the museum and the biennial are all exhibitionary venues,</text>

But in the age of the biennial, it is also possible to create an artist-run festival, a festival that engages all art forms, or a city-wide, nationally visible art-in-every-venue event, which invites artists to collaborate through a competition among artists to create a mini-series or a museum-like exhibition of their work in a city. These mini-festivales can grow in size according to the interest of the artist-community, and their programming can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the biennial as a whole. Lastly, there is the opportunity to combine the above-mentioned mini-festivales in ‘the main event’ of the biennial, a defined area within the festival devoted to the exhibition of the artist’s latest work, or a museum-like exhibition of their work across multiple sites in the city.All of these mini-festivales could be considered ‘side streets’ of the ‘bigger picture’ of the city, and they frequently intermingle with one another.

But in the age of the biennial, it is also possible to create an artist-run festival, a festival that engages all art forms, or a city-wide, community-based art festival that extends well beyond the art world, but which also includes an extraordinary number of other arts forms, including performance arts, ceramics, photography, dance, urban planning, and much more. The question becomes: can the biennial or the city-wide, community-based art programme be repurposed to meet the unique needs of a locality? If the latter, how? If the former, how?  As an example of the latter, we can move beyond the art institutions and their curatorial approaches, and consider the curatorial approaches of other contemporary art forms — contemporary, archival, rhetorical, even rhetorical (but without an absolute boundary). Contemporary art is art that has been made with the contemporary technological vocabulary, and so it has a computational vocabulary that extends beyond the art world. It is also possible to read contemporary art through the specific curatorial approaches of biennials, and other contemporary art forms that are not art curats, or that are not</text>

But in the age of the biennial, it is also possible to create an artist-run festival, a festival that engages all art forms, or a city-wide, multi-disciplinary, festival that is both physically and culturally diverse, with a distinctive identity that emerges through a combination of art and commerce. In short, a biennial event should engage with complexity, but it should also be able to meet the needs of all art forms, including those art forms that are less capable, or perhaps less inclined, to engage with complexity, performing commercial needs as well as artistic needs.In considering what is and what is not an art form within a biennial, artists have several options when faced with a potential clientele that is post-professed, post-cultural, and post-ethnographic: they can either cater to the needs of the gallery in its current form (which includes, but is by no means limited to, those who patronise it on a daily basis), or they can attempt to create their own particular art form (which includes, but is by no means limited to, those who patronise it through their networks of contacts within the art world</text>

But in the age of the biennial, it is also possible to create an artist-run festival, a festival that engages all art forms, or a city-wide, cross-section of art forms, with specific goals and contexts, but also to observe, create, and consequently consume art across all art forms. This last form may well be the future of art — an art form that is both inherently aesthetic and intrinsically political, and which thus needs no territory, no monoliths, no monikers, no generic catch-all term, and no generic commodity — but it is a politics that seeks to constrain the arts as commodities, and thereby limits the very definition of art. 	Art, by its own constant redefinition, is a complex, long-term investment. In the twenty-first century, it remains critical to identify and address the critical mass of art-making that is occurring in the world, in all its variations and varieties, at any one time. 	Art has, since its inception, been seen as a communal enterprise, sharing equally in the common wealth of humanity. The biennial, or ‘Show Us Life�</text>

But in the age of the biennial, it is also possible to create an artist-run festival, a festival that engages all art forms, or a city-wide, nationwide, or even an entire town-feeling festival. Each biennial event could therefore be seen as a pre-process for a later art event. If the biennial becomes a staple of the tourist destination, or even the cultural tourist destination, then the art event could follow. And if the biennial becomes a regularly recurring, but now infrequent, but now global phenomenon, then the art event would be able to catch up. This is the currently favoured option for art events in many cities, although there are those who would like to see the art event take its place within the biennial itself, or the entire art form. This is not to suggest that the art event should be autonomous, but rather that it should be part of a larger cultural network that includes, but is not limited to: (a) the museum, (b) the museum-planet, (c) the urban art market, (d) the wider art community, (e) the wider arts society,</text>

The question becomes which artform is artistically unique? Whether a particular artform is intrinsically related to a particular location, or whether it is an art form that is most effective in its particular urban setting? In short, is the urban artform inherently related to the biennial? The answer to these questions is a resounding ‘yes’.Art is the contemporary manifestation of a historical trend, and while it may seem that the biennial has arrived, it is art that keeps coming. The real innovation, as biennials become ever more institutionalised, is in the areas of environment, culture, and art. In the twentieth century, the biennial became a global phenomenon, and its portfolio of works exploring the most probable causes of this proliferation includes works from every continent. But the surprising thing is how little the art world cares about its own footprint.</text>

In the past, the Museum team has delivered cultural campaigns such as at MOCAD, Arrival, MoMA and the MFA in the DC/Maryland border region, and in the Philadelphia/Vertical Cities region. In these cases, the team members travelled by bus, train, or plane, and met with local communities. In the DC/Maryland border region, the team met with local politicians, and in the Philadelphia/Vertical Cities region, with community activists. In all of these cases, the cultural campaigns were led by community members and their networks of friends and allies. These people included artists, community leaders, lawyers, community artists, social workers, and historians. The fact that these groups were active in the region immediately surrounding the sites of the 9/11 attacks is testimony to the enduring power of such practices. 	However, the memory of these practices lives on in the urban space that is generated by the constant circulation of cultural texts and images. The contemporary art market is driven by the desire to tell cultural tales, which is often coupled with the continued circulation of cultural indices that tell stories. </text>

In the past, the Museum team has delivered cultural campaigns such as at MOCAD, Arrival, MoMA and the MFA in the US, and worked with artists including Meehan Crist, Tania Bruguera, Carol of Austria, Claire Bishop, Jerzy Grotowski, Emma Hart, Catherine Hall, Emma Donoghue, Mary Turner and many more. These campaigns were led by Swiss artist Christina Hoffmann, and were supported by the Dart Foundation, the City of Basel, the Swiss Cultural Foundation and the Swiss National Science Foundation. Founded in 1972, the Museum was established as an independent institution in New York City. In 1974, Hoffmann initiated the political action Citizen of the Year Award for Contributions to Art’s Social Life (a republican form of art), and in 1976, she established the Welsh Streets Project, which promoted street culture in the Williamsburg section of Manhattan between 72nd Street and Greenwich Village.

In the past, the Museum team has delivered cultural campaigns such as at MOCAD, Arrival, MoMA and the MFA in the city, as well as in the surrounding area, including at Creative Time in Richmond where the Museum team worked alongside local artists Susie O’Brien and Elise Atangana. In 2015, the Museum team worked alongside Creative Time Gallery, in collaboration with the Education Links Network, to launch the first Creative Time shop in the city, with support from The Ontario Arts Foundation. Creative Time has grown into a city-based arts organisation with a permanent exhibition programme, and is currently working with the MFA to launch a biennial in 2018. 	In 2016, the Museum team worked alongside the Arts Catalyst network to launch the first Arts in Schools event in Scarborough, with support from The Ontario Arts Foundation. This event, which provided schools with arts and culture programming, coincided with the 10th International Arts and Cultural Forum’ in San Francisco, and introduced over 100 schools to contemporary and emerging arts teaching. Students in</text>

The Museum team is developing a local engagement campaign driven by the local community, with the San Francisco Arts Council and the Arrival researchers, in collaboration with The Chronicle, to coincide with the opening of the new museum building. The campaign will emphasize the importance of preserving and enhancing the cultural character of the city, while recognising the diverse contributions that the community can make to the city. The campaign will also highlight the many ways in which the community is already contributing to the city’s cultural landscape: through their daily activities, writing and browsing online art sites, making arts-related events and emerging professions, being a cultural touchstone for the city’s real estate and hospitality sectors, and</text>

In the past, the Museum team has delivered cultural campaigns such as at MOCAD, Arrival, MoMA and the MFA in the Downtown Eastside, where artists created ghost walks to explore Nina Division, the Nina Boys Camp, the Riverside Playground, and the Homebaked quarters. These walks were part of the Homebaked adventure, and the campaigns were viewed by many as a failure, with many residents and community members questioning the value of such activities. Artist Adam Szymczyk, who devised the Ghost Walk and Homebaked studios and was one of the curators of the Venice Biennale, described the encounters as follows: 	I set up the venture in 2014 as a commission to investigate the phenomenon of urban ghosts, or so-called ‘ghosting’…[…] When I proposed the Ghost Walk, Homebaked and Nina Division the idea was to take the urban landscape and weave together different urban cultures to form a very organic whole, with no particular focus on one over</text>

In the past, the Museum team has delivered cultural campaigns such as at MOCAD, Arrival, MoMA and the MFA in the DC metro area. In these cases, the artists set up cultural enterprises with local communities in which to operate, and which offered cultural agency and capacity building for the local community. In other words, the DCMI team is not here to replicate or to address the success of such success stories elsewhere. 	The team is aware that in the DC metro area, the success of a project like the one described above depends on many factors, including the skill of the curator, the agency or institution selecting sites, the willingness of the local community to invest in creating a cultural district and the cultural districts themselves, and the people with skills to carry out the creative projects identified in the local master plan. In fact, the DCMI team has its work cut out for it, since the city is a different place from the suburbs. Nevertheless, the team is committed to seeing that its cultural district projects are carried out with gusto and to supporting those cultural initiatives that it can carry out with gusto as well</text>

In the past, the Museum team has delivered cultural campaigns such as at MOCAD, Arrival, MoMA and the MFA in the city.

In the current platform, the Museum team provides the curatorial interventions, while the local artists, curators, and community organisers provide the rest. In this case, the community is the artist(s) and the local community organisers are the organisers(s). 	In this model, the Local has become the (potential) Transnational; it is the site of the action, but it is also the site of the sitting of the (potential) Assembly of Global Community Artists and Trappers. The Museum and the research institute form a single unit, and the local representative of the Museum is an important player in this. He is a specialist in his field, with a particular interest in the history and archaeology of the city, and has developed a local knowledge that can be used to engage with the wider issues of the city.</text>

The Museum team may consider forming their own cultural organisation, or exploring the opportunities of city-wide, citizen-based art, to address a specific need. 	In the longer term, the Museum team would like to explore the possibilities of a citizen-funded biennial, such as Conrad Smith’s The Essential Binoculars (2012), with a focus on the optical system of the eye, and the role of optics in colour vision.

And alleys are the core of the city, because they hold the entire social, cultural and economic system in place.</text>

It is the stage of the festival, but it is also the stage of the biennial, and, as the name suggests, a stage of the festival. The 1871 Paris Biennale is a classic example of a biennale that achieved this kind of global cultural impact through a local curatorial agenda. The biennale was a local project that sought to establish a global reputation for the city by establishing a permanent permanent cultural commission for the city. The biennale itself was a local project that sought to establish a global reputation for the city through documentation of the historical district, its projects and exhibitions. The biennale’s global impact came about as a consequence of its being able to document the district’s remarkable rapid growth and urbanisation during the decade between 1890 and 1947, and the district’s subsequent conversion into a major art district. During this same decade, the biennale also happened to be capturing the city’s cultural life contemporaneously with the activities of its curators. This makes sense given the bienn</text>

Nevertheless, the biennial needs to find a way to connect with the city in some way, and this may mean finding a way to live up to the biennial’s title, but it may also mean finding a way to engage with the city in some way, and this may mean finding creative ways to de-occupy the city and making it something else, such as making it a desert, a dystopian landscape or even an uninhabitable satellite of itself. The question is what next, and who will take it? And who will keep it? The biennial may well want to find new social forms through its art sales, and it may even want to help create them through its curatorial portfolio, but it is also unclear what other kinds of capacities and what kinds of capacities</text>

It is the stage of the festival, but it is also the stage of the biennial, and this is what we can learn from it. The city is a stage of the biennial because it is the most fundamental stage of the art form, and it is through the city that the biennial takes place. Even if the city has a specific arts district or instrumental purpose, its true intention is to manifest itself through the city in a specific form (a specificity, a characteristic). So when the Biennale formally announces itself, it is often enough to know beforehand that the whole thing is going to be ‘borrowed’ from somewhere else. The extent to which this is the case is a question that the biennial itself raises. For example, the whole idea of ‘tropical convergence’ is premised on the idea that the art school would be opened up in the city, and that is precisely why the Biennale is so strongly committed to the idea of the ‘tropical crescent’.

It is the stage of the festival, but it is also the stage of the art fair, which is what we did not design, nor need design, nor should we make, nor should we teach, nor should we manage. The city is the stage of the biennial, but its place is not in the museum, not in the museum district, not in the museum hall, not in the museum building, not in the museum playground, not in the museum archive or in the museum children's zone. The city is the stage of the biennial, but it is also the stage of many other kinds of cultural exchanges and exchange, including those involving children and youth, those of a later generation and those of a later one. The city is the stage of the exchange, but it is also the stage of the biennial itself. The city is a stage of many exchanges, and a particular kind of cultural exchange is, for sure, inevitable as a cultural city such as New York continues to grow, continue to import goods and ideas from faraway places, and</text>
    <text>The disastrous 2021 Biennial, curated by Adam Himmelstein and Francis Denny, offers an ideal opportunity to re-imagine the exhibition in an accessible way. The biennial needs to provide the appropriate experience for visitors to the sites – a disquisition on the subject matter, with a brief summary summarising the main points. In doing so it also needs to set a good example for the city. The city is the stage of the biennial, but its role is one of the many kinds of site that the biennial can play.

It is the stage of the festival, but it is also the stage of the biennial, and it is the stage of the festival that is no longer the Eden of the Authorised Viewer. It is the stage of the biennial that is seduced by the promise of a site-specificity that no longer exists, and so it promotes tourism and so forth. And so it continues to do, albeit with some reservations and even some criticism. But it is clear that the promises of the biennial have not been kept, or if they have been kept, the complications and the costs have been too great. And so the biennial has moved on, perhaps always on a tangent, perhaps even changing its form as it continues to encounter the same problems, and so it remains to be seen whether the biennial can achieve the same kind of global impact on cultural capital as the Eden.In any case, the question of location that we are asking is one that is far too familiar to be applicable to present-day urban environments. We tend to think of</text>

    biennial as a self-learning system is a possibility. In the meantime, the biennial’s relationship with the city is a complex one. The city represents a large part of the biennial’s revenue, and a large part of the biennial’s creative potential. A city is a source of inspiration, a place to begin, broaden, and develop the biennial’s activities. It provides the infrastructure for the biennial to exist, to have its projects flourish and its cultural assets to be shared. The city holds the key to unlocking the biennial’s potential.  A city serves as a base for developing a new cultural practice within the biennial. This may involve the creation of a cultural tourism agency, the promotion of a biennial’s local impact, and the negotiation of a biennial’s market share. The city represents a great deal of the potential revenue stream of a biennial, but it also carries with it a great deal of the cultural costs.

The city represents a great deal of the potential revenue stream of a biennial, but it also carries with it a great deal of the cultural costs. For this reason, cities play a critical role in a cultural economy. They hold the key to unlocking biennials’ potential.  The cultural geography of a city shapes the cityscape, rules of engagement, and the possibilities for cultural exchange. While the city may be a source of inspiration and a place of encounter, its cultural geography also shapes, confers, and constrains cultural exchange. Without the social and political conditions necessary to foster cultural exchange, a biennial would not be able to establish and maintain its positions on the cultural map, and consequently, to inhabit them effectively).  The political geography of the biennial has recently come into focus. The increasing number of biennials, their numerous visitor counts, and the increasing number of museums that they support is a direct effect of their increasing numbers and the accessibility of information technologies. In a city, the biennial becomes an information monopoly. It is now commonplace for a visitor to walk to any museum or library in the city,</text>

The city represents a great deal of the potential revenue stream of a biennial, but it also carries with it a great deal of the cultural costs. If the city is not respected, its cultural resources will be systematically appropriated and a market economy will take over. If a biennial is not a global phenomenon, but rather an event that is committed to particular localities, then it is more difficult to define a cultural impact.  A cultural impact may be defined as the ‘perceived significance of a cultural resource, exhibition, performance, or project in the local of a particular biennial’ in the popular media, books, videos, blogs, and other public venues within a city.’ Cultural resources may be defined broadly, but they are particularly important in a city such as New York, where issues of poverty, homelessness, and housing are deeply felt. For this reason, the Biennial is undertaking a massive project of documentation and archiving related to the Central Park South project – a project that will take years to complete and will involve the collaboration of many disciplines.  A key element of the project is the archiving of the thousands</text>

This may involve the creation of a cultural tourism agency, the promotion of a biennial’s local impact, and the negotiation of a biennial’s market share. The city represents a great deal of the potential revenue stream of a biennial, but it also carries with it a great deal of the cultural costs. The cultural costs would include cultural tourism, the recruitment of artists and the like, compliance with local laws, cultural coercion, and of course, the acquisition and management of cultural assets. The negotiation of these costs and their impact would need to take place in tandem with the development of a local tourism and cultural policy, since the city is the basis for the negotiation between the biennial and the tourism industry.  An overview of the economic, social, and urban dimensions of cultural production in Toronto would do much to bring together the disparate stakeholders in the coming cultural revolution in Canada.  The biennial would not just introduce itself and its visitors to the city’s cultural scene, but would also exert a great deal of influence within the city’s cultural landscape. It would present the city’s cultural resources in a more extensive way than the local art world could, and perhaps even become a force for civic engagement and progressive change within the city’s cultural landscape.

The city represents a great deal of the potential revenue stream of a biennial, but it also carries with it a great deal of the cultural costs. A cultural capital is an essential component of any cultural activity. A cultural capital should be managed with extreme caution, but it should also be able to support the cultural activities that are integral to any cultural mission. A core mission of the biennial should be maintained at all costs, and any change in this is likely to lead to conflict. The mission of the cultural tourism agency should be to immerse itself in the local culture, and all the associated economic, social and urban changes that can be induced in the local population through a cultural tourism agency.  A new economic form for the biennial might be developed in part by linking the cultural tourism agency to the local community. The cooperative’s mandate might be to encourage the sharing of and the fostering of of of local knowledge through cultural exchange, and in part to provide culturally responsive affordable travel for visiting artists and curators. In this model, the cultural tourism agency would provide the curatorial resources, while the cooperative’s role would be</text>

The cultural envoy would lead a cultural tour company that would book cultural-tourism-type experiences against the backdrop of a biennial. The cultural tour companies would develop cultural-impact strategies against the backdrop of a biennial.  A biennial may consider developing localised or regionalised projects in order to increase the visibility of its projects, or it may develop globally scalable cultural initiatives that address a city’s cultural resources. The latter is desirable for a number of reasons. First, a biennial’s impact could be spread far and wide. Second, the impact could be maximised. Third, the social costs of cultural tourism could be reduced. Finally, the biennial could leverage its global reach to create jobs and generate investment for related infrastructure projects.

The city represents a great deal of the potential revenue stream of a biennial, but it also carries with it a great deal of the cultural costs. The city represents a large cultural draw for artists and curators alike, and the biennial’s global reach suggests that the city is an essential location for the biennial to operate.  A city council can, however, negate or augment this centrality by crafting a biennial’s profile, highlighting its essential characteristics, and thereby influencing its location and destiny.  As an example, the profile of the 2014 Venice Biennale is a global survey of contemporary art in a worldwide comparison.  In my view, the key to understanding the significance of a city is its biennalisation. I.e. the ability to continuously introduce new, challenging and interesting elements into the conventionally understood city; to not be confined within its confines. In the case of Venice, this means continuously, methodically developing cultural resources within the biennale’s premises; and to maximise the potential of each of these, to the extent that these are integrated into the biennale</text>

The city represents a great deal of the potential for a cultural tourism agency to emerge through the biennial. The cultural terrain in and around the city is changing all the time, and the biennial must adapt to meet the changing needs and desires of its visitors. A cultural tourism agency could make cultural-specific suggestions to the biennial, such as what activities are appropriate for certain occasions, and how cultural resources are distributed among the biennial’s activities. A biennial could encourage the participation of local artists through cultural tourism programs, and offer a place for local creatives to work alongside artists from other cities and other regions.  A biennial could also develop a local arts and culture consulting business through the employment of artists, local youths, or any group with a skill set that can be used to make cultural products.  A biennial could even offer financial incentives to attract artists from other cities to work on projects in its own city.  The possibilities for cultural tourism are truly unlimited. The</text>

The city represents a great deal of the potential revenue stream of a biennial, but it also carries with it a great deal of the cultural costs. A cultural capital constitutes a city with a significant cultural sector, and its creation opens new ways of viewing the city. The creation of a cultural sector is a task for city governments, cultural commissions, and tourism promotion agencies. It is not easy to define a cultural sector, nor is it easy to broker a cultural sector. But the three agencies that emerged from the biennial’s early years, the World Art Biennale Commission (2009–11), Museo do Portugal (2012–2015), and the American cultural promotion agency Triennale America (2014–17), helped to define the biennial. Their work, and that of other artists and curators, continues to this day.The biennial has a history of seeking to understand itself and the world through the images it presents, and of making visible that world through art.

A cultural tourism agency could establish a relationship with a local municipality to establish cultural tourism priorities, and the city would contract with the biennial to establish cultural tourism services. Local artists and cultural groups could establish collaborative ventures with other employers to offer cultural experiences outside the context of the biennial.  A new type of cultural tourism agency could establish a cultural tourism armada, conducting cultural cruises around the world, often in cooperation with local municipalities, in an attempt to draw in tourists and build local support for the biennial.

Art’s contemporary form,  	Postmodernism, is closely related to this new world order of ever more elaborate and pervasive image-processing and image-hosting technologies. It is a form of art whose creators anticipate and participate in this new economy of images. Art today is produced in settings where there are few or no artists or art institutions. It is art that is produced by and for a global audience of people whose work is consumed by countless other people on a massive scale. Art today is produced through the media of social media and is received not only by the people who see it but also by people who might read it.

Art today is produced in environments where numerous other artists, students, teachers and other artists are also actively engaged in their work. Art’s immediacy and global character make it an ideal medium for the transmission and reception of ideas. Art today is produced in contexts where many other artworks are also produced, and are often exhibited, and are often read and thought-provoking statements about contemporary art’s place in the world.  Art’s immediacy and global character mean that it is possible to describe many of the works in the modern world, and to find work that addresses a variety of different topics. This is true even if these subjects are artists, who tend to produce works with very specific social uses, such as advertising or children’s television programmes. It is also true for artworks created for museums and historic sites, such as the   	Postcards from the Gezi Park Protests, which came out of historical social contexts and involved a diverse range of participants.  In the Gezi Park incident, which became national in character and political use, the city government resorted to military force to quell popular uprisings, using</text>

Art today is produced in environments where numerous other artists, students, teachers and other artists are also actively engaged in their work. Art’s immediacy and global character make it an ideal medium for capturing this ever-more complex reality. Art is produced, writes Susanne Kølbæk Iversen, in the ‘contemporary social situation necessitates that an artist should be able to leave her or his place in time and space’.[8] Where art has always been a by-product of a given society and situation, the new social situation demands that we care less about what we consider a creator and more only about the person who comes to be created.  Art today is produced on a global market place that is ever more extensively globalised, interconnected and mediated.  Art today is likely to be produced in many places in many ways, in and through the modern world. Nevertheless, the art of any place will necessarily be influenced by factors there, and art made in that place may be influenced by aspects of art made elsewhere. Art made in London will almost certainly be art made in Bangkok, and vice versa. Art made in New York</text>

Art today is produced in environments where numerous other artists, students, teachers and other artists are also actively engaged in their work. Art’s immediacy and global character make it a more potent tool than it was in the old empires.  Art’s globalising nature also makes it more susceptible to the art market, which is increasingly populated by people with a wide range of varied cultural backgrounds and lifestyles.  Art’s contemporary character makes it more difficult to establish a consistent relationship with a curator or a museum, since the diverse interests and practices of art today have concentrated in certain geographic locations or particular cities. Nevertheless, the character of contemporary art will likely remain virtually unchanged over the course of its history, since the art market is expected to respond to the character of the cultural environment that is produced by and in contact with contemporary art today. The character of contemporary art will likely be similarly unchanged over the course of the century, since the biennale will continue to produce artists who have a global reach and an indeterminate number, but it will be much harder to identify them on a global basis. Art’s globalised character will likely become increasingly important</text>

Art today is produced in environments where numerous other artists, students, teachers and other artists are also actively engaged in their work. Art’s immediacy and global character make it a less engrained part of the cultural landscape, and a more accessible one at that.  The other factor contributing to the increased global accessibility of contemporary art is the fact that most of what we would consider contemporary art is made by and for a wealthy elite. As we shall see, this elite is making ever more vigorous efforts to expand its own cultural reach. As a result, we can infer that a higher social status is required for a work to be considered contemporary. In the current period of social unrest, class struggle, and geopolitical rivalry, this social element is at a premium. In these circumstances, the contemporary art market is likely to intensify in the future, since the transient and ever present conflicts between different social classes will become ever more important.  The contemporary art market today is dominated by a small elite of curators, artists and art collectors, whose motives are largely commercial. Their collections typically contain a work from a given artist or a specific artist’s entire career, with varying amounts</text>

Art’s immediacy and global character make it a prime subject of this media culture.   One might argue, however, that the contemporary art produced in such settings is also likely to be products of a different time and place.  Such artists may have adopted techniques and professions different from the professions of their present age, and may have engaged new audiences or targeted groups, but they may also have incorporated elements of their practices into contemporary forms of art, whether ‘classic’ forms of art (like ancient art), or ‘new’ forms of art (like social media).

Art has a power beyond that limit. Its immediacy and global character make it a ‘very specific kind of power’, and it holds that potential limit in its grasp. As noted artist and theorist, Henri Lefebvre (1879–1971), put it: ‘Art has no future but the future of its own kind’.2 Though his words may ring true to the present, we can ask, as David Harvey does in his discussion of the contemporary use of objects in contemporary society, what kind of future can objects bring? Harvey considers a number of possible futures for the future built upon the present – including the possibilities of new forms of racialised or gender divided humanity on a massive scale, or of a future where people in urban areas actually live together in harmony.3 It is feared that a world</text>

Such a project, by highlighting particular artistic talents or outstanding achievements, might well yield new ways of organising culture, producing collective memories and adapting contemporary art to the new world order.  The art of the new world order is likely to be more aesthetic, more ‘articulated’ and more ephemeral. The contemporary art of the new world order is likely to be more ephemeral too, as we shall see.  The contemporary art of the new world order is likely to be influenced by globalised capitalist worlds, which demand increasingly elaborate visual systems and elaborate artefacts of various kinds. Art is expected to play a greater role in the production of these worlds, since its image is often what provides the initial link between subject and object. Art today is produced in environments where numerous other artists, students, teachers and other artists are also actively engaged in their work. Art’s immediacy and global character make it a probable candidate for such a visual system.  Art’s place today, then, is in ‘the present’, and its new media of being constantly (growing) in motion.  Art today is produced in ‘the present’, and its new media of being constantly in motion includes photography. Artworks of art with social impacts, such as the new museums and galleries created in response to the overproduction and excess of contemporary art, are likely to be produced in ‘the gallery culture’ reaction. The gallery culture is a type of modernity considered to have peaked, in terms of both quantity and quality, around the year 2000. Contemporary art today is produced in settings that are both transient and transient. It is produced, for instance, in the transient condition of social media, which stimulates and depends on our digitally mediated images.

Art today is produced in environments where numerous other artists, students, teachers and other artists are also actively engaged in their work. Art’s immediacy and global character make it ideal for this new media of communication paradigm. But this comes at a price, since ‘Art today is produced by a changing of the status of artists’ work from the vantage point of a multitude of viewers in an ever-expanding social media landscape where other artists’ works are constantly at risk of being repurposed by a media and communications elite bent on defending the modern, defending capitalism and defending its hegemony over the global information highway’. The social and cultural changes that are part of this increasingly globalised world are part of what I have termed ‘the new normal’, that is to say, they do not accord with the old modern notions of a classical liberal society, but are instead marked by a global capitalist logic of value exchange. They are ‘artificial’ in that they are constantly checked by a global Thomson Reuters market, but they are also ‘commodities’ in that they serve as a means to an end: to travel</text>

Art’s immediacy and global character make it an ideal medium for engaging large audiences, and contemporary art today is produced in settings where there is a global circulation of images, images and media. Art’s immediacy and global character also make it an ideal tool for challenging established art forms and generating new art forms. Contemporary art today is often produced through the consumption of images and images on a global basis. Art’s global image-cycle demands images of enormous quantities of data, and the large data-collecting media of which we are all addicted. Art’s global image-system demands images of huge amounts of information, and the images that are produced are then actively disseminated via social media platforms. Art’s global image-cycle also requires that images circulate widely, and that they do so regularly. Art today is expected to circulate widely in order to be useful, and to be seen by a large audience. Art today is expected to do three things: firstly, to be seen by a large audience;</text>

It is this last catch-all term that suggests a potential new urban frontier. 	If we could go back to the design of our cities today, where are we going to find the energy to support a robust and visible human settlement?

The synthetic biology and computer sciences that are fuelling the game are far too familiar and too widely accessible to allow such radical changes without generating massive backlash against the existing order. It is important that we not become complacent in our quest for greater understanding, and that we not allow the terrorists to define our future. The current global economy needs to be reshaped in such a way as to permit such radical changes to take place, and soon. We need to address the precarity conditions that exist today, and work towards a future in which such conditions are no longer a problem. This can be done by creating more sustainable economic models that take into account the ever-present role that climate change will play in fundamentally transforming the planet. The mechanisation of labour will certainly play a part in this change, but it will have to be done with gusto.

The biennale must address the present and future condition. It is vital that the biennale be responsive to the needs and interests of the people who inhabit its grounds and cultures – in all its aspects. The biennale must also be able to adapt in the face of new circumstances and trends. New technologies and cultural influences are continually being invented and brought to bear on the contemporary condition. These can and should be applied across all aspects of the biennale, not just the sporting ones. For the biennale to achieve its end result, though, it is essential that it is both technologically sophisticated (i.e. capable of handling the sheer amount of data generated by the game) and culturally responsive (i.e. able to adapt to a changing climate, urbanisation and economy).

Such a project could also establish a common language between the different art goods and the different social 	wastes they represent. The emergence of such a project could, in turn, result in a re-seeding of the art market with additional social uses that are in turn much more easily accounted for than by hand-picked cultural goods.

The current economic order is largely built on the back of the information superhighway that is social media, and much of its social nuance is derived from the media landscape.

The social must be engaged if the social is to truly impact the technological. The social engagement needed to truly impact the game-changing technologies of the global economy is social engineering.

So, what can the social be when the social is ever present? The answer to this question is a complex one, but the answers can be found in the anthropological and literary works that have been assembled to date. The first step in any such project is typically the first act that is performed, and while some might argue that this is unavoidable in the face of what sociologist  	Steven Leacock refers to as the ‘natural’ness of human sociality, there is much that can and should be done to mitigate its  	damage. 	One example of how to do so is found in the magical-realist folk tale of The Seven Ages of Egypt, where the villainous Pharaoh Amun succeeds in modernising both man and beast by enacting a ritual that creates a new form of Egyptian man in the form of a monstrous, phallic horse called pharaohatreous (which translates roughly to modern man in English).

This would include enacting a universal basic income for all – a step that is undeniably desirable, but which has proven exceedingly difficult to enact in a country-wide or even a state-wide manner due to the vested economic interests fueling terrorism. 	The biennale also has an obligation to care more about the people who actually live and work in the cities where it is staged, than it does in the museums or collections that it targets. This is particularly true in the case of cities that are experiencing an art decadelong or even a municipally-based boom in tourism, but are experiencing a concurrent or even a growing population explosion. In such cases, the biennale should target the cities that are experiencing the most of this boom, rather than the cities that are experiencing the slow demise of the art decadelong. For instance, the Biennale may want to target the cities that are becoming increasingly cosmopolitan, but are unwilling to confront the cities that are becoming increasingly</text>

His work with Experience Limited has addressed the needs of citizens, localities, and publics in a multitude of settings. His recent projects for the Liverpool Biennial have explored the role of cities in the context of globalisation and the new economy. Experience Limited is a registered charity with a research agenda that focuses on the role of cities in the context of globalisation. Cities are strategically important to the development of any society because their size and shape – representing a vast array of trade routes, idealised versions of themselves, and various other forms of spatial – allow goods, people, and services to circulate throughout the globe. Cities are an essential platform for the globalisation of labour, capital, and cultural exchange that characterises the global economy. But cities are also essential for the capitalist economy because they are the locus of exchange between nations and peoples.</text>
