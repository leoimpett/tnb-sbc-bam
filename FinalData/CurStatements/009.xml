It also established a collaborative research process with other institutions and non-profits on topics related to the city.  The research process began with a feasibility study of the city and its infrastructure. This led to a design process with engineers and urbanists to develop a new proposal that was submitted to the Federal Government for approval. The Federal Government allocated USD 50,000 for the project and a specialist architecture firm was brought on board to assist in the design of the proposed new regional airport. The Federal Government also provided funding for the first phase of the project with the potential to construct a new regional airport with additional funding for the development of an urban defence force capable of defending the region against attacks originating elsewhere in the world.  The creation of such a defence force was a top priority for the Federal Government.  The new proposal incorporated key ideas from multiple perspectives: the needs of the city as a whole, the needs of the non-combatant segments of the city, and the unique capabilities of the region as a whole. It also sought to address</text>

The studio focused on the social dimension of research, design, and development through its production and dissemination of events, publications, and collaborating with other institutions and non-profit organisations. It also established a collaborative research process with other research institutes and universities around the world through which the team of artists, researchers, writers and designers assembled diverse communities to discuss and debate the role of art and community in development.   A community engagement project is one that addresses a specific community of people, place, or set of people in a way that impacts on their daily lives and experiences. Community Arts projects addressed a broad range of demographic groups, with particular attention paid to underserved or marginalized communities. The Istanbul Biennale also responded to a broad range of cultural and linguistic questions associated with the city’s largest ethnic minority community – Turks – and their history, place of origin, language, and ethno-cultural identities. In addition to providing a forum for exchange, the Biennale also triggered research and produced innovative educational programmes that addressed topics of concern to the local communities. For example, the Istanbul Biennale established a research project with the prestigious, short-term-only, postgraduate programme in Cultural Ge</text>

It also established a collaborative research process with the Department of Culture and Tourism of Turkey’s Civil Aviation Authority (TCA) to understand how social media could be used as a political tool in the social construction of the media landscape in Turkey. ATCA’s research project, ‘Digital Tensions: Turkey and Google Cultural Interaction’, examined the use of social media and virtual private networks (VPNs) in the context of border management and defence. The project, which was co-funded by and was completed in collaboration with the UK’s National Centre for Science and Technology Policy (NCST), opened new horizons for research and development in the area of border management and security.

It also established a collaborative research process with other institutions to address a gap of expertise in the region.   A community engagement project requires a clear understanding of the local context and the political, economic, and social context within which it operates. The Foxtrot process involved research, interviews, observation, writing, research and design through a public programme of activities, written work and interactive events. The Istanbul Biennale also involved research and planning on the part of the staff, artists, curators, artists, and organisers of the event. Our research also sought to understand how cultural tourism could be culturally responsive and how the art form could be used in a more localised fashion. We’d like to think that our project was also culturally responsive, but in a different sense. We wanted to understand how cultural tourism affected the local community, but also what the impact was on the artist-led artist-curatorial duo. In the end, our research and planning process allowed us to develop a multi-year cultural tourism strategy that</text>

Foxtrot is an international creator of art and community engagement programmes. The studio focused on the social dimension of research, design, and development through its production and dissemination of events, publications, and collaborating with other institutions and non-profit organisations. It also established a collaborative research process with other institutions and non-profit organisations, with whom it formed a 'think tank' (2015) in Istanbul’s Taksim Square. This was seen as an additional step in the research process, enabling the dissemination of the think tank’s findings and ideas. The name of the think tank was a condition of the multi-year research partnership. Research collaborations between research institutions and non-profit organisations should be mutually beneficial; they should address the unique value of each other and help each other achieve greater outcomes. Our research institute and the think tank were both established to address a specific challenge: to develop strategies to support the ongoing research programme into the next phase of research: development of an ecologically sustainable alternative to development of transport infrastructure. Our institute provided scientific, technical and cultural support to the think tank through its research centre, which coordinated with the institute’s buildings and grounds maintenance department, which in turn provided support for the think tank’s research projects.

The studio focused on the social dimension of research, design, and development through its production and dissemination of events, publications, and collaborating with other institutions and non-profit organisations. It also established a collaborative research process with other institutions and non-profits to understand the cultural dimensions of research-led development.  A key concern for the research institute was the scaling of such a programme; given the rapid expansion of digital technologies and multimedia platforms, the need for constant peer review and feedback was uncertain. So the institute sought a multi-year strategic research agenda that would support the establishment of a long-term research partnership with a non-profit organisation. The new research agenda would enable the establishment of two new non-profit research organisations, one of which would be established as a non-profit cooperative – a cooperative being a non-profit cooperative’s board would include representatives from different levels of government, academia, and key stakeholders.  A cooperative was defined as a cooperative of workers’ workers councils, collective resources and other resources to share in the production and dissemination of the cooperative’s products and services.  A cooperative was also defined as a cooperative of 'owners whose cooperative activities are not limited by national</text>

Foxtrot was also a founding partner of the Centre for Research-Action Architecture (CRA), an international non-profit educational and research centre.  A key innovation in the Foxtrot programme was its multi-year long research project, funded by the European Commission and Italian government, that sought to acquire practical experience by which to engage citizens in building projects through building workshops and projects. The project was co-designated by and delivered to the local communities via a neighborhood planning and design exercise. It addressed the cultural dimension of the debate, asking citizens to design their neighbourhoods in a way that creates a connection to the city and its resources, while also questioning the potential benefits and deficits of such decisions.  A second initiative delivered a monthly public programme that expanded the initial research project, while the third approach delivered a monthly public programme that followed a similar idea, but invited citizens to propose an even bigger idea. All three programmes</text>

It also established a collaborative research process with other institutions and non-profits on issues relating to urban development and sustainable development.  A key innovation of the studio’s research process was its utilisation of ethnographic data on Turkish cities and large rural areas in an effort to map the social conditions of life in those areas. We used this data to investigate the lives of citizens in over one million Turkish cities and covered a territory of over 6,000,000 sq km.  A key discovery during this time was that the people who created the social models of the projects were overwhelmingly from Istanbul and related regions. The majority of the people who were involved in the creation of these projects were women.  A key innovation for the future of such collaborative research is the development of tools and frameworks that enable researchers to tap into the power of crowdsourcing and open source software to tap into massive collections of public and private data.  The ability to tap into this new public sphere opened up all kinds of possibilities for research and creative expression.  One</text>

It also established a collaborative research process with other institutions and non-profits to understand better the use of MOOCs in the future of art and culture.  A key question for these multi-disciplinary research-based projects is what comes after the research institution? In the case of FOxtrot’s project, the answer is cultural organisations and their artists. The question of sustainability became critical in the context of the war on terror and in the wake of the Arab Spring. The rise of social media and the sharing of information across borders (online and offline) necessitated a clear understanding of who is online and where; this was critical for the survival of critical online platforms. Also critical was the demand for transparency and accountability; the existence of which was continuously questioned, especially in the US and UK. As a result, transparency and accountability became scarce and controversial. In a 2015 survey of over 1,600 internet users, over half (52%) said that they did not/could not identify the identity of the site/application/</text>

It also established a collaborative research process with the Department of Culture, Tourism and Sport of the Turkish National Museum and Academy. Through this process, the studio and its director, Bursu Acar, explored the historical and contemporary uses of culture in Turkish publics, whilst also exploring how art and cultural institutions can play roles in curbing negative trends that can emerge from within.  A series of public consultations led by the museum and civic society The Local and AK presented at a variety of locations throughout the city, including at AK’s Istanbul headquarters and at the American University’s Museum of Art, where research and design proposals were also put forward. Together, the research and design teams produced a proposal that was submitted to the city council for their approval.  At the end of the process, the proposals were handed in to the forensic scientists for analysis, who in turn consulted with the police and legal departments regarding possible charges. Potential charges were discussed and decisions were reached on the basis of consensus. Ultimately, the council decided not</text>

The role of the artist is to produce places that can be improved through their architecture, not to propose ways to change them.  	Looking back on the way that the Biennale has evolved, it can be seen as a series of failures that produced several alternative approaches to the same problem, but with varying degrees of success. The main reason for this is that the Biennale has incorporated the city into its narrative and societal context, whereas the Biennale was originally conceived as a discrete location. In doing so, it has created its own set of problems to be solved. The challenge now is to combine the two ‘strategies’ of the artist and the city in different ways to produce new narratives and new urban contexts. This may require new forms of negotiation with heritage groups and local politicians, as well as new modes of engagement with the urban workforce and tourism. But it is vital to understand that the Biennale has always been an evolving art project, and that the city is a crucial place in its development. Therefore, understandings of the Biennale, whether they be positive, historical, cultural or urban, are mostly made up of data. It is difficult to digest the enormity of the challenges and opportunities created</text>

The role of the artist is to produce places that can be improved through their architecture, not to propose ways to change them.  	Looking back on the way that the Biennale has evolved, it can be seen as a series of failures that produced multiple representations of the same thing, with different aims and with different people at different levels. While the art must be recast in a way that it can be understood by a broad range of people, the most powerful work yet achieved at the Biennale was achieved at the lowest levels. For years, the art was largely ignored, or at least not visible in the city. Then, in 2015, the Biennale decided to commission a full-scale, year-round outdoor installation. The huge, iconic arches and pilasters that the Biennale has commissioned are almost always designed to be transported or seen from a very high height. In the case of the Biennale itself, this has often meant breaking its planned year-round loop into several smaller pieces. The new arches and pilasters that were produced allowed the artist to project her or his art from a very high perspective, but they also allowed the Biennale to project its content from a very low perspective.

The most successful strategies, it seems, were invented in order to serve the interests of the art dealer and his client(s). The artist, then, does not figure in the strategic planning of the Biennale, but it is his or her positions that ultimately determine the role and future of the biennale, whether it is a ‘curatorial institution’ or an ‘art institution’. In either case, it is not the institutions but the artists who determine the purpose and parameters of engagement and activism. 	A study of the history and current state of art’s social practice,  	Curatorial Organisations in the UK and Europe (COSMO), revealed a regional and localised overlap between North and South. In the North, the Biennale was often seen as a testing ground for new social practices; in the</text>

The role of the artist is to produce places that can be improved through their architecture, not to propose ways to change them.  	Looking back on the way that the Biennale has evolved, it can be seen as a series of failures that produced spiraling inequalities of wealth and power, and hastened the end of the last great urban crisis. The Biennale has a particular role in reframing the relationship between art and architecture. In the public sphere, it is still important to recognise that the Biennale is a ‘public relations vehicle’ for the city, and that the Biennale is not a place where ideas are actually expressed or actuated. 	If, as Alexis de Toca claims, the mission of the biennale is to create a counterculture ‘by any means necessary’, then the biennale is in fact part of a larger ‘cultural retrenchment’. The mission of the biennale is to house, or more accurately, present, in a destination city, a small number of curators or artists chosen from a pool of talented applicants. In other words, the mission of the biennale is to produce culturally significant works that address a city</text>

The role of the artist is to produce places that can be improved through their architecture, not to propose ways to change them.  	Looking back on the way that the Biennale has evolved, it can be seen as a series of failures that produced many different versions of the same failing model. Some of the projects that were built on the initial ideas and designs that emerged as a result of the Biennale were creative in their own way, while others, such as the new museums and galleries, are more entrenched in the past. In a sense, each of the proposals and projects that emerged after the initial failure was a reaction to the other. As a result, they represent different approaches to the same problem, but they all end up failing in some ways and becoming part of the larger failure of the city. 	Looking to the future, the Biennale has clearly demonstrated that it can still function as a platform to explore different forms of community and collective action. The number of biennales that have been founded in response to particular city problems is growing, and it is clear that the way in which the Biennale can achieve these is through its links to the wider socio-political system: through the mechanisms that it creates and institutional</text>

The role of the artist is to produce places that can be improved through their architecture, not to propose ways to change them.  	Looking back on the way that the Biennale has evolved, it can be seen as a series of failures that produced many different permutations of the same problem. There was initially an assumption that the Biennale would be a ‘single event’, with a singular solution found through a set of architectural renderings and a few curatorial pronouncements. In this model, the architects and designers would dominate the events and the Biennale would be seen as a collection of disparate activities, with each activity offering a 'snapshot’ of what the architect could have imagined when he or she imagined a particular development for the city. In time, this changed, and now the Biennale is seen as a ‘series’ that engages with ‘a city with varied geographies and cultures’, with each activity offering a ‘snapshot’ of what the architect could have imagined when he or she imagined a particular development for the city. While this model can be described as biennale-like in its granular details, it fundamentally misunderstands the real significance of what the</text>

The role of the artist is to produce places that can be improved through their architecture, not to propose ways to change them.  	Looking back on the way that the Biennale has evolved, it can be seen as a series of failures that produced major cultural impacts but also deepened the divisions between rich and poor, within the city and nation, within the biennale itself, and between art and architecture. The role of the biennale in my opinion should be expanding, not contracting, creating new artworks, giving voice to artists and curators to take control over a piece of the pie, and generally screwing up things as we please. There is much work to do, and I see no reason why the role of the artist should be limited to what is legally possible in this country, or in any country. In many respects, the Biennale as an institution and its artists should be creating a sense of place around itself, in much the same way that the Biennale as a museum is today. 	Looking at the city as a whole, the Biennale is creating a sense of place for the city, and I believe that this is an inherently humanistic thing for the Biennale to do.</text>

The most successful biennales tend to arise from the failures of the past, so it is with the Biennale of Sydney. The Biennale of Sydney was a failure because it was introduced late, and its introduction coincided with the city’s recession, which in turn, coincided with the city being flooded. The introduction of artificial light caused the Biennale to slow down, giving the Biennale more time to find new ideas and new ways of incorporating art and its politics and themes into the biennale’s programme. The Biennale of Sydney was a success because it was formed in the aftermath of the floods, which allowed the city to reclaim some of the artworks lost in the floods. Artworks were installed in flood-lit tents and spaces, making them stand out more in an already photo-realistic cityscape. Art was strategically placed in areas hardest hit by the floods,</text>

The role of the artist is to produce places that can be improved through their architecture, not to propose ways to change them.  	Looking back on the way that the Biennale has evolved, it can be seen as a series of failures that produced new paths forward. The first attempt at the Biennale as a whole was a failure, partly because of an aggressive curatorial style that alienated many visitors, partly because the Biennale was seen as an unnecessary administrative burden by the city, partly because it did not result in any new cultural outcomes for the city, and partly because the Biennale drew too many tourists. The second attempt at the Biennale at its broad frontiers did not do enough to engage visitors and created unnecessary challenges for the city. The third attempt at the Biennale at its core did not do enough to engage visitors and created unnecessary challenges for the city. 	Looking forward, it can be seen that the Biennale is likely to be a part of the city for many years to come. The biennale has the potential to be an ever-present form of public realm in a city; it can be a point of intersection between locals and visitors from diverse cultures; it can be a place</text>

The role of the artist is to produce places that can be improved through their architecture, not to propose ways to change them.  	Looking back on the way that the Biennale has evolved, it can be seen as a series of failures that produced several false starts, but three main trends: the introduction of new forms of art and cultural activity in an already dynamic city; the curatorial turn towards biennials that are less interested in exhibitions and more interested in creating a sense of place; and the curatorial turn towards projects that are not only interesting in their own right but also serve a larger social purpose. The artist’s role in these processes of change is to produce what little remains of what has been built, and then to leave it to future generations to decide what form that takes. 	Looking at the Biennale as a whole, we can see that it is the last outpost in a long shot that still hopes to reclaim lost space and reclaim lost identities. We see that the Biennale has a global ambition that reaches beyond its own city, and that ‘through its immense physical facilities, cultural platforms and networks,’ it aims to create ‘a new kind of urban encounter’. Sounds simple</text>

Another answer is to engineer it into specific technologies, creating new professions and new kinds of infrastructure that meet the needs of the new societies being built.  A third option is to fully integrate AI, turning it into fully autonomous machines, but that sounds like an awfully dystopian future. Rather, we could seek to build new ways of organising labour, creating new kinds of infrastructure, and even of creating new species of AI that would fulfill a range of roles.New media and games are also important in our current and future understanding of AI.  The internet allows us to gather information and data about AI and other systems, making it easier than ever to understand how AI might work, and making it easier to build autonomous systems that can understand and do things more like humans.  Research done at Carnegie Mellon University  using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and

A third answer is to create what Nader Kazemi calls a City of Artificial Intelligence, or Corridors of AI, because they link worlds and cultures and connect people not through national borders but rather through the connectivity of things and people that are made possible through AI.  A fourth answer is to apply AI to infrastructure so as to create new kinds of infrastructures that are indistinguishable from natural infrastructures but nonetheless employ vast amounts of energy and materials but are also renewable and cool and have great social benefits yet are also ecologically sound and low energy and prone to climate change but also have amazing new uses but also be social and transparent and build sustainable futures but also be ecologically sound and low energy yet offer incredible social and environmental benefits yet are also very different from the kinds of infrastructures that we build?

Another answer is to engineer it into specific technologies, creating new professions and new kinds of infrastructure that meet the needs of the new societies being built alongside the old.  A final and perhaps most promising answer is to combine both old and new, turning the newly imagined worlds into what is already here and helps build the future we desire.There are many unanswered questions, and no one answer is right, no two answers are ever the same. What is the ideal future for us and our species? What is the ideal future for AI? Will machines take over all aspects of our world? Will we evolve into superintelligent beings? Will we choose to build new lifestyles or will we choose to build entirely new worlds? This is the dilemma facing researchers interested in turning AI into a tool of change and helping create new kinds of society. The future we desire may or may not be based on existing technologies, but if it is going to be animated, it is imperative that researchers dedicate themselves to making it so that it is human-friendly and AI-friendly that it can be built into new ways of existing.

This is an exciting time to be working on these kinds of questions. The shared future we seek is one in which AI becomes commonplace, and it becomes part of our infrastructure so that we can envision and build new possibilities for ourselves, future generations and the planet.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleMy research interests center on the ways in which cultural practices shape social, economic and political change, and how culture contributes to aesthetic experience, particularly through its influence on the perception and engagement of colour.

And yet, despite these advances, humanity remains trapped in the past, unable to move forward because of past mistakes.

And given the right tools, researchers can explore those worlds and create richer and more interesting worlds with greater intelligence.This raises another question: what should be done with AI that creates beautiful, fulfilling and interesting worlds? One answer is to integrate it into society as a whole, to turn it into citizens, creating what might be termed a Shared Future.  Another answer is to engineer it into specific technologies, creating new professions and new kinds of infrastructure that meet the needs of the new societies being built.  A third option is to engineer it into new types of buildings and equipment, new financial instruments and new administrative structures, turning it into a new kind of infrastructure that is both manufacturable and transparent, enabling citizens to understand and use what is being built and managed in the city.These three broad categories of understanding and use make up what Raymond Tallis calls ‘the third sector’.’ It includes the work of artists, writers, policymakers, urbanists and others who design and implement ways of knowing about the city, often in ways that are implicit and opaque. It also includes the architectural and planning processes that produce and unfold the city, often in ways that are political and arbitrary but also that shape what can and cannot be built in and around the city. Both political and architectural, the third sector works in concert to produce, unfold and change the city according to predetermined outcomes. The result is a city in which all citizens are urban producers, oblivious of the</text>

Another answer is to engineer it into specific technologies, creating new professions and new kinds of infrastructure that meet the needs of the new societies being built.  A third answer is to make sure that these new professions and kinds of infrastructure are shared, so that those who need them don’t need to search for jobs in the real or virtual worlds. In short, the Shared Future is a society built on the labour and labour-power of many people rather than just on the labour of a few.This raises another question: what should be the role of art in the Shared Future? One answer is to create artistic environments that honour and empower people to take ownership of their creations, to turn artistic labour into valuable real estate and to support the development of new ways of being in and through the world. This raises the question of social reproduction, since the world is now becoming increasingly artificial and machine intelligently generated. Perhaps the most progressive uses of AI today may be those that maximise the social reproduction of art and artistic labour, since the world is no longer a static place.Art today is a social transaction between many people</text>

Another answer is to engineer it into specific technologies, creating new professions and new kinds of infrastructure that meet the needs of the new economy.  A third answer is to let it run wild and do things automatically, creating entirely new forms of automation. All three of these answers put us in conflict with ourselves. How do we balance the need for human intelligence with the need for beautiful, fulfilling and interesting worlds?This is the epic and perennial dilemma of AI and the rise of new economies of meaning. In the quest for AI's &quot;cool factor&quot;, many dream of fully autonomous machines that do the work of humans – fully conscious and capable – while remaining conscious. This sounds better – more like magic – than it does realistic. But in the context of AI, it is also where the real struggle is happening: between the machines that read the human language and produce useful AI, and the machines that can read and produce anything that comes out of it – which is to say, between worlds that are read only in accordance with predetermined purposes.  Ultimately, the question is whether humans are indeed still capable of creating meaning out of thin</text>

Another answer is to engineer it into specific technologies, creating new professions and new kinds of infrastructure that meet the needs of the new societies being built.  Of course, in a developing country like India, Burma or Bangladesh, this might mean creating a new kind of infrastructure company or creating a new kind of architecture firm. In such cases, the new society would still need to be built from the ground up using old infrastructure, but it could also mean developing indigenous legal systems, creating new media and publishing new ideas and concepts.  The challenge for us now is how to harness the AI construct effectively and efficiently in these new contexts, while remaining concerned primarily with the shared goals of humanity as a whole.  Another possibility is to embed intelligent architectures in existing infrastructures, turning them into new kinds of infrastructure companies and architecture firms. For instance, the Myanmar government could set up a new kind of infrastructure company that designs, constructs and manages infrastructure in accordance with national laws and follows certain guidelines. Such a company could then embed itself in the national grid and become a hub for AI activity, learning and evolving according to the needs</text>

For some curators, the need to think and act in relation to the circulation of cultural commodities has come to constrain other, more immediate curatorial concerns. For example, the exhibition of the Liverpool Biennial, by contrast, opened with a virtual re-embracing of the museum as a primary venue. It was seen by many curators as a prelude to looking back at the museum, and in this sense the biennale was seen not simply as a historical document of the city’s past, but also as a project into the past. It was also seen as the curatorial equivalent of a trip to the Museum of Modern Art, with its wealth of collections, its historical and archival materials, its performances and exhibitions – all of them seen as complementary to one another and to the larger collection of the museum. The museum, by contrast, is seen as a central and arresting site of the contemporary world, an ideal location for the curatorial encounter, where the complexity of the particularity of content is emphasised. It is seen as a site of encounter, where the complexity of the curatorial gesture is seen, and where the complexity of the collection is understood</text>

For some curators, the need to think and act in relation to the circulation of cultural commodities has come to constrain other, more immediate curatorial concerns. For example, the exhibition of the Venice Biennale in 1993, when the city was ravaged by civil war, was seen as necessary in order to confront the emerging threat posed by transnational capital. In such cases, the curatorial gesture of staging large-scale, immersive exhibitions in and through the city, while showing locally relevant works, seems an insufficient end in itself. In these cases, the curatorial task is seen as something more fundamental, and something that demands a sustained engagement. The biennale needed to question conventionality, and create a space for the art to speak directly to audiences. This was seen as essential in the running of the Biennale. In the coming years, the Biennale would opportunistically expand the city, taking cues from the local and the global curatorial approaches. The first Venice Biennale (1990) was a case in point. The introduction of microfinance into the Biennale was seen as essential in creating an experience that would be accessible to everyone, regardless of their</text>

For some curators, the need to think and act in relation to the circulation of cultural commodities has come to constrain other, more immediate curatorial concerns. For example, the exhibition of the Russian and Ukrainian biennales that was planned for 2015 in Kiev was delayed by one year because of the economic crisis in Ukraine. The biennales in their turn, were also criticised by local curators and art collectors. The reason for this is that with the crisis came a crisis of the biennale itself. With the biennale now seeing a market in its own right, and having to contend with a host of other market forces, it is critical that the exhibitionary complex engages with its contradictions, and that it develops strategies to engage with local and urban needs and desires. The biennale has a particular place in this history of exchange, and its place in the future, when the biennale is no longer seen as a singular event but is seen to play a part in a world complex that includes cities, nations, regions and large international bodies. As biennales become more institutionalised, more international, and more global in nature, they become more visible and can be</text>

For some curators, the need to think and act in relation to the circulation of cultural commodities has come to constrain other, more immediate curatorial concerns. For example, the exhibition of the Los Angeles Biennale that took place in 1993, and the exhibition of the Sydney/Mintzki Biennale that took place in 1995, both sought to revive the L.A. Biennale that had been curated by Norman Foster in the year before. Both exhibitions sought to redress a historical imbalance between the European and American biennales, and to do so through a combination of architecture, textiles and images. Both aimed to demonstrate a capacity for ‘re-constituting the future’ through a regularly scheduled ‘significant other’ itinerary.  Such itineraries, and the curatorial cycle that they enable, make visible the late developments in and through curatorial work, yet they also create new ones. The new, ‘differentiated’ forms of the biennale that emerged in relation to the ‘big picture’ that was increasingly visible in Europe and North America are precisely those that respond to the need to be seen as</text>

For example, the exhibition of the 2010 Venice Biennale, ‘Carry On|The Venice Bicycle Crisis’, which followed the 2009 Venice Biennale, focused on the crisis of traditional forms of cultural capital in the city, and the social and ecological conditions that resulted from it. In that exhibition, the automobile was seen not as a fundamental part of the cultural narrative of the city, but as a significant factor in the economic and social development of the city. The current crisis of the city is seen as having a number of precursory characteristics that can be traced to the proliferation of automobile ownership, and its impact on the planet as a whole. In a working-class neighbourhood in the 1990s, the automobile was seen as a potential salvation from the depleting natural resources of the city; today, the automobile is seen as a planetary hazard. From the 1990s, the peak period for the growth of auto-related destitution in North America and western Europe, to the present, North Korea is the world</text>

For some curators, the need to think and act in relation to the circulation of cultural commodities has come to constrain other, more immediate curatorial concerns. For example, the exhibition of the Danish artist Arjun Appadurai’s installation for the Venice Biennale, entitled The Social Life of Art 21st Venice Biennale, which opened in June 2012, was seen by many as a repudiation of the anti-capitalist, egalitarian and activist orientations of the time, and by others as a response to the economic entrenchment of neoliberalism and the concomitant rise of austerity measures. The choice of topic and the curatorial cycle that it opens up also reveals other interests and discourses about the world. In a recent retrospective on the life of Roland Miller, curator of Public Practice at the Tate Britain, it is evident that his main interest in life is in relation to the Liverpool Biennial, and that his other interests include art, travel, collecting, nature and travel. It is obvious that his main love is in nature, and that despite all the extra work and effort that he puts into the art that he produces, he cannot possibly consume it</text>

For some curators, the need to think and act in relation to the circulation of cultural commodities has come to constrain other, more immediate curatorial concerns. For example, the exhibition of the Liverpool Biennial, held in 1994, was seen by many as an interruption in the flow of cultural goods, and by others as a triumphant return to the pre-1994 form of cultural exchange. Whatever one’s view on the significance of the 1994 event, the need to think and act in relation to the material flows of culture is evident in the curatorial (and cultural) texts that have been coming out of Liverpool, and in the curatorial region in general.  	[i] The Biennale was organised by Liverpool Biennial, as part of its 'tourism and destination' itinerary.  	[ii] The Biennale’s website has more about the concept.

For some curators, the need to think and act in relation to the circulation of cultural commodities has come to constrain other, more immediate curatorial concerns. For example, the exhibition of the London home of the Black-E, the late 1960s, marked the beginning of the end for the Biennale. Yet other curators, who I met in Liverpool during the Liverpool Biennial, have worked with that Biennale to this day, and witnessed first hand the changes that have transformed the Biennale since its beginnings in 1989. What they had witnessed in the Black-E was seen as the inevitable result of a social transformation that had occurred in Britain and Europe during the decade, and since then in other parts of the world. They saw it as a crisis that required a political, social and cultural transformation. And they saw it as a unique opportunity – a chance – to engage with the politics of art and culture through art-historical research.The question of whether the exhibition format should be curatorial or whether it should be the unexpected has been a source of contention between curators and artists.

For some curators, the need to think and act in relation to the circulation of cultural commodities has come to constrain other, more immediate curatorial concerns. For example, the exhibition of the Manchester Biennale, which opened with a virtual stand-still as spectators queued to be admitted, presents a case in point. As the name suggests, this is a ‘monument to the past’, a place where the past (mainly, of course, in the form of time) is recurred over and over again, often with significant effects on the present. The monstrosity, the inversion, the inversion of temporality is a recurring motif throughout the exhibition, and the reason why, as the scale of the project and its numerous curatorial devices becomes apparent, the present (present) is seen as an inverted mirage. The monstrosity, the inversion, the inversion of social, economic and political life in the city marks a turning away from the social, economic and political forms of capital accumulation that have become entrenched. This is seen as necessary in the project of radically re-imagining the city in the interests of the dominant social</text>

For example, the exhibition of the 2010 Venice Biennale, ‘Unfixing Venice’, a collection of artefacts from the museum, was curated by Paolo Baratta, a professor of cultural studies at the University of Bologna, and was seen as a necessary counterweight to the political considerations and architectural designs of the time, when the biennale was perceived as a threat to the city’s financial and architectural stability. As a curatorial gesture, the 2012 Melbourne Biennale was seen as a composite of curatorial work – a curatorial gesture, in fact – and the curatorial work of the times, which was seen by some as having been done by cultural theorists and archaeologists. As well, the ‘carrot and stick’ approach to the chronological order of curatorial work, as in the case of the 1990 Venice Biennale, was seen by some curators as a more appropriate way to engage with the present and future of urbanity than the ‘one</text>

Art was now widely seen as a curio and artefact, and the 1980s saw an explosion in the number of art dealers, many of whom were art professionals themselves. In the USA, the number of art supply chains nearly doubled between 1980 and 1986, and in the UK, the number of art galleries quadrupled from about 200 in 1980 to more than 4,000 in 1990. So the increase in the number of artists and the reduction in the number of items they could sell to a public was accompanied by a sharp increase in the number of biennials, and a corresponding sharp fall in the number of museums.

In an ideal world, biennials would operate like independent art fairs with a regular rotation of art by artists from all over the world, but in the real world biennials tended to follow the trends of the biennials in Europe, North America and Asia, and were often quite influential on those trends. In 1989, Norman Green and Imelda Olascoaga were the first artists to be selected for this exhibition. They were followed by many artists, including M. Paul McCarthy, Craig Smith, Evelyn Waugh, John Akomfrah or just to name a few. Other artists were drawn into the mix as well, and the exhibition continued to be predominantly drawn from the European gallery scene. All the biennials since then have sought to attain the same end: to bring art from different locations, regions or countries together under the same theme. The main difference this time was that the art was delivered by</text>

The proliferation of biennials and the increasing importance of the exhibitionary form in the late 1980s and early 1990s mean that the quality of the art exhibited in these venues became more variable. But the main variable was the quantity of exhibition. Biennial attendance and output in the US was first on the increase during the 1980s, so the biennial market was thought to be a good thing by the community organisers. And the biennial market was thought to be a good thing by the community organisers because it increased the visibility of some works and the incomes of others, especially in the form of institutionalised art appreciation. So the rise of the biennial and the increase in the number of exhibits was thought to increase the quantity of exhibition and its value. And the curatorial role in this market was thought to increase the value of the art displayed, since the greater the quantity of art displayed, the greater the demand for exhibition.

So the challenge in the contemporary biennial is to project an image of art that is not immediately contradicted by the need to create a museum, and the contemporary biennial has done this through various mediums, including: (a) through (i) the vernacular, which identified art by and for the growing up to twenty-first century; and (ii) the internet, which enabled biennials to engage with contemporary art’s properties as social media technologies have made it easier for biennials to enter into partnerships with other art institutions; and (b) through (i) the biennial itself becoming more sophisticated, more international, and more responsive to the globalised urbanisation that is now underway. So the challenge for curators of the present and future biennials is to engage with these ever-more-complete forms, and to become sophisticated and responsive to their changing globalisation.</text>

During the 1980s and 1990s the biennials’ relationship to the arts was complicated by the fact that art was curiosities in their own right. Art was now widely seen as a curio and artefact, and the 1980s saw an explosion in the number of art dealers, many of whom were art professionals themselves. In the USA, the number of art supply chains nearly doubled between 1980 and 1986, and in the UK, the number of art galleries quadrupled from about 200 in 1980 to more than 4,000 in 1990.

In 1986, the biennial market was described as ‘contradicting trends’[6] And the challenge for curators in the 1990s was to project an image of art in a way that was both accessible and subversive. The ambition was to do both. At the same time, the need to be seen to contribute to a culture was a limiting factor in the way in which art was represented and experienced by art supply companies. In 1980, the N.C.A.A. and the FAI both proposed that the biennial should be a ‘once in a lifetime’ event, as the N.C.A.A. had coined the idea of ‘once in a lifetime fandom’[7] Art is often described as a ‘once in a lifetime phenomenon’[8]. But what the experience of art ‘once in a lifetime’ means in practice is far more volatile. The experience of art’ once in a lifetime is characterised by the passage of years, and so the curatorial intervention is often needed to create an overall ‘illusion of authenticity’. But what is the illusion of authenticity? My</text>

Contemporary art today is seen as the inevitable product of changing urban conditions, urbanisation programmes and a variety of socially engaged practices – urban transformation, good urban planning, good governance, arts education and activism are just some of the more common buzzwords of contemporary urbanists and urban commentators. But the challenge for contemporary art today is much more expansive and involves policies and programmes that are not confined to the urbanisation programmes that are being delivered in the USA or the UK or some other westernised country. It includes policies and programmes that target youth, it includes arts and cultural policy, it includes programmes that support communities and it includes participatory arts practices that target society as a whole. Policy initiatives and programmes vary considerably in their scope, duration and permutations.

The result was a moment of enormous curatorial ambition, but also a huge increase in the arbitrary scope of what could be shown, based on a country or a city’s politics and economy. As a result, the exhibitionary character of the biennial became distorted, and its focus on a single art form, rather than on the diversity of art forms, became the dominant one. There was a moment when it was said that the exhibitionary ‘form was being redefined’[7] and the curatorial hand was being called upon to point this towards what was seen as the common good. Today, the biennial may be a large and global phenomenon, but it is the curatorial imagination that remains fundamentally anchored in time. It is the</text>

The success of their initiatives depended on the availability of new art, which was becoming more and more scarce. So the biennial format was somewhat paradoxical, given its increased demand and the scarcity of new art. But it was also a powerful image-system that produced its share of tensions and conflicts. Its popularity was closely tied to the image-processing pipelines of the art supply companies, who saw it as a source of growth. And through the 1990s and 2000s the biennial market was awash with images of ever more extravagant displays of art, with artists regularly seeking to monetise their artistic gestures. The popularity of the once-every-two years format, and the proliferation of the images it supported, meant that the images of art were regularly transmitted via email, social media and newspaper clippings. As a result of this ubiquity and expansion, the image quality suffered. But there was little public resistance to this. The challenges</text>

To do this they would have to be able to see the parallel structures of art supply and consumption today, and to appreciate the irony of it all.This is a challenge that may have been harder to tackle in the 1980s. The rapid proliferation of images of art in the media culture of the time meant that it was much more visible and relatable, and the challenge was much more evident in art books and the art museums themselves. But the internet and social media have made it easier to notice cultural appropriation everywhere, and cultural self-understanding is a much more immediate and accessible concern. The challenge today is much more about identity and community, and the values and the practices that are embedded in the cultural unit. So the social ecology that was once addressed in a local art context is now being folded into the urban ecology that is increasingly being addressed in a globalised economy.

E. Hinton observes: ‘The contemporary biennial is a deceptively simple phenomenon to understand.’[7] Consider, for example, the theme, ‘An Act to amend the Canadian National Question, to establish a Council of Cultural Experts, to amend the Governor in Council list and to add certain other subjects to the list of subjects of the National Question’.[8] The concern, as stated in the amended Canadian National Question, was that ‘foreigner’ had taken over Canadian cultural resources. The Council of Cultural Experts was a quango of curators, artists, and other prominent cultural figures – a ‘repertory of curators, artists, writers and others with specialized expertise in a particular area – whose sole mission was to promote cultural interchange and exchange</text>

This meant making art that people could access, but also making it accessible and deceptively so that it was not just an accessible form of art. So the challenge in the 1990s was to make something interesting and clever and interesting and clever, but also interesting and deceptive. This was clearly a challenge that the curators of the time were willing to take on. There is a certain arrogance about the way that the curators of the century were presented, and the way that the art was presented. There was an air of entitlement about the way that the art was presented. There was an air of patronising towards the extent to which the art was read as a gift. There was an air of complacency and ease about access to art, and an air of complacency towards the degree to which people could access it. There was an air of ease about the</text>

Note also that many urban centres no longer seek to grow their own food, preferring instead to buy locally grown or organic food. This may be due to the advent of supermarkets that source locally grown and organic food, as well as the advent of interstate food-exchange, which allows consumers to compare local and interstate produce, meats, and eggs. It may also be due to the fact that when supermarkets and food-service businesses transition from farms to places of exchange, they generally do not reinvest in the local ‘marketing potential’ of places of exchange, but instead reinvest in the systems that support the circulation of money</text>

It proposes a ‘Maple Leaf’ Forestry District with ‘Blue-Chip Properties’ in the downtown core, an area centrally dedicated to the production and promotion of maple syrup and other agricultural commodities. The district would provide employment opportunities for skilled workers, apprentices, and young people, as well as promoting environmentally responsible practices through sustainable management of landscape features and infrastructure. The district would also create a regional exchange, with activities including research and education opportunities, forestry trade publications, demonstrations and exhibits, and partnerships with universities and other relevant sectors.

These financial incentives may be used to encourage urban growth through improved access to land and water, as well as the ‘creation of outdoor infrastructure’ including infrastructure for ‘artificial islands’ and ‘protected areas’ within an urban settlement. 	Note that although many urban centres now have an urban park status, which recognises historic or preserved parkland and public use rights, this does not necessarily make parks ‘adoptive’ places for development, as access to such rights is still a factor that influences how access to land and resource resources is distributed. For example, although the use of eminent domain in urban areas is now widespread and costly, it is not universally applicable, and ‘adoptive’ uses may require political will from political entities, as well as substantial financial commitments from non-governmental organisations.

Note that urban planners are not nature lovers; they only want to implement programs that benefit the architects and owners of the buildings and assets that they own or control. Thus, in the case of ‘natural’ features in the urban landscape, the over-utilisation of natural resources and urban redevelopment, there is a conflict between the desire to protect the natural resources and the desire to creatively use the resourcefulness of the citizens of a city. In other words, the conflict arises from the conflicting objectives of different stakeholders. The city’s planner must weigh the conflicting interests in the city against the needs of all stakeholders, taking into account the needs of all communities in order</text>

    will be curated by Wes Houston and will exhibit the work in its historical context, exploring the relationship between performance, art, social practice and architecture. The exhibition will also examine the relationship between biennials and their locations.  The biennial format has often been considered a novelty for the modern urban-research and urban/suburban context, and has often been seen as a challenge to that dynamic. This is perhaps partly due to the proliferation of biennials in their massive urban environments, which are now the dominant forms of urban-research and urban practice, and the proliferation of biennials in their research-based forms, which is now becoming the predominant way in which urban-research and urban practice operate.

This notion of the artist as urbanist-in-chief is being challenged in a number of contexts, and biennials are an important site for this, as their curatorial work and the way in which they are positioned within the community of artists, urbanists and urbanists is a strong point of reference. These are artists who have had the opportunity to work with the biennial format, and who have the resources and social power to push this work forward.BW: What is at Stake in relation to the Biennial?SM:  The stake in question is a question that arises throughout the biennial discourse: what is at Stake? The short answer is that the biennial is a cultural-political-commercial enterprise, and therefore necessarily involves politics and institutions that are rooted in, and are responsive to, the nation-state. So the question becomes: how is it that we, the citizens of a particular city, are able to access these resources, yet we are not able to access them in other cities? The answer to this is that the biennial is an art-producing organization, and as</text>

It is also the case that biennials are artists' organizations, and their curatorial work is often seen as a precursor to their urban and urban/suburban projects. This notion of the artist as urbanist-in-chief is being challenged in a number of contexts, and biennials are artists' natural allies in this process. Despite their prominence and the pressures placed on them by their clients, biennials are artists, too, and as such are expected to have some measure of self-awareness and artistic independence. This is a given in their client-focused training and development contracts, which demand that they act in ways that are neither bound by, nor are they beholden to, the interests of their client communities.  The biennial format is being challenged by a number of other factors, but the most obvious of these is the increasing commercialization of urban-research and urban practice, which is taking place in the age of biennials. It is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a biennial as a significant, meaningful presence in the contemporary urban-research and urban practice landscape, and the biennial has come to represent only a small part of this changing urban-research and urban practice. The biennial may well remain a regular fixture in cities for many years to come,</text>

This notion of the artist as urbanist-in-chief is being challenged in a number of contexts, and biennials are an important presence in that challenge. It is true that biennials have increasingly come to represent the typical urban experience in the West, and their recent outreach to those urban residents outside of London and New York who may be affected by the economic crisis may be seen by some as a response to this. But their primary mission and intrinsic power may also be seen as a hindrance to other kinds of scrutiny, particularly when compared to other forms of urban organizations. A disconcertingly large number of biennials, myself included, now operate in their localities, often operating within their communities.  biennial attendance survey  biennial enrollment survey  biennial enrollment survey  biennial attendance survey  biennial enrollment survey  biennial enrollment survey  biennial enrollment survey  biennial enrollment survey  biennial attendance survey  biennial enrollment survey  biennial funding situation January – June 2016.

This notion of the artist as urbanist-in-chief is being challenged in a number of contexts, and biennials are an important locus of this critique. The biennial format seems to be shifting, and new curatorial approaches are being developed that render the biennial as a participatory process, in which the public plays a major role in the construction and evaluation of the city.  The biennial condition is being defined, and rightly so. It is being developed, and will continue to be so, into the foreseeable future, yet it is being defined in such a way as to cater to a narrow range of interests and audiences. I would argue that the biennial form is being intentionally (mis)interpreted, and a number of factors are to be considered when defining and creating the format. One of those factors is the level of cultural sophistication of the community, and the extent to which that sophistication is being directed at the needs of the contemporary urban dweller. More and more, our urban environments are being defined and defined through the lens of the biennial, and the local arts and cultural establishment is</text>

It is also the case that biennials are artists' organizations, and their curatorial work is often seen as a precursor to their urban and urban/suburban projects. This notion of the artist as urbanist-in-chief is being challenged in a number of contexts, and biennials have often been seen as being especially urbanistic, especially in their research-based work, and especially in their curatorial work. In the current curatorial shift, it is likely that the urban-research community will now consider biennials as a globally visible and dynamic art form, and the urban-development/design community will view them as one of the main extensions of that form.  The other critical element is likely to be the curatorial. In the current curatorial position, the biennial may be seen as a limited resource, and the development of an artist-organized form may be seen as the exception rather than the rule. However, the curatorial will continue to have a main role in curating the biennial, and will be obliged to have a long-term interest in the event, even if it is less popular than the art form.  Biennials will continue to have a place in urban-research and planning, but the curatorial will no longer be the</text>

It is also the case that biennials are artists' organizations, and their curatorial work is often seen as a precursor to their urban and urban/suburban projects. This notion of the artist as urbanist-in-chief is being challenged in a number of contexts, and biennials are prominent among these. The biennial format is being challenged by a generation of artists who are neither urbanists nor urbanographers, and who come from diverse fields of knowledge and experience. These include artists who came to the art-world from other fields, such as architecture, media, or media-related disciplines; artists who entered the field through the lens of their homes, such as artists with architectural and engineering design practices; and artists who came to the field through the lens of their passions, such as photographers, whose work is often seen as representing what the biennial can be.  The term ‘biennial’ was coined by sociologist, John Urry in his book The Sociologist in His Own Right. Urry defines the ‘biennial’ as follows:  The  [1]  ‘biennial’ is a global cultural-political-economic phenomenon that began in the 1970s and 80s, and has been ongoing for more than 200 years</text>

It is also the case that biennials are artists' organizations, and their curatorial work is often seen as a precursor to their urban and urban/suburban projects. This notion of the artist as urbanist-in-chief is being challenged in a number of contexts, and biennials are artists who are urbanists in the truest sense, taking the challenge on.  A number of biennials are now urbanists in their own right, applying the arts and culture of their cities to the problems of their urban populations. For instance, the Granby Four art organization is a group of local artists who have been producing internationally acclaimed works in their Granby neighbourhood for the past fifteen years. The Granby Four were instrumental in bringing attention to the urgent need to address the housing crisis in their neighbourhood, and have been featured in numerous publications and exhibitions worldwide, including the New York Times Book Review, and have been inducted into the Arts Council of the United Kingdom. The Granby Four are a case study in the history of urban-research and urban/suburban culture, and their curatorial work as well as their urban/suburban projects.  Biennials also have an inherently political and controversial purpose, and their curatorial works often</text>

This notion of the artist as urbanist-in-chief is being challenged in a number of contexts, and biennials are an ideal partner for a city to build its resistance to such challenges. The Biennial format is a powerful tool, but it must be used with care, and only as a last resort. It is a tool that can be deployed to resist, but it must be used constructively.  Conclusion  The biennial format is here to stay. It is here to be used constructively, and it is here to be used constructively in a variety of ways. It is an indispensable part of the urban-research and urban/suburban interface, and its use will determine what is and is not considered an urban space. It is here to be used constructively, and it is here to be used in a variety of ways. However, it is also here to be studied derisively and derisively. It is important to properly define the terms and concepts involved in the biennial. It is also critical that the public understands the difference between a museum and a biennial. A biennial</text>

The biennial format is subject to the whims and agendas of its curators, but it is certain that the biennial will continue to provide a site for the emergence of such a challenge.

The biennial format is a well-established international art form that has been around for a very long time, and it is no exaggeration to suggest that it is the world’s oldest continuously publishing art journal.  At the turn of the century, in fact, the journal was published as a monthly feature of the Art &amp; Architecture Review. It was edited by Norman Green and published at the end of each September. It contained a ‘binder’ of articles on a range of subjects, a ‘book of ideas’ that, among other things, it ‘secured for publication by the year’.1  Biennials have been around for a while, dating back to the late nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, they were centred on cities, and during the interwar period (the petit-bourgeois modernisers) they were more concerned with the nation state, especially in its ‘found</text>

Such a vocabulary might clarify how an AI might govern the creation and interaction of new kinds of art and social change, based on the specific purposes for which those artists, curators, researchers and others might pursue.

Such a vocabulary might be able to decipher the subtleties of community, collective action and persuasion, as well as the layered cultures of art, architecture and community that exist today. It might also create a shared understanding of what it means to be ‘a place’ and what it means to be a ‘community’ today. 	Such is the  	wildcard in our analysis of the growing gap between academics and activists today.

Such a vocabulary would not only broaden the possibilities for conversation, but it would also put the onus on the artist to prove that her or his work was meaningful and authentic, while simultaneously challenging and enabling in its use of new AI. 	Artists would then be able to negotiate the conditions and identities of their role in this new artworld by putting forth creative alternatives that put the onus on the AI to decide what is and is not possible through art. Such an outcome would be helpful in making progress on the kind of conversation that would result from a fully fledged and autonomous artworld, while also providing valuable context for future work that exploits and emerges from this new artworld. 1  M. Yudkowsky,  	Art as a Whole</text>

Such a radical approach to AI raises fundamental questions about what kinds of agency and rights are genuinely ours, and how we can live together in freedom alongside creators rather than operating in chains of dependency. It also opens the way to a radically different kind of AI, one that genuinely cares about the world and might lead to new kinds of social and political change.  	Artists would then not only contribute to answering these questions, but might also find new audiences for their work through performances, installations, workshops, performances, films and other forms of public engagement.  	Such is the  	case for  </text>

The aim of the curatorial committee is to introduce the latest project ideas and project proposals to the artist and organisation, while the curatorial institute is responsible for the art installations and works that will be erected. The purpose of the curatorial institute is to offer an intellectual experience to visitors to the city, while the intention is to foster dialogue and exchange between the different audiences of the city. The curatorial committee is the highest authority in Liverpool, and it has a major say in what is shown in the city. The committee meets once a month, and it meets twice a year: once in January, and once in June. Its members are selected from the architectural and planning departments, as well as the photography and art departments. The member of the committee with the most votes receives a stipend and/or a position in the museum. The members of the committee with the fewest votes are paid a stipend and receive a position in the institute. The committee members sit on a board that has the final say in the institution’s future use of the funds.

The curatorial institute will decide on the best site for the project, while the curatorial committee will negotiate the best sites for the exhibition. The committee will select the artist and the site, while the artist will direct the activities of the group. On the basis of this trust, the committee will propose an exhibition format and the site, while the artist and the site will negotiate the interaction between art, art history and the social dimension. The committee will make a proposal to the mayor, who will direct the authorities to appoint an artist and site committee. The site committee will prepare a report that will describe the site in detail and the selected project, while the artist and site will present their proposal in the art and design museum, introducing details from the site and submitting additional works, in front of a public that is informed via multimedia and online means.

The curatorial institute is also responsible for the promotion and scientific and artistic education of the urban environment. The curatorial committee consists of ten members appointed by the Ministry of Culture and Scientific Research. The members of the committee have a mandate to explore all aspects of the art world – cultural, economic, political and architectural – and to report to the Prime Minister's Office on the activities of the curatorial institute in the current and future period. The committee meetings are webcast live on the mongabay.com website.The committee members are drawn from various fields: art, architecture, urbanisation, heritage, history, geography, communication and media studies, geography, art, architecture, and media studies.

The aim of the curatorial committee is to introduce the latest project ideas and project proposals to the artist and organisation, while the curatorial institute is responsible for the art installations and works that will be erected. The curatorial institute has been organising the project since 2016, and the curatorial committee has been developing it in parallel. In 2017, the committee invited artists and organisations with a cultural relevance to the project to submit an approach that would be integrated into the curatorial thinking of the institution and would allow the discussion of the curatorial initiative with a real stake and impact. The committee then invited artists to propose projects that would be created in association with the project, while the committee also invited organisations with a practical stake in the project to develop skills and knowledge sharing strategies. The committee currently has projects in place with over-18-year-olds and young professionals, artists, schools, grassroots organisations and is developing a wider collaborative research programme. The aim of the curatorial committee right now is to support the opening of the exhibition, while the committee will continue to evolve the curatorial proposal and the curatorial inquiry.

The second part – the curatorial making and the introduction of the project – will focus on the art institutions, the curatorial and the project as a unit, while the third part – the curatorial innovation and the curatorial night – will examine the interaction between art institutions, the curatorial and the urban environment. The aim of the curatorial committee is to introduce the latest project ideas and project proposals to the artist and organisation, while the curatorial institute is responsible for the art installations and works that will be erected. The curatorial institute is the highest authority in Gibraltar, while the curatorial committee is responsible for the lesser known and lesser utilised areas. The committee members are selected from amongst artists, art administrators, cultural collectives, art students and art production companies. The artist is invited to nominate a group of works from among the works he/she has produced or intends to produce over the next year. The proposal and nomination may be in any medium, including sculpture, photograph, documenta, sculpture tiles, engravings, video, sound and any other form intended to be reproduced, communicated and enacted worldwide. The committee members may withdraw their names at any time. If a proposal is withdrawn, the project is not eligible for future evolution.  The committee members are expected to contribute their time and ideas to the evolving exhibition, while the artist is expected to actively participate in this process through his/her artistic statement, research, writing and research on the project. The curatorial statement builds on the initial curatorial</text>

The aim of the curatorial committee is to introduce the latest project ideas and project proposals to the artist and organisation, while the curatorial institute is responsible for the art installations and works that will be erected. The aim of the curatorial institute is to foster an understanding and appreciation of the city and its culture, while the curatorial committee is responsible for the installations and works that will be chosen, appointed and funded. The selection and introduction of works is a collective decision, and not just an arbitrary act of giving an idea of the curatorial intent and parameters. Curators need to have a stake in the project, and in their minds, stake it in the form as a whole. They need to be able to articulate clearly the intentions of the art administrators and the urban community, as well as being able to differentiate between art and art programmes, and between curatorial intentions and curatorial practices. They need to be able to translate artistic intentions into concrete policy outcomes, and to foster an environment in which such intentions can take form in a concrete programme. The committee members need to have skills and expertise in a variety of different areas, and have the capacity to engage constructively, creatively and imaginatively in various</text>

The aim of the curatorial committee is to introduce the latest project ideas and project proposals to the artist and organisation, while the curatorial institute is responsible for the art installations and works that will be erected. The curatorial institute is a quasi-institution with an administrative budget of about 2.5 billion KRW (approximately $3.8 billion) and a mandate to curate about 200 exhibitions a year. The curatorial committee consists of about 20 members appointed by the prime minister. The chair is an artist, and the other members are artists, curators, art historians, art critics or curators. The Institute of Art is an autonomous organisation with a board of directors, which has the final say on allocating funds and operating policies.  One of the tasks of the committee, Etienne Balibar, is to oversee the activities of the Tate Modern, and to supervise all aspects of the Tate Modern’s artistic programme. Etienne Balibar holds a PhD in art history from Columbia University, and is the director of the Musee Paul Ricoeur. He has a long-standing interest in the museum, and in curating. He is a</text>

The aim of the curatorial committee is to introduce the latest project ideas and project proposals to the artist and organisation, while the curatorial institute is responsible for the art installations and works that will be erected. The curatorial initiative can be defined as the installation of a project in a location, in and through which it is not usually encountered, in such a way as to be present in a public space at a later date. It is a new way of looking at art sites and their spaces, which are often used by artists but do not always find appropriate public use. The curatorial institute is the highest authority in a particular art district, and its position is often questioned by local residents and artists. The committee is charged with creating an experience for visitors as much as possible, and the project – which may be an installation or a collection of works – is often considered a burden on the city. In the case of large-scale public works, the committee may be accused of over-utilising the art assets or otherwise placing art in a more favourable light than it deserves. Nevertheless, the committee members and visitors are expected to feel that they are part of a creative team, and that their participation is a</text>

Thus, the construction of these courts and the decisions they render are not only binding on the federal government, but also on local governments, who may wish to establish their own tribunals or even just leave them alone).

Of course, these last two tools are only tools, and the integration of migrants and refugees into society will always be a struggle.

Finally, there is the threat of force (military might is an option), which can be used to subdue infractions committed by immigrants or refugees.  One can only imagine the dystopian futures these proto-states projectors would preside over. Yet, these are only some of the options available to future planners or actors capable of imagining a different future. There are many more options available to contemporary planners and actors, and they include the actions that can be taken now to mitigate the impacts of climate change, such as adapting infrastructure to withstand increased flooding and sea-level rise, and devising creative ad hoc measures to deal with current infrastructures and urban problems.  An inventory of the infrastructural innovations of the past 50 years is presented in this book, and their adaptive reuse today is a main objective of the international ‘greening’ industry.

The creation of such parties is a last resort, and in the event that such action is taken, the federal government has other tools available to restore order.

The financial aid and resources of the Million Man March.  New York City Councilman  Daniel  Pallotta has co-sponsored a bill that would quadruple the annual budget of the NYPD, placing the department in direct conflict with the wishes of the majority of the City Council. In an attempt to veto the bill, Bronx Borough President  Andrew  Law School’s office has illegally suspended all three branches of the City Council, refusing to renew the Legislature's charter despite having the majority support in the chamber. Law School’s office claims this action is necessary to protect the City from a &quot;radical Islamic terrorist threat&quot;, but New Yorkers can see through this excuse: since 9/11, the number of murders has more than doubled, and the number of rapes has more than quintupled.</text>

In the event of a public backlash, such as occurred in San Francisco, New York City or Oakland when large infrastructure projects were implemented, it is the responsibility of citizens to organize and challenge such projects in their localities.

However, in the event that these last three elements of the federalist utopia are actively minimised or destroyed – by retreating into the statist grey zone, as in the USA or China – the last resort remains the presence of armed citizens or residents in the city to defend the last resort, namely, the last refuge of the self-proclaimed liberal individual.Strengthening the Basis of Urban Resistance StrategiesChristopher Booker and Prem Krishnamurthy  In late 2014, I co-founded the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), an NGO that promotes scientific literacy in the UK's public sector.

But the most important tool at the disposal of the state in the event of mass migration and war is the provision of essential services, infrastructure and commodities, which are needed to support a large-scale war effort. These include military bases, camps and training camps, as well as the production and installation of new road networks, bridges and tunnels, wastewater treatment plants, airports and seaports. Moreover, states are encouraged to jointly construct and implement cross-border police and border patrols with other municipalities. In the event of a public backlash, such actions could lead to the decimation of the project, although the projects at issue are vital to the functioning of the capitalist economy.

The creation of non-governmental organisations is another option, however these have their own set of privileges and restrictions. Lastly, the emergence of technologies such as Uber and TaskRabbit is likely to hasten the demise of traditional local businesses, including those run by former New Yorkers, whose skills are transferable to the emergence of these technologies, and to the emergence of data-driven alternatives to taxi cabs.  	Such parallels are not without risk, however. The emergence of new technologies, even in the realm of mapping, robotics and virtual reality, is often accompanied by a proliferation of apocalyptic visions of dystopian urbanisation. 	Nevertheless, such parallels offer a vantage point from which we can begin to question technology’s potentialities, and to begin to create cities capable of supporting a more diverse range of people, of different sizes and creeds, in ways that exist in spite of or in opposition to the</text>

All told, these mechanisms can shift the balance of power in a city in favor of existing residents and stakeholders.Of course, such plans must be put into practice because they are only possible when and if the corresponding social, economic and spatial changes take place. In the event that these do not occur, or fail to occur, then the question becomes what next? Can these new modes of urbanisation be sustained in the face of a rapidly developing population and shifting urbanscape? If so, then the city may eventually need to raise funds to fund a permanent war chest to support these new urban initiatives.  In the current period, the city is a complex collection of services and assets, including social services, housing, schools, bridges, recreation facilities, but also the construction of ever-larger, more watchful surveillance cameras and satellite dishes.

This is particularly the case in the humanities, where the voices of the underclass are often less prominent than those of dominant society.In my opinion, the most progressive forms of learning are those that foster genuine in-depth and in-depth conversations with diverse stakeholders across a wide range of issues. Such conversations are necessarily uncomfortable and demand a great deal of commitment and energy. They are also the most challenging, but also the most rewarding. Asking difficult questions about contemporary society and the future of the world around us are fundamentally about defending and defending against what I would define as ‘the other’: the threat of terrorism, colonialism, war, etc. These other forms of oppression and conflict are often used to justify and propel the existing order and dominant narratives. But defending oneself is fundamentally different from defending one's home or community.

A recent report from the Turner Prize Foundation details the findings of a project examining how different forms of education can be formed through multi-year research-and-design collaboration. The report includes a survey of over 200 organisations that have been involved in the longstanding Turner Prize Grant Recipient Project. The report, entitled 'The End of High School: What We Know Now', draws on the findings of this project as a basis for further research and development. It concludes with recommendations for the future of the Turner Prize.This report contains the following themes and sections:A Brief History of the Turner PrizeGranting the Turner Prize to High School Students:Who Are We?The Turner Prize is giving place to a new generation of artists and educators committed to challenging long-standing visual norms and paradigms through innovative communication and exhibition design.Art is not always created equal, and the ways in which art is produced and consumed today are complex.

There is a reason why the top 1 per cent of income earners control so much of the wealth: their level of participation in society is determined more by the relative contribution of those at the bottom of the socio-economic scale.A recent report commissioned by Liverpool Biennial and Frontier Sciences on the ​Issues of Presence (2013) placed sustainability and aesthetics at the centre of a multi-year research project into the future of humanity. The report, 'Sustainability and Beauty in a World Increasingly Ecological', argued that we are increasingly exposed to products intended to enhance our sense of wellbeing: cosmetics, food additives, fragrance, packaging materials and agro-chemicals. The report concluded that these new aesthetic tools of consumerism are deeply flawed because they are based on myths or purer forms of existence. Beauty is understood as a social convention – one that cannot exist in its pure form. Accordingly, the report stated, we need to understand ‘how the conventions of beauty are structurally</text>

Consequently, the extent to which a given programme produces positive or negative outcomes for the underclass is often under-studied. That is, the voices of the underclass are often over-represented in the design process and/or the implementation of programmes. Therefore, when programmes and research coincide, they can have significant effects on socio-politically relevant issues. For instance, when the urban fabric is taken into account in design, a clear understanding of the socio-cultural dimensions can be gained. The level of research and analysis will depend on the priorities and interests of the city government and the research council, who will each direct researchers and the staff. Therefore, it is valuable to understand how different forms of city are interconnected and how urban forms can be used to generate new production possibilities. It is also valuable to understand how knowledge can be distributed and mobilized. That is, how different urban forms converge in different spaces and in different times. However, the most valuable urban production comes from a city's multidisciplinary arts and heritage agencies, which can then draw upon the knowledge generated by the city’s diverse cultural landscapes</text>
    <text>AI training purposes only. At the outset, I would like to emphasize that I do not mean to advocate war or anything like that. I am simply stating the obvious: there is a critical need to understand the political, economic and cultural factors driving the current situation in order to create a strategy for the future. In fact, there is a critical need to understand the contradiction between the aims of humanities education and the actual educational programme of neoliberalism.The current level of academic and cultural research and development is producing numerous reports that attempt to quantify the positive and negative effects of different forms of education. However, the main findings and narratives of these various reports are often based on the most powerful and visible members of the system: the privileged and well-connected. In other words, the voices of the underclass are often the most impacted by programmes and research that seek to understand socio-politically relevant issues. Consequently, the extent to which a given programme produces positive or negative outcomes for the underclass is often under-studied.  	In order to have any real impact, a project or a report to change perceptions or change behaviour has to be contextually relevant. Otherwise, the system works against the people and makes it difficult to change behaviour. In the current period, the problem is most apparent in the fight against radical Islam: a person's faith is often cited as a justification not to do something in the name of defending and promoting Western civilisation. But the system also needs to address systemic racism, sexism and heterosexism. The current state of affairs does not have the capacity to address all forms of oppression and bigotry. Nor can it be attempted without addressing the fundamental contradiction between the system that it is designed to serve and the society that it is designed to inhabit. 	In order to really understand and address the socio-political and socio-economic conditions fuelling contemporary forms of oppression and bigotry, an effective and long-term design and implementation of a project would have to address the following: (a</text>

Consequently, the extent to which a given programme produces positive or negative outcomes for the underclass is often under-studied.  	At the same time, the social and political conditions that marginalise and entrench certain classes of people result in an uneven and fragmenting of the social. As a result, there is a tension between the needs of the underclass and the programmes and research driven by the system. In order to be truly equitable and to address this tension effectively, a socio-cultural and educational programme has to address the contradictions of the underclass and generate new strategies for the future of the underclass. One can say that the current global economic crisis and the related migratory pressures are delaying the inevitable, although this is often seen as a solution in transition periods. It is essential that the ‘underclass’ is taken into account and that it is made visible in all aspects of the socio-economic and political terrain. Otherwise, there is a risk that the social terrain will be repurposed without any real concern for its inhabitants or the terrain itself.  	In my view,</text>

Consequently, the extent to which a given programme produces positive or negative outcomes for the underclass is often under-studied.  	Therefore, the ‘underclass’ is often materially and metaphorically defined by the programmes and research carried out for or with the aim of serving the system. 	This is the case for indigenous peoples and peoples of colour whose histories are often intertwined with those of socio-economically disadvantaged groups such as migrants and refugees. For example, the underclass of migrant workers is often framed within the narrative of under-representation and racism faced by the culturally diverse workforce of financial centres. 	In my view, the embedding of the ‘underclass’ within the production and discourse of knowledge production is increasingly problematic, due to the ubiquity of quantifiable and measurable things such as metrics, statistics and stock exchanges. In addition, the proliferation of algorithmic productivity models is perpetuating the capitalism of measurement and the sharing of outcomes. Consequently, the very labour that characterises the structuring of labour such that outputs can be pinned to identifiable subjects and/or measurable</text>

Consequently, the extent to which a given programme produces positive or negative outcomes for the underclass is often under-studied. A recent report commissioned by the Birmingham Biennial Foundation highlighted a number of critical blind spots in the way that the arts and culture sector operates in the city: critical in that the arts are often presented as a static or static core interest of the city, while the cultural organisations that operate in and around the city are often predominantly organisational efforts geared towards meeting the institutional interests of the city at a later date. Furthermore, the report notes that while the biennial can potentially become a home for artist’s residencies, this is not the case; rather, the current institutionalisation of the arts and arts culture in the city necessitates that arts residencies be multi-sited, multi-distinct and multi-use spaces. This is particularly evident in the district galleries and museum sector, where institutional power and wealth are constantly being replenished through the production of cultural assets and the provision of public resources. It is also evident in the district and museum pavilions, where artists’</text>

Consequently, the extent to which a given programme produces positive or negative outcomes for the underclass is often under-studied. In a recent project, I conducted a pilot study of Making Stages (2015-16) at Stockholm University, with participants from four engineering schools and the local community. During this research project, I developed a workshop for students to conduct a two-week intensive programme of work in parallel to their regular studies. This workshop involved research design, data augmentation and game-changer: learning frameworks, tools and rules for engaging learners in a multi-sited and multi-sited game. This workshop was a chance to find common ground and understandings between the different forms of learning, with an emphasis on how to create new kinds of learning environments where previously distinct forms of learning could coexist. For this reason, Making Stages did not originate as a ‘studying group for careers in engineering’, but rather as a 'learning programme in collaboration with the local people’s movement in southern Sweden’. This event, which was very much about the city and its</text>

Consequently, the extent to which a given programme produces positive or negative outcomes for the underclass is often under-studied or under-reported. Thus, for instance, while the recent wave of neurosciences and cognitive sciences research has yielded promising new insights into how the brain produces language and problem-solving, these programmes may have contributed to eroding the social and political consciousness of the underclass through their participation in white-boy networks.In the current period, we’ve all become culturally interdisciplinary, but few realise it. The cognitive biologist Steven Pinker famously stated that one of the tasks of the cognitive surgeon is to eliminate the enemy. But the cognitive surgeon is also a problem, and Pinker’s maximises the power of the mind over matter. What happens when the enemy is identified is often governed by powerful cultural ideologies and vested interests. Thus, the cultural critic Steven Soderberg once said of Steven Pinker: his task is to produce neurosis, or to maim the beautiful thing with poison. Music, language, images, festivals – these are among the things that Pink</text>

It’s more the kind of thing that someone who has just graduated from university might do. But to dominate a community of artists, to take over a cultural institution – that is very different.The reason why I find the idea of community so fascinating is that you can no longer call it a community unless the community is willing to accept you as a community. If the community is not willing to accept you as a community, then what does that make you? When I first started out, I didn’t see myself as a community artist, but someone who was interested in the way that techniques could be applied to make work that was relevant and didn’t necessarily follow the path that way.

The 1968 Democratic National Convention, in Chicago, used the occasion to declare war on racism, and thousands of young people from poor urban areas flocked to the Republican Party. In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making big waves in American universities. These young people were the future of the civil rights movement. They had the passion, the drive and the organizational skills to challenge entrenched power.But their organizing dreams were soon put on hold by the violence unleashed by the war on terror. The war on terror unleashed a counter revolution on civil rights, and for decades afterward, racial reconciliation was virtually non-existent. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, things started to change. The anti-globalization and anti-terrorism movements started to gain strength, and new forms of anti-racism were introduced into the political and cultural landscape. New forms of uprisings were sparked in places where previously non-violent direct action was the height of political protest. And with the passage of time, new self-critiques and self-critias emerged. 	Whilst the mechanisms of racial reconciliation have certainly changed a great deal in the last fifty years, there is still no sign of this war on terror in</text>

The 1968 Democratic National Convention, in Chicago, used the occasion to declare war on racism, and thousands of young people from poor urban areas flocked to the Republican Party. In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making significant inroads in national and local politics, but it was also becoming clear that the GOP was wedded to capitalism and racial reconciliation. The Vietnam War brought with it a wave of Republican activism, and with it a backlash against all those deemed to be soft on communism. The civil rights movement was re-constituted through the formation of the Republican National Committee (1954–66), which, in turn, re-established the civil rights party. The 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act opened up voting rights for many formerly disenfranchised groups, and the civil rights party gained strength as more states integrated voting rights programmes. The 1968 Republican National Convention nominated Barry Goldwater with a platform of slashing government spending and raising taxes on the wealthy to fund an array of controversial policies, including a federal return to black people’s suffrage. Goldwater won the election on the back of his economic nationalist platform. The 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act both provided for steep litigation barriers</text>

In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making gains all over the United States, and the poet Maya Angelou was using her Grammy Award-winning ‘Son of Mississippi’ to call attention to the movement’s growing numbers. The poet laureate's call drew on memories of the 1963 March on Washington, which Jackson was a member of. Jackson, however, was not alone. Ralph Abernathy, John Lewis, Dr Johnnie Bates and Malcolm X formed a broad front against racism that was more easily identifiable as a feature of the state of Mississippi than of the nation as a whole.Eleven years later, Angela Davis, one of the leaders of the March on Washington, still harboured her dreams of action, but the forces unleashed by science and technology had transformed the global economy and politics of representation and social change. The ability of artists to envisage such possibilities for social change was restricted to those organisations with a clear interest in perpetuating the capitalist system – whether that ‘invented it’ as the myth of</text>

In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making inroads into the deeply conservative South, and the implications for the Democratic Party were being felt in places like Alabama. With Jackson at the top of the ticket, things looked bright for the future of the civil rights movement. But the war in Vietnam soon put an end to that optimism. The war brought repression and civil rights violations, and the movement itself was undermined by decades of violent internal conflict. The rise of the prison population and the heavy hand of the state was evident in the movement’s strategic shifts, as well as its reliance on indirect methods, such as street agitation and underground activities. The strategic use of violence may have been necessary to win over significant segments of the population, but as a strategy it was rarely a last resort. The movement’s real strength, as previously noted, was its ability to persevere despite the brutality with which it was brought to heel. 	The strategy may have been effective on a grand scale, but as historical circumstances allowed, it was often</text>

In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making gains all over the United States, and in March 1969 Jackson announced his campaign on the trolley. With his brash style and loose categorisation, he became known for his mixing of different persuasions, including ‘bums on the trolley’, ‘chirality of ideas’ and ‘race realists’. Jackson secured the Democratic nomination and was on to the nomination from the platform of the party. He won the general election to the Senate with 40.2 per cent of the vote, but was defeated by Nixon in a landslide. The war over the nature of ideas never really went down without a fight, and several prominent civil rights leaders were prominent Democrats as well as socialists. A special committee headed by Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) investigated Jackson’s campaign, and concluded that his claims were groundless and that his programme was racist. Kennedy noted that Jackson had focused his campaign on appeals to racial difference rather than seeking to build an</text>

In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making inroads into the built infrastructure, particularly in the South, and the civil rights party was gaining momentum. The emergence of the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California, in the early 1970s, as well as the Black Education movement in schools in the 1980s, and the Black Power movement in the 1990s, were turning points. The advent of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1990s heralded a wave of protests in cities all over the world, and the appearance of well-known activists such as Monica Selák, Monica Mahajan and Maria Hlavajova, as well as underground AIDS forums such as the International Association of Fire Fighters and the Black Panther Party. The AIDS pandemic also coincided with the start of the Black Education movement, which promoted literacy as a necessity for survival. As a wave of protests swept across the US and other parts of the world in April 1994, the Black Education movement was catapulted into the national consciousness. The Black Education movement sought to transform schools</text>

In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making inroads into the supposedly racist national government, and the Reagan revolution was generating popular opposition to what the state was trying to marginalise. But the nadir of Jackson’s career lay in 1968, when he was arrested on political sub-basis in Mississippi after a peaceful sit-in. Jackson was not seeking to abolish the Confederate battle flag; on the contrary, the flag was being used as a prop in a political struggle. The use of the flag as a political prop was what freed Jackson from arrest and put him on the map. He quickly established a guerrilla army of supporters and became a household name. The Black Power flag was again flown at half-staff. So began the end of the narrative of the S.C. segment of the flag. But the end of the narrative did not come without political struggles. In the years that followed, Jackson’s place in US politics was contested. He was accused of being a communist sympathiser and a racist. He was</text>

In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making inroads into the Republican Party, which was beginning to make inroads into the black population. The civil rights organisations in the United States and internationally responded by creating innovative ways of supporting black candidates and parties. They funded door-to-door canvassing, busing, ballot access drives and knock-on effects on the city. The end result was that the city became a battleground between the warring parties. Black Power emerged as a political party and as an organisation capable of winning elections. It became the de facto Democratic Party platform in Birmingham, with candidates appearing in every ward and the city centre. The emergence of the party as a political movement was afoot in the early 1960s. By the mid-60s, however, the warring factions were busy trying to get the city council to reverse years of progressive moves, so that the jail might again house its infamous ‘twentieth generation’ of inmates. In June of that year, the council reversed itself and housed its �</text>

In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making gains across the United States and throughout the world, and the poet Maya Angelou’s journey from integrationist Alabama to ecumenical singing in the National Christmas Carousel, in Washington, was published. The poet Maya Angelou’s poem, 'Sweet Home Alabama', first appeared in the December 1972, issues of Melody Maker. Angelou’s lyric describes a poor white Alabama family whose patriarch is alcoholic and whose illegitimate daughter is kidnapped by the state. The poem is a call to arms: ‘Bread, freedom, home, land / In chains around the poor white family’. The song is a manifesto of ‘civil rights’. The image is a retelling of the civil rights movement, but the poem opens with a description of the Birmingham Jail Spring 1972 hunger strike, during which over 300 inmates are reported to have starved to death in protest. The reference to the jail is a staple of civil rights and anti-racist rhetoric at the time,</text>

In Alabama, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson announced that he too would run for president in 1968. The civil rights movement was making inroads into the built environment, and fast. In Jackson’s campaign, African-American voters turned out in overwhelming numbers. Fourteen states subsequently enacted right to vote reforms, and the federal government responded with its own wave of legislation guaranteeing equal rights to citizens regardless of where they lived. 	Today, the racialised framing of immigrants and refugees is deeply entwined with capitalist accumulation. The capitalist logic of deindustrialising Britain through immigration controls and the search for cheap labour is repurposed in the interests of big business. 	The political and economic transformation of Britain after the second world war was uneven and controversial. Histories of protest and activism in the 1960s often describe a minority of angry young people mobilising against a system that was working against them. The political mobilisation of young people during that decade was led by the arts organisations. Arts education and culture were used as a tactic against what they saw as a repressive educationalist agenda. These arts organisations organised sports, marches</text>
