In 2004, the then Mayor Boris Johnson announced that the entire borough of Hounslow was going to be redeveloped for the new London Bridge commuter hub, which would include a large underground rail tunnel under the Thames and the creation of a new ‘green-field’ including the former ‘rapid transit’ venue at Waterloo Station.3 	The announcement sparked a wave of optimism about the potential of such new ‘renewable energy resources’ to address London’s intermittency and potential re-use of the once-prosperous resources of the borough. While renewable energies are certainly sources of energy that can be harnessed and utilized creatively, they fall far short of what is needed to address the intermittency and potential</text>

As the British urban historian David Hetherington has pointed out, gentrification is a myth in its own right, since creating or re-instituting new housing is difficult, if not impossible, given the dominance of financial and political interests in the city. Nevertheless, the myth of the sterile market has become an essential building block of any economic development programme in the metropolis. As Peter Osborne, an architect and urbanist, once told the City Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Housing, Development and Reform, Alan Duncan: “The myth of the ­episodic is a myth in its own right.”2 	The challenge for any programme of urban regeneration is two-fold: firstly, to expand the myth of the episodic; and secondly, to create what might be called a ‘transcendent public space’ through what might be termed ‘creative perforations’ in the built infrastructure of the city. Such spaces are said to be responsive to ‘the call of habit’, signalling to habitants that newly-acquired rights can be relied upon to sustain a particular set of uses. Such spaces have been characterised as micro-apartments or mini-apartments</text>

The mid-nineteenth-century revivalist style that was to characterize British urban architecture until the mid-twentieth century is characterised by a dramatic influx of handsome new buildings on a tide of post-WW1 de-industrial decay. As Hetherington points out, this reviveism incorporated elements of both liberal democratic and socialist urbanism, but with a socialist twist. The influence of this particular form of urbanism was to a large extent to be found in the east, in parallel with the spread of new immigrant streams. In Hetherington’s words: ‘[T]he rise of the East Londoners and the consequent fall of the West were closely tied to the growth of the socialist wave sweeping across the nation. The East Londoners had set up shop in the laundry rooms of department stores, cafés, and railway stations across the nation, and the</text>

As the British urban historian David Hetherington has pointed out, gentrification is a myth in its own right, since creating or re-instituting new housing is difficult, if not impossible, given the dominance of financial and political interests in the city. However, once housing becomes affordable to a clientele capable of supporting a rise in prices, the myth of the free market urbanity is cast aside. Its proponents take their cues from the media, which regularly narrate the exploits of creative-class urban dwellers. 	The rise of the Creative Class urban explorer David Hetherington (1887–1971) provides a paradigmatic example of a city-builder successfully projecting its retrofit technology onto an older urban landscape. Hetherington’s project was a full-scale replica of the Belfast bakery, but situated in the gentrifying eastern suburb of Palmerston, where the railway once ran alongside the Don Valley Parkway. The bakery itself was repurposed as a park for overnight visitors, while the houses it housed served as guesthouses for city dwellers during the summer.2 	Footprints of the City 	The footnotes of the 1986 book  	Footprints of the City provide a useful window into the</text>

This is particularly true in a metropolis as vast as New York, where the mythology of the city as a source of limitless possibilities for growth and wealth is the dominant political narrative. Yet as Hetherington points out, while mythmaking may have some truth to it, it is also a myth of the pitiful, the disenfranchised and the non-rich. The CPP has long since ceased to be a political tool for the interests of the wealthy and privileged; it is a project of social and economic empowerment for the city’s underclass. As Hetherington points out, in the twenty-first century, the main beneficiaries of urban growth and development are the extremely well-connected and the extremely well-connected. The non-professionals,</text>

The CCCP’s programme for cultural organising, tentatively titled ‘Creative Cents’, provided a space for artists and arts organisations to create collaborative projects with local communities. This was seen by some as an opening for ‘hard core’ housing activists to lay claim to local urban space and cause havoc, so CCCP embarked on a multi-year cultural campaign designed to reclaim the city’s spaces and destinies. The campaigns culminated in the launch of a yearly ‘Creative Cents’ campaign conference, ‘Creative Cents: Housing and Community Games in the City’, organised in CCCP’s annual conference room at the Liverpool’s Victoria and Albert Museum.3 	The</text>

Nevertheless, the myth of the empty and dystopian city persists as a dominant urban narrative, and in a number of Western European cities it is more or less a given that will be part of any redevelopment strategy going forward. Creative Periphery 	In the current period, the myth of the empty and dystopian city is the dominant urban narrative, and the urban imperative is being reinterpreted in ways that put people on bikes, cafes, park benches and in some cases, rooftops. Yet for this to happen, two conditions must be met: (1) a process of spatial and temporal complexity must be fulfilled in a sustained way, and (2) the resulting adaptation of the ‘space and its inhabitants’ must be participatory in character. If space is to play any role in the metropolis, then parks and streets have to be ecologically significant in their functioning as publics, and participatory in their design.  	In the twentieth century, space was understood as</text>

The bicycle has become increasingly important in and contributes to the production of urban energy infrastructure (EV) – a significant amount of which is devoted to the transportation of goods and raw materials by bicycle. In the period immediately following the rise of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century, the production of paved surfaces and infrastructure was shifted from the manufacturing of bricks and nails to the production of frames and components. These shifted production streams naturally, and by the twentieth century, many a working-class neighborhood would boast an expansive bicycle path that ran parallel to the wind for miles. However, in recent decades the production of new pavements, new transit infrastructure and transit oriented developments has come primarily from the trucking industry, which relies on the surplus of cargo it can reshape into pleasing surfaces and building codes that are pleasing to truck drivers. This shift in the production of infrastructure has been accompanied by an</text>

As the British urban historian David Hetherington has pointed out, gentrification is a myth in its own right, since creating or re-instituting new housing is difficult, if not impossible, given the dominance of financial and political interests in the city. However, as Hetherington shows in his book Anglophone Urbanism: The Curse of Urban Checkpoints, creating or re-instituting affordable housing is easier said than done, since the dominant forms of housing in the city are reserved primarily for a few extremely well-connected owners or firms. Moreover, Hetherington shows that even when new housing developments are proposed in the city, previous policies of subsidizing housing and pushing up the price of housing to attract developers' attention tend to delay or prevent new housing from arriving, rather than creating or fostering it. As a result, average house prices continue to rise, even as housing access and quality deteriorates. 	The myth of the empty city also has some support from within the art world, although strong countermeasures are needed. As the Granby Fourstadts political cartoonist John Lennon points out, the À l'Aigner de Paris (the Elephant) is the dominant artistic representation in Paris</text>

The Biennale board has a mandate to explore all venues for the 2018 programme, and they did that while the Biennale was still at ground-level negotiating a new contract with the city. So there was a window of opportunity for the Biennale to engage more directly with the broader city, and the city has been working very, very hard to transition from its biennale status. Seeing as how the Biennale started in Venice, it’s easy to connect the two. The Biennale board is made up of art professionals who also happen to be board members of the Biennale, and so the city is becoming a self-sustaining biennale.

In the 80s and early 90s, the arts organisations in many ways, at least, tried to mimic what was happening in the housing crisis, and they did a good job of it, but as the housing crisis unfolded and new forms of capital became more prevalent, the organisation that you joined became ever more dependent on the changes in the market that were determined by the state. In other words, it’s not just the organisation that you came to in the moment to do a job, but the new forms of organisation that were increasingly capable of providing that kind of work.&quot;The closure of HMRI in 1990 fundamentally changed how we understand how art was produced in the UK, and how the art was distributed. At the time, the shift in our notions of what ‘the art world’ meant in terms of cultural production came about because of the closure of a number of biennials that were at the centre of the artworld crisis.

There was a real conflict there between the old guard of artists and the younger generation of artists; there was a real generation gap in terms of their perceptions of art and their engagement with it. But there was also a real generational gap as to what it meant to be an artist in the 80s and beyond. Now, there’s a real sense of convergence between artists and audiences: both generations are there, and they’re engaged with art in ways that are authentic to the contemporary context. This is interesting, this whole generation of young people are now saying, ‘You know what? I’m ready to give it all I got in the 80’s; why don’t I start</text>

Because the impact on communities was so pronounced, there was a real cri de coeur about it: people were speaking about it amongst themselves as if it were a fact of contemporary art history. It was a real turn-on for young people to be able to see themselves in these images. I think that the fact that it’s still happening with the same curators, artists and commissioning agencies, even though the art has changed, is a reflection of that real sensitivity and complicity.

The thing about these small works is that they were almost entirely invisible at the time, and now they're almost completely invisible now. I don’t think it’s fair to say that the art was useless in the 80s, because there were a lot of young people who were involved, and a lot of them are involved now, but they didn’t have the social networks or the networks to see that this work was important, and they probably still don’t understand how much the arts has influenced their lives and art’s impact is still a huge part of their lives. It’s about complicity and it’s about how you enable that complicity, and it’s about providing that complicity with the resources and networks necessary to see that impact, to feel that impact, to engage that impact and to have that influence.&quot;The NMA is close to an agreement with the DLA to commission a series of new works for the north east London gallery, and is developing plans for a new generation of artists to be brought into the mix. The commissioning begins this week, and the artists’ engagement with the process will commence next month. The new works will be works that recreate some of the historical practices of their forefathers, using both current and forgotten media technologies. They will be works that enact certain cultural messages through the medium of art, but they will also be works that move away from that medium. I think the engagement will start from the artist perspective, and run for some months to come, and we will see what works best in that engagement.This is an edited extract from the talk that I gave at the Biennial conclave, 'The Art Newspaper Project:  How We Can Work Together To Make Art Online</text>

So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to sustain itself, and it has had to become something more in touch with local needs and desires. But this dynamic has also had to undergo a massive shift in order to be able to support the massive amounts of material and digital culture now produced and consumed in the city. And this process of material and digital culture coming to terms with the idea that it is no longer a static physical object in a city – a dynamic that is no longer static and static – is a process that will probably continue to be messy and chaotic, but it is also a process that will undoubtedly become more democratic and equitable. Future curators and artists will undoubtedly know and work with this dynamic in different ways, and they will need to be able to distinguish between curators who are actually trying to support the museum as an organisation and those who are just there to make a lot of money for the city.Future exhibitions could, of course, also involve a curatorial hand in supporting the material and digital culture that is produced and consumed</text>

So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to function in the new economic and social world that is being created by the biennial, and it has to do so in a way that is both responsive to the needs and the tastes of the local people. This dynamic has been quantified many times over the years, but as biennials become more and more and more internationalised, the need to evolve in a new exhibitionary complex becomes ever more apparent. At Venice, for example, the need to develop a new, more immersive and international exhibitionary venue was noted almost immediately, and this was probably due to the fact that the biennials themselves became more and more internationalised: they became more and more visible in the Italian media, and became part of the Rome publishing family. So the need to expand the museum dynamic is obvious in the biennial format, and it is even more so in the volume 1 and volume 2 that follow it. Volume 3 is due to be published this autumn, and the biennials will likely continue</text>

So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to support the exciting newness that is now evident on the city-wide map, but it has also had to adapt itself to the old habits of the museumary complex. It will not achieve this simultaneously and simultaneously, as some might imagine. On the one hand, there is the need to continuously renew the museum as a local project, in order to maintain its current form (which is itself a very local phenomenon), but also the need to constantly evolve and expand the museum as a geographically diverse project that is not limited to the city in which it is located. This latter part of the dynamic is what is often referred to as ‘the city’, but is also what is sometimes referred to as ‘the museum’. The museum building has responded to this need for spatial heterogeneity by providing a singular space for a singular purpose, such as an exhibition or a collection, but it has also emerged as a structure that can support different kinds of spatial experiences – a kind of ‘</text>

So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to support the different levels of the city. For me, the interesting dynamic has been the one that is currently being played out between the different levels of the museum complex, as different curators, artists and art historians are coming together to come up with different versions of what the museum could be. The key is that the museum is always looking out for the best interest of the community, and so there is a real convergence of interests, even though the actual curatorial approach may differ from regional to local. I have been really looking forward to seeing what projects are being proposed for the Liverpool Biennial, because it is such a broad concept and can be very powerful: bringing together artists from globally renowned museums, curators from regional and local institutions, and scholars from widely different fields. I feel like there is a potential for the regional interchange of knowledge to form a bridge to the globalised knowledge of the future, because our contemporary knowledge of the past is going to be so globalised.

So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to keep pace with the enormous infrastructural changes taking place all around the world, and in a city itself increasingly dependent on global trade.  	The dynamic of the museum as an object has been a source of much fascination to artists and curators throughout the world. Many artists, including myself, have our work exhibited at the Liverpool Biennial, which is now in its sixth edition, and many curators, including some who were involved in the creation of the Biennial itself, have their work exhibited at the next edition in New York. And now, with the tenth Istanbul Biennial, the Biennial in Istanbul and Venice, coming up in 2017, and a host of other emerging biennials around the world, we are entering a new ‘medium’, one that is both imaginative and responsive to the world around it, drawing upon the new technologies of cultural production that are reshaping not only what is seen but also what is made, experienced and made redundant. </text>

Also, during that same time the museum was often beset with crises of funding, with artists and curators having to be much more creative and flexible with what they produced and invited into the city. So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to sustain the very real possibility of museum-going. The museum today is a global phenomenon, a globalised version of the museum of nineteenth century Europe, and as a consequence exhibits from many different museums are regularly shown together in a concerted, orchestrated manner. So the museum dynamic is deeply contradictory. On the one hand, the biennial exhibits from many different cities show a converging collection of artists and curators working in concert to tell a story or engage in some kind of activity. On the other, the city-specific exhibits from different museums that clearly separate themselves as distinct exhibitions. The problem with this dichotomy is that it produces two radically different experiences of the same thing – a challenge to the idea of the museum as museum-going experience. To a visitor who comes to the museum to see a collection of works, the museum dynamic is an experience of accumulation, of going back and forth between past and future, of going back and forth between past and present, of going back and forth between</text>

So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to meet the demands of the city and, in doing so, has had to become something other than the artefact museum that it once was. This dynamic has been a feature of the museum since it was first conceived of as an evolving collection of objects that can be continually (re)arranged and changed into new forms – a collection of objects that can also change. So the museum dynamic has had to be flexible enough to accommodate a range of changes and can no longer be confined to the defined form of the museum. It is a collection of objects, in the broadest sense of the term. It contains new curatorial approaches and curatorial pronouncements, but it also has to address the challenges that these confrontations pose and are said to present to the city.  In the twenty-first century, the dynamic between the museum and the city is changing, and art’s continuous (re)occurrence is no longer the defining characteristic of the dynamic. Contemporary art is no longer seen</text>

Also, during that same time the museum was often beset with crises of funding, with artists and curators having to be much more creative and flexible with what they produced and invited into the city. So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to offer the same level of information and the same level of engagement with the city, which has involved a lot more staff and funding. I would say that the dynamic has become more institutionalised and institutionalised because the infrastructure of the museum is now so intertwined with the urban fabric that it is almost impossible to separate the museum from the city. If the museum were to be allowed to develop independently, it would present a complete and coherent picture, but at the moment of its establishment it is almost impossible to separate the two. In fact, the museum would almost naturally establish a partnership with a city council or a local authority, since the city is the foundation of the partnership. However, the city is such an overwhelming majorityally-mandated piece of infrastructure that when it is integrated into the fabric of the biennial, it becomes more of a fetishised thing than a curatorial tool. The biennial is more of a fetishised thing than a museum, and this is particularly true for the relatively new</text>

So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to meet the demands of the city and, in doing so, has had to become culturally significant in order to be taken seriously by a wider public. And, culturally significant is a word that has a lot of different senses. The word itself has different definitions depending on context, and within the context of the contemporary artworld. For me, when I hear the word ‘culturally significant’ I generally think of institutions like the Kampala Art Biennale, or the Kampala Art Museum, or the Kampala Art Gallery, or the Kampala Art Foundation, or the Kampala Art and Design Biennale, or the Kampala Contemporary Art Biennale, or the Kampala Film and Video Biennale, or the Kampala Film and Video Festival, or the Kampala Film and Video Performance Biennale.

So the museum dynamic has had to evolve in order to provide the social, cultural and practical conditions for a strong, vibrant and autonomous museum complex that is not bound up with the city.‘Art’s mission has always been to make a difference, and though it may sometimes be accompanied by a lot of theorising and theoretical work, the main emphasis of the artist has always been on the most immediate needs and concerns of the community. So even though the museum dynamic may present a new and exciting element to the exhibitionary complex, it is essential that it isn’t just a museum that happens to be very important to the community. The museum dynamic needs to evolve with it, whether that’s through engaging with the current museum dynamic through research, or creating its own dynamic through what the museum may already be doing. If the museum is to retain its mission and ethos, it’s going to need to be involved in creating a new museum complex that is both local and also participates in the larger social and cultural systems</text>

Like anything else, it starts with a premise and a desire: the larger the space, the more we inhabit it, the more we become who we really are. The more we inhabit the city, the more we inhabit its infrastructure and the more we inhabit our place in it. When we stop and think about it, the more we inhabit our own embodied rhythms. In a way, I think that a biennale can be seen as a space in which to be constantly active, and so it’s a space in which we can be open to new situations and experiences, and so forth. The issue that biennales always have is what to do with the inevitable: the legacy of colonialism, the legacy of oppression, and so forth. And so there we are: the exhibition is always going to have that aspect that concerns us, because we know that we’re always going to be in this situation</text>

Material things don’t have that kind of grounding; they are made in terms of image and sound. More importantly, once something is made in image and sound, it can be corrupted and misused. When you take an image and translate it, you create a representation of something else, you cause a representation of something else to happen. So there is a kind of a dialectic going on between work and perception. You take the image and the representation, and the work that results is what you perceive as real, even if it is not. When I made the translucent hand in the aquarium, I didn’t see it as real, but rather as a sepia-toned photo-realistic drawing of a hand that had been digitally enhanced in photoshop.

She doesn’t mean things through the things that are reductive of their essence – that is, things from the system we live under – but things that are rooted in the particular forms that they take. For instance, the root of the magic of cicadas is in our biological systems: we have a sense of what is beautiful and exciting and makes us want to do things, and we also have a root of the rootlessness and poverty of our material world. For a long time we didn’t talk about the cicadas in the context of ecological systems, but their presence and the things that follow from it are a part of what we think of as the emergent. She also emphasises that the reasons why we don’t live in ways that are guided by the world as a whole are because our present forms of organisation are based on slavery – we have no choice but to follow the flow of things in order to survive.Now</text>

You’ve got all these components that are equating to one thing and one thing only. But as an artist, you’ve got to be able to figure out how to bring them together in a way that is both functional and poetic. The root of the things is what I’ve always liked to do, and it’s something that I still think about. Sometimes it’s easy to ascribe meaning to things that are made up of parts, but sometimes that just makes the things seem more real – like when you’re dealing with living organisms. When you take the time to actually look at things, and think about what they’re saying, and how they’re saying it, and how that makes you feel, that is poetry. It’s that kind of poetry.It’s also interesting that in the context of the culture wars that were raging at the time, there was</text>

Art is an incredibly abstract discipline, and the roots of what we were trying to do, which was to bring out the cultural value in the roots, lay dormant for a while, then come back into life. As time went on, the culture came back into play, and the abstractions that we were trying to eliminate or to reduce to their natural state emerged. She suggests that this is the evolutionary trajectory of the art form: from being made using tools and procedures that cut and paste parts from different animals together, to being made using principles of symbiosis and mutual aid that emerge from the interaction of different organisms.Art is inherently provocative. The key to its power is its ability to set people off in dangerous directions. But what makes it art is something else entirely. It’s not just the things that make it art; there is a much deeper reason why artists do what they do. Something much more subtle is happening here. She talks about the primacy</text>

She captures the essence of the exhibition in a single narrative, yet she also introduces new dimensions of context and politics and forces us to confront things we never knew existed.  She uses the word ‘social justice warrior’ to describe those who oppose her agenda.   She is quick to add that she does not wish to delegitimize any group or person's right to express themselves and think and express feelings however, and that she hopes her project will prove an example of how cultural producers can coexist with those with different viewpoints.I then asked her if her project implied that people who use their artistic talents in a political struggle are also artists. She seems to misunderstand the concept. The idea is that artists’ political work does not inherently involve a political meaning. Contrast this to the context in which an exhibition is located and the audience. If the context is removed or altered in any way, the work ceases to be an art project and becomes something else entirely</text>

She replied: it’s about the social, and how we relate to them [animals in general] and to art in particular. When you get down to it, what we were trying to do was to bring out the roots of the things that are going on, and to show the roots of the things that are going on, and also things that are different and mysterious and magical.It’s an interesting way of bringing out the roots of things: not just in the way in which they’re hidden or invisible, but how they actually are. There are certain basic human needs and desires that we can all identify with. And so there was something very evocatively different going on with the animals in the Biennale – perhaps it was the subtle social commentary of the time, perhaps it was the overtly commercial nature of the art, but whatever it was, it had a fundamentally different essence than the art having at the time. And so the root of the conflict was that the art was intrinsically political in nature, whereas the Biennale was all about the social. And so the roots of the conflict continued to be a social difference, rather than an art one.Vincente Minnelli, the curator of the Venice Biennale from 1996 to 2005, has a very interesting perspective on the exhibition and its development. He describes the political nature of the exhibition as the product of</text>

In the real world, cultural production typically happens on the basis of agreements between nations (although this is rarely enforced). I asked her if she thought the historical context of the Biennale was important in understanding how things are produced and reproduced today. She replied:Yes, and I think that the way things are set up now, the way it is, in terms of the relationship between biennials and the cities that they are in, and the fact that biennials are global in their composition. But I think that there is a disconnect between what is considered the urban and the urbanisation of nature – the production of landscapes and the maintenance of landscapes – and what is considered the biennale. We don’t really know what the urban is anymore, and so the biennale is</text>

But being able to bring out the roots of what is happening is a difficult thing to do, and Kulkarni and Mehta’d have that in common: they were both working in the context of the war, and in that context, things that they saw as essential to the work they were doing were also at risk.

Art is a social process and we as artists are part of that process. Social conventions, tropes and images are all around us, but they’re also images – images of other people speaking through us. When you get down to it, what we were trying to do was to activate the animal kingdom as a metaphor for social life, and to invite the animal kingdom as a whole.She continues: it’s a great way to think about our relationship to our environment: what we can and cannot do with regards to it, and how we can and cannot interact with it. But perhaps there is a deeper level to what we are trying to do: perhaps what we are trying to do is activate the primal drives that govern our nature, and to that extent there is some intimacy to it.

It is a semi-transparent material that transmits data between the computer and the networked devices that are part of the network. The term ‘interface’ is used to describe a point where data is sent and received; a point where communication occurs. There are two main types of interface modules: peripherals and embedded systems. Peripherals are those that directly interface with the computer, while embedded systems are those that act as a bridge between the computer and the real world.[1] There are various kinds of programming languages that can be used to create interfaces: programming languages, protocols and constructors. There are also various kinds of device drivers that can be used to program the computer to do certain things.[2] For instance, the programming languages used in the internet today are made up of many different protocols that all have one thing in common: the protocol name is followed by a sequence of parameters that describe what kind of behaviour can be expected from the computer. For instance, the protocols of the internet today</text>

The term ‘interfaces’ has come to refer to a class of materials and devices that are ideally suited to meet the needs of software-defined networking (SDN) and other new ‘post-device’ situations. In other words, the interface becomes what allows software to ‘live’ after the device has died.The function of the interface today is highly nuanced and fragmented. It is often conflated with the phrase ‘communication’ and its various protocols, and its layered ‘layer’ structures with ‘transmission’ and ‘receiving’ devices. But the functions of the interface today are much more diffuse and variable: they may be classified as protocols, protocols, virtual protocols, layerips or some other synonym.

It is a semi-transparent module that enables communication between nodes in a networked computer. It is important to realise that the interface module does not directly link to any particular node in the networked computer; rather, it links to nodes on a node’s chain of command. Hence, ‘interface’ in this context refers to a chain of command that exists between nodes in a networked computer and nodes on a particular interface. This semi-transparent node-to-node interface means that communication between nodes in the interface network is not visible to software that is installed on nodes in the networked computer. Rather, software is installed on nodes in the interface network and its job is to link to nodes on the node’s chain of command.‘High-performance computing’ is a branch of computing that is advancing at a rapid clip, and high-performance computing is a node-specific application of this kind of node-centric computing.

It is a module or circuit board that encapsulates data necessary for the operation of the computer system. The interface module is often referred to as a ‘cloud’ or a ‘network’ module. It is a semi-transparent material that transmits data between computers around the world. It is made up of thousands of tiny holes arranged in concentric circles. Each hole has a different function – a switch, dial, button or anything else you might plug into to access a particular area of the interface. The idea is that the data streams between the computer and the holes – the virtual data – are routed through these different holes in a way that maximises the possibilities of data extraction. In other words, the interface allows you to access parts of the computer that are not operational but might have useful functions.In the 1980s and 1990s, the interface was often confused with a magnetic diskette or similar storage device. However, unlike contemporary hard drives, the storage on the interface is not removable or accessibly, whereas the storage on a CD/DVD is. Instead, the storage on the magnetic disk is accessed by software on the computer through commands sent over the air (comms). These commands tell the computer what to</text>

The name ‘interface’ is used to describe a point where data about the user, such as her position, is exchanged. It is a place where data about objects in the computer are recognised and data about the environment is not; where objects in the computer ‘real world’ are processed; where functions such as the application programming interface, or API, are executed; and, finally, where all the data between these different places is collected and presented (in one place or another). The interface module is a technological artifact of the 1980s, and thus deserving of its modern moniker. But its functionality and its place in the computer system are much more than that. The interface module is a source of pride and a source of shame. It is the point where the designers of the interface meet the users of the interface and the other components of the computer.

The data may be text, images, audio or video, but it is the application of algorithms to detect and categorise the objects within the material that makes the interface distinct from other types of media. For instance, the term ‘applications’ might suggest what kinds of functionality can be provided by the material, while the equally generic term ‘interface elements’ might suggest what kinds of functionality can be accessed by the users of the material. The word ‘applications’ is often used synonymously with ‘hardware’ – a usage that echoes the earlier Greek and Roman usage of the word ‘archaic flesh’ and ‘womb’ – but in the modern sense of the word, the behaviour of the components is what counts.

The name ‘interface’ is a trademark of Intel Corporation.About UsThis is the second in a three-part series on the history and future of internet, or so I thought. In Part 1, we looked at the origins of the internet and in Part 2 we look at the different forms of internet today.

It is a place where different kinds of data can be exchanged, often involving legal tender (i.e. debt obligations between parties), and it is a platform or ‘bulletin board’ that enables access to information about the world around it. In this sense, the interface is almost ‘the new city’. It transmits information about the city (locating buildings and individuals within it) in ways that are computationally cheap and also about present conditions (e.g. unrest, poverty, injustice). In this sense, ‘interfaces’ are perhaps more accurately depicted as ‘layers’ or ‘layersets’ that together form what Robert H MacDonald calls a ‘compartment of shame’.3 In my view, this combination of cheap and transparent information provides the interface with an extra ‘tidbit’ that makes it difficult</text>

Here, the computer is not only capable of doing things that could never be imagined, but also of fabricating worlds or ‘phantoms’ out of nothing in a moment's notice. The emergence of new media and apps that render the interface as a smooth surface is often cited as a precursory factor in the explosion of computerised infrastructure and societal disruption. But there are many more fundamental factors that come into play, including the proliferation of rich digital cultures, the shift towards ever more immersive digital modes of self-expression, and of course the growing importance of data capture and transmission.

Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Architecture, Graduate Center, City University of New York, September 2018. Abstract: In the context of the UTOPIA project, I propose the concept of the UTOPIA of information autonomy. This new paradigm imagines a future where information and knowledge are autonomous; where people derive meaning and value from understanding; and where power is no longer the foundation of society. I begin my proposal with an overview of the history of 'natural language processing,' and then move to a description of the UTOPIA project’s approach to governance and power.

In the larger urban centers, she examines the growing privatization of urban space and the shifting of consumer habits towards alternative, but expensive, modes of transportation. In China, she examines the consequences of a deindustrializing economy for the future of the coastline, and islands in particular. In Hong Kong, she examines the migration patterns of Chinese cruise ships and the impact that this has on the ecosystem that they inhabit. In the United Kingdom, she examines the changing face of the island as a result of the shuttering of mainland ports, and the increased use of ferries to connect to the mainland.In her recent collection, Colors of India (2015-16)Remi Aubut, explores the relationship between color and language.

In the larger urban centers, she examines the growing privatization of urban space and the displacement of populations in the peripheries. In these latter cases, she argues, there is an urgent need for cultural institutions to intervene and help the city recover. This is particularly relevant in the era of massive urbanization in the former ‘off-balance’. She examines ‘Off-Balance’ as a concept and urban-desegregation path, and how the challenge is to find the right balance between the self-repairing biological systems that constitute ‘the urban fabric’ and the regenerative potential of cultural practices. The term is derived from the Balts who live in northwestern India and China and are thought to have invented the concept. Castringius proposes an encyclopedic ‘national register’ of all forms of Indian urbanization, from manufacturing to retail, and the languages that constitute ‘the urban fabric’. She dubs this ‘The Fabric of the Indian City’ and projects that this ‘repurposing of</text>

In the larger urban centers, she examines the growing privatization of urban space and the resultant loss of control over space. In these two cities that she visits, Mumbai and São Paulo, she brings out the political and material factors that contribute to the contemporaneous emergence of the modern city and the subsequent decimation of the indigenous people who were once its dominant inhabitants.She explores the politics of language in relation to the urbanisation of the peoples of the periphery, particularly in the context of the Indian cities that are being gentrified and are now home to a multitudes of tourists and expatriates. She also reflects on the politics of migration in the contemporary urban setting in the wake of neoliberalism and the concomitant dismantling of publics, services, and unions. Lastly, she explores the politics of language in relation to the urbanisation of the peoples of the peripheries, particularly in the context of postcolonial theory and its variants.In her new book The City of Industry: Growth, Politics and the Aftermath of Postcolonialism, Castringius reflects on the political</text>

In the larger urban centers, she examines the growing privatization of urban space and the related decline of the local. In the past, architects and urbanists tended to focus on the infrastructure of the cities, particularly the public realm, as the site of the future growth of the metropolis. But Castringius’s interests are much more oriented to the inhabitants of the rural periphery of the cities. Her research often takes the form of observation and, apart from the museum, interviews. In this respect, her interest is in the quotidian. She believes that the important distinction between the city and the rural is that in the latter case, the urban is an ever present and ever-present concept. Her interest is in the invisible urbanization of the remote regions of the country, particularly in the last decade. She believes that the research that she does requires the local, the ‘rural poor’, to be part of the equation in order to be valuable and to be able to participate in the future of the city.   Her most recent project for the</text>

Drawing on his own experiences as a researcher and curator, Venema discusses the ways in which visualisation can be used to interrogate the imagined authority and purveyors of colour. He suggests that the key is ‘imagination alone – not a product of sophisticated cultural planners’ but rather of everyday activities that spontaneously generate imaginative associations and visualisations of things that are not there.’ [3] And so it happened that in 1986, the Barbican, London, with its many curatorial crafts, initiated the Barbican Alliance, a collaboration between the museum and local community of Barbican workers. The Barbican Alliance was a ‘turning point in the history of the British Museum’s relations with the local community, bringing together the museum and community for a week of intensive research and development. The alliance established a joint working group to explore ways to work together to develop a new exhibition format for the Museum of Colonial Architecture and Urban Design at the Barbican.

Drawing on his own experiences as a researcher and curator, Venema narrates the ‘contemporary knot of material and cultural resources and ideologies’ in order to draw a picture and a constellation of symbols that are recognisable across diverse cultural centers and across different levels of social organisation. His ‘chain of value chains’ is divided into three ‘levels’ and ‘levels of presentation’. ‘Material symbols’ include bags of coconuts, t-shirts, bags of flour, bags of sugar, and bags of salt. ‘Concrete representations of the social world' include the mass media of the ‘net’, ‘Facebook’ and ‘Instagram’ social media platforms, which continually remind us that we are urban and globalised and live among ‘us’ and ‘them’, but also ‘cut and dried’ text and image processing, modelling and image archiving canons such as those developed by Caleb Daniel or ‘Open</text>

He also examines the ways in which the colouring book can aid in the work of resistance. The conference took place in the spirit of the Colonial Body of Art’s centenary year. The authors report that they feel that the potential of the exhibitionary format and its materiality are oriented towards the needs of national or racialised minorities or those whose cultures are undergoing irreversible change – those who can be profitably rendered invisible or whose identities are erased. They also recognise the importance of the interlocutor, the interlocutor’s role is to create the narrative of the encounter, to create the perception of belongingness and belongingness alone. They refer to the example of the Spanish artist Diego Rivera, whose statue was placed in front of a Chinese restaurant in New York, in a deliberate act of parallel oppression. In a</text>

Drawing on the work of many other distinguished curators, including Guillermo Vitaleza, Evelyn Forget, Noel Burch, Paul Butler, Miriam Schneider, Carol Becker, Judith Collins, Michael Kimmel, and many more, Venema organises the material and the invisible assemblage into three broad categories – human remains, fragments and non-mortal remains. The human remains are given a multi-layered and multi-faceted treatment including being both representative of the deceased and representing the moment in time when they are discovered. The human remains are then presented in three-dimensional forms – figurative, historical and archival materials. The archival materials are presented in the form of figurative images – images that capture the essence of the event as it occurred – and the remains of people whose bodies have recently been pulled from the Caribbean.

He argues that the collections of the American Museum of Natural History contain a ‘contagion' of images of racial violence and subjugation that continue to be committed by and about these populations.1. Dynamics of Modern Curating (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2010). This is the article in the journal Modern Curating  that re-narrates the past three centuries of European settlement in North America and the Caribbean.

Drawing on his own experiences as a researcher and curator in the Caribbean and North Africa, Venema describes the ways in which the physical and virtual colonization of these countries continues to affect their political, economic, social and cultural histories. He also suggests that the exhibition of visual art that emerged from the convergence of these two large centres of capital today constitutes an ‘embarrassment of modernity’.2 ‘And yet it was all for naught: the treasures of modernity would soon be devoured by the forces of neoliberal globalisation’.3 This is in part a comment on Venema’s own position as a curator and critic in the West, where he has been for the past twenty-five years. He argues that the powers that be in London and New York today cannot be expected to respect the interests of the British Isles, nor to adopt the interests of ‘people of colour’, nor to represent or deliver to their peoples the ideals of modernity or a future for future generations.4 ‘</text>

Drawing on his own experiences as a researcher and curator, Venema narrates the rise of modernity in the Americas through the visual medium of photography and the colonial archives. Drawing on his own postcolonial and racialised practice, he explores the material effects of economic colonialism through the material and imaginary frameworks of racialised and imperialised communities in the Americas. He also proposes that the potential contribution of this exhibitionary form to the public realm is two-fold: (a) it can act as a catalyst for a discourse on colonialism and racialisation in the Americas, and (b) it can generate a range of cultural practices and practices that will be adapted to the specificity of the site, the multiplicity of uses, and the multiplicity of communities that are to be served.While many of the practices and ideologies mentioned by Venema do not directly relate to the site, their presentation and incorporation into the curatorial conceit of the exhibitionary form suggests a certain amount of relationship.

Drawing on his own experiences as a researcher and curator, Venema narrates the material and the invisible assemblage of the museum in his book – a narrative that draws on his own research and that he claims is the only legitimate one. Drawing on his own travels, he gathers together the experiences of several of his subjects who were either directly or indirectly impacted by the Museum of Modern Art’s collections. These subjects speak as individuals and through their stories, archaisms, and archival documents, constructively or destructively narrate the material and the invisible worlds of the museum. With archaisms, material and non-representational artefacts, the material finds its way into the contemporary and the impermanent. With archaisms, the material enters the social.Venema begins his account by describing the disorienting effects of the cocaine and heroin epidemic that swept through the Caribbean in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He cites a number of affected communities as sources of inspiration and material for his narrative, but also on his</text>

The bewildering array of characters that characterise the New Urban Interface is a mix of those who lost their houses to the process of demolition, and a further bewildering array of characters who found themselves living in converted warehouses and underground parking lots. Some of the characters in the mix are quite charming, while others are quite sinister. But the overriding sense of enfant terribleness is that of urban decay. The city is a sprawling landfill, and the character that emerges from the various stories is a caricature of the monstrous urban machine that is churning away in the background.The uncanny valley is one of the first places that comes to mind when thinking about gentrification, and it appears in many of the city’s earliest planning documents. In 1797, for instance, the New York City Council declared that it was ‘frivolous to call the city ‘miserable’, since the rich were being pulled out of the city and the poor out of ‘glorious’, ‘dismal’ condition. Instead, the city was to be ‘profaned’ by</text>

The bewildering array of characters that characterise the New Urban Interface is a mix of those who lost their houses to the process of demolition, and a mixture of those who found places in the city that they could still call home. City councils, local authorities, heritage commissions, heritage organisations… every organisation was represented, and their activities were often informed by the people who occupied the properties that they were given. And when they weren’t the people who occupied those properties but were now administrators of the city, or in the case of a local authority, the local school board, or in my case, the local council, who then had to act in the interests of the city at large. The fact that people are still often shocked when they’re shown footage of the demolition of housing blocks seems particularly strange to me, since such an activity is one that seems to have been almost entirely automated. The automated mechanism seems to me most revealing when it’s used to rebuild empty or dilapidated neighbourhoods, and while many of the people whose houses were demolished were in the business of renting property out, the machinery seems to me</text>

The bewildering array of characters that characterise the New Urban Interface is a mix of those who lost their houses to the process of demolition, and also those who found places in the city where they could ‘re-occupy’ the empty spaces. The former is sometimes called ‘taking the city’, and the latter as ‘creating a city’. In the latter, the spaces are turned into cafes, parks or playgrounds for a small or mid-sized community. In the former, they are merely ‘placeholders’ for future use. In the latter, they are actively sought after by real estate developers and financial corporations looking to make cities their ‘endemic places of the future’.  The commission’s other members included prominent urbanists and aesthete-type figures, including Walter Benjamin, Thomas Heatherwick, John Lennon, and Terry Smith. Each had their own take on the interface, with Benjamin proposing a hybrid of physical and digital signage that would have been obvious in the art collections of the city; Heatherwick proposing ‘digital signage’ that</text>

The bewildering array of characters that characterise the New Urban Interface is a mix of those who lost their houses to the process of demolition, and a few who now call the place home. But the large majority of the people who use the word ‘urban’ don’t call it ‘urban’ any more than the few who coined the word ‘highway’ do.  Rather, they call it ‘the city where people make choices and live lives’. And they’re not wrong.The point of urbanisation, as Steven Pinker points out hundreds of pages into his book The Better Angels of Our Nature, is to make space in which to do things in such a way as to maximize the social good. Space maximises exchange; new buildings bring people together; and, as Pinker points out, cities today make it easier for people to get around than ever before. But what’s most compelling about the city today, and what architects and urbanists have long sought to make real through planning and urban change, is that there’s virtually</text>

The bewildering array of characters that characterise the New Urban Interface is a mix of those who lost their houses to the process of demolition, and a few people who gained new houses through creative demolition. The latter is a process that is still ongoing, but which has created a new set of residents who use the park as a mix of housing (since no one wants to buy a house), as well as a mix of offices and retail. This mix of uses has its own set of conflicts. The park was a point of convergence for a lot of people, and now it is a point of divergence.  Creative Demolition: The Making of the New Urban Interface (1986-88) by Wendy Chun and Wendy Harpe is the story of New Urbanisation, New York City between the 1980s and 1990s. It is a narrative that is full of metaphors about the co-dependency of people, nature and the city. But it is also a story about the co-dependency of space – and specifically, of a city-centred economy that</text>

The bewildering array of characters that characterise the New Urban Interface is a mix of those who lost their houses to the process of demolition, and also those who found places in which to ‘reclaim’ their spaces.  	Looking back, some might wonder why the city didn’t just buy back all of the houses from the Architecture Firm, or a higher government authority, and instead of spending the money to refurbish the city as a city, planted trees and set up community gardens? Perhaps the answer is that the architects who designed the Architecture Firm buildings were rewarded with a large tax abatement package that made them highly profitable, and the trees or parkland that they collectively ‘re-created’ are worth far less than the houses that they replaced. Perhaps the answer is that the city didn’t set out to ‘recover’ the buildings but rather to create a ‘space’ that is both ‘restoration’ and ‘aesthetics’ over and above everything else] – a space where people can ‘</text>

The former were called ‘demographers’, while the latter were called ‘urban-design’.  The key to the interactive city is in the details, and the NUI has clearly demonstrated an aptitude for the finer points of planning, such as the location of schools or the precise mix of buildings in a neighbourhood. It seems entirely possible that the commission, which was itself once a practitioner of the old urban policy of the ‘Big Lie’, might now be interested in the benefits of transparency and might even want to help create an alternative future by providing cheap or free housing for residents.  The commission certainly seems to have an interest in the latter. In a recent report, it was claimed that the creation of an ‘expert panel of housing practitioners and local experts in urban-design’ would have allowed for greater public participation, and would have allowed for a transparent process with more</text>

Some of the new designs incorporated elements of the old, with cafes and shops along the Green Lane and the 4th Avenue, as well as the alley behind the Millionaire's Club.  Aesthetics over reality: the New Urban Interface Aesthetics of demolition are often given a Make School Sweetener by those with a cultural inclination towards trendy, party-like, urban design. But what happens when those with a cultural inclination towards trendy, party-like, urban design give up on their urban dreams? That is, when such efforts lead to the demolition of neighbourhoods? That is, when the city itself falls prey to the urban fantasy? That is, when the city becomes a dangerous, chaotic and uninteresting place in which people live in fear? That is, when the city becomes a place where violence, crime and despair rule the day? That is, when the city</text>

The bewildering array of characters that characterise the New Urban Interface is a mix of those who lost their houses to the process of demolition, and a stunningly large number who now live in parkland or on the half-acre that was once a grass verge. The former ‘underground railroad corridor’ has since been turned into parkland with stores and restaurants. The city’s partnership with Whole Foods, which had been part of the city’s retail district, quickly became an iconic image of the Great Park, and the store fronts that had once been part of the ‘underground railroad corridor’ became iconic too.The city’s involvement in this process continued well into the twentieth century, when architects such as Frank Gehry poured money into an ambitious urban plan that would make the parklands into islands, and the river into a multi-purpose recreational river with walkways and tunnels. The parklands that would later be fragmented into islands became the site for the Brooklyn Navy Yard’s post-Second World War gunnery range, where USN submarines launched missile defence systems, and for the</text>

The bewildering array of characters that characterise the New Urban Interface is a mix of those who lost their houses to the process of demolition, and a mixture of those who saw an opportunity to make nice parts of their properties back. The result is a zone that looks like a cyclical construct: the same houses with the same mix of uses – a mix of shops, a mix of homes for a while, then some homes for rent – but with a chaotic mix of residents, transient and permanent. This is the urban interface today, but with a density of businesses and residences that makes it difficult to see the city without getting caught up in it. The city’s decline coincided with this mix of permanent and transient housing, which in turn coincided with a cyclical shortage of affordable housing. As the number of houses per square kilometre declined, the number of spaces per household also declined. This means that as a city expanded it became ever more difficult to mix and accommodate all the inhabitants of a neighbourhood, which was undesirable in the same way that a desert island is undesirable. And so the cycle repeated: once the density of houses per</text>

This is especially the case with the rise of mobile devices and social networks, which make it easier for anyone with a Facebook or Twitter feed to reach everyone in the workplace and so beyond. As a consequence, it is not surprising that such practices have proliferated in the workplace and are being put under increasing scrutiny. But the tension between the need to actively generate knowledge and the actual use of that knowledge remains, and so the tensions that arise from this lack of awareness is palpable but often feeling futile. The solution to the lack of concrete knowledge, as we understand it, is knowledge sharing. This may be seen as a contradiction in terms, but it is perhaps a necessary concomitant of the needs of the contemporary condition: the more we are surrounded by information and data, the more we are exposed to it, the more we need to absorb it, the more we need to know, and the more we need to know in order to</text>

This is particularly evident in the form of new media, which is increasingly driven by people with a daily commute to work, and is therefore also affected by changes in the driving infrastructure. New media is also affected by changes in the nature of trade, and so changes in the kinds of work that can be done in it, such as image processing, graphic design and journalism. The kinds of knowledge that can be gathered from ‘out there’ and transmitted to the offices or the stock exchange is of course going to change, and so there is a need for practitioners of new media to be able to adapt and respond to this changing knowledge base.  	However, this need for adaptability and rapid response is itself a challenge, and there is a tension between the need to be able to learn and deploy knowledge and the other aspects of its complexity.

This is particularly true in the context of a social network, because the collective knowledge that is generated and flows towards the networked micro-blog is likely to be more accurate, and more likely to be shared, than the individual and personal knowledge generated and flowed towards the paper and paper board. In the new media literacy movement, this is particularly evident in the use of social media, which is understood by many people in the workplace as a medium that has definite and constraining effects.  One can argue that the expectations of the new media literacy movement are the same as those of the old media literacy movement: that is, that knowledge should be spread across a shared set of tools, that is, across a community of people involved in the creation of the knowledge shared between the social networks and the traditional media, that is, across a shared set of bodies (blogs, newspapers, radio, etc).

Thus, as the social-media user grows older, there is a tension between the needs of the business to engage with and utilise young people and the needs of the young person to disengage from the media. It is true that many young people today consume media in an entirely different way from their elders, but this is also true of those who consume media at a younger age. The question is whether the requirements of the modern workplace today are the same as those of the ancient one, or whether they are different. Does the need to engage with social media in order to stay current in a way that is both necessary and desirable outweigh the need to constrain oneself to consume media in a certain way? I believe that the requirements of the modern workplace today are different from those of the ancient one, and that the technologies of the internet today render the social more difficult, not easier, to disengage from.

This is particularly true in the context of a social media ecosystem where claims to knowledge are often highly individualised and generate claims of ownership. However, this concern and the knowledge that is generated and claims to knowledge is not without strain and politics. As is often the case with any new technology, there are claims to ownership that are not necessarily shared equally. This is particularly true in the context of a social media ecosystem where claims to knowledge are often highly individualised and generate claims of ownership. The sense of community around social media has certainly accelerated in the past decade. However, the increase in access to content and the claim to knowledge surrounding social media use is not without strain as claimed ownership. In the past, claims of ownership were often based on a shared claim to representational value for a specific work.

So, the concern that is growing in some quarters is whether or not the old media – especially print media – are sufficiently invested in highlighting the positive aspects of new technology and emerging media to be able to sustain the practices that are necessary for the success of the practices to shift and evolve. In an ideal world, the answer to this question would certainly have been available to all stakeholders involved in the production of any new media, and so the question raises the same sorts of concerns as do questions such as, for instance, what might happen if the internet is invented? The present global infrastructuralisation of the global information infrastructure means that questions of social and ecological sustainability are of particular concern, and so it is possible that the creation of a new media would have made sense in the context of a broader public sphere that also included artists, writers, collectors and others with a stake in the practices and</text>

This is particularly evident in the area of urban and urban regeneration, where regeneration schemes are premised on the notion that the old media is pastiche – something that can be seen as a redundancy in a social media age – and so the need for specialist, urban-based knowledge gathering has arisen. This is particularly evident in the area of transport, where recent developments in car sharing and the reduction in car ownership are purportedly making it easier for people to get around than ever before, and so a knowledge of the old media is being generated. It should be noted, however, that the interests of the city in this regard are not necessarily in favour of new media, or even in their remit to absorb new media. The emergence of new media and social media is likely to have an impact that is much more ‘horizontal’ than that of an urban development or a business strategy.

As a result, many job-related requirements are met by the social media, which in turn, encourages a certain amount of socialising. But it is important to distinguish between the social media and the actual media – the former is a tool utilised by the media to inform the public as to what is happening, while the latter is an actual media organisation that publishes and distributes news and information in a way that is consistent with its stated mission. For example, a news organisation may publish stories about exciting new developments in their locality but they may also publish stories about buildings that have been put under renovation or refurbishment. The publication or the distribution of a story does not necessarily mean that the organisation publishes or distributes it, only that it is presented in a way that is consistent with its stated mission. In addition, news organisations may not publish all news stories, and some may present news from sources other than their own organisation. As an example, the fact</text>

The most obvious and obvious example of this is when a new medium such as film is introduced to the practice of curating, but there are many more subtle ways in which media such as social media can be used to engage with and, indeed, create in situ and generate knowledge about local, regional and social issues, including their geographical locations and histories. As a consequence, curatorial practices and curatorial knowledge have become increasingly critical and visceral. Addressing the tension between the rise of new media and their impact on traditional media forms is pertinent in the current context. Despite the new media being introduced into the workplace and in some cases, even in the workplace itself, companies are very much concerned about the knowledge that is generated and flows towards the new media, and so have a vested interest in ensuring that the old media is of value to the very end users of the new media. In this sense, the old media is still of value to the company that produced it, although the new media is deceptively free and transparent in its form and content. The same company that develops the apps that are used in the workplace may also develop the next big thing that is completely dependent on the user data that is collected and transmitted via the app. This is a very real concern for many companies, especially those that are embedded in the larger transport and communications infrastructure. But even if the content of the report is neutral, the methods used to gather it and the companies that make use of it may still have a huge impact on communities in many cases, because they are embedded in the infrastructure and because they understand the communities that use the infrastructure. The report may not be what brings people together, but it is what binds them. A sense of the urgency, the desire and the commitment to make something happen, to push it forward</text>

This is particularly true for smaller companies, as the emergence of social media makes it easier for users to come to and fro across the site, and for businesses to employ more than 140,000 people. More subtly, but nonetheless still pressing, is the fact that many of the traditional media forms that were once the property of large corporations are now the property of regional or local governments or non-profit arts organisations. Thus, while social media and digital technologies are indeed great for generating knowledge and sparking connectedness, they are also often used to actively separate people – making it more difficult to forge connections across the web, in places like in the arts and culture sector. The real power of the new media is through the mechanisms of the informality it generates, and so it is with great concern that we are witnessing a resurgence of the once dominant forms of middle-class knowledge producing habit – that is, the knowledge industries.

Part Three surveys the social formation that is constitutive of contemporary art’s production of social conflict. The book includes a survey of the contemporary art that is produced in the �context of globalized capitalism’. It also examines the art produced in the shadow economies that emerged during that same decade. The social production of contemporary art’s social production entails more than the art itself. It involves the art being crafted or produced in secret, its production shared between a community of artists and a community of consumers. It involves how that art is received by a public that is then encouraged to share that art. As noted by the Guardian, in part, the reason why we don’t know what contemporary art is made of is that: curators at Tate and the Modern Language Museum in New York, whose collections include works from Tate, were asked to imagine an entirely new kind of art gallery – a gallery that would be warm, inviting, participatory and above all private. They created a series of online games for journalists – ‘Inside Job’ – designed to engage and surprise as many journalists as possible. The result is an art that is as accessible as</text>

It also includes a chronological survey of the development of art’s relation to social change, an examination that moves from the production of art and images through the production of social images and their consumption. This is part of the broader, but specific, question of how the contemporary predicament was produced, and whether or not it is a product of the social formations that emerged during the decade. In this respect, it is a valuable and important work, and sheds new light on the current predicament that we live in.

Part Three surveys the social formation that is constitutive of contemporary art’s production of social conflict. The book includes a survey of the contemporary art that is produced in the �Arab World’, focusing on the art of living, art of reproduction, and art of communication. It also looks at the art of engagement, or protest painting. Art students in the United Arab Emirates studied the art of living, the art of reproduction, and the art of communication. The UAE has a large and diverse art world, with diverse audiences to fit almost any cultural preference. The book does not attempt to define or define the contemporary predicament, but it does attempt to point to some of the features that distinguish it from other social situations and to suggest some of the distinguishing characteristics of the contemporary predicament. The contemporary predicament is a complex situation, but it is also a circumstance in which cultural practices can play significant roles. Cultural production of social conflict is culturally specific, and its production today is largely confined to the cities that are part of the Global South.

It begins with a review of the art that was produced in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, which swept away traditional forms of authority and ushered in a multiplicity of local alternatives. It then examines the growing literature on the contemporary predicament, naming a number of artists and a host of curators that produced significant contributions to the field.

It also includes a survey of contemporary art’s social production in the West. Part One also includes an analysis of the ways in which social processes shape cultural categories and identities. It constitutes a �working definition� of contemporary art’s social production and its social consequences, drawing on the results of a major international survey of art's social production.[2]In Part Two and Three, the author develops his definition of contemporary art’s social production and its social consequences. He draws on a range of theoretical, conceptual and empirical positions to develop a comprehensive theory of contemporary art’s social formation and cultural production. He develops these in terms of the cycle of capitalism and the cultural production of modernity. He shows how the aestheticisation of social experience through modern art practices like socialising the individual through mass media is a possible response to the social totality and the social situation.

This is primarily explained as a consequence of the inimitability of information technology, which enables rapid exchange between different kinds of information (data, images, ideas) in a city. 	Technology creates social contradictions, but its ubiquity and decentralisation are also producing new kinds of social organisation that are as yet largely undiscovered. New kinds of social organisation are being formed through the perforations of information and the shifting of places. New kinds of organisational forms are emerging along the lines of emerging biennales, cultural festivals and  	post-exhibitional programmes.

The subtitle of Part Three of the book is a recurring theme: the contemporary predicament. It was first used in an article in the December 2013 issue of the journal PLOS, and it has been used in subsequent issues of the journal and the book. Here, the editors select nine works that they say represent a break with tradition in their respective disciplines, demonstrating that they are contemporary with each other and not in any way responding to the discourses of the current moment. For Part One, they choose nine works from the library of artworks produced during the decade between 2000 and 2015, and talk to the ways in which each emerged from the particular particularity of the particularity, and in different ways. The editors also ask: what can we learn from these artists and the way they engage with the contemporary predicament? They cite the work of art</text>

It also examines the emerging biennale as an emerging category of art-in-recipes, catering to the needs of curators, collectors and artists in the contemporary predicament. The entheogen market is a socially dynamic phenomenon that has recently featured an abundance of poetry, from Hilary Mantel to Coline Millard to Naomi Klein, among others. It is a market that generates globalised forms of economic, political and social upheaval, but also the formation of socially engaged art practices that are global in scope, regional in character and often occur in hybrid forms throughout the world. Contemporary entheogen markets develop in response to specific requests from curators, artists and curators, the media and the public alike. The media respond by making the social more present in art, making the art possible to be shared, making it possible to be appreciated and making it socially</text>

The book includes a survey of the contemporary art that is produced in the �public gallery’ (2000-2015) and the establishment and development of an artist-run biennale. There is considerable overlap between the disciplines of gallery building and biennials, with a common reliance on policies and programmes to control and direct activities. Indeed, the contemporary predicament was so central to the thinking of gallery owners and artists that it was assumed would be of greatest relevance to artists and audiences during the decade between 2000 and 2015. So the assumption was that a biennial would find a place in a cultural landscape dominated by large scale exhibitions, and that it would follow that the biennial would become a regularised phenomenon, embedded in a regular cultural landscape, and that the biennial would be a periodic occurrence, marking a specific event or occurrence in time. But the contemporary predicament has proven more variable and variable in its contours.

It also examines the �Caduceus of Art’ exhibition that became the basis for the coming together of such diverse cultural regions. The volume draws upon the conference proceedings and conference papers of the year 2000, including those of the American Museum of Modern Art, in the pages that follow with annotations and quotations from the sources cited. It presents new conceptualizations of the contemporary predicament that seek to bring collective knowledge together with historical documentation. It seeks to bring contemporary art and its social production into the discussion of cultural production and its relations to the past, to anticipate work in the field of art history and archives.

It is also easy to understand a city's desire to simultaneously commission and host a biennial, especially if this is the only way to acquire contemporary art products.  	However, when the biennial is an occurence, and not an event, the city is no longer the primary market for contemporary art products. The exhibitionary circuit has responded by turning into conspicuous consumption the identity of the city, and the city is the only market for contemporary art products in a city anymore. 	It is common for biennials to become cultural outcries, or worse, pandemics, whose interrelatedness produces a chaotic mix of emotions, some of which are directly related to the art products they display, such as rage, revulsion, euphoria, despair, anger and so forth. Art dealers and art fans today are more likely to be art-utopian, or more likely to be affluent middle-class people who identify with the idea that art will one day matter, and who will value their art products in a way</text>

It is also easy to understand a city's desire to participate in a cultural exchange, and thus a city may invest in the development of a biennial by providing culturally responsive services, such as cultural institutions for their members, as well as cultural tourism promotion. In addition, cities may create cultural networks, such as city-based art organizations, by pooling resources and assets, participating in public or private festivals, hosting cultural exchanges, and supporting bienniales through partnerships. The importance of this type of institutionalised social capital cannot be overemphasised. The social and political structures that emerge from such processes are critical for the success of such ventures, and it is these that become embedded in the social and political landscape and are able to effectively negotiate the complexities of contemporary art today.  	While the biennial is a transient format, its history is chronicled at length in the art books that are published in most biennials.

Therefore, it is easy to understand a curatorial decision to devote significant resources to a city, as a city is the primary market for contemporary art products in a given market. It is also easy to understand a city's desire to limit or eliminate commercial activity within its boundaries. Therefore, a city may actively promote a certain level of art activity within a particular city, using cultural resources and cultural assets generated by the city’s economic activity as a way of controlling or intervening in the cultural flow. However, in the case of large-scale migrations or metapictions that result in the total or partial closures of urban venues, or in the case of cities that wish to return to the past but cannot, such as the ‘Cadillac Tax’ that crippled cities during the recession, the city’s cultural resources and cultural assets may find themselves in danger of becoming commodities – commodities used to construct a future urbanisation. In such cases, the city is likely to experience a kind of ‘demographic storm’.1 	However, it is important to distinguish between the kinds of cultural production that are subject to the Cadillac Tax and those that do not.

Therefore, it is easy to understand a curatorial decision to devote significant resources to a city, as a city is the primary market for contemporary art products in a given market. It is also easy to understand a city's desire to exert significant political and economic influence on a particular market, such as, for example, the desire of Istanbul’s financial district to buy into the value of the cultural district’s inventory of art products. In either case, the financial district’s influence on art products from the cultural district is maximised. This is not to suggest that cultural districts have no external markets to influence – indeed, they do – but the fact of their present economic imbalances and the vagaries of the biennale have made it difficult for artists, fans and curators to effectively engage with or participate in these markets. Indeed, as the biennale has become more institutionalised and internationalised, the level of political and economic involvement has become more significant, with curators increasingly invested in gaining public support for their projects. So, museums, artists’ unions, grassroots arts organisations and even the biennale itself are often active in mobilising public support for specific projects, but they</text>

It is also easy to understand a city's desire to ignore or to mitigate the impact of a market demand for art products. Thus, a city can (and, in some instances, has) reduced the impact of a market demand for contemporary art products through policies and programmes that actively participate in the market for cultural products. Examples of this kind of cultural self-sufficiency are abundant in the global art market today, and can be seen in the increased popularity of the Middle Eastern contemporary art of takfiri, or contemporary art after Islamic art.7 	The interest in the city as a vector for contemporary art production is largely due to the economic impact of urbanisation on the value form of cultural capital. The New Urban Capital of the Future 	The notion of the city as a vector for contemporary art production has gained currency in recent years through the economic implication of growing populations, ever more urban centres and the diversification of labour.

Cities, on the other hand, are ubiquitous, and cities are in general, where there is a market for cultural products, have a significant amount of influence. Therefore, it is easy to understand a curatorial decision to devote significant resources to a city, as a city is the primary market for contemporary art products in a given market. It is also easy to understand a city's desire to foster a transient art form such as graffiti, which is of course not a new phenomenon. The main difference between the two is that in the former case, the art is produced and exhibited in a city; in the latter, it is socially engineered. It is the willingness of city administrations to subordinate local needs to the needs of the international market. Therefore, it is easy to understand the impulse to confine contemporary art in a particular city to a specific set of priorities, such as those set out by the art dealers and their clientelists, who jointly control the art market. It is the willingness of city residents to accept this as a given. This impulse is reinforced by the fact that, unlike in many other places in the world, New York City is a city with a large Latino and African American population. It is in fact true that, since the early 1990s, the amount of African American art has outpaced that of Latino art, although the former have consistently outpaced the latter</text>

Therefore, it is easy to understand a curatorial decision to devote significant resources to a city, as a city is the primary market for contemporary art products in a given market. It is also easy to understand a city's desire to host exhibitions that are not merely a variation on a theme or an archetype, but draw audiences to the city and engage with its politics and history. Thus, a city may choose to limit the number of exhibitions it hosts, or to limit the type of art it exhibits, or both. A city's cultural resources and cultural traditions are critical in providing a sense of continuity and continuity, but they are also critical in creating an impression of diversity and inclusion. That is, of course, if the city is to retain its cultural value, which is threatened by globalisation. Cities may wish to preserve their historical values by donating artefacts or adopting contrarian cultural practices, but they are primarily concerned with generating cultural practices that will be accepted and utilised by transnational capital, or by local stakeholders – stakeholders whose identities are defined not by the city, but rather by the globalisation that is happening all around them.This is the global curatorial economy.

Therefore, it is easy to understand a curatorial decision to devote significant resources to a city, as a city is the primary market for contemporary art products in a given market. It is also easy to understand a city's desire to reduce its cultural footprint, to the extent that this is possible. Of course, this approach does not apply to all cities, and the resources needed to support a cultural mission in a city vary widely. Nevertheless, the resources allocated for a cultural mission in a city typically make significant contributions to the cultural organisation’s success, which is why cities continue to fund a cultural mission at a deep level. In these cities, the resources are there, and the participation is voluntary; in a deeper sense, the city is the biological organism of cultural exchange. However, the deep cuts to social and health services and diminishing living standards that poor urban conditions impose on people inevitably lead to cultural conflict. The main challenge of the contemporary urban situation is to find creative and positive ways to work collectively towards a common destiny. Cities should be creative and receptive to new ideas and approaches. They must be able to offer cultural experiences in a practical and equitable way, so that people can come out of their shells and flex new</text>

Therefore, it is easy to understand a curatorial decision to devote significant resources to a city, as a city is the primary market for contemporary art products in a given market. It is also easy to understand a city's desire to block out other markets, to limit cultural exchange to a city. In both the case of a city and a contemporary art market, there is competition between cities for cultural products, which creates a dynamic that is almost universal in its effects. For example, in the urban arts market, there is a strong tendency for artists to be clustered in high-end districts, such as the financial district and the city, whereas in the urban music market, the premium is for artists to operate in low-end districts, such as the very poor district and the subcontinent. In the former, the premium is for the most innovative, whereas in the latter, it is for the most innovative artists to operate in the most deprived areas. This is true even when the artists operate in countries where consumption is heavily influenced by media outlets such as billboards, radio and television. Thus, there is a constant struggle between the interests of artists and those of the urbanised elite. In the 1990s and early 2000s</text>

The curatorial is the representative or representative of the artist(s) represented in the exhibition. It is the point where art products, goods and services are offered and sold. It is the point where connections with other art institutions, curators, artists, administrators and other stakeholders meet and engage. It is the point where ideas are put forth and conclusions reached. It is a point of convergence or divergence, where ideas meet practice and it is the point of articulation or disagreement. It is a place where ideologies or personal preferences govern discourse or position. It is a place where power is concentrated or dispersed or nonexistent. It is a place where control is exercised or ungoverned means of expression is exercised. It is a place where power is exerted over expertise or power conveys, and power is delegated or ignored. It is a place where ideas are perforce rejected or held in check</text>

If the answer to this question is a definite 'yes', then a strictly commercial relationship between art and the city is the only possible format. The other possibilities, such as partnerships between the city and non-governmental organisations, are likely to be costly and ineffective. Therefore, the biennale seems to be taking the form of non-profit institutions – socially engaged art institutions, in the classic bureaucratic sense – but is also developing a number of innovative initiatives outside of the traditional scope of the biennale. These include a number of initiatives by the artists and their representatives, such as the artists’ residency at the Dubai Museum, which brought artists together and gave them a voice, and the establishment of a Community Land Trust, which brings together the interests of the local inhabitants and the urban planners of the city. These last two initiatives seem to be developing at a pace that places the trust between the inhabitants and the urban planners at a critical moment. The trust has to be broken, and with it the opportunities for growth that can emerge from that growth. This is an urgent and potentially game-changing challenge. The biennale must expand its role beyond the static confines of its traditional</text>

If the answer to this question is a definite 'yes', then a strictly commercial relationship between art and the city is the only possible format. The other possibilities, such as partnerships between the city and non-governmental organisations, are likely to be incremental and temporary. However, the increasing importance that the city places on its financial survival suggests that there is a need to reconsider the role that the city has in the first instance. If the city is to play a significant role in the future of the city, a co-constitutive role that is not dependent on commercial revenue streams, then a dialogue between the two must begin. If it is to foster a dialogue, then the relationship between the artist and the city must be based on mutual respect and understanding. There is a way of talking that is not reductive, but rather invites dialogue. In order to achieve this, the city must adopt a more fundamental purpose-oriented agenda, which is dependent on the city’s economic survival. This is imperative in the face of the runaway industry that is developing in the city, and which seeks to exploit every bit of the artefact as a commodity. The question becomes, can the</text>

If the answer to this question is a definite 'yes', then a strictly commercial relationship between art and the city is the only possible format. The other possibilities, such as partnerships between the arts and the local economy, are also commercial in nature. What is unique about this relationship is that the art is delivered in the form of new developments and is not delivered as a negative or negative congealing of past developments. This is an example of the postcolonial, ‘cumulative’ structure that is being slowly dismantled. In the words of Guy Debord, ‘the trap of multiplicity».1 	The monolithic institutional memory of the past is being constantly reshaped by the constant churn of commercial and social agendas. Consequently, ‘the past’ is frequently repeated again and again, which creates situations in which repetition can be used to generate many different permutations of the same thing – which is to say, different kinds of problems.2 	But what happens when that institutional memory starts to fail? What happens when the infrastructure for cultural activity starts to fail? What happens when the public sector and the commercial sector start to collude to secrete</text>

If the answer to this question is a definite 'yes', then a strictly commercial relationship between art and the city is the only possible format. The other possibilities, such as partnerships between the arts and the private sector, are still viable, but the demand for sustainable practices is becoming increasingly important. The demand for environmentally conscious practices is driving a cultural revolution in the city, which is seeking to replace the antiquated and declining infrastructure with renewable resources and cultural networks. The question is: what alternatives are there for the city, other than to commercialise and consume itself? Curatorial work in the city has a crucial role to play in this process. It is being made increasingly visible in the financial markets and is a necessary precondition for any viable future for the city. However, the city is being increasingly alienated by the increasingly visible hand of finance, which is seeking to commercialise the city in order to meet a market demand for housing and cultural resources. The financialisation of the city is creating a situation where sustainability is no longer a primary objective of the city. The city is being given over to the logic of profit, which is determined in large measure by the financial markets. The</text>

If the answer to this question is a definite 'yes', then a strictly commercial relationship between art and the city is the only possible format. The other possibilities, such as partnerships between the city and multi-cultural institutions, are likely to remain tentative and unstable. However, the introduction of new buildings and infrastructure does not always equal success. The city does not have to constantly repair itself, and new developments do not necessarily equal success. So, while new buildings and infrastructure may or may not make an impact on the city’s cultural capacity, they do have an impact on the city’s finances – and that is all that is really at stake. The question is, which way will the cultural capacity pivot? 	Since the early 1980s, when the Arab Spring erupted in the Arab world’s largest protests, a lot of attention has focused on the role of the ‘next generation’ – a term that was used synonymously with ‘older’. It is common for artists, writers, and artists’ organisations to develop educational or outreach projects for younger people, or in the case of large scale cultural institutions, for people in</text>

The other possibilities, such as partnerships between art institutions and non-profit organisations, are likely to be of limited scope and duration. Nonetheless, there is an opportunity to create something new and different with the city, to incorporate some elements of the city into your curatorial thinking. A perforated and perforated version of the modern curatorial, with a long term view, would allow you to see the city and its diverse districts, but would also allow you to introduce elements of the city into contemporary or future architectural designs. The idea would be to create ‘institutional memory’ by weaving together the different versions of the same site, creating ‘a hybrid space that is both archaeological and urban’. This would allow you to imagine yourself embedded in the city, although it would also introduce ‘institutional blindness’ – the condition of being unable to distinguish between fact and fiction, and between what you and I imagine the city to be like. It would render modern urban planning and its discontents into something that</text>

The other possibilities, such as partnerships between the city and multinational corporations, are usually criticised for favouring corporate profits over people on the grounds that this would mean less taxpayer funding for arts education and cultural activities. However, there is overwhelming evidence that shows that partnerships between arts organisations and large financial institutions are commonplace practices in the globalised capitalist economy. So perhaps it is time to begin to consider other forms of infrastructure supporting the city’s culture economy.

The conversations that take place within the context of the contemporary curatorial are likely to become increasingly complex, multi-layered and multi-functional. It is this multi-use of the city, its diverse cultural landscapes and historic architecture as a material asset, which is likely to remain an open question through the course of the near future.Download this article as PDFHamid Dabashi Hamid Dabashi: Originally from Ahvaz in Iran, Hamid Dabashi is a researcher, writer and Director of the Persian Cultural Centre based in London.

The other possibilities, such as partnerships between the city and private companies, are either ‘worst-case scenarios’ or ‘worst-ever partnerships’. In the former, the city is de-factocommon space; it is owned by a development company and its customers; and its use is restricted to those who hail from that company’s desired growth zones. In the latter, it is commonplace that thing are abused and misused – although there are signs that these problems are beginning to be addressed. The city is becoming a transient site of exchange, where people tend to congregate around ever-more elaborate ways of being transported or ‘curationally tagged’ objects. The failure to generate cultural institutions that can sustain a city as a cultural centre is the real challenge of our time. We need cultural institutions that can generate the capacity to critically assess and address the effects of infrastructure on habit formation, as well as the incentive to undertake long-term projects that could in principle address the effects of such infrastructure</text>

The other possibilities, such as partnerships between the arts and the hotels, or the potential acquisition of intellectual property rights, are also on the decline. But the criticality of the biennial remains firmly based around its commercial relationship, whether that relationship is commercial, intellectual or all three. The biennial must negotiate various forms of institutional and political support in order to succeed in Dubai, whether that success is commercial or institutional. The biennial must also negotiate the complex relationships between art institutions and powerful lobby groups, because if it falls outside the prescribed parameters, it is likely to be severely criticised. Finally, the biennial must navigate the complex obligations and assumptions of postcolonial and racialised communities in order to provide meaningful and relevant arts and culture to a wider community of people. While the various elements of the biennial may or may not belong to the current globalised forms, their commonality and shared dependence on a globalised capitalist economy means that they are ultimately accountable to a particular globalised market.
