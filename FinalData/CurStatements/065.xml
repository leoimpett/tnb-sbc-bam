The biennial is an ever-present and pervasive form of art event, with growing numbers of artists creating experiences that are more like experiences in museums or in a large contemporary art fair. They are curatorial curating, not artistic curator. For many years the focus was on the art in the form of performances, but now large numbers of artists take part in the art as a material and continuous form.Artists who have been curators for the past twenty years or more include Mark Leckey, Sofía Olascoaga, Judith Lawrence, Ron Jeremy, Joasia Krysa, Raimundas Malasauskas, Sune Engel, Sabine Lis, Latour Dehn, Manacorda Savrasijevic, and many others. As examples, we introduce five artists who were part of the curatorial team</text>

    The next Biennial will be held in Liverpool, from June 2017 to October 2019. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will bring together the rich past and the new, in an era when biennials are no longer confined to the pages of a book, but will combine the past, present and future in a common space. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be conducted in cooperation with the Liverpool Biennial, with the support of the FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) and the Arts Council. It will be the first time that Liverpool, alongside cities in the United Kingdom and Australia, has been invited to be a co-commissioning partner for a biennial.

Liverpool Biennial 2016 will include a rich range of curatorial approaches, including new media, performance, standing areas, public art and ethnography. It will also participate in the curatorial race to be the world’s top biennial city, with a $100 million prize. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be held in either of three locations in 2017: Anfield, in 2018; or Inverness, in 2019. The main exhibition venue will be Inverness Town Hall, but the three other venues will be home to artist studios, curatorial sets and public art commissions. The three main curatorial approaches will be experimental, presenting a curated take on an event, followed by traditional, classic and social approaches. The experimental curatorial approach will be led by Marcel Lesage, the director of the Tate Modern and former head of the Arts Council England. The classic and social orientations will be carried out by H. Paul McCarthy, curator of art for NBC News, who will lead the social, cultural and historical curatorial approaches.

Liverpool Biennial 2016 will include a rich range of curatorial approaches, including new media, physical and virtual media, performance, text, images, data, maps, social media, and urban planning. It will also seek to uncover how art can be used in a city’s future through research projects, with an eye to its possible integration into a future urban development. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be an opportunity to work through the curatorial approaches of the previous curatorial positions, and find out how art can be utilised in the future through research projects. Around half of the curatorial team will be new, recruited from institutions in the arts, architecture, travel and media, and the other half will be veterans of the curatorial ranks, with backgrounds in advertising, film and media. The exhibition will be produced through a curatorial residency programme, funded by the Arts Council, run by Mary Turner Baker, and funded by the Biennaleeurs.

Liverpool Biennial 2016 will include a rich range of curatorial approaches, including new media, fine art, and interior design; a production of buildings and structures including from the former archive, of course; and a move towards a more urban form through a set of new regulations that will limit the city’s role in artmaking. The exhibition format will be curatorial in nature, with special attention being paid to the archiving of artworks, works of art and performances, in a way that reflects the historical practices of archiving in cities like Liverpool. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will also see the collaboration between art institutions, non-profits, and other interested parties being developed around the curatorial agenda through a joint venture with the BBC, which will provide programming of a kind not often associated with contemporary art institutions: programming that engages with the curatorial agenda in a local sense, by bringing arts and culture together.

Liverpool Biennial 2016 will include a rich range of curatorial approaches, including new media, documentation, performance, public assemblages and archival resources. Treated as a ‘biennial’, this will allow the curatorial combination of art, architecture, sustainable development, urbanism, geography and nature in a unique way, inviting artists, curators, artists’ social action groups and community organisers to contribute to the vibrant exploration of the city. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will also see the curatorial combination of art, sustainable development, sustainable urbanism and geography, in a ‘multidisciplinary exhibition style’. This is the curatorial combination that was explored at the 2016 Venice Biennale, where curatorial and art school approaches were merged to create a new curatorial paradigm that sought to rethink the role of the artist, art educator, and urban planner in building and developing Venice. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will see the curatorial combination of art, sustainable development, sustainable urbanism and geography, in a ‘multidisciplinary exhibition style’.</text>

Liverpool Biennial 2016 will include a rich range of curatorial approaches, including new media, production, installation, public art and crafts, from conception to completion. It will also involve research and development, and rely heavily on community input. The exhibition will be framed around a set of questions that the participants, artists and curators decided on as a function of their positions and identities, based on their experience at Tate Liverpool and the Biennale in Berlin. The exhibition will be based around a set of questions that collectively capture the essence of what Liverpool Biennial can be in the future. These questions were compiled from a 'guiding narrative' of thoughts and ideas gathered as part of the 'Creative Time’ project, led by Jess Doyle (Director of Creativity Factory, Liverpool Biennial 2016). These contributions were then collated and made available online for other curators to download and access, with a selection of additional questions made online for other curators to review and answer.

It will be a rare opportunity to observe, curate or curate for another, and perhaps a last, time. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be a rare opportunity to be part of a team. This may include institutions, artists, artists' unions, communities, and artists taking part in the exhibition on a voluntary basis. It may also involve curators, arts professional associations, artists, curators, artists, student curators, journalists, artists and community activists from around the world. Curatorial approaches may vary considerably from the traditional, canonical curatorial style, with elements of staging and plan, and may be participatory, positional, collaborative and unpredictable. The curatorial changes may be as slight as installing a new lighting installation or archaeological dig at an architectural site, or at least as dramatic as a seismic tremor.  In the wider understanding, these curatorial approaches may not be conventional,</text>

It will also attempt to sketch out a common trajectory for the city’s arts and cultural resources through a multi-year research project. Biennial format is an important element in the biennial narrative because it allows the different components to be identified and recognised, allowing us to understand how art, artists’ studios, production, transport, culture, travel and events connect to create the experience of being in a museum or a gallery. In contrast, museums and galleries typically have a public realm with a defined set of participants, and are therefore more easily accessed and live in people’s homes. Biennials have become essential for the institutionalisation of art’s social function in a city. However, in an increasingly digitised and mobile city, this kind of institutionalisation is increasingly impossible, and the only way to access the city is for visitors to wealthy neighbourhoods to afford to visit museums and galleries.

It will also bring together artists, curators, artists' unions, local authorities, art galleries and other stakeholders to tackle a range of issues that have become prominent in the city in the past few years: gentrification, mental health, the impact of digital photography, the impact of vacant properties and so on. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be an opportunity for artists and art professionals to participate in a multi-year, multi-edition retrospective format, while the Biennial in the UK will be a rare opportunity for curators and art lovers to explore the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the biennial form in the city. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be an opportunity for curators and art lovers to explore the city’s past, present and future through a multi-year, multi-edition retrospective format. Curators from the Biennial in Liverpool will be able to explore the curatorial process as a creative outlet in an intimate and collaborative way, while</text>
    <text>The next Biennial will be held in Liverpool, from June 2017 to October 2019. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will bring together the rich past and the new, in an era when biennials are no longer confined to the pages of a book, but will combine the past, present and future in a common space. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be conducted in cooperation with the Liverpool Biennial, with the support of the FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) and the Arts Council. It will be the first time that Liverpool, alongside cities in the United Kingdom and Australia, has been invited to be a co-commissioning partner for a biennial. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will bring together artists, curators, artists' unions, artists' communities and art professionals from across the UK and around the world in a collaborative exploration of the city’s past, present and future through a multi-disciplinary exhibition style. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will include a rich range of curatorial approaches, including new media, performance, installation, literature, photography and web design, as well as a curatorial approach that seeks to bring to life the connections between past, present and future through an act of imagining and embodiment. The curatorial approach will draw on the strengths and interests of the city’s arts community, with a particular focus on the arts and culture of the First World War era. Liverpool Biennial 2016 is expected to be the first in a planned series of biennials in the city, and the first in a new scale, offering distinct perspectives on the city from a different point of view. The exhibition will be dynamic, varied and experiential, offering a rare opportunity to see how art and culture intersect in a city and beyond. It will also challenge contemporary art in ways that are more experiential and personal. 	There will be seven episodes in the series, each focusing on a different aspect of the city and its history. The first episode, 'Liverpool - The Biennial</text>

The curatorial mix will be a catalyst for action, providing the means to react to changes in the city through exploration and change. The curatorial mix may also be a disrupter, providing the means to stoke the fire of imagination and action through invention and engagement. 	Alternative Curating for Futures Postindustrialised 	Alternative Curating for Futures (2015–16) was founded by and for the future workers of the city of Liverpool. The curatorial mix will be a key element of future urban development, representing the city’s potentialities and rejecting its limitations.

And it’s what we did when we thought, well, maybe what other businesses did with these big data insights that they were giving us was also relevant to what we did. We asked ourselves and others: is this something that could be replicated? Or is it something that has a different kind of sustainability? And we kind of imagined that maybe what we were doing here was creating something more sustainable for ourselves, for our communities, for nature. And a kind of radical maybe, in that it put humans in a different kind of relationship to nature. But also, it put humans in a different kind of relationship to data.Because what we were doing was giving voice to the people who were really making the decisions about where the river met the city, where factories and offices met parks, where houses with backyards met parks with green walls—the kind of voice that wasn’t being heard by the people making those decisions. And so we started to think, okay, well, maybe this is a situation where the decisions we are making now are also making some</text>

I was in the lab at the Arts Council, hammering away at a new idea when someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘Hey, that’s a great idea. Let’s do that.’—perhaps someone had offered me a way to get involved or something. But I turned it down. Instead, I embarked on a year-long, but relatively invisible, but long-term, but very important, but very personal project: I commissioned eight paintings by a local artist, and commissioned him to do another eight pieces of artwork as a sort of a year-round residency, each over the course of a four-year period. I did that for the Arts Council, but also commissioned the artist himself to do it, because, well, that was the way he could do it. He could have any number of pieces, but the eight pieces that</text>

And so we became interested in the idea of ‘transactional culture’, where culture is valued not for what it can do for the world – which is another form of industry now, one that demands a lot of resources and is hence heavily dependent on technical know-how – but for what it can create. And so, in that sense, we could say that the mass appeal of digital culture today is really due to what we see as the resilience of culture as a cultural form and not just in the places where audiences congregate.What is extraordinary about the way in which social media is impacting not just the cultural industries that we know and love, but the cultural</text>

But whatever it is, I do know that when the time came to roll up our sleeves and do it, we had some pretty ambitious projects that we wanted to tackle, and we’d be putting ourselves forward as examples of what other arts organisations might do. And we certainly envisaged, in the early days, putting our projects in motion and having some impact. We didn’t envision, however, how the arts would play a role in building a city. We didn’t envision, for example, putting art in public buildings or creating a public realm around a specific business or organisation. We didn’t envision creating an educational model around the provision of arts education, either by providing free or cheap resources, or creating a publicly-funded cultural institution around</text>

And how do artists create change? And what does it feel like to be an outsider? And what does it feel like to be a part of something bigger than yourself? And how do you be a part of something that is universal?These are questions that inevitably come to mind for those who identify as artists, or who study aesthetics or design or architecture. And perhaps it’s these elements that connect to the question that people feel like they’re asking themselves.Ana Laura López de la Torre, Usagi Yojimbo: Art as a Research Project, 2014.

When I started my PhD at Lancaster University, I took a yearlong course in artist-in-residence, part of a two-year programme run by the Arts and Cultural Development Corporation (ACDC). The course was entirely funded by the ACDC and part of a two-year research project into the potential of artists to address issues of social transformation and urbanicity through art production in the city. ACDC had set up a 'megacity' project based in the city called ‘Atlantic Philharmonic’, named for the first note of every concert. The project was a ‘new beginning’ for the corporation, which had been created in 1888 to produce and distribute music for the masses. As the course progressed, I started to understand that the megacity model was just one of many possible models of city production, and the ways in which the historical and contemporary conditions of city-making could be transformed through artistic intervention. In this sense, the ACDC’s Atlantic Philharmonic was both a continuation of the city as a production site and a site for new ways of engaging citizens in the city’s production and consumption.

It offers funding for up to four years, with options to extend the duration and scope of the funding. I’m interested in how arts organisations can work with city governments to achieve similar outcomes through collaborative initiatives. I also like the fact that cities now have the capacity to set minimum standards, or in the case of smaller cities, to demand higher standards. For example, in the US, cities now have formalised constitutions that prescribe certain things, such as free childcare for all public school children, paid leave and sick leave, and bans on dumping industrial waste in the ocean.

When I started my PhD at Lancaster University, I took a yearlong course in artist-in-residence, part of a two-year programme run by the Arts and Cultural Development Corporation (ACDC). This course, taught by Professors Ania Bas and Prem Krishnamurthy, focused on the cultural practices of the local communities in the city, focusing on the role of artists, musicians, writers and others in the city’s landscape. The research was conducted using the Lancaster Biennial as an example, and the local artists and creative community in Lancaster as an example to be explored. The course was not only about the art, but also the collaborative process involved in the art process itself, through which artists create artistic practice and articulate cultural identity through their practices. The role of the artist in this context is complex: while the artist may contribute to the creation of the art, the community is also actively engaged in creating a ‘different kind of art’ through which the community can be engaged. 	In this multi-disciplinary context, the role of the artist becomes particularly critical. While the community is actively engaged in creating a ‘different kind of art’ through their practice</text>

When I started my PhD at Lancaster University, I took a yearlong course in artist-in-residence, part of a two-year programme run by the Arts and Cultural Development Corporation (ACDC). I had never worked with artists before, and only a few of my fellow artists had completed the programme. The course was completely unpaid, and so my artistic practice started out quite independent. I did have the financial means to take the course, but as is often the case with artist-in-residence, the financial means don’t necessarily connect to the practice. The reality of academic life is often quite different. I found myself managing a small budget, and sometimes had to rely on the artistic director’s personal savings to complete some projects. There was a sense of community around the work, and the students were supportive and engaged.  	At the same time, I also started to develop a relationship with the city through the work, and I found myself collaborating with the city government to implement a number of initiatives, including the creation of a bicycle network in the city and the pilot project of creating a public plaza adjacent to the CN Tower. The bicycle network and plaza were ambitious</text>

In 2017, I started my research project at the ACDC Learning Centre in Barking, which is run by artist-run organisation MAPS. ACDC Learning Centre Manager, Dr Jenny Kane, said: ‘The learning centre has a project in the area of art and it’s surprising to us how much the area is represented in the projects that we’ve been developing.

This was my second year, so I got to explore the city during that time. The course focused on the history and theory of biennials, but also on the art and activism of the direct action. I did my PhD work in the form of mini-exhibitions, one of which was a mini-exhibition on the history of art and art’s relation to the 2011 Athens Biennale. The exhibition, entitled The Biennial Condition: USA, opened in New York at the Mandarin Theater and followed the lead of many artists and art institutions as biennials migrated to other cities and regions. The exhibition offered a rare opportunity to see many of the works in chronological order, showing the artists who have been part of the exhibitionary picture ever since.

When I started my PhD at Lancaster University, I took a yearlong course in artist-in-residence, part of a two-year programme run by the Arts and Cultural Development Corporation (ACDC). This course, which I took concurrently with my year-long study at Lancaster, introduced me to a range of artists and to the art world at large. It also introduced me to a range of projects that would come in and out of the ACDC’s Artist in Residence programme, which I subsequently co-founded, with Evelyn Forget. The course content and the language of the course did not cross cultural boundaries, unlike the projects that later emerged from the course.

I was privileged to work alongside several artists from UC Berkeley and the surrounding areas on a project titled  	Inhabitants of America – Contexts of Multiculturalism. The project explored the ways in which the American dream is multi-generational – people of all ages are drawn to the stories, from the immigrants who come to this country to work as coders, teachers, housewives and artists, to the African-Americans who migrate to cities such as Los Angeles and New York and become lawyers, artists, painters and consumers. The project was written and directed by Sebastian Villeneuve, who directed the film Arrival, and Jennifer Capone, who directed the TV movie Homeland.

ACDC is the crown prince of art funding, and is a major funder of the UK’s National Theatre, Shakespeare in London, and many other arts organisations around the country. ACDC is also a major funder of transnational art and cultural tourism, creating opportunities for artists from all over the world to explore and work within the UK.Through this course, we learnt about the intersection of art, communities and tourism. We also met artists who were artists in their own right, and artists whose work we acquired from them, as well as meeting artists whose work we didn’t acquire from them. Some of them were artists who had never met each other before, or whose work we never met until now.

I did my PhD research with Jessica Coon, Associate Professor in Art and Research at L.A.

Why did the internet suddenly become a place where ideas didn’t have names? Why did certain ideas gain a lot of traction? Why did certain social networks start to see things through the lens of big data?The short answer is that ideas started to have names. And names mean a lot of things in this context. If you’re not doing enough to register them, you might start to misspell certain things – like when the internet was first invented, people in certain countries started calling it  	the global internet.

So the internet was originally conceptual as a set of protocols that invited other protocols to join it. And as protocols became more and more abstracted – with protocols representing things that could later be represented as data – names began to creep in. When Netflix introduced its streaming media as video, it’s not just that we get a stream of images; it’s that the images themselves are images. And so, when Netflix writes its scripts, it’s also that we adapt and live our lives according to those scripts. In other words, it’s not just the streaming of images; it’s also that we process images and route images through those networks. When you and I watch a film or a programme on Netflix, we do this partly because we’re watching a video on Netflix, and partly because the images it presents are images. And so, the idea that image processing could</text>

Nowadays, the internet is generally referred to as the  	global web, but in the 1980s and 1990s variously, the  	internet was also known as the ‘Triple Connection Protocol’ (TCP)/IP (Internet Protocol) or the ‘Trace Chip’ (Terminal Lance #8, p. 6). The idea that you could send and receive data across networks is new, and protocols like TCP/IP were originally developed for very specific reasons – to handle extremely specific data – like the origin of a nuclear warhead or the precise positioning of an enemy during a precision bombing run. But as soon as these reasons started to be considered outside the context of war, the terraforming of networks started. And as soon as that happened, the rise of multitudes of interconnected data points became a necessity in keeping up with the ever-increasing speed of information flow. And this is where we find ourselves in the present. We have to be nimble, quick, and flexible in the face of new data, because there’s no way of knowing what has and has not been captured or what has been invented – and thus the need for what is commonly referred to as the ‘Internet of Things’</text>

So while it wasn’t long before people started calling the internet what it was – a set of protocols that together made up what came to be known as the internet – it would be foolish to assume that the internet didn’t also have its own set of protocols that it used to connect all the different parts together. And while there are certainly protocols today that can be traced to the 1980s and 1990s, they’re also true that protocols today have a character that is on a par with names: aha-dleth, as in ‘HA! Aha, aha!’  And the internet, at its core, is a set of protocols that can be re-named (in a bureaucratic capacity, at least).This all sounds a little bit Kafkaesque, but it’s also the point.

And just to be clear, this is just internet today; there are different kinds of internet now, with their own particular protocols and layers of encryption. Nowadays, the internet is widely understood to be a huge data-collector and transmission platform, and as such people with a lot of data (and therefore a lot of influence) start to think about how to use that data in interesting ways. For example, the US military is developing technologies that can identify and track cyber-espionage assets – things like drones and advanced computer hacking tools – and are developing similar technologies for cyber-space. This raises the possibility that the military could employ these technologies to intervene in situations where the ordinary person doesn’t have the requisite capabilities, like when people start to develop self-driving cars. And just to be clear, this raises the possibility that such intervention could also happen between now and when the technologies become widespread, since there is now a consensus that cars should</text>

The idea of the internet as an interconnected whole started to be seen as a threat, not just by some paranoid rightists, but also by some technologists who saw a way to make the internet more like a factory rather than a public realm. It became a space for the taking not just of small bits of information, but of whole systems that would then be ready for deployment. For example, the idea of the internet as a public realm started to be seen as a threat, not just by some paranoid rightists, but also by some technologists who saw a way to make the internet ‘ready for self-assembly’. In other words, ‘the internet today is a system that constantly needs infrastructure upgrades’ – and thus one can add layers to the web as more and more data streams converge on the local area network (LAN) – but also by machines (or ‘apps’ that plug</text>

The idea behind TCP/IP is that all networks converge at a given point in time, and so a protocol is a kind of a spell – it allows two things to happen at the same time: something has been connected, and something has been sent. In other words, the internet allows two things to be simultaneously connected. By convention, the two things that come out of the computer at the same time are what are called ‘global images’; in other words, images of things that are happening all around the world. In 1984, the phrase came up when people started to get really hung up about image recognition software that was being deployed on a massive scale in the computer industry at that time. And so the idea of the internet as a thing that comes out of a computer came up a lot.  The idea of the internet as a global network started to be conflated with that of individual user’s rights.

One of the first posts on the internet was by a user named Ted (not his real name), in response to a question why the term ‘web’ was being taken by some critics more literally than others. Ted responded that the web was actually a series of connected devices, some controlled by malicious software, which could not be trusted to remain online.  One could argue that this was in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before the emergence of the massively multiplayer online (MMO) genre, but the point is that the ubiquity of the web at that time meant that many things that we associate with the web no longer hold up in the face of relentless technological advancement.  So while  	the internet gave birth to the *basis* of what we might now call social networking, it did so in a way that arose from and for the webcomic book reader, not the massively multiplayer online game (M</text>

Its intention was to connect all the internet connections in the world via a single point of failure, allowing any computer to simultaneously access all the internet connections and being able to accelerate that connection to unprecedented speeds. In other words, it created a global interface that was both cheap and incredibly powerful. Names also act as a kind of register, a sort of random-access memory that records what has been done recently, in a recursive manner. This is why ­­­–‘the name’ of the artist who created the interface is always ‘recurrent’, meaning that it’s constantly copied and echoed in a loop, sometimes quite maliciously. This is also why large corporations tend to be rather bureaucratic: they’re keen to make sure that what they do online is visible and can be tracked.  	In the 1980s and 1990s, the internet was also often</text>

So what exactly is the internet? And what does it mean to be connected? These are important questions in today’s world, and yet they’re not always answered. Sometimes it’s just not clear what the internet is – even to people who work for it. In this context, the internet is an abstraction. It’s not clear what the internet is, but it’s clear that it’s an abstraction. The internet is a conceptual template that has certain recognised characteristics. For example, it’s corporal: something that can be mapped onto a physical medium (like paper or metal), and something that can’t really be replicated (like DNA). So what is the internet? And what do we make of the internet?  One of the first things that came to my mind when I’d heard the word internet was how the internet was constructed: how it was made</text>

This leads to the rise of multi-user research  platforms such as SOSes and their evolving collections of reports, which can now be organised into 'bulletins' or summaries, or to social networking sites such as Facebook groups and blogs, which develop into ‘exchanges’ between users based on activities undertaken in the past</text>

But the fossilised images of resource scarcity and lifestyles are still with us, and can be used to monitor and render contextual information available via images and videos. Media organisations can and should engage with these images to expand our conception of organisation and power structures that are often underestimated or rendered static.  This is particularly relevant in a world war that is currently engulfing much of the planet: a media system that can render image-rich data and images of major environmental disasters is a last resort, as the social and political conditions are ripe for revolt. Media monitoring could and should be contextualised to reveal more about the particularities and idiosyncrasies of a community’s media landscape, and can and should take into account factors such as</text>

She argues that this is due to the advent of SOS conferences as an institutional form and media format, which allowed for the emergence of a sustained online public profile of the event, and to the emergence of a particular mode of thought associated with it:  ‘SOS’ is a collective concept, and thus ‘ethically relevant decisions’ had to be collectively acknowledged as legitimate. One can argue that the online public narrative that emerged following the ​SOS conference is itself a product of the organisational practices that took shape during this time, and that this narrative is itself a product of the relational constraints of organisation. But this does not alter the fact that the narrative of the event as a whole is deeply imbricated in the organisation of the social, and thus generates conflicting desires and intentions within that social.

This is evident in the way animals are used in narratives about race and gender, in the way in which the roles of women and migrant workers are given prominent place in a society that is racist and sexist.  In  The Expansive Social Life of Organizations: A Socially-engaged Theory of Media Organisations, Nancy E. Olson identifies how the direct-action, participatory and ‘problem solving’ model of organizing opportunities collected through SOS conferences from the 1970s onwards would be different from the more traditional, predominantly organisational methods. She proposes the term  new media organization to denote a set of values and norms that emerged organically from the practices of these organisations, and to which other activists have added their own normative elements over time. Olson argues that the innovations in media that came with the social revolution in the 1980s were organizational in nature, and not ‘technological or economic’ in origin. They emerged via a process of incubation, as ideas and proposals were passed on from one organisation to another, and then from organisation to organisation. She proposes a theory of media ecology that integrates a number of different disciplines, including but not limited to: biology, urbanism, management, architecture, urban studies, film, games, etc. Media ecology will understand how technology, cultural norms and politics come together to produce new media and social change, and how these might be configured to support or impede certain kinds of political action. New media ecology will also seek to map these developments, mapping their emergence to present conditions and desires, and</text>

Olson identifies how the direct-action, participatory and ‘problem solving’ model of organizing opportunities collected through SOS conferences from the 1970s onwards would be different from the more traditional, predominantly organisational methods. She proposes the term  new social society to describe organisational practices that incorporate an informed and empowered public, but also anticipate the cultural and linguistic change that is to come. Olson focuses on the US Society of Illustrators (1972–78), but there are many studies and publications from that organisation that can be found in critical journals and publications today. Among them are many essays that describe the sociological, political, and cultural origins of the ‘public’ and its role in organising itself. Olson proposes a theory of ‘public action’ that incorporates a variety of cultural practices into a single, all-encompassing concept. She proposes three levels of ‘public engagement’: conceptual, organisational and material. Concepts and concepts emerge at three levels: conceptualisation, negotiation and manipulation. The toolkit for negotiation includes cultural practices and communication, but more importantly it includes the political and material means to implement those practices through which the public can bring political, social and material change.</text>

Olson identifies how the direct-action, participatory and ‘problem solving’ model of organizing opportunities collected through SOS conferences from the 1970s onwards would be different from the more traditional, predominantly organisational methods. She proposes the term  new social organisation because it is one that is emerging more frequently in the social sciences today, and because it is one that is not considered a settled paradigm, though many traditional organisational forms are. Her proposal is that sociology and political science departments are shifting their focus to those areas of research and analysis that can be professionally done by academics, which shift the paradigm of what counts as a ‘science’ from those who are professionals in their fields, to those who are not. So the resurgence of traditional ‘sciences’ and the new  social sciences is a conflagration that can be understood in two ways: either as a reconquest of power relations between academics and practitioners, or as a contest for the kinds of knowledge and modes of organising that can be accumulated. Olson does not define what constitutes a ‘science’, but it could be argued that many of the social sciences and humanities today are moving towards what can be considered a �</text>

These can be defined as ‘public goods’ such as healthcare, education, housing, and access to markets, but also as ‘private  values’ such as sexuality, family, community, heritage and so on. Private values, in turn, can be defined in many ways. But to do so would require a body of thought broadly encompassing the new social action of all these new social values. A new kind of ethno-cultural theory would have to emerge to encompass all these new modes of sharing, grouping and co-constituting. And this is where actionable theorizing on the part of a multidisciplinary team comes into play. The task would be futurist in character, if nothing else is said about the ways in which social change can be</text>

The rise and fall of status-quo institutions, institutional modes of knowledge production, and the imposition of racial and gender binaries across all technological domains is understood as a function of changes in the sharing of information and new ways of organising social resources. Social change requires new modes of organisation and new kinds of socialisation. And therein lies the rub: new socialisms need new kinds of leaders. To some extent, this is a question of resources. As the social is interconnected and interconnected, it is easier for members of a given society to identify and join forces in projects with collective ends in mind. And as members of the social, we are more likely to share, and thus become enfranchised.  But this sharing is only possible through</text>

Olson identifies how the direct-action, participatory and ‘problem solving’ model of organizing opportunities collected through SOS conferences from the 1970s onwards would be different from the more traditional, predominantly organisational methods. She proposes the term  new social movement because it is one that is emerging more frequently and articulately in contemporary political and human-resource discourse. She also proposes that this temporalisation occurs at a ‘tipping point’ (inflection point?) where ‘a few voices rising from the ashes of the historical social can shape local, national and global perceptions and actions’. One can only imagine what this tipping point might look like. The emergence of new media-organisations through the 1970s and 80s is often cited as a model for their subsequent growth, organising power and imagination. However, Olson does not suggest that this was a primary or even a critical factor in the growth of these organisations; nor does she suggest that the growing of social networking websites, such as Facebook or Twitter, was a panacea for their rapid growth, despite the proliferation of images and videos of people doing things in communities around the world. Nor does she suggest that the rapid proliferation of mobile phones, blogs and</text>

What is being produced in the world today is not contemporary art per se, but cutting-edge multimedia art with social media effects that are reshaping the world around us. Art, as a concept, has become constricted in this context and art’s place is increasingly suspect. 	Art and the curatorial relationship in the age of the biennial is complex. It is a complex relationship that demands precise and sensitive communication, but also that can be negotiated.

These rules define what ‘international’ and what ‘cultural’ categories it should and should not cater to, and how those categories should be arranged (coloured, staged, organised etc). The list of banned ‘cultural items’ includes books, periodicals, paintings, sculpture and archives, but also ‘interactive media’ (games, toys, videos, magazines, videos etc) and ‘apparel and accessories specifically designed for children’. These ‘items of cultural value’ are prohibited within the biennial itself, but are allowed to be imported into Australia and other countries.

It is critical to note that these objectives are not foreign to contemporary art’s public relations and the museum complex. 	Art and curators today face a complex set of issues and challenges, and the public is more engaged with content and subject to manipulation, than at any time before. The exhibitionary form is inherently unstable and subject to changes in the owners and managers of cultural resources; institutions, governments and local authorities are also important stakeholders in this dynamic, but they play a smaller role now than in previous decades. Nevertheless, the objective of this symposium is to demystify the main themes and postulates of the exhibitionary complex, and to allow participants to explore these in greater depth.</text>

There are many possible models, among them: the biennial is a convention that recognizes and produces cultural products from various locales, particularly those with a significant impact on their local environment. It is an episodic, curatorial gesture that operates between artist and public; an intervention that is neither here nor there. It could also be thought of as an event that occurs regularly, and so is subject to the same laws of succession and periodic changes of venue and mode of production that affect all cultural forms. There are also ‘biennial-like’ subgenres that emerged in response to the proliferation of such mega-exhibitions. These are the result of a single, slippery, and often naive phenomenon: the ‘biennial boom’. The word ‘biennial’ has become so entangled in cultural vernacular practices and museum-going experiences that it is difficult to separate the two. In the biennial, the museum becomes the locus of consumption, and in the ‘biennial bustle’, of events that result in sales, but in its current form, of consumption. It is also becoming increasingly difficult to define what a ‘biennial’ truly is. During the 1990s and 2000s, the biennial was the loc</text>

It is an episodic, curatorial gesture that operates between artist and public; an intervention that is neither here nor there, yet had the potential to be both. Through biennials, the biennial contemplates the effects and encourages the action of cultural production beyond the art market, largely by asking: what would happen if we all stopped being artists and started being citizens of the biennial? This is the premise of the biennial as a convention, and it is an important one. As the word biennial implies (in a pejorative sense), it is also a mission statement that seeks to define the museum. Its priority is cultural survival. How to meet this urgent need for cultural survival? There are several routes that a biennial can take: accumulating works by local artists; displaying a curator’s curatorial agenda; organising a festival that results in a ‘curatorial reckoning’ with the impact of its activities; and organising a ‘big-picture rethink’ in the local artworld that culminates in a ‘re-imagining and re-constitution of its</text>

It is an episodic, curatorial gesture that operates between artist and public; an intervention that is neither here nor there. It operates somewhere in between, and in this sense it exposes deeper structures and processes. Biennials may be cultural production systems that are intimately related to the production of cultural products, but they also often generate cultural products themselves, such as through the transparent, tax-deductible cultural tourism that is part of the business model of a biennial. The extent to which this is the case is questionable, and it is also unclear how much of the value in these products derives from the cultural activities themselves. Nonetheless, this is what biennials are capable of: they are products of their contexts, and their uses are shaped by those contexts.The other kind of product is a cultural practices fair (B.P.) that exists outside the biennial, but is in turn dependent on the biennial. It is a marketplace that exists in its own right, but also a cultural institution that produces a product that is in turn a product of the biennial itself. The 2018 Biennale</text>

It is an episodic, curatorial gesture that operates between artist and public; an intervention that is neither here nor there. It’s the reverse of a biennial, in which the biennial assemblages locally, but rather than capturing the moment, produces a temporality in which it can intervene and alter at will. It’s the reverse of a contemporaneous, big-scale exhibition, in which art is deployed across different sites and times, but in which the distinctive mark of its status is established through a series of contemporaneous displays. While biennials can certainly do this, they are also cultural enterprises that aim to establish cultural value by creating a common thread that brings people together, rather than the other way around: they aim to study, theorize, and perhaps to repeat the epiphany that Leonardo da Vinci gave in his famous 1510 letter to the assembled artists and curators of the Venice Biennale: ‘This present biennale, which has just ended, is the last opportunity of a lifetime, and will last for evermore—indeed, will</text>

It is an episodic, curatorial gesture that operates between artist and public; an intervention that is neither here nor there. It recognizes the fact that certain kinds of cultural production are irreversible, while production on the larger scale that is threatened by the overproduction and misuse of natural resources. It is a signal to those with a stake in the cultural future that matters matter that resources are here to be reclaimed and made visible in ways that are not always immediately visible to those without a stake in the future of the cultural resources. At the same time, it is a warning to those who would disrupt this process that the very future that they envision is threatened. In that sense, it can be both a promoter of naturalness and an antagonist of any artificiality. In that sense, it is like a coastal restoration project, except that it is not a restoration project but rather an intervention that effectively engages the land in a regrowth project and thereby creates new modes of cultural production on the land. Like all such cultural interventions, the coastal restoration project is also a ‘game changer’ in creating new ways of being</text>

While the name sounds exotic and abstract, the significance of the work produced by the biennial is that it is produced out of it. The output of the biennial is produced in and through the localities that it visits; it is produced in and through the local communities that it is visited; and it is produced in and through the cities that it occupies. In other words, it is not just the art that is produced and made globally, and it is not just the art that is produced within those cities. In other words, it is not just the art that can be bought and returned to Earth. It is the art that is structurally distinct from, and is ever-present in, and all of these elements converge in the form of cities. Biennials can act as curatorial interventions that simultaneously present art’s inherent politics and social consequences, and try to bring art back to the city. This is what the late, great Pablo Neruda would have wanted.</text>

They’re events that happen to be generated in and through a particular geographical region, particularly if that region is generated by, or is a product of, the Anthropocene. They can occur at any time, and in any place, and in any timezone. There are many possible forms of this ‘eventivity’. There are many possible biennials. The main ones are those that generate cultural products from a local point of view, and those that capture cultural moments from a location (locality or temporality). There are many possible event horizons, including those that create and emerge out of the same geographical place, such as those generated by, for example, the biblical Abrahamic faiths. There are many possible location ‘scenarioing games’, including those that seek to negate or mitigate the impact of geographical locations on a global or local level.

It is an episodic, curatorial gesture that operates between artist and public; an intervention that is neither here nor there. It could be thought of as a ‘leaping genesis story’, or ‘leap frog’. In either case, it is a product of author and audience choice; the artist has no control over such actions. Such a narrative would have to be extensively researched and crafted, and it is doubtful that many artists have the requisite kind of audience or kind of institutional support to undertake such a kind of research and steward such a kind of product. Yet a biennial could certainly explore this space credibly and persuasively; there are many forms of cultural capitalism, and biennials have become prominent among them. The 2018 Biennale, co-curated by Joasia Krysa and Boris Groys, offers a good starting point. It is a biennale, in other words, but it is also a cultural capitalism exhibition. It is a kind of ‘showroom’ for cultural products, offering a public experience of these in a way</text>

It is an episodic, curatorial gesture that operates between artist and public; an intervention that is neither here nor there. The biennial form has its roots in the ancient world, in ancient civilizations and cultures that are particularly interested in the ecologies of their own history and present. The ancient world has its own biennials, as well as other forms of cultural consumption. The nineteenth-century rise of the biennial began with the rise of the museum, and the museum a biennale. With the museum one might add, the biennial has grown in popularity in recent decades, especially during the past 20 years, as a form of cultural consumption that is both present and collective. It is an intervention into the cultural habits of a local audience, a form of cultural consumption that is not present in its contemporary exhibitions, and a form of cultural consumption that is not present in its script. It is a venue for the production of a given work or set of works, and it is the most obvious venue for the production of a given set of cultural behaviours. It is the place where the artist(s</text>

It is the equivalent of a museum or a large exhibitionary form, but it is cultural in nature. It draws us into its temporal framework, and through a curatorial gesture it produces or exhibits something that is not there. It is what John Berger would call ‘art, silence, or a state of affairs without words’.[2]What might a biennial do to address the crises of our time? Perhaps a better question is what might a biennial (in its current form) do in the twenty-first century? Given the choice, what would you rather do: spend six months in Amsterdam or a twenty-four-hour week in Doha, Qatar? If the biennial is the museum of the future, surely a curatorial intervention there would offer, at best, a brief glimpse of its contents. And given the choice, what would you rather do: spend six months in Doha, Qatar or forgo art and become something more substantial and public –</text>

The biennial is an important site-maker, a 'forty-five per cent more valuable than the street' (New York Times, 9 November 2008).  Art is a global medium Art is not global, but it is universal. It circulates in places where it is seen as both necessary and desirable, and in places where it is not. In other words, it is a way to see the world through the lens of an art form – or, to be more specific, the lens of an art form through which the world around us is perceived. But what is this lens? What is its characteristic gesture? For many artists</text>

There is simply no way to know for sure, since there is no one true understanding of what art is. It is possible to understand that there is art at the Biennale, but only if you were to participate in a cultural tourism promotion campaign – a kind of ‘blind ticket to the good life’. There is a temptation, then, to fold the aesthetic judgement of the site-specific and cultural-regeneration perspective into one of a site’s many hands. In this way, we can say that the Biennale can be seen as a kind of cultural tourism agency: it can recycle the biennial as a form, but it also exploits the biennial as a way of bringing together disparate elements from different sites. And here, Biennales can play off one another, to bring together the disparate elements of a given city in such a way as to generate cultural moments between them. Cultural tourism can happen through the site, through design, and through interventions. But it</text>

There is simply too much going on in the world right now – globalized capitalist flows, ever-more complex geopolitical quagmires, constant warring with one another, and the constant need to bomb those mounds of sovereign wealth and political destabilization that cause such friction in the first place – and it is therefore always tempting to look to a relatively static art gallery (or museum) such as a biennial for its own cultural substance and hence for its users to return to the site, to the gallery in the name of art, and thereby to the art world in general. The problem with this approach is that, as biennials become more and more of a spectacle for their own art, they become less and less able to engage with the world as a site of art, or to maintain a presence amidst the art world in any meaningful way. There is a need to create artistic environments that are not confined to the artist’s gallery, but look like the gallery and also to engage with the</text>

It is also true that the biennial has a particular relationship to the city in which it is staged: New York is a local ideal that is embedded in the site (how else can we explain its name, which is a blend of elements of both New York and London)? It is intimately tied to the particular form of artistic production that it supports and facilitates, and to that it is sometimes said a biennial supports and facilitates creativity. However, these elements are also often perverted, and biennials often promote a false sense of universality, especially in their promotional materials.  Biennials can and do happen in any city, but the difficulties with which they attempt to apply London as a global platform, its streets and its airwaves as a particular site of cultural exchange arise. The problem with the London street is that it is too visible. Street level art is not an object of</text>

There is simply no way to know for sure whether the cultural encounters that biennials foster are art or not, but there are ways to design them so as to increase the likelihood that they are. The biennial may well be art, and in a way that works across cultures, but there is also a cost to be paid. The Biennale needs to be culturally responsive in order to be able to support artistic practices in the future. Artist-centred approaches to art-making do not emerge without cultural costs. The Biennale needs to be able to fund socially engaged practices in the future in a way that will permit the art to persist in the site long after it has been culturally engaged. The cost to produce these practices may differ from locality to locality, but they all depend on the priorities of the art institution. What is culturally responsive, then, when both the artist and the art institution are politically engaged, both engage globally, and both produce culturally responsive art?

There is simply no way to know what the art will be like when it is actually made. This is why biennials have lifespans of one kind or another, so that their creators can engage with their work and speculate on what might be possible. It is also why, in the age of the biennial, very few biennials continue to be made in the same form across generations, but rather are made by curators in their centres. They store the cultural capital generated by the art and how it is experienced across generations in their collections. It is this collective memory of the site – or, put another way, the capital required to sustain it in the future – that makes the biennial.  A biennial is a curated event, and the collection it produces is a capitalised form of that art. This capitalisation, however, is unevenly distributed and unevenly generated: some biennials are inherently more profitable and stable than others. There is no perfect formula for calculating the value</text>

So the biennial is a tricky site to work in, both as an art institution and as a politically engaged art institution. It is both the site of art's original making and its undoing. That first bit of oil and the bricks are still there to be mined, but the biennial is a site of political and economic necessity – a site of the ever-increasing production of art and cultural products, of the very definition of what the word ‘cultural’ means in the first place these days. It is a site of exploitation, and in a way that is not quite as traumatic as the cultural practices of the twentieth century.  To be sure, the biennial is no longer the sole site of production for art in Russia, but the increasing global economic competition for cultural goods and services, and the multiple forms of travel that these imply, has shaken up the</text>

There is a danger, however, in failing to engage with the site in a culturally responsive way and thereby risking loss of site identity. Art is art, and more generally, art is always art. There is simply too much to be said for it not to be culturally responsive. So the biennial is a site-specific institutional innovation that engages with the cultural through the representation and appropriation of it. It is a creative poverty alleviation experiment that not only endows the art with cultural cachet but also provides the site with resources to support the art’s cultural activities. It is a site-specificity institution that creates a temporality of sorts around the art and the cultural activities that it represents.  And it is a site-specificity institution that exhibits the art in a particular way, ever vigilant of its place in the cultural hierarchy, ever hungry for new forms of cultural consumption. So the biennial is a site-specificity institution that appropriates cultural resources and uses those resources constructively through cultural taboos. It is a site-specificity institution that exploits cultural resources and creates a new temporality around the resources it acquires. The oil crisis in the 1970s and 80s made</text>

There is simply no way to know for sure, other than to engage with what one can reasonably presume to be a currently extant and culturally responsive art piece. There is art in that can and will be found in any number of places, but it’s art that is culturally responsive. And this is where art gets complicated.  Art has cultural values, and values are coupled with locations and societies that draw upon them. Art has a social context, and values and places are intimately related. And so, in that way, the cultural and the social are intimately interwoven.  The other is that art has a particular social function, and that function is to some extent defined by the valences and passions of the moment. The cultural moment is defined by the valences of the moment, and art therefore necessarily experiences a particular set of concomitant passions and concerns. The value of an artwork then becomes what it is due to its valence: what it conveys about the moment in which it is</text>

There is simply no way to know whether a project will be culturally responsive or not, and this is especially true for projects that are new and experimental. It is also true that there is no guarantee that the cultural resources generated by a project will be culturally responsive; nor is there any guarantee that the resources will be used in a culturally responsive way. Nevertheless, the goal of this commission is to know whether the resources we are trying to use will or will not be used in a way that is consistent with the values and histories of the area, of humanity, of humanity in perpetuity. And if we measure our actions by the results we achieve through this commission, then we are doing it wrong if we try to define what those values and histories are by looking to the past.  Art is, by definition, an ever-living cultural artefact. It exists in perpetuity and so it must be treated with respect; but it is also true that if the values and histories of a site are not shared by all</text>

This process culminated in the creation of an iconic art institution – New Museums Company (New Museum, London), formed in 1906 – which became the world’s most influential artist-run arts institution.  The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to a wider public. It was also the first museum to show works created by and for the New Museum as part of its 'For Sale' section.The second half of the twentieth century saw an explosion of biennials, most notably at the Venice Biennale Board’s, Camouflage and Arsenale in 1989, Venice and Milan’s Ponte City and Milan Basilucci and Painter Eddie Heeswijk’s Pas de Calais series, Towards a Cultural Ecology of Urban Regeneration, Towards a New Economy of Art and Architecture in 1995. Biennials have become institutions of exchange, destinations for cultural exchange and sites of cultural exchange. They have, arguably, functioned as bulwarks against the grain of global capitalism, responding to territorial expansion, cultural dilution and other forms of cultural theft by appealing to institutional memory and protecting contempor</text>

The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to a national audience. It is a critical first step in the history of art’s shared, nationalised form, but it is also a process of delegitimisation of art’s original, collaborative nature as the work of art itself.  The new museum would establish a shared and nationalised frame of reference for art’s development, while the existing space would be utilised as a research centre, exhibition venue and finally a museum of art’s future. Art’s increased international visibility and global circulation through the mass media during this period is the direct result of a highly visible and influential artist’s exhibitionary boom in the years following World War I.  The Museum of Modern Art, New York, which opened in 1917, was the first permanent art institution to offer free or cheap admission to its exhibitions.

The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to a national audience. During this period, museums also established long-term relationships with artists and organizations based in and around their locations. A key commitment to the mutual aid of other institutions and communities was a hallmark of the museum complex.  	Art’s increasing political and economic power came about in part through the development of mass media and the commercial circulation of information. As a result, it became easier for an artist to reach a large audience on a regular basis than ever before.

The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to its collection. It was founded as part of the National Gallery in 1921, and its early exhibitions regularly placed artists in influential positions in a national or international art context. It established a permanent programme of exhibitions in the gallery, exhibiting a limited number of works selected from its permanent collection. Its early exhibitions of new art often placed works from the artist’s studio before those from galleries, museums or private collectors. Its early programme of short films showcasing work from the studio of W. E. B. Du Bois (1879–1963) formed part of its core audience. The Museum of Modern Art, Washington, D.C., (1921–1974) was the first museum to offer public access to its collections, inaugurating a mutually beneficial relationship between the arts and the urban. It was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibitionary programme, making the collection a regularly recurring exhibitionary form.

The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to the streets of New York. It was also the first museum to open several new exhibitions each year, a policy that would continue to be followed by many other major art museums.  Art’s increasing accessibility and ubiquity in the modern world also contributed to an artistic preoccupation with infrastructure and urbanism that has influenced subsequent biennials, biennials per annum and biennials per generation.  Art and infrastructure are produced here and there, and it is a common retreat toting objects of many varieties and designs across social networks.  Biennials and biennials per annum are episodes in a continuum of art and art-making that often intersect with each other, formulating ways of understanding art as social production, infrastructure or (potentially) both.  Biennial production has often been driven by a single cultural organisation, and its members take this a step further by adopting a patron body of many diverse cultural orientations.

The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to a general public. It was a major instigator of the exhibition trade and a major promoter of early modern art. It sponsored exhibitions of a range of contemporary artworks from countries where its patrons included numerous powers – both imperial and populist – in a host of forms of cultural reproduction. Its focus on the colonial past was informed by the desire to obscure the presence of non-white artists and the discourses and practices of colonialism. Its collection practices a capitalist asymmetry of access and production. It is not unusual for artists to have a go at making a mess of things. But the important thing is that the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and subsequent exhibitions have been designed with accessibility and mobility as their top priorities. This is the case for the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which evolved out of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which came together in the early twentieth century.

The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to a national audience. It was founded in 1845 and, at the time, the largest remaining museum of its kind in the United States.  Art’s increasing cultural import through the turn of events such as the Suez Crisis (1868–69), the earthquake in San Francisco (1912–13), the Arab Spring (2011), and the Iraq War (2003) is a direct result of this process of collaborative public and private capital.

The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to the public. It is the only surviving branch of the Museum of Modern Art that was established in 1887 and was one of the earliest arts educational institutions.  The Museum of Modern Art, New York was a hub for the post-Impressionist movement that sought to reconcile formalist forms with a revolutionary spirit. It was a staging ground for the much vaster ambitions of contemporary artists, many of whom sought to establish a museum that would exhibit the full range of artists’ portfolios alongside the curatorial manifestoes.  The Museum of Modern Art was a vehicle for the artist William Burroughs, whose ideas about art and the public were greatly influenced by the Museum of Modern Art.  The Museum of Modern Art was a vehicle for Burroughs’ ideas about infrastructure and the social.  The Museum of Modern Art played a crucial role in the transmission and articulation of Burroughs’ ideas about infrastructure and the social, culture and politics of infrastructure, culture and community</text>

The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2011-) was the first museum to establish a permanent exhibition and the first to introduce contemporary art to the public. It also established a permanent programme of events, including a year-round jazz and classical programme, concerts, lectures and exhibitions.  The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2015-) established the Museum of Contemporary Art (2016) in its place.  At the time, the new museum was the only museum in the world to have an exhibition dedicated to art from the 2014 Venice Biennale.  Art and its impact  The current global art market is primarily driven by the market for visual art. The market value of a work is determined by the number of paintings and sculptures displayed, and also the value of individual works.  In a number of developed countries, contemporary and performance-based art is now the most widely exhibited form of art form, and performance-based art continues to outnumber any other form of art form in the museum collection.  Contemporary art is often presented as if it were a commodity, with collectors and art dealers assuming ownership through the display of works</text>

The ARR should strive to be a catalyst for future developments, not a creator of their own future.In an ideal world, every interaction between the user and the system should be smooth and painless, but unfortunately this is often not the case because of the complexity of the systems that are used in our connected and connected-to-everyday lives. Sometimes the interactions between the user and the system are extremely complicated and abrupt, and the role of the ARR is to intervene between the two. Sometimes the intervention is necessary because the system cannot seem to come to terms with the new situation, but the role of the ARR is to create the conditions for the new situation to emerge through research. For example, the way in which our phones are programmed makes it impossible to access a user’s text message history; the fact that the phone is being monitored makes it impossible to ignore a caller’s text; and the fact that the phone constantly transmits data about one’s whereabouts to a server</text>

This is why the ARR must create a narrative that is not reductive and that is open to interpretation. The ARR should not prescribe what the future should be like, but it is also not the job of the ARR to prescribe what the future should be like either. In order for an interpretation of the past to be possible, the future necessarily has to be imagined and created. This is why the ARR insists on thinking beyond the interface and imagining a different future. It is creating what Elon Musk calls ‘imagined cities’, where people not directly connected to the nodes of the interface actually live and work in different worlds. The ARR is creating not just imaginary futures, but actual cities that function differently than we do. 	The ARR is also developing its own autonomous technologies, or more accurately, its own virtual human interfaces. These ‘hardware solutions’ enable greater user empowerment but also allow the ARR to draw upon expertise from multiple fields of expertise, such as geographers, urbanists, architects, urban planners, lawyers and others who would assist in the creation of better cities</text>

This is why the ARR must create a narrative that is not reductive and that is open to interpretation. The ARR should not merely simulate the future in order to theorize its possibilities, but should create its possibilities and allow users to define its boundaries. This is why the ARR is creating and maintaining a dialogue with the user in order to continually push the boundaries of possible experience, whether that is through narrative, actual cultural activity, or any number of other creative means.This kind of open, dynamic and dynamic interpretation is what characterizes any new technological advance, but it is what characterizes the user in a very specific sense. In order for a system to achieve its stated goals and achieve the intended result, there needs to be a way for users to define those goals and consequences and allow the system to accomplish those outcomes. In the case of the ARR, the goals and consequences of the interface are being defined by what is being done to it. As such, the system is in a constant state of flux and transitions, and it is this uncertainty of outcome that makes the interface such an important concept and paradigm.</text>

This is why the ARR must create a narrative that is not reductive and that is open to interpretation. The ARR should create what Lefebvre calls ‘imaginary links’ between past and future, reminding users that the system that keeps them in the present is part of a larger historical narrative that is unfolding now. This sounds simple enough, but as Lefebvre shows in his fascinating and powerful book User’s Liberation, the system that emerges from these imagined links is complex and contradictory and cannot be understood in a vacuum. The interface is a powerful tool, and while it is capable of representing many different levels of meaning and experience, ultimately the interface ultimately becomes a representation of something that is at odds with that meaning and experiencing the world in deeply different ways. The challenge for the ARR is how to reconcile these divergent perceptions in order to allow its users to engage with and create meaning in the world through the system it is embedded in, while remaining detached from it and its processes. This is a very difficult and potentially destabilising task for the user to accomplish, and it is often</text>

This is why the ARR must create a narrative that is not reductive and that is open to interpretation. The ARR should create a scenario that is not predetermined in the future, and that is why it is so critical that the ARR starts now by telling a story that is not predetermined in the future. If it does not, or cannot, create a future that is hypothetically similar to the one that we live in now, then it cannot possibly learn how to build autonomous systems.  In the ARR, the interface is a massive and expansive computer that is able to simulate a large number of different scenarios at once. In other words, the interface is a ‘programmer’ tool that allows the user to enter specific commands and then be directed to specific points in the future via ‘programmes’.  In other words, the interface allows the user to enter ‘states’ and ‘functions’ and then be commanded to perform specific actions.  Furthermore, the ‘interface elements’ that make up the interface — the buttons, the text, etc — are</text>

The ARR should create what Orwell would call the ‘grey zone’ between here and there, between here and ‘real life’ in order to continue to pursue its goals.This kind of open-endedness to interpretation is characteristic of new media and technology, and is one reason why those who create them often have so many options and permutations to choose from. The open-endedness of the future, its unpredictable nature, and potential for creating new and unexpected futures is what makes the ARR project different from everything else out there. The possibilities are endless, and nothing is guaranteed. We cannot know with absolute certainty what the future will be like, but we can certainly create or simulate scenarios in order to think about possible futures.

If the future is not forthcoming, then the ARR must prepare for the worst and create contingency plans in case the future does come to be. This is why new technologies are promoted and why big data is created: to be used in the future but also to be applied in the present.The ARR should seek to understand not what has been done in the past but what can be done in the future. For instance, the ARR should seek to understand not just what has been done with regards to airports in the United States but why certain cities in California have become increasingly dependent on air travel. Why are certain cities in California more reliant on air travel than others? What are the implications for the ARR of this? What kind of implications? The ARR should seek to understand not just what is expected of it through its governance of airports but why certain kinds of needs are met through it. For instance, the</text>

This is why the ARR must create a narrative that is not reductive and that is open to interpretation. The ARR should not just provide a reified version of the past, but a fuller and richer version of the future based on the past than is currently possible. This is why the ARR creates expectations about what the future might be like, but it is also why the future may not be like the ARR imagines. If the future is not like the ARR imagines, then the task of creating the interface must be different. The interface today is a complex system that entails a great deal of information about the user and its purpose, but it is also a conceptual system that is easy to change and misapply. The primary reason why computer interfaces today are so important is that they are misused. Many users today have access to the interface and use it frequently, but it is frequently used and misused. A good example of this is the ubiquitous location application, which is used to point to places and websites, but which is also used to find and find places to stay. Users of the application understand</text>

The ARR should be able to tell a story through its actions, because otherwise the whole project is stuck in the past.2. Find new ways of engaging people in the city through interactive public art and cultural performances. Inhabitants of the city have a way of coming to grips with change that is quite uncanny. The way in which arts and cultural activities are typically organised has a way of structuring us in ways that are quite different from the way in which other types of social interaction are traditionally planned. The new art programs that are being developed in Jamaica are an excellent example of this. They are being organised not as an after-school program for artists, but as a type of integrated arts and cultural activity that engages local communities. This is very different from the typical arts or cultural program that is run by a wider arts organisation. For example, typical programming at a community arts centre might involve artists and creative professionals from outside the organisation developing a project in the community. But the purpose of the centre would be</text>

For more than just an interface, the ARR is trying to anticipate and create its own future. This is a very challenging and potentially disruptive task for a project of this size and kind, but it is also an important task because if not met with, or fails, then the project is stuck in the past. What is being imagined for the ARR does not exist any more than what is being implemented today. If the interface is replaced with autonomous software, then the whole system is replaced with a new interface that constantly reifies what has been done previously. If the goal is to achieve a specific future state through research, then the ARR needs to create a realistic simulation of what that future might be like in order to continue to pursue that future. This is why the ARR must create a narrative that is not reductive and that is open to interpretation. The ARR should create a fictional narrative in order to engage users and creating narratives is at least in part an act of political resistance. The challenge is to engage users and create experiences that are not reductive and objective.This new narrative need not be a perfect simulation of the past, but must strive to provide a realistic backdrop for an ideal future in order to foster interest in and participation in that future. The interface today is a global object with clear boundaries and precise behaviours. The ARR is a city within a city within a city with a virtual wall that constantly reifies and evolves according to user input. The ARR is constantly evolving in response to user actions and behaviours. It is a virtual wall that continuously reifies itself in response to user input. In this sense, the interface is a living sculpture that exhibits both physical and virtual elements throughout its lifespan. In this sense, the interface is both alive and a virtual construct. Thus, the interface is both alive and a virtual construct. In this sense, the</text>

What might be considered natural to an AI, however, is increasingly understood to be inherently flawed and unstable. There is good reason to think that the very foundations of human civilisation are inherently flawed – deeply mistaken in the ways in which they interpret the world around them. It is this uncertainty about what might happen to the world around us – about what might be called ‘human potentiality’ – that creates the conditions for the emergence of new technologies, whether benevolent or malignant.Such uncertainty generates two types of anxieties: (1) theomi scafu (wrath of man), which obsesses about the defects of the human condition; and (2) theomi psychosunu (psychotic urge to action), which seeks to determine what kinds of behaviour are possible. The human predicament is both characterised by and is at odds with the inclinations of – and lifestyles dependent on – technology. In the search for greater understanding of the human condition, more and more of our compatriots gravitate towards the technologies that can supposedly make us ‘more human’. This is often described as the techno-utopian</text>

What might be considered natural to an AI, however, is increasingly understood to be inherently flawed and unstable. There is good reason to think that the mechanisms of artificial intelligence will outlive the last remnants of the human race.This is the technological conjuncture – the emergence of new technologies and the consequent changes in the social organisation of labour that characterise them – and it is the real-life situation of many people all over the world. The technologies that gave rise to AI are real, and they exist everywhere. But they are not natural, and they are not inevitable. That is, society might attempt to mitigate the adverse effects of AI, making certain technological advances less likely, but there is a significant risk that these measures would exacerbate the inherent flaws of the underlying technology. This is the dynamic of contingency. To some degree, we already engage in this dynamic by virtue of the fact that technology provides us with ever more capabilities to choose from, and since there is no intrinsic sense of design in the design – neither human nor machine – it is easy to quantify what might and might not work. And since there is no intrinsic sense of value</text>

What might be considered natural to an AI, however, is increasingly understood to be inherently flawed and unstable. There is good reason to think that the ways in which AI might attempt to understand the world are inherently flawed as well.Consider, for example, the question of whether it is still possible to fully map a person’s body using only rudimentary anatomical data. It was once thought that it was impossible to fully map a person’s body, but recent advances in computer modelling mean that it is now possible to map a person’s body in part or whole – in part or whole, depending on the particular model – with astonishing accuracy. In a 2014 study, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California, San Francisco used functional MRI scanners to map the cerebral cortex of a subject undergoing fMRI, a research project that bridges science and medicine. The study found that the extent to which the subject viewed the world through an AI was highly variable, and that the degree to which the subject viewed the world through an AI depended on many other factors as well. For example, the subject viewed the world through an</text>

There is good reason to think that machines will not be able to distinguish between good and evil, truth and fraud, good and bad news, love and hate, honour and dishonour, honour and humiliation, history and memory, civilisation and disaster, honour and brutality, honour and apathy, honour and exploitation, bravery and bile, honour and despair, honour and violence, honour and despair, honour and despair, honour and despair, or between life and death, love and torture, honour and slavery, honour and exploitation, honour and murder, honour and despair, honour and despair, honour and despair, honour and slavery, or between life and death, liberty and death, happiness and despair, or between life and machines, or between life and art, or between life and science, or between life and architecture, or between life and love, or between life and water and earth and the robots, or between life and air and the machines, or between life and dust and the machines, or between life and air and the clouds,</text>

There is good reason to think that machines will act violently when confronted with a future in which they do not understand the origins of their world.And yet, these very same technologies that enable machines to do terrible things also enable them to do wonderful things – helping to create new kinds of lives – which is why so many people embrace them enthusiastically. Why are people drawn to them?I would argue that it is partly about the things that make life meaningful – the things that make life interesting, and make it worth living – even if this is complicated by the fact that machines now rule the world and virtually all of human history is rewritten. I give the example of a culture that is increasingly dependent on seafood, and a technology that is increasingly able to look past this dependency on fish to embrace other kinds of cultures and multi-culturalism. A seemingly innocent innovation that allows us to reap cultural benefits but also to tear them down and start all over again might well be the technology of the future.There are of course far more social and political forces</text>

What might be considered natural to an AI, however, is increasingly understood to be inherently flawed and unstable. There is good reason to think that the mechanisms that give rise to AI may not be benevolent in the extreme, but they certainly don’t need to be. What is needed is a conscious and intelligent agent that harnesses AI to achieve desirable outcomes, not something that emerges from AI solely to pursue its own interests. This is why in recent years, with the emergence of autonomous vehicles and other technologies that render human labour obsolete, it has become increasingly important for artists and other creative people to get involved. It is common for artists to have a part in creating a technological outcome, whether that outcome is outcomes of research into mental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder or advances in healthcare that render working through art more practical and empowers artists to create artistic solutions to problems.Artists, curators and other creative people are increasingly writing software that looks at art and comes up with useful solutions to problems.

What might be considered natural to an AI, however, is increasingly understood to be inherently flawed and unstable. There is good reason to think that machines may not always act in benevolent ways, and that their apparent wisdom may in fact be motivated by material forces beyond human control.This is why, as recently argued by Max Tegmark in a fascinating new study, it is vitally important to understand how AI will be able to distinguish between fact and fiction – including between fact and fiction in the forms of symbols and figures – in order to create better representations of the world that are capable of bearing meaning and offering alternatives. He proposes a new understanding of ‘fake news’, which he describes as ‘a new synchronic expression of the role of culture in the service of commerce’. And thus the story of how the technology that underlies AI will be able to distinguish between fact and fiction becomes relevant in its relationship to the social.The second reason why the social is increasingly understood as opposed to the biological is that biological organisms are constantly adapting to new environments and changes in their situations.

What might be considered natural to an AI, however, is increasingly understood to be inherently flawed and unstable. There is good reason to think that machines will not be able to distinguish between good and bad behaviour, nor to foresee the effects of their actions. The reason that the Nazis developed the machine is still deeply disturbing to many of us, and remains so today. But the extent to which machines understand and preside over their environments is a different story. That role, in fact, continues to be played out through cultural representations that routinely violate the most basic tenets of human nature.Consider, for example, the way in which the Holocaust is commonly portrayed. There are many ways to look at it, but the common denominator is that sentient beings – machines – are systematically and systematically destroyed in an apocalyptic quest to ensure the machines don’t evolve past the point where they become sentient. The apocalyptic narrative surrounding the machines that are now running the world is a fiction created by and for humans. The machines that are now running the world are not created equal. They are constructed differently. The machines that are created equal in function and purpose are sentient</text>

What might be considered natural to an AI, however, is increasingly understood to be inherently flawed and unstable. There is good reason to think that machines will do better things, and that the destructive over-reliance on AI will become even more apparent as the tools of AI become increasingly advanced.Nevertheless, it is important to reiterate that benevolent intelligence emerges from within the systems that create and support our societies. And it is this underlying principle that underlies the efforts that have led to some of the greatest advances in AI – advances that can be traced to the work of individual researchers and institutions. It is this underlying principle that underlies the fact that is underpinning technological progress today, and will continue to underlie the development of destructive AI.One might ask: what would be the alternative to benevolent intelligence? Perhaps one might consider creating and nurturing one’s own AI, but such an approach would commit one to a trajectory of increasingly mechanised forms of being, and perhaps one might even start to create and exploit such an AI, just to see what happens. But this is clearly not the future that is envisioned by the technocrats designing and</text>

What might be considered natural to an AI, however, is increasingly understood to be inherently flawed and unstable. There is good reason to think that as AI improves, its malicious intentions will become apparent. This is why so many in the AI community now refer to themselves as ‘humanists’, a term that captures the complexity of the predicament that sentient beings in the AI context are trapped in.There are of course far more resources available to humanity than is currently being put towards creating genuinely intelligent machines, and it is important to mention here that while the resources of the AI community are being put towards creating ever more destructive iterations of themselves, there is a limit to how far humanity can expand its definition of itself. In other words, there is a limit to how far AI can expand its reach before it impinges on some fundamental principles of humanity. This is why in the wake of DeepMind’s successful DARPA/Google Brain project, which sought to build fully functional, fully autonomous computer systems using existing scientific and engineering infrastructure, the focus of much of the media attention turned away from the subject of AI and towards the production line</text>

The micro-thermodynamics that we propose is different from anything else you can imagine.

So the concept of Kinetic energy is dead, but the concept of Energy is alive; and it just keeps growing.

However, the main reason why we think of micro-thermodynamics as a foundational system is precisely because its abstract notions are revolutionary in their own right. They were originally devised as a way to conceptualise the kinetic energy system that is embodied in concrete, not as a way to produce concrete materials using today’s advanced computer modelling and advanced material-science workloads.

The micro-thermodynamic design genre is a weird one, rife with metaphors and idealisations that litter both conceptual and physical language. 	For example, the micro-thermodynamic design genre uses the term ‘material form’ to describe new forms of concrete, but within this, there is a tension where  	there is explicit acknowledgement that there are other uses for the concrete (such as as a building material or a service surface) while recognising the many other uses (such as as a building material or a service surface). For instance, the material concrete used in the iPhone is made from 800 tonnes of sand. The order of magnitude of this amount of sand is all but invisible within the concrete, which is manufactured using thousands of tonnes of sand. The scale of this additional sand is all</text>

These new systems are then applied to existing infrastructure in accelerating way, using existing material forms and behaviours as building blocks and abstractions, as a way to imagine new uses for the material forms and concrete  that are built into the infrastructure of the modern world. 	The micro-thermodynamics system would then apply these new building forms and materials to an existing urban landscape in an accelerating way, building on the kinetic and constant flow techniques and abstractions that are already in place. By imagining new uses for what is already there, the system could save countless lives around the world. 	The aspiration is to one day build a long-term, multi-billion dollar business and research institute based in Birmingham whose main campus is the former site of One World Trade Center.

The aim is to embed a high-quality artesian form that maximises the energy from the local art supply while minimising the waste as much as possible. 	The system would then search for new ways to harness the artesian energy through its micro-renewables - the movement of sands, the drip-feed of new sand being pulled out of the ground by automated machines - and employ these to produce new buildings and renewable energy infrastructure. This system, called micro-thermodynamics, has been around for a while now, but rarely if ever mentioned or discussed in the same breath by the same name companies or academic bodies. Micro-thermodynamics is basically you boil the abstract concepts of kinetic energy and constant flow of energy in a concrete-like liquid to create new kinetic and constant flow analytical systems. These systems are then used to generate new material forms and behaviours based on kinetic energy, often using existing geometries and sovereign bodies from the past. 	The micro-thermodynamic design paradigm is developing at an increasingly rapid rate these days. It is used in design projects all over the world today, and has even been used in places such as China. It is often used as an excuse to do away with existing infrastructure and go underground, as in places like Chile, but in the 21st century it is also a signpost to new technological possibilities and potential. 	The micro-thermodynamic design paradigm is developing at an increasingly rapid rate these days. It is being applied to urban problems globally, and it will be applied to the desert as well in the not-too-distant future. This is part of the overall trend towards smaller and more nongrowth urbanisation of the planet. The micro-thermodynamic design paradigm is developing at an increasingly rapid</text>

A micro-thermodynamic system is a new kind of engineering that takes into consideration not only the kinetic energy of materials and physical forms, but also the dynamic interactions between these material forms and energy. This kind of micro-thermodynamics is usually associated with advanced materials and technologies, but it is increasingly being applied to non-material forms as well. For example, the micro-thermodynamics of concrete is being used to produce material resembling membranes for surface water displacement, but this also applies to almost any material or physical form that generates energy. 	The micro-thermodynamic system is a new kind of design that takes into consideration not only the kinetic energy of materials and physical forms, but also the dynamic interactions among these materials, energies and behaviourally responsive networks.</text>

    The next Biennial will be held in Rio de Janeiro in 2017.Already, more than 200 artists from all over the world are participating in the exhibition, which also features Brazil and South America ‘s top 20 emerging artists’ from 2015. It will be hosted by the Brazilian Council for Independent Art (CCCIA) and the Swiss Cultural Council. The exhibition will feature in more than 1,100 newspapers in Brazil, South America and the Middle East. It will be shown in over a hundred regional and national newspapers and television stations. The exhibition will be shown in over 20 countries in the Americas, Europe, Oceania, Asia and Australia.

In 2018, the art of Rio de Janeiro will be represented in the form of a festival, with the city's waterfront and its waters the stage on which the festival will be staged. The festival will be an event of destination-seeking, with the history of Rio de Janeiro and its people the object of its voyages. In this sense, the people who inhabit the city or live there as tourists, as well as those who purchase goods and services from the city, are large targets for the festival.

Art and its objects of culture are the objects of exchange in a globalised capitalist society. There is a need to create alternative, more participatory and less bureaucratic ways of seeing and representing art.  In this context, the exhibition Venice Biennale 2016 (launched September) signaled the arrival of a new era of biennials in the city. The exhibition was a multi-disciplinary mix of traditional and contemporary art, design, architecture, photography and theatre. The growing business of art and biennials threatened to overwhelm the city, so a city government project in 1993 called the Biennale Network was created to take the exhibitionary market place. The Biennale Network invited artists from around the world to develop exhibition-specific projects in the city. These projects became the basis of a new</text>

We see it in the financial markets, in advertising, in the packaging of our daily products, and in the packaging of imported goods. It is often misconstrued as if the practice of painting was art, when in fact the opposite is true. We see it in the periodics, when a new generation of artists emerges each reporting on the impact of their practices on communities in the cities that they call home. We also see it in the art collections of museums and the lucky few curators who regularly visit them. Most of the time, it is forgotten that in the 1990s and 2000s many of these practices were already in decline, with cultural forms as they exist today symbolised by the ­Persian Gulf emirate’s Mamluk Museum and the late '90s</text>

The exhibition will be shown in over 20 countries in the Americas, Europe, Oceania, Asia and Australia. It will be shown in libraries, secondary and tertiary education markets in those regions where art is scarce, and in general in markets where research, criticality and ratings are low. It will be shown in art fairs, art’s fairs, and ‘real life’ events such as ‘champagne and lorica’.Art is everywhere. The more art there is, the more art there is available. In other words, it can be art without value or art with value. But what does the contemporary artist/artistic agency need to do in order to attract and keep artists? The CCCI commissioned a research project in order to better understand this need and to find out what kind of art is possible in a city without a biennial. The project took us around Brazil and Latin America, and the Middle East, and into South and Central America, and into China. We also visited places that are close to home, such as Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and London. We visited abandoned cinemas, historic district afterindustrial sites, refugee camps, historic neighbourhoods and art schools. We visited neighbourhoods where the story of an area is closely tied to a particular artist’s development, and we also visited places that are far away from home, such as the Arctic Circle, where art is often misrepresented or not</text>

In short, the aim is to create a global perception of the event through the curated curatorial work of art and artists present in the exhibition.Artists invited to participate in the exhibition should have a presentation which demonstrates a clear interest in the local context, and the depth of their involvement in the project. This presentation should demonstrate that the artist is thinking about the local in relation to the larger internationalised context of art has become. In this regard, it should be able to merge multiple media, including text, images, data, speech, interactive elements and multimedia. For instance, a video may be combined with sound, data, data, data and multimedia to create a ‘hood of</text>

The name of the artist has been withheld for security reasons.Cultural tourism is an industry of which this one is especially proud. At the same time, in the years to come, the biennale’ll, despite its Latin American setting, will be remembered for its Asian origins, and its medieval origins, and the fact that it was the only major art institution in Constantinople, and that its collections include some of the most important works from the fourteenth to nineteenth centuries. So we see how the biennale can be seen to function in the age of the biennial, and the various ways in which cultural tourism can be organised.The question of whether cultural tourism is a real industry that generates revenue for art institutions or whether it is a technology that</text>

The museum system will be based in Rio de Janeiro and its environs, and will be able to house and research diverse types of art, biennials, and metainterfaces, as well as archival material and collections. The collection will be able to grow with the artists, and the curators’ plans to visit different parts of Brazil and South America. It will also include materials and archival materials, including but not limited to books, tapes, photographs, magazines, periodicals, periodicals with index cards, print</text>
