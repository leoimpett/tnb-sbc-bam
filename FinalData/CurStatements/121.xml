Cultural production is the heart of any industry, and the art of producing culturally responsive products is a vital skill set for any industry. 	However, as any self-made business owner will tell you, the art of making a product is a craft. The art of manufacturing a product is different. The art of manufacturing a product is production. And so it is with the art of making art. It is not art that creates value, but production that creates value. And so it is with cultural production. Culture is produced through the process of making, and so if an artist is capable of producing cultural outcomes through her work, then surely other creative individuals are capable of producing similarly valued outcomes through their work too? Creative individuals do indeed exist, and many talented individuals gravitate towards areas with a strong artistic bent, but there is a distinction to be made between producing value and producing art. And so there is a gap between the expectations of what artists are</text>

The Delft University of Technology students put their ideas into practice in the city in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the arts were often used to subvert or to mask the economic realities of city life. The art world didn’t pay much attention to the arts’ economic impact at the time, since the market was dominated by large companies and the art market was seen as a niche market. However, over the past fifteen years the art market has largely shifted to take into consideration the economic impact of art produced and maintained in large numbers in industrial</text>

But as of yet unproven, there is little sign of this in the public discourse. In fact, there is some debate about what exactly AI entails, with some arguing that it actually promotes creativity through its apparent intelligence. 	On the contrary, many business leaders and academics, myself included included, believe that an AI will ultimately lead to the perversion of human intelligence, to the weakening of human institutions and the glorification of absolute forms of AI. 	As of yet unproven, there is some debate as to how to define and address these new kinds of threat. But broadly speaking, it is clear that those with a grudge against humans will find a way to work around any weakness or vulnerability presented by an AI. 	There is a danger, though, in over-emphasising the singularity and neglecting</text>

The exhibition was, in fact, created as a ‘test case’ for the Biennial in other cities, using this city as a case study. Given the importance of this particular exhibition, and the way in which it was designed to be experienced, it is worth asking if there were any lessons for the Biennial to learn from its own difficult first year, when it came to terms with the massive scale of the project and the city’s potential as a site for the exhibition itself. Perhaps the lesson for the Biennial is that it is capable of engaging with its own form while remaining incredibly conscious of the task at hand, while simultaneously maintaining the distinctively human quality of the ever-shifting target of making the city real for visitors as well as residents of the city. This seems particularly difficult in today’s</text>

The latter group is being funded by the Biennial, so it’s not like they’ve said, ‘You’ve Never Visited a Liverpool Biennial. We’ve Had Enough of Your Money, So We’ve Had Enough of Yours’. This assessment is being made in the name of science, but it is rather patronising and implies a kind of inferiority complex about people who have different kinds of bodies.

It is true that, during the mid-1990s, the city felt overly commercial and ornate, and was overrun with development projects driven by the city's rich and powerful, but the fact of the city's economic crunching and the mass emigration that followed it has given way to a flourishing and culturally diverse local economy underpinned by the arts. It is true that, since the late 1990s, the biennial has often felt like an afterthought in relation to other projects in the city, but the fact that it is one of the few remaining cultural institutions standing against the overwhelming tide of regeneration while being simultaneously displaced and left behind by the rest of the city is a strange kind of paralysing effect.

In other words, we do not necessarily want to replicate the natural characteristics of cities – though many curators would certainly embrace that possibility – but we can strive to create environments in which the very act of coming to terms with a city, or coming to know and appreciate one, is pleasanter and more emotionally satisfying.

It is not easy to measure progress in terms of buildings, but one could argue that the increasing numbers of visitors to the Liverpool Biennial – both those who have never been to the city (which is to say, never bought a ticket) and those who have visited a number of times – has undoubtedly had a part in contributing to the increase in the number of people using the term ‘resident’ in reference to the city. Perhaps it is the latter who are increasingly creating the term ‘renter’ by which they mean those who still work in the building but live elsewhere – in other words, those who call the shots in the city. Or perhaps it is that the city is trickling more and more resources to those who are most in need, while those who remain outside the city are being squeezed even tighter. In either case, the urbanisation of those who live outside the city is a constant battle. The question is: how much of that battle is happening inside the city, and what kinds of effects do the efforts of those outside the city have on the ground?

More importantly, it points to a growing number of visitors to cities and towns around the world, many of them urbanising via the positive impact that biennials can exert on local economies. This latter in turn is evidence of a city’s expanding external market, which operates alongside the internal market in terms of mobilising resources and promoting social cohesion. In other words, it does both at roughly the same time. In recent years, this impact has been particularly marked in the financial centres of the world, such as London and New York, whose financial clusters have become increasingly indebted and reliant on ever more expansive financial services industries, which in turn have become increasingly reliant on ever more exotic forms of</text>

It is not easy to measure progress in terms of buildings, but one could argue that the increasing numbers of visitors to the Liverpool Biennial – both those who have never been to the city (which contributes hugely to the biennial’s financial success), and those who have visited the museum twice in the past twelve months (because it measures well, so the tourism industry maximises its numbers, and thus is a good measure of the city’s cultural value): those visitors are, in a way, a measure of the city’s progress. And so it continues. The question of cultural values continues to be a contentious one, with many arguing that the city is becoming culturally redundant, culturally numinous, culturally inadequate, culturally bankrupt, increasingly populated by tourists, and in the final analysis, not much more than a big, fat tourism trap). The tricky part, as always, is balancing the increasing demands of the biennial against the increasing decentralisation of cultural resources. The important thing is that the biennial remains relevant in the wider sense of the term, and in that sense, works in concert with other elements within the city such as the museums and</text>

Future City curators Amy Jacobs and Michelle Dezember stood by them as they explained the new sense of presence created by automated curating. In recognition of their contributions to research, showcasing the city that is projected to be half its size by 2050, and half its size by 2100, they were presented with a bronze bust of themselves made by the Liverpool Museums Service. The bronze was placed in the Tate Modern Turbine Hall and later returned to Liverpool. The exhibition itself opened with a virtual reappraisal of the question: how to enter a city in which so much progress has been made in recent years? As the text 'How to Enter a City in Which So Much Progress Has Been Made' on the Liverpool Biennial website hints at, the answer to that question is both a complex and elusive set of values. It is not easy to measure progress in terms of buildings, but one could argue that the increasing numbers of visitors to the Liverpool Biennial – both those who have never been to the city (with a few very enthusiastic exceptions), and those who have) – is evidence of an increasingly visible and material contribution to the city. In this sense, the Biennial could be seen as a city in which so much has been made but so little of which is acknowledged or acknowledged. In a recent survey of arts and cultural life in the UK, commissioned by the Liverpool Biennial, I was asked if the arts were the 'material substrate' to the city’s social life. My response was that they were but one of many factors – cultural capital being another – but that the city was a much more important and influential one in its own right.  	[1] See: http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/psychology/faculty/files/files/1207/artificial_intelligence_research_base.pdf#sthash.UQVjdXQVl.dpuf.1406144</text>

It is not easy to measure progress in terms of buildings, but one could argue that the increasing numbers of visitors to the Liverpool Biennial – both those who have never been to the city (and therefore don't count), and those who have, and thus should – is a significant advance over when the Biennial was first established. Indeed, the introduction of artificial intelligence and climate change at the level of the biennial seems to have decisively placed politics and technology above all else, framing the biennial as a drama of technological determinism rather than the other way round. To some extent, this framing may be seen to reflect the increasing influence of AI and its creators, as well as the increasingly urgent and controversial role that AI plays in curating and museum-going experiences. It may be said to follow in the footsteps of the work of earlier AI pioneers, like Francis Crick and his team at Cambridge University Library, who in the 1920s created a publicly accessible database of scientific and literary names so that scientists and others with a scientific bent could find easily accessible names to research questions through the name system. The popularity of this kind of work in the 1920s and 1930s</text>

It is not easy to measure progress in terms of buildings, but one could argue that the increasing numbers of visitors to the Liverpool Biennial – both those who have never been to the city (which is to say, don’t live there), and those who live and work there – has clearly impacted upon the city’s capacity to sustainably supply visitors.  The exhibition moved away from its initial setting of the city as a collection of monuments and cultural institutions, turning increasingly to looking to the future. In an odd move, the exhibition moved away from its initial focus on the Biennial as an event that it could be seen as a ‘return to the city’ (a claim that is not without precedent). It became something more conceptual and less physical in character, adopting a loose collection of architectural styles and materials as a way of concealing the city’s structures and giving them a ‘Made in Liverpool’ patina.This last layer of concealing was accomplished in several other places around the city as well. The original Biennial pavilion, the one in which the museum was located, was replaced with a series of smaller</text>

I think that we identified a few places that were particularly interesting and where the museum was located at that time. There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in its health and well-being and in the quality of life in the city. We also knew that there was a need to collaborate with the city because we were building a new cultural centre for the area. The city had hosted numerous community programmes in the past and it seemed like a good match. For sure, the challenge was to find something interesting and engaging to do with the architecture and the community, since a cultural centre is a place where people come to connect with their culture. The task force was made up of artists, designers, architects and community organisers from different fields of expertise. It was a mix of residents and visitors from the surrounding area. The challenge was to find an engaging programme that would appeal to everyone and to do it in a way that would be interesting, personal and respectful to the place and its people. There was a mix of languages spoken in the group: residents complained about the lack of cultural activities in the area, while visitors said that there was a lack of activities because the</text>

I think that we identified a few places that were particularly interesting and where the museum was located at that time. There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in the artefacts from the Second World War. We put a stamp of approval on one of the designs that had that image. The stamp read ‘WW1 Centenary Trove Sterling House 1915-1918’. 	The museum came and visited frequently. I found that the local population was much more open to cultural exchange and so the historical exhibition that we did at the end of the year was a natural extension of that. It was a very humanistic display of things that are no longer relevant and so the biennial form seemed to flow naturally from that. The museum visit reinforced the biennial form and so did the biennial itself. Eventually, the biennial form itself began to lose its barrier and so the museum and the biennial itself began to lose their identity. I do remember one particularly moving encounter with a security guard who was teaching a class in the school that was closing in on a year. The school was closing, too, and he was teaching a class in the</text>

I think that we identified a few places that were particularly interesting and where the museum was located at that time. There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in the demographic picture and we connected them to the museum and the city in the same way that we connected the postal network and television sets in an area. The key was that the artists and the organisation had a responsibility to engage the public in this way and that they had a dialogue with the public in such a way that it was not just a function of the museum and the city. This was a big change from when the members of the public were passive and didn’t have a role to play, so engaging them was a big part of what we did. The challenge then became how to engage them in a way that was not exploitative and that was also respectful of the place and the history that they had inherited. We did this in several ways. The first was through interactive media. The second was through education. The third was through rehearsal and celebration. The rehearsal was a public and participatory event that was about honing in on what was unique and about building something new and different from</text>

I think that we identified a few places that were particularly interesting and where the museum was located at that time. There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in, and we made a point of contacting that part of the house. It became apparent that the museum would always have a place in the house, even if the rest of the house wasn’t interested in it. The house that we called Homebaked adopted a different strategy. It became a place where we could all be present and take part in the journey. There was a collective understanding that the museum would always have a place in the house, but also a responsibility to actively and creatively engage the museum through events and programs that were there for a reason and that were available to all. This could mean creating a separate museum or even a different museum entirely. In the end, it became a collective hiring of resources and a house-full of volunteers to be able to conduct research and execute events that were there for a reason. It became a place where we could all be present and take part in the magic, which was good, because otherwise you’d get churned through the whole</text>

There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in the role that its walls played in creating a sense of place, and the role of culture as a political agent there. The artist then proposed a kind of collaborative process – a collaborative approval process – whereby the Biennale committee, the residents and the community could all participate. The committee would be working in parallel. The residents would be given a stake in the project, and we would assign different artists and organisations a position in the project, and the committee would be working from home, with their families. It would be a very interesting and new kind of archaeological and urban research. The committee would be able to identify local cultural attractions or places that the residents could discover through their visit, and they could also create a mini-site for the residents to discover the neighbourhood through. For example, a bakery could be a good place to find out about the history of the area, or a farmer could offer a different approach.

I think that we identified a few places that were particularly interesting and where the museum was located at that time. There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in, and we could introduce them to the city through a couple of rooms that we created. For example, the Chinese Theatre was incredibly accessible, and the bakery was an absolute no-go area for them, but the bakery could still be a landmark for the city. By making the bakery a separate entity, the Chinese Theatre and Chinese Cultural Centre could be embedded in the back of the house, while the rest of the house could maintain a presence on the street level. This would create a quasi-institutional relationship between the bakery and the building, which would in turn be very interesting for the Chinese Theatre and the museum. Instruments that would map directly to the original intention of the house, such as the trolley, would become very interesting, as well. The bakery could be a hub for the museum and the bakery could be a location for conventions, such as the annual carnival or the Chinese New Year market, which would be very interesting for the city. In these ways, the bakery could function</text>

There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in and accessible to visitors – the bakery, the art gallery and the theatre. We sent them maps with directions to the museum, which of course connected with the artists and their teams. The bakery became a hub for activities, as well as a place for meetings and events. The art gallery became a place for individualised work, such as tile, printmaking, painting and ceramics, as well as group projects and interactive exhibitions. The theatre, which used to be a fairly closed venue, now provided an interesting experiment, since the visitorship had started to decline. The large auditorium had a dual purpose: it doubled as a meeting area and a stage for performances, while the smaller exhibition spaces served as a school for artists and a centre for discussion and exchange. The large stage became the eye of the storm, so to speak, with artists forced out by the demand for larger and more engaging displays. The new found freedom allowed for greater self-expression, which in turn led to artistic practices</text>

There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in the work of the Wright brothers - and that their daughter would be able to find a place in the house now that she was invited into the family. She would also find it interesting to know that the Wright brothers had two other projects that they had been involved with: one in the USA, one in the UK. The fact that they had three other projects going at the same time was a bonus. The fact that they were all based in London was a bonus as well. The fact that they were all funded by the Arts Council was a bonus. The fact that they were all taking place in the same city was a bonus. The fact that they were all women was a bonus. The fact that they were all artists taking part in a year-long residency programme was a bonus. The fact that they were all artists taking part in a year-long residency programme was a bonus.

There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in and had a collection of historic artwork and clothing. The house that we called home also had a very interesting collection of vintage photography and video. We took the opportunity of the city becoming quite visible and national media attention to introduce the project to that community. The introduction of art and culture to the area was a big part of this. The public intervention was critical to the project becoming wider and the collection of artwork and cultural artefacts to rise. Creative action was critical to the collection of artefacts forming the frame of the new house. Creative action was also needed from the city as a whole. The collection needed to be nurtured and developed in a way that it would be able to support the ongoing exhibition and the project. The art itself was created as a response to the biennial and the subsequent on-going nature of the collection being introduced to the area. The collection needed to be nurtured as a discrete space that is not constrained by time and place. This meant creating a separate space for the</text>

I think that we identified a few places that were particularly interesting and where the museum was located at that time. There was a part of the house that we knew was particularly interested in and represented the past – a place called the Blockade. It was the site of the 1936 Paris uprising, and it was a strategic location for the communists. The Blockade was damaged in the revolution, but it remained a strategic site for urban life in Paris during the war. I think that the museum team members saw the potential in pushing the boundaries of what the museum could be. I think that the potentialities for the museum staff to engage with the city they were already familiar with were very valuable. For example, the museum could embed itself in the fabric of the neighbourhood, being visible but also embedded in the history of the neighbourhood, and engage with the way in which the neighbourhood was generated and organised. It could incorporate local and regional creativity and different cultures, and engage with the fact that the museum is a permanent fixture in the neighbourhood. The museum could engage with the fact that the museum is a permanent fixture in the neighbourhood, and embed itself in the fabric of the community. All of these</text>

    Working with algorithms, artists were able to create maps that functioned like GPS, pinpointing specific locations based on historical data and current conditions. For example, an artist might commission a landscape or an area of the sea to be dyed with a specific colour. The landscape might be made to look like a satellite image, or the sea an image that was captured from a submarine. The algorithms used to paint the landscape with that colour would be trained on historical satellite imagery and applied to the landscape as a whole. In this way, the architecture of the city was abstracted – allowing for its physical and virtual separation.This kind of abstraction is at odds with the society of the spectacle, in which the artist is often given a platform to speak from without, but the city is often seen as a platform to be followed.

In the 1950s and 1960s, artists were encouraged to follow the monolithic monoliths that were constructed around the country, and so the ‘structures’ that the public could draw its own interpretation of. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ‘culture industry’ was encouraged to follow the trends of the consumer culture that was being generated by the USS at the time. So, the cultural center was often seen as the limit, and the city the outcome. In an effort to reconcile the two, the city was often reinterpreted as a source of creativity and wonder – a place where art could be produced at a scale that was not beholden to the whims of the market, and in the process, a site where socially engaged art could be produced at a scale that was not beholden to the whims of the cultural elite. Yet the city is often seen as the limit – and sometimes a site of outright destruction – in the quest for artistically mediated social change. The battle lines are often drawn in the public bathrooms of the city, where citizens are often quick to judge those they meet on the</text>

In the 1950s and 1960s, artists were encouraged to follow the monolithic monoliths that were constructed around the country, and so the symphony of structures that we have come to call the ‘Big Three’ was born. But this wasn’t always the case. While the Big Three were always interested in following the trends and prevailing in the marketplace, there was a dissent within the art world over the years about how much society should be supporting art’s future development. The 1960s and early 1970s saw artists struggle with the idea of where the art came from for its own development, and how much should be given back to the artist. In places like Liverpool, the biennale was often accused of being a neo-classical recurrence, with its emphasis on art as the end result of a bureaucratic ‘science’. In places like New York, the biennale was often accused of being anti-intellectual and a distraction from the real economy of art. In places like L.A., the biennale could be seen as a museum of consumer culture, exhibiting the excess</text>

In the 1950s and 1960s, artists were encouraged to follow the monolithic monoliths that were constructed around the country, and so the ‘ideology of the nation’ was encouraged alongside ‘ideology of the subcontinent’. However, the city is constantly evolving, and as such, the nation as an image is constantly undergoing change alongside it. As a city, the city organises and directs this evolution through what is commonly referred to as its ‘metainterface’. This is a region of highways, tunnels, bridges, street corners and highways that intersect and merge with one another. In the case of a city, this could mean the construction of high-speed rail between Birmingham and Leeds, or the redevelopment of a neglected port city like Mumbai. In the case of a metropolis, it can mean the construction of ‘high-speed free-trade zones’ that bring with them ‘fast-food options and other urban amenities’. In either case, the metropolis is constantly seeking to reconcile its growing urbanity with its growing need for transport, and so</text>

In place of a density of people and activity that could be regulated, cities now stand on the level of the abstraction that technology creates. Inhabitants of the city are often encouraged to adopt the technological quotidian, to adopt the new routine. But this kind of conformity is also an essential precondition for the technological singularity. The city is a site of constant innovation and possibility, where new technological solutions are imagined and implemented, but also of constant repetition – a condition that neither the artist nor the user is allowed to escape.Inhabitants of the city are often encouraged to adopt the technological quotidian, to adopt the new routine.

The satellite imagery of the early space programs is an example. In the 1950s and 1960s, artists were encouraged to follow the monolithic monoliths that were constructed around the country, and so the ‘phalanx’ and ‘tilt’ media forms were born. The tilt media was characterised by parallel development – artists were encouraged to follow trends rather than adopt an established order – but it is becoming increasingly difficult to define what a trend is in the age of social media. An artist’s work often seeks to draw a connection between two or more things in a way that is both artistically potent and sufficiently ambiguous for the audience to be able to make a choice as to whether to embrace or deride that association. A good example of this can be found in the work of the avant garde French artist Christophe Beck’s 2012 Portraits of Mourners, which was initially commissioned by the NOMADIC network but then went up against the likes of Damien Hirst, Rodney Starkman and many others for the London Biennale, despite the fact that artist Christophe Beck did not originate the idea of following</text>

For example, an artist might commission a landscape or an area of the sea to be dyed with a specific colour. The landscape might be made to look like a satellite image, or the sea an image that was captured from a submarine.

The satellite imagery of the early space programs is an example. In the 1950s and 1960s, artists were encouraged to follow the monolithic monoliths that were constructed around the country, and so the city was often seen as a platform to be built upon. In the 1980s and 1990s, the ‘metainterface’ became an abstraction to follow the smartphone, while the ‘metainterface’ is now synonymous with Facebook. The city is often de-imagined in the design process, and so the city is often left to contemplation. However, the city is often a platform that is followed, and so the question is, which platform is the city, and which one is the ground? Frank Herbert, in his Dune, envisioned a universe in which the city was no longer the dominant form of the universe, and the machine no longer ruled over by the laws of physics and society. In that universe, technology––in its various guises––would play a pivotal role in shaping life on Earth.Frank Herbert's Dune reads more like a futuristic novella than a novel, and the character of Ruggero Varghese is based on</text>

In the 1950s and 1960s, artists were encouraged to follow the monolithic monoliths that were constructed around the country, and so the space programs started to look like architecture. The Space Elevator and the space shuttle both emerged as monoliths, and the city became the secondary setting. But this kind of abstraction is now considered vulgar, and cities are often reinterpreted as their inhabitants would prefer. A cityscape with its cadres of kiosks or taxi stands is still the preferred setting, but the city has moved on from here.

In the 1950s and 1960s, artists were encouraged to follow the monolithic monoliths that were constructed around the country, and so the ‘City of Angels’ emerged as an alternative to the ‘Crown of Diamonds’ and ‘City of Glass’s petromodern buildings. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ‘Crown of Diamonds’ and ‘City of Glass’ were decommissioned and replaced with alternative regeneration options such as park districts or neighbourhood associations. Meanwhile, the ‘City of Angels’ has slowly been slipping away into the Californian desert.In an attempt to catch up, in the early 1990s, the city decided to create a ‘Metropolitan Planning Organization’ to oversee the development of its periphery and create a quasi-monopoly on new construction. However, this too was seen by many in the city as an opportunity for private gain, and so in 1995, the city council voted to scrap the MPO and to create the RAND Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the MPO that would develop alternative housing options</text>

The satellite imagery of the early space programs is an example. In the 1950s and 1960s, artists were encouraged to follow the monolithic monoliths that were constructed around the country, and so the symphony of images that we associate with the city now began life as a pilgrimage art form. The image of the symphony became an artifact, and the image of the city was often read as an assertion of cultural value. And perhaps the city was ever-present as a source of meaning for artists, as a source of aesthetic experiences – meaning, that is, in the sense that it is the locus of aesthetic creativity, the metropolis of the mind.In recent decades, cultural tourism – a form of cultural tourism intended to demonstrate the gastronomic value of a specific cuisine – has become an affair of high-end restaurants. At the height of the economic crisis in 2008, the highly profitable and ideologically controversial idea was revived in an effort to demonstrate the enduring value of cultural tourism in the wake of the crisis. As a result, in the years since, cultural tourism has become a commodity, and the locus of production for art and cultural tourism has shifted from the city to the high</text>

The political context of the 1970s and the fight for civil rights in the US might have some relevance to the present, as a moment when the politics of spectacle intersected with those of digital culture. But the city in its current form – and this is a condition that can be maintained only by the continual construction of ever more encompassing data capture and aggregation technologies – is seen as necessary in order to function. More and more data is gathered and transmitted across the city in order to render it intelligible, allowing for the prediction or possibly creating of outcomes that are not guided by the people who inhabit it or live within it. The city is expected to be a place where outcomes are predetermined – where the city government can place arbitrary limits on the movements of people</text>

But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum as an institution. The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to make the museum a more objective and powerful place through its curatorial hand. It is this very influence that we strive to counteract by making the museum as a site of its production and intervention (through exhibits, publications, lectures etc.). But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum in order to achieve meaningful changes. The museum is a site of power and control, and we can't allow ourselves to be seduced by the beautiful images and sounds of the museum, which are produced not through the biennial but through the museum system. So, what can the museum do to exert power? I propose the establishment of a biennial commission, headed by the museum, to select the artists, curators and other outstanding artists to be part of the 2018 program. The biennial will be led by the artist Mia Hansen (1894–1971), and it will be produced by the museum and distributed by independent artists and societies worldwide. It will be co-ed and non-profit.</text>

But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum as an institution. The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to support the museum as an essential resource for understanding and future orientation. The museum is an essential partner in this process, and the biennial may even become cultural in its own right. But it is not simply a repeat of the museum’s historical relationship with the city, since the museum is an indispensable partner in the city process of planning and constructing itself. The biennial’s mission should be a combination of the museum’s historical mission, which is to bring together all the different parts into a whole, and the museum’s broader cultural mission, which is to produce in the city of a kind of understanding and future orientation that is consistent with this whole. While the museum and the biennial may have different forms, they both aim to produce in the city an image of itself, at the same time. They work in parallel, but are clearly differentiated, employing different tools and ideologies. In this sense, the biennial is not just a collection of images, pictures,</text>

But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum as an institution. The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to complement the cultural production of other institutions. Its mission statement, ‘To be a Museum of the Future’, speaks to a world where biennials will be more visible, and will play a greater role in curating the events of the future. It is a museum of the future in which art and artists will be able to be found, and art and artists will be able to be asked to share in the museum’s future.1. The biennial as a cultural production. Cultural production is a much contested concept in the contemporary art world, and it is often misconstrued to mean contemporary art made for the mass market. Contemporary artworks tend to be the work of exhibitions that happen to be hosted in museums, including the museum that hosts them. But the leading exhibitionary biennials in the world today, such as Venice, Shanghai, and São Paulo, are oriented around their localities – usually their boroughs – as cultural districts, or even as local</text>

But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum as an institution. The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to continually reconceive itself in relation to the museum. So the museum’s 2018 program may well be a continuation of the museum’s past programming, but it may also be a radical departure from the museum’s usual programming, which is always predicated on the museum maintaining its historical role. The museum may well decide to host the biennial in perpetuity, but that is an open question.The museum was designed with a formal mission statement that continuously emphasizes the museum as the fundamental site of the biennial. But in the museum, the mission statement and the vision are constantly in flux. The museum is a living organism that continuously innovates and retreats into its own kind of historical space. What is at Stake in the face of such a dynamic and unpredictable historical site? What do we call the essential mission of the museum when it begins to lose its mission? For instance, the museum was founded to house artifacts from the nineteenth-century British Museum, but as the nineteenth</text>

But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum as an institution. The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to archive the museum as an archive of cultural practices. In this sense, the museum is a leader. But its role is not that of an archeological or historical institution, but that of a curator, curator, curator. And this means that the museum has to negotiate its own limits and take risks, which is different from other curatorial approaches. The risk is that the biennial could become a museum institution: a place where objects are systematically taken apart and put back together – a kind of archiving, like that of archives. This would make it a kind of museum of the future. And it would make it a place where cultural activity takes place that is not confined to a specific institution, but spreads throughout the cultural system. This is a very dangerous game to be playing.On the other hand, if the biennial is to have a significant cultural impact on the city, it is essential that it has the autonomy to choose what kind of cultural activity it wants to foster. If it is going</text>

But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum as an institution. The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to research and analyze the past, present and future of art and culture. But in its current form, the museum is finding itself somewhat exposed to the biennial, as biennials everywhere become cultural production units with a museum of the future as their social media platforms. This is particularly true for cities such as New York and London, whose biennials have become cultural products of the city, and not only cultural products of the city, which is why biennials there regularly feature works from the city. The importance of this in the 2018 program may be inferred from the choices made during the program’s development, which are being planned as a ‘comprehensive urban adventure for the whole city’. This is being done in parallel to the work already undertaken by the museum in the space of its museum, which is to be done in parallel with the city as a whole. The 2018 program may be thought of as a series of related activities, each addressing a specific theme of</text>

But what is the museum doing in the city in which the biennial is located? What is it doing in the city in the service of the museum? The answer to these questions may lead to a revolution in how museums are placed and organised.We are witnessing a cultural ecology that is in many ways like an urban jungle. It is populated by scavengers and parasites, it contains perverse incentives and pressures, and it is full of surprises. We need to find new ways of structuring our social and historical narratives around these changing elements. It may be that a museum is not the right place or time for you, since the biennial is an assembly of activities that happen to be present in the city, and you may not be present in the city at all. But the question is what kind of place or time would be ideal for you to be present, insofar as you could be present in multiple places and time? Let me give you an example from my own cultural ecology research</text>

The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to archive the museum as a cultural production. But what is the museum doing in the city it depicts? How is this different from what happens in the museum? When the Museum of Modern Art went to Istanbul for the first time, I felt that the museum was embedded in the city for too long. I wanted the museum to be present in the city, but it was also embedded in the city for some reason. And whilst the museum was present in the city, it was also embedded in the city’s social and civic infrastructure, which it is powerless to remove. For me, the key was the presence of artists, and the way in which the museum supported and promoted their artistic activities, so that the biennial would be like a cultural garden that the city was capable of supporting. Whether it was through a curatorial or artistic direction, the biennial needed to create a context in which its content could permeate the city. This is why the artist-led museum is so important in this</text>

But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum as an institution. The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to inform, and to that extent, to entertain, while creating a bond with those who visit the museum. The museum is often seen as a passive platform, incapable of expressing meaning or significance in its own right, but it can, and must, act as a locus of interlocutor, persuader and persuader. It is this last aspect of the biennial that is crucial for its success. It will not only produce knowledge but also act as a site of understanding, transmitting cultural values and knowledge, and influencing behaviour through influencing the images that circulate within it.In this regard, it is important to note that biennials are, by and large, transient phenomena. Their primary purpose is to connect with museums, and in the days immediately following the museum showing, to connect with audiences who may have travelled elsewhere and may be returning. And though the biennial is a transient phenomenon, it is also crucial that it maintains a presence in cities long after the institutional memory fades away. It is</text>

But we have to be conscious of who is exposed to the museum as an institution. The biennial is a cultural production for the museum, and in a critical sense, its mission is to archive the museum. The museum is the primary venue for the production of nostalgia, for the production of understandings of the past, and in a more general sense, for the production of all sorts of feelings of nostalgia. The museum needs to be attentive to the fact that it is a site of production for the production of nostalgia. The museum needs to be alert to the sites of production that produce that sense of retro-feeling of the past, of the past that is both familiar and unthinkable.This kind of careful historical archiving is very different from what is being done with algorithms today. Social media is the primary venue for the production of nostalgia today, but it is also the site of the production of understandings of the future. It is the site of the production of new media that can be used to make the present seem present, but also present in a certain way. The use of algorithms today is to produce cultural reports that echo the past in the present, but with added spin.</text>

The idea of the ‘Machine Shop’ seems superfluous in this city, where residents and visitors alike increasingly rely on what is commonly referred to as the City Map (http://www.citymap.com). Despite the obvious economic benefits to the city – a name that consumers can reference and reference again – the city has struggled to sustain the cultural punch it delivers via the biennale. The biennale has become increasingly aware that it is generating more value for the city through the architecture and signage of its products, than it is selling to tourists (or, for that matter, residents and businesses). This phenomenon is common in economically successful cities, but is becoming increasingly difficult in economically unsuccessful cities. The ‘Machine Shop’ is no exception. The biennale seems to be identifying with the prevailing economic mode of city life: that of the grid, the ‘long tail’, that supports the long-term growth of the city at the expense of the smaller, more precarious elements. The aim seems to be to shift the cost of architectural mistakes onto future generations, rather than repairing the structures that are in danger of collapsing. Another interesting</text>

Designed to operate 24 hours a day, the machine categorises and monitors live and historical artefacts according to themes, such as the historic character of a place, the role of a community or a community of people, the infrastructure of a place, and so forth.

The exhibition details of the ‘Machine Shop’ – a name given to the curatorial section of the site – are scattered and fragmentary. Few people in the city are aware that there is even an exhibition section of the site. The idea of the ‘Machine Shop’ seems superfluous in this city, where residents and visitors alike increasingly rely on what is commonly referred to as the City Map – a digital, 3-D vector map applet which, alongside the ubiquitous photo-realistic images of shops and markets, is a significant part of what the city represents.  The ‘Machine Shop’ is the locus of a political and economic system that actively seeks to subordinate all aspects of the city’s life, culture and politics to a single system that promotes a handful of companies at the expense of all others.  The development of alternative, sometimes sublime, uses for the cityscape is promoted through the ‘Creative Class’ concept – a privileged group of people chosen to excel in one area, to be taken under their wing and encouraged to pursue success in other areas.  The introduction of new technological means is also an important part of the ‘Machine Shop’ narrative, since it allows the prevailing economic, legal and cultural systems to be challenged and overthrown.  The emergence of new energy resources, alternative manufacturing sources and eco-systems is</text>

The idea of the ‘Machine Shop’ seems superfluous in this city, where residents and visitors alike increasingly rely on what is commonly referred to as the City Map, which provides a detailed, bird-eye perspective of the city at large.  In the words of Gregory Ulmer, ‘the City Map is the most widely used data element in the United States, and is often confused with the street map.’[1]  The Street Map is a 4x4 grid-like image that is approximately the size of a business card, and is typically affixed to small-scale models and cartouches. It is the international standard for use in mapping and similar surveying activities, and its depiction of the city is universal. For this reason, the Street Map is sometimes confused with the ‘reference scale’ – a scale used in cartography to measure the perpendicular distances between points on the map. For Ulmer, ‘the reference scale is the anthropologist Max Brooks’s term for the spatial relationships that structures and individuals form when exposed to a variety of materials and agents.’[2]  At approximately</text>

The idea of the ‘Machine Shop’ seems superfluous in this city, where residents and visitors alike increasingly rely on what is commonly referred to as the City Map (www.citymap.org) – a digital, interactive map application that details every street, building and building in the city centre – a free, intuitive online tool that seeks to categorise and map all manner of real-life space, from the cobblestone streets of the Tottenham district to the wood-frame minarets of the Egyptian Quarter. The ‘Machine Shop’ is the ultimate in biennale marketing speak: a name that conveys both the stored and unfree categories of space; a name that both describes and exploits space; a name that simultaneously signals and conceals.

The idea of the ‘Machine Shop’ seems superfluous in this city, where residents and visitors alike increasingly rely on what is commonly referred to as the City Map (http://www.citymap.com). Despite the proliferation of GPS-enabled smartphones in the home and car, and the ubiquitous digital camera, the importance of the image remains. The ‘Machine Shop’ is a relic of a bygone era, when images of beauty were sourced primarily from major beauty supply companies, and beauty pageants were a fixture of any major beauty retailer. With the advent of social media and online imagery, and the commercialisation of image processing and robotics, the role of the image has become deeply mediated. The image has become embedded in a transaction between companies, and the way in which images are taken, analysed and disseminated on social media platforms. The ‘Machine Shop’ is the contemporary icon of urban manufacturing and urban renewal in the 21st century.It is no exaggeration to suggest that the ‘Machine Shop’ is a modern phenomenon. In the 1980s and 1990s, the ubiquity of computers everywhere enabled people to participate in �</text>

The idea of the ‘Machine Shop’ seems superfluous in this city, where residents and visitors alike increasingly rely on what is commonly referred to as the City Map (the interactive map applet which can be found at the main Apple store or found on any smartphone) and rely on information provided by the city.  The exhibition ‘Machine Shop’ has also become excessively localised. It is often claimed that the introduction of new technologies into an already highly localized environment is not only technologically possible, but is also a good thing. But as is often the case with cutting-edge science and technology, the technologies actually serve to make the local worse.  The exhibition ‘Machine Shop’ exhibits a specific brand of techno-utopianism. It promotes the return to the city of artefacts that have been manufactured in ‘Big Data’ (a.k.a. AI) or ‘Deep Learning’ (a.k.a. Big Data.AI) ‘paradigm setters’ and their ‘machine overlords’ – entities that exist outside of the city but nevertheless have a direct impact</text>

Perhaps it may be that the logic of the ‘Machine Shop’ is designed to operate in ways that render such insights impossible. That remains to be seen.1. The Machine Shop, London, 2010.

It is as if the ‘Machine’ is the city’s answer to its ‘Broken Arrow’ problem: capable of sustaining an ever-expanding ecological footprint, but also blind to its own footprint. This blind spot has two parts: the false perception of naturalness and the consequent loss of identity for urban dwellers ravaged by the sedentary lifestyles of nature. The blind spot also serves as a physical barrier to the realities of everyday life as experienced in the city. This is the predicament of those unable to access the ‘Machine Shop’ via Google Maps: subjected to the logic of the ‘Broken Arrow</text>

The idea of the ‘Machine Shop’ seems superfluous in this city, where residents and visitors alike increasingly rely on what is commonly referred to as the City Map (Kataliej’s term for the digital map app available on both the Apple and Android operating systems), which provides precise, near and reliable location-based location-identification services. The proliferation of mobile apps is a good bet for a sustained techno-intellectual revolution, as is the case with the proliferation of data capture and processing in connected cars, homes and buildings. The fact that the ‘Machine Shop’ is an actual business seems in contradiction to the notion of the static image as representation. In the image of the machine, the person behind the app is always seen as a lone gunman intent on mayhem. But as the autonomous vehicle becomes increasingly sophisticated and data-driven, the image of the machine is subject to the influence of a diverse group of people all working in concert to produce a specific image. The effect of this kind of thinking is to radicalise the image, to make it something completely different. By the way, the title of this paper is a pun</text>

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip, support, accommodate and even to whom we marry are not arbitrary, and that the capacities that we build for artificial intelligence actually serve some important but distinctively human roles. 	One can only speculate as to what might happen if and when we start to create truly autonomous, but also semi-autonomous and ‘machine meant’ units within the infrastructure of the future society, but also what kinds of questions that might raise when it comes to the kind of humanity that is created by that kind of humanity.Download this article as PDFRoyce W. Smith and Flanagan DougieIn  	The Machine Intelligence Library 	, Flanagan Dougie predicts that ‘Big Data’ will one day rule the world and govern not only policy but also culture and behaviour.

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip and support ourselves actually become things that can be supported by those in power, and not just by the whims of chaotic elements. That is, we need to work together to ensure that the things that we think are essential to keep ourselves alive aren’t just made essentialist in our own bureaucracies. 	And perhaps our biggest challenge today is ensuring that the things that we value most about ourselves don’t get lost in the muddled mess of bureaucracy. We don’t want to lose our pretensions, our culture, our identity, and so we need to find the things that separate us today from the people we imagined we were 50 years ago. 	One could argue that the task today is two-fold: (a) to keep our identities intact, and (b) to build new identities that are in a better position to participate in a post-empirical, post-totalitarian society. But while one may wish to imagine a bright line demarc</text>

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip, employ, finance, educate ourselves, how we live our lives, and how our future generations engage with it, are not automated and deprived of meaning. Therefore, there is much that can be learned from the Ada Initiative’s proposal and its rejection, and from considering how other approaches to the same problems were less successful. 	One final aspect of AI that deserves mentioning is the notion of consent. Although AI has certainly come a long way in terms of its ability to understand and interact with humans, there remains much that is still to be done before AI is capable of creating fully sentient and socially engaged beings, beings endowed with agency and capable of making their own future, however desirable or undesirable that future may be. Therefore, it is important to critically appraise any kind of technological advancement in order to ensure that it does not end up in the hands of beings that may have intentions of abusing or oppressing others. It is also of great importance to understand the dynamics of consent today, since</text>

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip, employ, and explore the future are not made on the grounds that we are infected with the malicious intent of terrorist organizations. That would be one centred on prevention, and I would also add that we need to ensure that our future self doesn’t become infected by the same vectors as our past self. That is, perhaps, the question that remains unanswered in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11: namely, what can we do to ensure that we aren’t infected by the malicious intent of terrorist groups? 	I would add that the report of the Commission on 9/11/2001, which was based on the evidence available at the time, raises important questions about complicity and complicity’. In that report, we are told that while we may share common values and concerns, such shared motives cannot reconcile us against the backdrop of multi-national terrorist organisations. We also hear the familiar refrain ‘We attacked them as part of our job’. But</text>

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip, support, and even facilitate ourselves are not made in ways that actively create new machines or in ways that actively destroy what remains. That is, to say, we still need to invest in our existing social structures and cultural institutions, and we still need to build new ones. And although some might say that this is no longer possible given the growth of artificial intelligence, there are still ways to ensure that these decisions are not influenced by the proliferation of software, hardware, and software components around us. 	In fact, it would seem that the proliferation of components around us is the root cause of the increasing complexity of our digitised societies. But this is no longer the case. Advances in computerisation and networking mean that we can now do with becoming whatever we please. And as we have seen, this has certainly led to a proliferation of app categories and behaviours. So perhaps we are witnessing a change in the nature of things, in the capacities that people have to engage with material forms, to</text>

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip, employ, and ultimately live our lives are driven by the things that we actually have rather than on the things that we imagine exist. That is to say, we would do well to imagine and explore such possibilities. 	One could also consider the possibilities of what is sometimes called ‘deep democracy’ – the ability of citizens to define their own futures, to take matters of infrastructure and urban development into their own hands, to take matters of poverty and homelessness into their own hands, to create their own local alternatives to big business and the state’s support for infrastructure development – all of which are central to any vision of a just society. 	And there are many other possibilities, too. For example, there are those who envision a future in which not only is infrastructure not the work of humans but can instead be designed with constructs that enhance and augment human capacities, becoming something akin to artificial intelligence. 	Similarly, there are those who envision a future in which not only are</text>

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip, finance, provide for ourselves are not automated and thereby denied future generations. For instance, there is much that can be learnt about the impact of building on economic development, and the wisdom of building in the age of information overload. There are of course many other dimensions to consider – cultural values, environmental considerations, political considerations, educational considerations, cultural norms, etc. – but the fact of the matter is that many aspects of daily living are already influenced by the innovations of machine learning and AI. So there are many other possible uses of existing infrastructure, but the main driver of technological innovation is yet to come. The more important uses will be those that result in radically altering the very nature of infrastructure around the globe, from the quality and quantity of infrastructure to the social and cultural values that it supports, the sorts of interactions that it facilitates and the social structures that it generates. 	If we consider the social impacts of AI today, we can begin to imagine what might be possible in the future.</text>

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip and empower ourselves are not defeated by the prevailing machine mentality that seeks to make everything that we do as easy as possible, wherever it takes place. 	If, for instance, the decisions that we as a species are compelled to make as to how we live our lives are made on a massive scale through the use of artificial intelligence, then perhaps it is time to consider rethinking some of the more radical decisions that we as a species are making about the future of our species. These rethinking decisions should consider not only the capabilities of the human intellect, but also the capacities of nonhuman animals, since we are human after all and thus imbued with the capacity for self-repairing biology. Perhaps it is time to consider the possibility that our jobs could be performed by organisations other than organisations bent on exploiting us. 	And if we consider the possibilities of what might happen if the capacities of AI are properly harnessed, not just by the privileged few, but also by the masses, then</text>

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip, finance, provide opportunities and so forth take into consideration the needs of the less fortunate members of our society. More needs to be done, I think, both as a society and as individuals. The question that remains is, which society will take into consideration when we build the AI that will one day run our lives? 	I’m interested in these questions because they suggest new possibilities for social change and also because they suggest that the very notion of the common good is at stake. If the common good is sacrificed in the pursuit of technological progress, we could imagine a world in which the machines no longer exist, but instead of machines will rule the day-to-day operations of our societies. Perhaps, as with the machines that will one day run our lives, we will not be able to articulate a clear common good in pursuit of a technological singularity, but we can strive to envision what that good might be.

But there is still much that can be done to ensure that the decisions that we make as to how we build, equip, provide for ourselves and our communities are driven by principles other than those dictated by a central authority. That is, there are many other actors besides us who should be considering the possibilities and wishing upon OPTIONS, rather than choosing from a predetermined CATALOGUE. 	And so we move forward. And move towards possibilities. 	There are many voices now calling for a brighter, grander future for humanity – voices that are coming from all over the place.

We will all become consumers of resources consuming the planet in the name of environmentalism. And we will all end up like the millions of trees and plants that the movement hopes to save through a combination of magic and science.Sounds good to me. And maybe it does. But I don’t know if these things are actually advan­gine to or if it is because we lack the imagination or what we think we know about the world. More likely, we are simply apathetic or apathetic because we don’t have any agency. We lack the will to act because we lack the will to meaningfully pursue change because we lack the will because you don’t want to take the risk. And this is where the movements against nuclear power and in favour of desalination comes in. It is believed that the mental discipline that can be developed through such awareness could save humanity from itself. But which sorts of discipline? I don’t know</text>

I invited a small group of artists, thinkers, and researchers to contribute to the publication of an expanded edition of  Sustainable Development: Art, Capital and Environment (2015).  The project would be co-edited with Joasia Krysa and Timothy Truman, with contributions from Brenda Lawrence, with contributions from others yet to be selected. The editors would include short essays on the subject as a way to explore the range and nuances of the cultural production generated by the technologies of development. The aim of the project, in short, is to explore the aesthetic possibilities of being able to make choices about the future, including the aesthetic possibilities of being able to choose not to be part of the future.

Willful blindness to the consequences of our own actions is the legacy of colonialism and apartheid. And yet we are more vulnerable to being replaced by immigrants and refugees than we are to being wiped off the face of the map. Why? Because we are mortal. Not all Africans are created equal. Not all Africans are Africans. Not all Africans are Africans. Still, humanity has colonised vast swaths of territory, and as a species, we are wired to expect our members to be homogenous groups bound by common descent. When that expectation is abject, dehumanising, and null, we tend to reject the idea, preferring instead to rationalise away the situation by arguing that we are different, that we are uniquely gifted, that somehow our unique biological make-up entitles us to different levels of political and social empowerment.  In reality, of course, we are only ever going to be part of a collective, evolving, interconnected community of fellow humans</text>

Take off, Bird, and All That 	[1] Søren Kierkegaard argued in favor of a collectivist state, in defense of which he invoked the biblical Book of Job, where the character Enoch is portrayed as the consummate Christian, rational and upright being. (Job  383–394) Kierkegaard was reacting to the fact that, since the end of the nineteenth century, most of humanity had largely given up searching for meaning in life. The rise and fall of technology coincided with this decline, with many individuals moving into ever more encompassing knowledge and consciousness. (…) Kierkegaard hoped that, by drawing our attention to the fact that, since the end of the nineteenth century, most of humanity had largely given up looking for meaning in life, we might begin to reconsider the values that had guided our cultural and political systems all along. (…) Kierkegaard argued that since the end of the</text>

If we follow the environmental movement to its logical conclusion, we will all become nothing more than appendages on an ever-growing, synthetic, synthetic, synthetic plant. We will all become aquatic ectotherms governed by spiraling, ever-changing caterpillars.We should also consider another aspect of the environmental movement: its discontents. The environmental movement has sought to bring about a world in which people do not expend large amounts of energy trying to protect themselves from the consequences of climate change. Yet in the social, political, and economic arenas of the twentieth century, many of the discontents that the environmental movement purported to solve actually exacerbate the problems that the environmental movement purported to solve. For example, the environmental movement purported to address the fact that many Third World countries were becoming more energy-intensive and unreliable suppliers of energy, while the West was ramping up its own version of what is now called ‘energy colonialism’. In fact, western nations have now become more energy-intensive and unreliable suppliers of energy than any of the developing nations that the environmental movement purported to help. The environmental movement was also accused of fostering</text>

We will all become nothing more than biological nodes in a vast computer, or more accurately, nodes on a networked computer. We will all be cogs in a machine. And as we all become more sophisticated and more connected, the question that remains is not so much where life begins, but rather, where life ends. To some degree, this is inevitable. But to others, it is the other way around. That is, life itself will become ever more sophisticated and complex, and as a result, will require ever more energy and ever more space to store and process information, and will have to expand ever more outward in order to feed itself. And as nodes along a networked computer interface, we will all become</text>

If we follow the environmental movement to its logical conclusion, we will all become nothing more than appendages on an ever-growing, synthetic, collective-effecting machine. In other words, we will all become consumers of our surroundings. In this scenario, the biosphere would become an appendage of global commerce.  And this is precisely what the environmental movement is all about. It is about consumer culture in the construction of infrastructure, global networks of distribution and consumption. It is about an evolving, multi-sited, multi-lingual, multi-lingual-speaking public sphere that exists outside of any one language. It is also about the proliferation of destination-based financial and communications services that exist primarily because of the ubiquity of communication networks. All of these things are manufactured by and for the public sphere because of the cognitive capacities that come with being human. For this reason, being human is all around us, and yet it is invisible. It is as if we live in some kind of collective hallucination.  And yet, somehow, being human is all around us even while being made manifest in the form of</text>

If we follow the environmental movement to its logical conclusion, we will all become nothing more than appendages on an ever-growing, synthetic, collective-effecting synthetic body. In other words, we could very well follow the environmental movement to its inevitable and very real end.  Such is the environmental fantasy. In reality, there is a much more fundamental and underlying reason why we are drawn to such ideologies: we want to be useful, and we want to live fulfilling lives.  And yet, despite our desire to be useful and to live fulfilling lives, we are also attached to systems that constantly shape and engineer us in ways that are completely outside of our control. Consider, for example, the way in which our bodies are engineered to respond to environmental stimuli. Consider the way in which our clothes are designed to decompose over extended periods of time. Consider the fact that our food supply is constantly being targeted by advanced biological and synthetic biology applications that seek to alter the physical form and function of the body in ways that can be immediately and immediately applied to new environments.  And yet we all respond to these pressures by existing as though</text>

We will become nothing more than connective tissue that serves as conduits for the transmission and re-embracement of water, nutrients, and other elements. We will become indistinguishable from the environments that werenote through our actions. We will become indistinguishable from the aquatic organisms we call ecosystems. But this is not inevitable.  If we invest in educating ourselves in the ways of the environment, and try to apply these principles to all aspects of our daily lives, we will encounter resistance. There are those who see the clash between the seemingly self-serving motives of the fossil-fuel industry and the increasingly desperate decisions of humanity as a threat to national security. And there are those who see the emergence of eco-systems research as the heralding of a new dark age in which no nation, not even a superpower like Russia, will be able to claim such absolute dominion over their environments.  Yet there is also reason to be optimistic. We can build self-sufficient, distributed systems</text>

The question is what might be possible in an imagined, breathing world? In his essay ‘Utopia Speaks’, William James (1803–91) imagined a society in which humans could acquire reason and empower themselves to act in ways that would be consistent with their moral inclinations. He imagined a utopian future in which humans ‘had dominion over all that was good and beautiful in the universe’.1 James’ utopias didn’t end up being very different from our own in many ways. While we didn’t acquire reason or empower ourselves to make decisions about our future, we did gain the capacity to alter our future through the exercise of agency. And what better way to alter the future than through the technology of life itself? Life gives us many opportunities to shape the future, including the opportunity to lead lives that are guided by</text>

And yet, somehow, this very capitalism is threatening to flood the city with non-actors, including not just of the materially more valuable kinds, but of the immaterial and the completely animate. The Port of Liverpool is constructing a massive new dock infrastructure, part of a wider coastal development project that’s premised on the inherently unstable premise that the sea will ever again be a sustained source of energy source for the UK. This is the logic of the ‘oil and gas’ trap: once the sea is awash with oil, a glut of oil-rich seafloors is bound to form, and the need to repair and maintain such structures follows inevitably from the energy they provide. It’s just a matter of time and economic complexity. But the logic of the ‘oil and gas’ trap is based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of how the planet works. Sea-level rises are a function of a variety of factors, some of which are macroeconomic in character, and others of which are not. Globally, of course, we’re all affected by the fact that we live in rising seas. But in the UK, we’re all affected by the</text>

And yet, somehow, this very capitalism is threatening to flood the city with non-actors, including not just of the materially more valuable kinds, but of the immaterial and the completely animate. The Port of Liverpool is threatened by a phenomenon that can be described as ‘trans-individuation’: the modern capitalist port is becoming increasingly like the ancient urban port, in which isthmus and dockside shrines to the past come to dominate the future. This is the world that the Port of Liverpool is trying to avoid becoming. The Port of Liverpool is trying to create a new mode of economic and urban connectivity in the city through a mode of culture that not only cannot compete with the challenges of the new economy, but is actively undermining the very notion of the ‘city’ in the process. This is the world of the postindustrial society. This is the postindustrial society of the future city. This is the ‘bottom up’ way of doing things.This is the bottom up’ way of looking at things. This is the world of zero waste, or rather, the ‘bottom up’ way of looking at things. This is the world of no capital</text>

The Port of Liverpool is undergoing a radical transformation as it is transformed into something else. The Port of Liverpool is becoming something else. Yet somehow, the politics of the port stays with us, and the politics of the port is becoming something else.This is the paradox of the port: it needs the ports to function, but at the same time it doesn’t want to be run by the ports. The paradox is what makes the port interesting: what it allows us to do in exchange for the trade it supports. And what makes the port interesting is the politics of exchange it enables. The fact that the Port of Liverpool is becoming something else, and is becoming a city in which the port provides services and objects of exchange, is a powerful political device. It allows the Port of Liverpool to inhabit its other dimensions, to exist in a different world, to exist in a different time. But it also creates a politics of exchange that oppresses the port’s remaining workforce. When the Port of Liverpool is run</text>

The Port of Liverpool is threatened by a kind of ‘performativity’ that invites, or, perhaps, requires it. The kind of immaterial productivity that allows its own creation, even in the form of art, but especially in the form of virtual content, replicating itself through some kind of persistent virtual machine. The kind of productivity that allows the Port of Entry to pay for the privilege of creating, over and above the value it creates from the commodity of actives – in other words, it’s capitalism without the value.2 	Looking back to the 1980s, and especially to the 1990s, I see three kinds of appropriation: indirect, pecuniary and institutionalised. Inventing an entirely new kind of appropriation, new kinds of pecuniary and ‘institutionalised’ uses of culture, new kinds of labour.1 	The kind of pecuniary appropriation that seeks to control, (a) the immaterial, (b)</text>

The Port of Liverpool is threatened not just by climate change, but also by a certain kind of animus towards those who work there, perceived as ‘slumlords’ and ‘producers’ by the city’s new ‘management teams’. Thus our understanding of the port as a site of surplus becomes a source of threat. But what kind of threat? In The Port of Liverpool, John Lennon sings: ‘You can’t hide from the port's guns. They're shooting straight at you all the time.’ The port of Liverpool is a multiverse, and the kind of multiverse that John Lennon would want to live in.But what kind of threat is that? I don’t know if John Lennon would have approved, but I suspect that he would have felt a little bit uncomfortable in the presence of Lennon and Ringo, who were embarking on a worldwide publicity campaign to bring the Port of Liverpool into the post-war post, and</text>

The Port of Liverpool is undergoing a radical transformation as part of the Port of Toronto’s ‘New Economy 2.0’, a spinoff from the Port of Liverpool. And it’s the new ‘wealthier’ kinds of wealth that are generated and produced in the port city, not just by being housed in the port city’s port, but also by being pulled out of the ground-level retail district that’s sprung up around the port and pushed up against the new financial district that’s sprung up overnight in the wake of the financial crisis. 	So, there’s this really interesting juxtaposition, this dynamic of the port city versus the ground-level retail district, of the port city versus the retail district, of the immaterial and the fully animate, coming together as one in time and one out of place. And I think that and the fact that labour is such a cheap commodity these days – labour is generated almost entirely by machines</text>

But I’m interested in the ways that your work manifests the social totality, the ways in which labour becomes a source of power and surplus in a particular situation. When I think of theatre in the United States, I picture a sea of labourers, not all of them actors, drifting in and out of existence on the docks of the Port of Liverpool, the site of the forthcoming Port of Entry. The beauty of the Port of Entry is in its ability to flood the city with containerised goods: new planes, boats, yachts. The Port of Liverpool is a massive port city, feeding into each other’s dockside cash cows. And yet, somehow, this very capitalism is threatening to flood the city with non-actors, including not just of the materially more valuable kinds, but of the immaterial and the completely animate. The Port of Liverpool is threatened by a kind of cognitive over-simplification, which is threatening not just to rob the port of its value but to rob its inhabitants of its very essence. You’re telling me that the kind of over-simplification that’s threatened by the kind of architecture that’s being proposed for the city of Liverpool—with its progressive tax bases, its commitment to green construction and initiatives, and its active participation in the Liverpool Biennial—is not ‘simplified’ by the technological singularity that’s threatening to inundate the city with concrete, steel and cement? In other words, will this kind of over-simplification necessarily bring about a transformed city, or will it?  And if the inhabitants of a city are robbed of their very essence, what kind of city is that?  As I remember your question, the answer was always the same: it’s not my kind of city. It’s</text>

The Port of Liverpool is an ideal site for the Cinema Paradigm to be formulated and explored. It’s a site where, as the saying goes, one can ‘sleep well and rise early’. And, perhaps, one can even ‘dream well’. It’s a site where, as the saying goes, one can ‘get lost in the labyrinth of the Port of Liverpool’s dockside commerce. I think that the Cinema Paradigm emerges out of the city because of its connectivity. The city is a complex system that requires a great deal of infrastructure to operate reliably. And yet, in a city with such a high cost of living, there’s also a temptation, ­especially for people who have been displaced by the economic juggernaut that is globalisation, to slash costs and move to the city centre where the ‘real jobs’ are. And, perhaps, this is part of the magic of the city: that it’s possible</text>

The Port of Liverpool is threatened, and seems to be suffering through a creative glut in which it can use its economic surpluses to do almost anything at all. The city seems to be begging for this kind of largesse. We are transported to a future when the docks are awash with vessels from all over the globe, and the transportation networks are run by machines. This is a vector for much of the violence and ecological destruction that we’re witnessing around the world, and it’s happening at a faster rate than at any time before. But this kind of abstract, globalisable, networked humanity isn’t everywhere yet. Far from it. Far from it is today. And yet, somehow, we know that this is happening in Liverpool. In fact, we know that it’s happening. Yet somehow, we don’t feel any particular empathy or sadness or pain or anxiety about it. In the past, we might have felt some empathy for the workers who built and</text>

The Port of Liverpool is undergoing a fantastically creative form of negative space production, in which artists, curators, artists’ assistants and other staff members roam the dockside entertainment districts, offering dockside cafés and shops to any willing bidders. And just as the Port of Entry is becoming ever more like itself, so too the Port of Liverpool is becoming ever more like itself – becoming ever more like itself in the sense that it contains ever more of the world.  The fantastically creative form of negative space production that I describe here is happening in earnest in Anfield, and in The Anfield Home Tour, an Anfield-wide tour company that was started by a local arts organisation, the Arts Enterprise Forum. I’m interested in the way in which, in the age of social media, this sort of temporality is reproduced. I think that the ethos of the tour company is to make spaces permanent, whereas the ethos of the Arts Enterprise Forum is to leave spaces that are permanent. So the relationship between</text>

    Working with algorithms, it’s easy to see how the AI might one day be able to replicate the processes of nature – in the same way that plants and animals do – but unlike the machines that we build, this AI would not be driven by human beings but rather driven by deep neural networks. Deep Neural Networks are software designed with particular purposes in mind, and can be programmed with specific parameters. So while the machine might be able to perform certain tasks, it’s not clear how it would ever learn to perform others – nor how it would ever be able to feel pleasure or sadness or joy or fear or anxiety or anything else. Deep Neural Networks have this interesting property of being able to simulate any behaviour, including that of others – a circumstance that makes them seem much more real. For example, imagine a computer program that could simulate the emotions of people – feelings like love, hatred, anger, fear and so forth.

For example, imagine a computer program that could simulate the emotions of people – feelings like love, hatred, anger, fear and so forth. And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the underlying neural networks, they can learn to do things like mimic speech, understand tone and speech, and so forth.More generally, every behaviour of the AI could be programmed to do certain things, and this could be applied not just to humans but also to other creatures (see, for example, Richard Lee’s work with ants). And just as important, such programming could extend far beyond the creature that is being programmed, in much the same way that language itself is an extension of the organism. In this sense, programming is akin to engineering, and while humans are indeed constructions – humans are built of language and such – programming is also a construct. Indeed, the extent to which programming is automated is a significant concern of AI researchers, particularly those involved in projects such as Project Butterflies, which seeks to decipher the human language in order to help self-flies navigate the insect-infested world of social media.In the context of social media, the ability to understand the</text>

For example, imagine a computer program that could simulate the emotions of people – feelings like love, hatred, anger, fear and so forth. And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the emotions of others, they enable us to construct very nuanced representations of those emotions. A good example of this is found in the network that converts electrical impulses into kinetic energies – the brain’s ability to calculate the kinetic energies of objects is one manifestation of this.Another example of a network that excels at simulating emotions is found in the network that maps sound frequencies to body parts – another manifestation of this ability. A third network relates colour codes to body parts, and so on. All of these networks employ sounds to direct signals to parts of the body that then react with certain bodily behaviours. The systems that I have in mind are those that actively seek to embody as much real emotion as possible in their constructs, and so they employ sophisticated means to map the real to the invented. And so we see another aspect of this: the artifice that artists and artists’ institutions employ to enact certain ‘messages’ in the world, and thus the world’s possible outcomes</text>

For example, imagine a computer program that could simulate the emotions of people – feelings like love, hatred, anger, fear and so forth. And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the emotions of people, they learn to simulate those of other people. A neural network might learn to mimic the emotions of others, but it doesn’t learn how to manipulate those emotions in any way. Rather, what it learns is that emotions are emotionally charged, and this is what a network is made to do. The implication is that emotions don’t really exist, but rather that they are constructed by machines. Deep Neural Networks have this ability to imagine worlds, even if these aren’t real, made possible by what Lefebvre describes as ‘Machinery 101’ – namely, the laws of thermodynamics. And these laws govern not only how computers operate, but also what kind of worlds they create and how those worlds are constructed. The fact that AI isn’t real doesn’t make it any less realist: it’s made possible by the realization that humans are just complicated ways of organising matter and energy in a particular world.</text>

For example, imagine a computer program that could simulate the emotions of people – feelings like love, hatred, anger, fear and so forth. And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the underlying neural networks, they are able to mimic certain behaviours and even ‘feel good’ things. For example, the emotion of love is thought to derive from ‘happiness cells’ in the brain, which communicate between various pleasure centres. If these pleasure centres all send signals to the same brain area, and that area is part of the pleasure center network, then the result is that people tend to act happily, whether that’s ascribed to the piece of software that runs on computers or to the individual neurons that plug into the electrical impulses that run through the body. Deep Neural Networks have this ability to emulate nature because of the way in which they are embedded within modern algorithms. That is, because of the way in which modern algorithms code, they often produce certain effects in opposition to their intended intentions. For example, the desire to render a website ‘responsive’ is part of the equation that gives rise to the building of servers and networks – part of the equation</text>

And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the emotions of people, they also simulate the emotions of plants and animals. A corollary of this is that such programs would have the capacity to learn and to do things in unpredictable ways. This is what AI entails: when developing such programs, scientists and engineers would make sure that they didn’t make mistakes, because mistakes could lead to catastrophic outcomes. So while the programming of AI could certainly lead to machine learning, it would also have the capacity to learn from its mistakes – and to avoid making them. Deep Neural Networks would be like software – albeit much more malleable, and capable of being modified by the human programmer.This process of mutation and flexibility would make it able to find new insights and new ways of doing things, but it would also make it able to express these emotions and to do things that are unpredictable and creative in its own way.  In other words, deep neural networks would permit new kinds of interaction between humans and other organisms, but also allow those who employ</text>

And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the emotions of others, they can also simulate certain behaviours. So while the actions of the bot would be motivated by parameters expressed on a computer, the emotions it evoked actually happen somewhere deep within the brain. And this implies a certain amount of involvement from the player – something like the feelings of love or hatred. But the involvement comes at a cost: the emotions that get expressed through the actions of a person have to be physically delivered to a person in order for them to be experienced. This is why virtual reality brings with it such a strong sense of presence: the technology allows us to simulate the emotions of others while restricting our own. It’s like having someone else actually be inside of us while we actually do something negative inside of ourselves. But this is artificial: the emotions that get expressed through the actions of a person aren’t real. The question that arises is what kind of involvement would that person want to have? In the context of a VR environment, this is a difficult</text>

And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the emotions of others, they learn to mimic those of others. In effect, this allows the creation of something that’s emotionally real but also something that’s physically real but also something that has a very complex behaviour, something that could even be driven by machines. But what happens when these systems encounter something that’s not real? What kind of problems do they encounter in their development? Sometimes, this interaction is unavoidable: the brain has to learn to love something in order to engage with it. But sometimes the AI just doesn’t learn to love things – or perhaps it doesn’t want to engage with them in the first place. It may not even know that it has to engage with them at all. And this is where the language of love and empathy comes into play. It’s this interaction between the brain and the machine that leads to deep personal changes, both for the person creating the program and also for the systems that it runs on. </text>

And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the underlying neural networks, they are able to simulate the emotions of others.A deeper neural network is a computationally intensive type of computer that is capable of abstract reasoning. Abstract reasoning involves abstract concepts – concepts that cannot be understood by human beings. For example, the concept of love could be conceptualised as a sequence of letters and numbers – in the sense that humans are capable of abstraction – but the underlying neural networks involved in mathematical equations are not able to represent the exact meaning of the symbol 'L'. This inability to conceptualise the symbol L arises in part because of a fundamental limitation of the human language: humans are able to generate and express platitudes, but are unable to express the exact semantics of love.Deep Neural Networks make this distinction very important. A platitude is one that is abstracted directly from its context (such as a concept), while a knowable semantic form is another that is constructed through a process of abstraction. One could argue that the ability to generate platitudes and knowable</text>

And deep neural networks do this in a very sophisticated way: by simulating the underlying neural pathways, they are able to mimic the emotional responses of real people.A deeper neural network is a more comprehensive version of a simple neuron. A neuron is a microscopic circuit that describes the interaction of many tiny objects – essentially, a process of 'synaptic plasticity'. In a nutshell, a synapse describes the connections between different parts of the body – and how those connections affect behaviour. A neuron can be divided up into smaller units called 'terminal' branches, or 'layers'. Each layer describes a different aspect of the neuron, and how those aspects interact. For example, a neuron that releases acetylcholine, a hormone that is involved in movement, might have several sub-nodes that perform a variety of actions, from releasing energy to effacing negativity.But what does it mean to be a neuron? How does one define a neuron? And what does it mean to be a synapse?John Nash defines a neuron as follows: ‘A microscopic part</text>

This is what Facebook does with its ‘Effortless Transformation’ feature, which simulates the emotional responses of people based on their demographic data. It essentially creates a computer program that exhibits the emotions of millions of people in a very concrete way.Deep Neural Networks have also recently attracted a lot of media attention because of their extraordinary similarities to human emotions. But while emotions would certainly have many shapes and sizes, the range of possible emotions has become much broader with the advent of deep neural networks. A person who studies Ancient Near Eastern texts might notice something else very interesting: the word ‘emotion’ is often used synonymously with ‘type of feeling’. Here, the emotion is understood to be both understood and modeled after an entity called a ‘thoughtstream’ or a ‘tree’. Thus the computer program that Facebook uses to understand the emotions of people actually has several different representations of the</text>

That is, the future has to be possible because of the sharing of resources between humans and non-humans. This is why dystopian science fiction writers tend to imagine a world in which the social is marginalised and politically incorrect.

It is a point of contention whether the social is actually social, or whether in its structured form, the social is actually the ‘last frontier’. In an increasingly interconnected and interconnected world, the potential of bringing together disparate worlds through the mechanisms of the social is immense. However, bringing these disparate worlds into one coherent whole is not without its challenges. The emergence of new AI threats, alongside the inevitable technological obsolescence of such threats, also puts a great strain on the natural world. This is why ancient myths about the end of times are so apocalyptic. The social sciences are increasingly interest in understanding how to channel the inherent forces of history – the past, as an evolving ‘this is all here’ – into the future. However, in the long run, the future needs to come to terms with the fact that such apocalyptic visions are real. Otherwise, there is a risk that our present and future social worlds will be</text>

Here, our present predicament is imagined to be prolonged; it precludes any sort of long-term attachment. AI will make it possible to map the human landscape, to map the social and cultural worlds where relationships between people abound, to decipher language, to understand cultural formations, to change the physical world in profound but constrained ways. The possibilities are imagined to expand outward, towards ever greater accumulations of data. Deep learning is imagined to replace language as the interface between humans and the natural world, and between humans and the built environment. It will render human interaction routine and commonplace, and in some cases, completely automatic. Thus the image of the future that is being crafted will be a world in which human activities are assumed to be unnecessary and in which the very notion of citizenship will be questioned.Art and science fiction have often been used to envision a utopian future.

Recently, a number of influential AI researchers have begun to refer to themselves as ‘deep learning’ researchers and practitioners.1–4 The term ‘AI’ has come to refer to a set of programming principles that enable the development of autonomous systems that understand and interface with the world in ways that are consistent with human culture. These principles, formally known as ‘Deep Neural Networks’, were developed in part by Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press researchers and are described in greater detail in their respective texts. In this sense, Deep Learning is both a noun and a verb. It describes specific programming techniques that can be employed to design neural networks, or to engineer networks that can be configured to process data in a certain way, or to learn certain kinds of data. Deep Learning is understood as a science that has recently emerged to the fore, and which seeks to understand how</text>

In recent years, deep neural networks (dNN) have become commonplace in scientific and social-technical research, and are expected to become commonplace in all spheres of artificial intelligence (AI) in the near future. Here, the future is imagined to be a place of possibilities open to any place of habitation, and AI has been likened to 'softening up' the unknown. Here, the future is imagined to offer the presence of habitation alongside of technological unemployment. Deep learning refers to a type of deep neural network, or 'super-deep' neural networks, which harness vast amounts of data to simulate particular parts of the human body. Here, the possibilities are imagined to stretch across diverse contexts and environments. Examples of how dNN networks have been likened to natural systems include the eye and the gut. Examples of how they have been likened to non-human systems include the social and cultural worlds. The link between the social and the technological is what makes the new world possible. The world as we know it is not to be taken for granted. It is constantly adaptable to new circumstances and technologies. The possibilities are thus imagined to evolve and morph – that is, to be continually reshaped and reconfigured in response to changing circumstances. This is seen as a precondition for a fuller sense of the unknown, or even for the possibility of imagining such circumstances. It is to be imagined as if ‘there’s life’, in both of these terms. In this respect, then, AI is not just another set of tools for the emergent to understand – to have capabilities – but is thought to be an aspect of a wider socio-political-cultural system that needs to be continually (re)imagined and revised. In a broader sense, this means that unlike other kinds of systems, such as land and resources, the social – in both its conceptual and empirical sense – is</text>

Examples of how they have been likened to non-human systems include the social and cultural worlds. The link between the physical and the social is made explicit in the opening lines of the poem: ‘Human nature, its recurring and ultimate designs, is a great work of art’. In the line between the physical and the social, ‘human nature’ is painted in such a way as to be both palpable and intangible. 	[…] Assembling together from diverse points of view, these three-quarters of a million words reveal a single idea: ‘We are who we were meant to be. Over thousands of years, this idea has rung true across the breadth of Eurasian and North African history. But the capacity to read and digest this one true idea as a set of related values and desires, to engage with and ultimately to become what one wants — that is, AI can only ever dream of.’[7] And here, the third line of the poem, between the physical and the social worlds, makes its appearance three quarters of a century and</text>

Examples of how they have been likened to non-human systems include the social and cultural worlds. The link between the image and the object of cognition is not absolute but relies on certain conceptualisations. For example, the eye and the image of the organ are thought to be in synch. This means that images represent sounds and images of movement, but images also have meanings associated with those sounds and movement. In effect, the network represents the social worlds through the social relations between humans and objects. This is similar to the way in which AI is being likened to. The possibilities for AI here refer to the ways in which social relations between humans and non-human actors are imagined to evolve. For example, how social media networks might conceivably augment the role of the individual in the future, while AI networks imagine the possibilities of massively parallelising human cognitive processes. These are thought-experiments that render the possibilities of the future in human terms. They assume a robust cognitive capability that is capable of imagining and modelling the world as a complex system. This is similar to the way that AI is being likened to.</text>

Examples of how they have been likened to non-human systems include the social and cultural worlds. The link between the virtual and actual is perhaps what gives the possibilities of AI their extra-human force and their place in the world. Some have sought to reconcile the two.For instance, in the social-media startup Twitter, the role of the engineer is to interpret the world through a set of rules – interpretive rules. The task is to one degree or another render tweets intelligible across a global platform, but beyond that, to render any tweet intelligible at all. The relation between Twitter and its users is, in my estimation, as real as breathing. Its users are not passive consumers scanning for the next inspirational tweet. They actively participate in the service of a site that produces not only beautiful tweets, but also engaged and influential ones. The service of a site like Twitter produces not only beautiful tweets, but also interesting ones too. And interesting ones can be created by the users.  Inspired tweets are those that pertain to current events, happenings, trends or any kind of ‘moment</text>

Examples of how they have been likened to non-human systems include the social and cultural worlds. The link between the organic and the inorganic world is a development that is still in its infancy, and which needs to be clarified. The organic world is imagined to grow in stages, with stages of inorganic growth preceding each other. For instance, the eye and the gut assume their initial stages of inorganic growth – inorganic matter (eyes and guts) take several days to form corneas – but this does not necessarily entail that these tissues will remain inert and unresponsive: rapid changes in external stimuli can alter the shape of the body's blood vessels and macromolecules, and in turn, bodily functions]. As in the case of the organ, the inorganic world is said to grow in stages, with different micro-environmental factors (SIFs) determining what inorganic materials become bio-absorbable and what are not. For instance, the gut microbiota influences the formation of bovine serum albumin (bSA), a component of bone, through the action of a bacterial over</text>

The link between the image processing units (Photo: Marianne Moore)The emergence of new AI threats is driven by two factors: the increasing complexity of the AI threat, and the increase in data sets that can be fed into the threat. As a result, the threat becomes unmanageable in the face of finite computing resources, and AI must evolve strategies to cope with the new reality. Here, the question is raised: how does the human element interact with the new data streams? At this point, we are entering a period in which experts are beginning to suggest that there is a 'soft' AI threat – that is, AI that is not malicious but friendly – that can be used to subvert or subvert our government, to subvert our belief systems, to subvert our economic systems and political systems.‘Friendship is War’s' answer to this problem is a blunt 'yes'. AI is warlike in its assumption of new AI threats, but unlike other types of malicious intent</text>

It is the combination of new technological understandings of the world with the old adage, &quot;a machine tells a story … with human agents helping to interpret and apply that story″. AI is believed to be able to tell stories that were not originally told by humans, and also able to create narratives that are explicit, precise and self-contained.[1]Artificial intelligence has been likened to cybernetics, or the cybernetics of the future. It seeks to understand the underlying principles of computation and data production in the same way that physical computers do, but with the capacity to execute automated programmes that narrate complex factual situations in a way that no human agent could ever achieve.

Artificial intelligence refers to the branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to simulate phenomena such as human behaviour, emotion and language. In effect, it enables machines to reason like humans, but in a broader sense, it enables them to understand the world through processes of collectivity and interconnectedness. In effect, it enables a multitude of interconnected systems to function like human societies.

He suggests that there are ethical questions that do not involve concepts or language, but rather the decisions that artists and others with artistic inclinations must make regarding the ethical uses of their creative powers.Artists, curators and arts administrators are expected to have an informed and conscious involvement in the use of cultural resources and artefacts. In the age of the big data and social media, it is critical that this involvement remains apolitical and independent. It is easy to align oneself ideologically with a cause or a platform, but it is much harder to align oneself with a cause or a platform that is both informed and creatively engaged. Art is an artefact that is often misrepresented or misunderstood. It is often the case that the artist or curator who undertakes an ambitious project with the museum is the same artist</text>

It enables artists to conceptualise systems that reason and can therefore draw connections between the worlds of art and science, technology and politics, and between art and life itself.Artists are able to draw connections between seemingly disparate phenomena through the power of AI, and the subject is able to identify and identify with the artist.Artists are also able to understand the societal impact of AI through the mechanisms of culture, and there are now compelling reasons to believe that AI can play a significant role in the future of culture itself.Artists are also able to explore ethical questions through mechanisms of AI, including the question of whether AI should be allowed to cause cultural damage.

In this sense, I consider it to be a critical technological question that needs to be addressed in the public sphere.Artificial intelligence has the potential to radically alter the nature of work and artistic production, to produce new kinds of collaborative art projects, and to produce new forms of social interaction.

While there are definitely differences between the ways that humans and machines learn to do things, the similarities end there. Machine learning refers to the process of programming in general, but also algorithms that enable machines to understand fundamental principles such as meaning and purpose. Machine learning is the merging of human and machine learning; the latter is the process of creating ethical and morally ambiguous programs. Machine learning has been likened to natural language processing and artificial intelligence, but unlike those technologies that attempt to reconcile human and algorithmic learning, there is no inherent link between the two.

Mining for resources using machine learning will produce huge profits for companies keen to expand their extractions per head, but at the same time leave behind vast environmental footprints. The potential of combining the two is what has put artists like Jane Stradkin and Peter Brook in touch with the Biennale.

Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power grids, which are expected to produce vast amounts of data every second and which must constantly adjust their components and protocols in response to changes in demand. As a result, the infrastructure of such grids is constantly being modified, and new kinds of malware are evolving in response to new kinds of programming.Such malwares are designed to be detected and to evolve in response to changes in their programming – such as changing grid signals or new programming languages – but they also have the capacity to become malignant in their own right. This is because new kinds of malware respond to the shifting of parameters within the framework of the interface – changing parameters in ways that are indistinguishable from human language. Thus, new kinds of malware are built into the infrastructure of the interface, and they actively seek to replicate the behavior of the human programmer within the interface. New kinds of malware are thus expressions of the inhuman.New kinds of malwares are constantly being designed and evolve through in-depth simulations and / or programmings,</text>

Such systems have their roots in engineering and theoretical computer sciences, but they have recently begun to emerge as a mainframe concern in schools and universities across the globe. Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power grids, which are increasingly vulnerable to disruption by disruptive energy sources, and are also increasingly concerned with monitoring and controlling such sources’ functions. Such criticality has placed ever greater emphasis on the apparent operations of such apparatuses, with serious inquiries into their ‘meaning making’ and their ‘interplay’ with real-life processes and processes that create and disturb ‘societies of habit’.[1]Such systems are developing ever more complex and reactive ways of encodings and media of expression, in part because of the ever-more pervasive and ubiquitous forms of computation that characterize modern life. And although the apparatuses of the internet and apps of all kinds continue to pose a threat, they are also increasingly being engineered to meet specific needs and platforms. As a consequence, the heads of state and government worldwide that sponsor terror worldwide continue to bear a near-identity with those organisations that develop and deploy algorithms, whether state or non-state.

Such systems have their roots in engineering and theoretical computer sciences, but they have recently begun to emerge as a mainframe concern in schools and universities across the globe. Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power and media paradigms, and in fact many of the ‘apparatus’ that we associate with ‘the interface’ today also play a role in managing and interpreting new media phenomena such as social media and geo-location.In short, the built environment (or ‘apparatus’) is an extremely important conceptual framework to understand and create interface possibilities across a globalised and dispersed society. The built environment is foundational to the functioning of any large scale infrastructure – the ‘apparatus’ that supports and directs it – and it is this framework that is constantly evolving and mutating, constantly adapting to new user needs and wants. But more and more, we are entering into realms of unprecedented, even disruptive, disruption to the infrastructure that is based on the built environment. The built environment is the interface that is most consistently understood and used, and this makes it the most vulnerable. The built environment is the sole locus of disruption, and the reason</text>

Such systems have their roots in engineering and theoretical computer sciences, but they have recently begun to emerge as a mainframe concern in schools and universities across the globe. Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power and media paradigms, and are increasingly so as a result of the connectedness and multi-platform nature of contemporary society. In an increasingly interconnected world with ever more sophisticated means of remote control, the ability to inhabit worlds that look like environments but are in fact made up of countless disconnected parts is essential. Such conscious or unconscious interface design is often performed by artists, filmmakers, writers and patrons of art, but it is often done by professionals as well, including in the private and public sectors. This is particularly true of computer-programmed systems that monitor and control users’ behaviour, but it is also true of systems that monitor and control data gathering and transmission, as well as the proliferation of automated creative and surveillance systems. As a result, critical art and critical design has often been deferred to later stages in the development, when it is more obvious that the systems have effects and outcomes and do not simply sit by doing nothing. For instance, critical design today often happens on a smaller scale</text>

Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power and economic crises, and can be relied on to deliver unexpected but useful aid in times of crisis.Such systems have their origins in ancient mythologies of Greek and Roman origin, and are often compared to aspects of our own contemporary society. But unlike other types of cultural artefacts, such as statues and monuments, cultural artefacts have no fixed place of exchange or home for their production and consumption. The arts and craftsmen of yesteryear were able to identify and craft ways to meet current needs and wants in an ever-shifting and fluid way, responding to ever-more complex needs from a shifting population, urban and regional pressures, and economic tides. More and more, today's artists and crafters of all kinds of media, from video artists to social media commentators, are turning to self-starting cultural organisations and DIY cultural practices as a way to meet ever-shifting and ever-larger needs.If the art and craft we produce has origins in an ancient Greek or Roman myth</text>

Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power and water crises, but they have also become vulnerable to malicious third-party apps and websites. In an effort to protect itself, the Apple interface regularly obtains upgrades from Apple’s servers, which it does not always provide in a timely or purely functional way. In these cases, the company can opt to release fixes or new features via software updates, but in the overwhelming majority of cases, users do not need to be told about these developments. Acknowledging this fact, and placing users at the center of decision-making through software updates is the contemporary interface challenge.In an effort to eliminate bottlenecks and other manual elements from the interface experience, graphic designers are often asked to create ‘interface defense strategies’. These are elaborate, time-consuming and error-prone processes that seek to anticipate and mitigate the negative effects of user behaviour in ways that neither Apple nor other device manufacturers can. However, in the quest to enhance the user experience on a massive scale, many</text>

Such systems have their roots in engineering and theoretical computer sciences, but they have recently begun to emerge as a mainframe concern in schools and universities across the globe. Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power grids and other disruptions threatening not only to disrupt supply but to create new forms of semi-permanent scarcity due to over-consumption, and they are often deployed as replacements or augmentations of existing infrastructure. In such cases, the built environment is often reinterpreted in order to serve as a platform for new modes of social and cultural formation. Such novel worlds are often imagined to be possible through subtle but powerful manipulations of human resources, information flows and cultural norms, but they are often employed in an environmentally destructive manner as a way to justify such actions or to help cover the tracks of questionable operations. In the wake of these systems being continuously reconfigured and updated – often in response to user-generated content and innovative approaches to gridlock – new modes of social organization are implied, and questions of sovereignty are raised. It is here that the concepts of ‘institutional racism’ and ‘global capitalist patriarchy’ arise to frame diverse perspectives and question prevailing narratives. Questions of social</text>

Such systems have their roots in engineering and theoretical computer sciences, but they have recently begun to emerge as a mainframe concern in schools and universities across the globe. Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power grids, and in many regions is also the case for emerging computer-systems infrastructures. In such cases, criticality is ascribed to the emergence of new media (e.g., social media), and in many ways this is true: new media have certainly been a transformative force in fundamentally changing how we consume media, and in many ways this is also the case for infrastructure that is increasingly online-oriented: ‘smart cities’ and the associated rise in urban populations are a force for change.’However, as new media and apps proliferate and take root in the built environment, they tend to become embedded and to define the terms and parameters of how individuals and societal groups interact and perceive the world. And so, we can say that the interface today is often seen as a critical enabler of neoliberal capitalism – the logic of the interface is now deeply imbricated in capitalist circulation, and while the user interface may be a ‘woven’</text>

Such systems have become critical in the wake of emerging power grids, which are becoming increasingly adept at sensing and monitoring the physical world around them, and which are becoming increasingly adept at programming the world in ‘humanistic’ ways. In addition to being able to produce and consume information at will, the system is often programmed with conscious or ‘system’-level programming that permits ‘programming’ to take place in ‘the Big’ and in ‘the Little’. In this sense, the system can ‘think things through’ and arrive at conclusions that are ‘sensible’ in the face of changing circumstances. One might add another layer to the metaphor: the built environment that is part of the campus, the urban landscape and the built infrastructure that are part of the connectedness of all of humanity.  One might even propose that the underlying principles underlying the systems of interface that we now call ‘the Internet of Things’ might be relevant to our own in a historical or cultural</text>
