[R]esearch for an article on numbers in art journals would begin with the production of a figure that represents the contingent, fluid and mutable elements of the circulation of art forms, a production that changes with the tides of history, a production that is, at the same time, and remains essentially unpredictable.’[1] This figure, each representing a distinct point in time, is a matrix multiplicative of myriad matrices, each with various sizes and shapes drawn directly from the artwork and published in various art and social science journals. Every element of this figure – the artwork, the data, the methodology, the editors, the reviewers, the editors-in-chief, and the editors themselves – is</text>

Consider the following matrix: 	[N]umbers from 0 to 9, inclusive. Each number represents a person, place, thing, or concept. 	[A] number from 0 to 9, inclusive. (This is a normalized form of the symbol, so it can be easily translated into other languages.) The subscript ‘x’ indicates a multi-valued index.) Each number adds or subtracts one from a given number. For example, the subscript ‘2+2’ translates into  	2*2=8. The multiplicative effect of adding two numbers results in a multiple of two, which is then multiplied by two more to produce a multiple of eight. (The subscript ‘x’ is a special kind of morphism; it has a name, and it describes an effect.) So, for example, the matrix  	3+3=7 	 results in the combination of two numbers, where each combination of two numbers adds or subtracts one from a given number. The</text>

[P]ertaining to image, it is a polynomial (exponential) function of two numbers: the number of the image (in parentheses), and the number of the subject (in red). Here, the image number represents the raw data about the person or entity represented by the image, and the data about the subject (in parentheses), its behavior in the image. Here, the image is some kind of magic marker or cheat sheet that reveals, to some degree, the hidden values or hidden behaviours of a subject or entity in the image. This kind of mapping is not new, and it is one that many realms of modern science and technology aspire to achieve. It is, however, much harder to achieve than one would imagine, given the enormous computational resources at stake, the influence of institutional and cultural power</text>

Afterwards, participants convened in Porto Alegre for a three-course Peruvian cuisine event, entitled ‘Tequila Peruvianami’, during which they shared their interpretations of Peruvian art and culture with Uruguayan and Spanish artists, as well as biennials in each city. The cuisine event also invited artists from the Universidad Di Tella to collaborate with the Uruguayan curatorial team on a project related to the event, as well as ARRIA, the biennial authority in Uruguay. The Uruguayan curatorial team found time to commission a number of artists from the Biennial movement to explore the region, while ARRIA artists explored the region through its art and archipelagos.

In this context, the artists were able to draw on their respective disciplinary perspectives and bring their unique artistic practices to the table. The project was also successful in bringing together local and international artworld stakeholders, academics and artists to work together on the design of a new urban space for the Andes.  The exhibition was designed to be seen as a ‘snap’ in time, emerging from the unfolding narrative of the Andes. The word ‘apocalypse’ was frequently used to describe the condition, and artworks that emerged during the course of the project were often designed to function as warning signs of impending disaster. Art was made to function as both a stand-in for the city and a warning.  The name ‘Apocalypto’ was frequently repeated throughout the project, and participants in the process often resorted to variations of it in place of official documentation or source material. Their efforts were sometimes rewarded with eminent archaeological finds, but in the end, much</text>

The project was also multi-generational, with the participants reflecting on the history of art making and cultural reproduction in South America during and after the 20th century. The project was organized by the Artistic Department of the Universidad Di Tella, with support from the Gran Canaria Cultural Centre and the Biennial Foundation. The participants spoke of their fascination with the idea of the mestizaje, the return to life of art after death, with contributions from diverse cultural and urban actors. These included not only Argentinean artists, but also representatives from the United States, France, Italy, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil.

The project was initially presented in both Spanish and Portuguese as a means to engage with the fact that the name of the city where the project is located is Portuguese – something that has recently come to be referred to as the ‘Portoghesi syndrome’. The thesis of the project, which sought to reconcile two divergent understandings of the same space, was also frequently questioned in the Brazilian media. In his essay ‘Portoghesi’, Guadalupe Jara-Arevalo (2007), anthropologist, critic and art historian Teó Oscar Ramos (1907–92) makes the distinction between the two modes of being in which art can be made: the mode of reflection and the mode of making. He argues that while the name ‘Portoghesi’ conjures up images of bureaucratic processes and the hierarchical structure of formalised art, its true counterpart is the mode of the market forces that shape the world through a complex combination of</text>

The presentation was written up in many different art journals and popular magazines, as well as the local press. Towards the end of the project, a group of us decided to turn the art into a tool that could be used in the social and ecological situations that the Andes provide, through their landscape architecture and the activities of their tribal peoples. This could be a direct action against the prevailing neo-liberal economic and political systems – in other words, it’s not an economic intervention – but rather a strategy of using the architecture that is already there to help create and facilitate a new mode of living. This new mode of living could be based on the technology of housing, food production and distribution, as well as the architecture of infrastructure, including the infrastructure of cultural practices. We invited architects, landscape architects, urbanists and landscape artists from all over the world to collaborate on this new mode of urbanization. Together, we turned the landscape into a site for cultural activity and created a new</text>

The exhibition was curated as a three-day workshop, during which participants worked alongside artists from the Universidad Di Tella, Gran Canaria and the Biennial movement in order to develop a work exploring the ways in which art is made in the Andes and the Americas today. The project was presented as a temporary memento of the event, and as such was highly relevant in the context of the 2014 Biennale. In this context, the project was further developed in order to be showcased at the biennale itself. Through this process, a number of artists were invited to participate in the exhibition in various ways – as artists, curators, researchers, writers, as well as as as art experimenters, in order to make the experience of being part of the exhibitionary curatorial staff as varied as possible.I made a change in my mind a few days before the exhibition was due to open. I had planned to go hiking with friends in the Andes of South America, rather than the beautiful Italian mountain towns around me. Instead of hiking, I decided to do some restoration work in the foothills of Mt. Gordo in the Andes. I had chosen Mt. Gordo because it was the highest peak on the</text>

The three-day exhibition was designed to be an introduction to the region, while the three-day tour provided a more in-depth look into the city. When the exhibition was completed, it was found that the participants found the structures and the way in which they were constructed a valuable and provocative way to think about the social context of their lives as artists. Moving away from the simple object of the building, the structures, positioned at an angle, with pilasters, pulleys, pulleys and pulleys of various shapes and sizes, running parallel and converging with one another, forming a ‘loop’ and an entire series of related loops, that allowed access to different parts of the city.

What is it that the artists, curators and art administrators of the project believed was possible? What are the conditions for artistic productivity? What is the potential for artistic reproduction? What are the conditions for a biennial to become a significant artistic force? What are the limits to artistic productivity? What are the limits to biennials becoming cultural institutions?

The project was presented as a kind of ‘big data’ – the kind of data that enables innovative thinking and can be mined in order to reach new places – but it was also presented as a kind of virtual «reality check’ in that it allowed viewers to step back and create an ‘intermediate space’ between viewer and work – a space where understanding and imagination could freely coexist. In other words, the art could be interactive and interactive media could also be immersive and poetic.Art as a medium has – by this I mean the power of the artist and not necessarily the specific tools or skills – a very dangerous kind of wield. There is a reason why contemporary artists are often accused of being frustrated and artless. The problem with the art form is that it tends to impose a strict, predetermined meaning on what can and cannot be said. When that happens, it’s difficult to tell what is and is not allowed to be said. This is</text>

In this regard, the authors would like to highlight the fact that, in a city such as Liverpool, which has recently become a major hub for online trade and finance, the ubiquity of information sharing between citizens and the facilitation of financial services through the Creationist ­Movement has put a crimp in the already-softening fabric of cooperation between the police and the city's largely impoverished and most disenfranchised population. The authors believe that, as a result, a Future City, built upon the biennial model, could see an increase in cooperation between police and community members, with enhanced educational programmes tailored to their needs and interests.

We must choose between art and destruction. The choice is ours … We must choose between habitation and development. We must choose between nature and creation.

The author of the book Digital Demands  suggests a future in which surveillance is ubiquitous, but today many people do not share that viewpoint.

The authors of the report suggest that a future city should be possible because of the coalescence of relevant infrastructures, but also because of the decimation of jobs and industries throughout the city. The report calls for a ‘world-wide collaborative effort to be assembled around a single concept to describe the current situation and future possibilities of the city’, but it is clear that the authors have their priorities set very differently.  The report contains a resounding ‘No!’ It is clear that, as the report reads, the city is not only a ‘compelling global imperative’ but also a ‘glimmer of hope’ in the future. It is time to change this. ‘We must act now, or face a future without future?’ The authors reply, and many of us in the group respond, with characteristic frankness. We know that change</text>

The promise of these new mediums is that, as with palm-sized computers and satellite imagery, they can be controlled remotely from anywhere, at anytime.  But, as with any new technology, there are questions that need to be addressed and addressed soon in order to reap the full benefits and avoid any issues that may arise from the rampant proliferation of these new technologies.  The current state of knowledge regarding biennials and their impact on the local economies of large metropolitan areas is such that it is difficult to gauge the full impact of a project, let alone determine which projects are most likely to be of benefit to that region.  So, it is with great concern and reluctance that we bring forward some preliminary questions regarding the nature of such projects, and the social ramifications</text>

The authors state that their proposal is not a replacement for what is already happening, but rather evolves along with it.  As has been mentioned many times already, the aim of this dialogue is not to make an ideal city, but to create an ideal city in which to live, learn and play – in their words, ‘where issues of inequality are confronted with the capacity to cause real change and where a sense of community is built into the fabric of the city’.  	Since their proposal is directed at the creation of a Future City, not at the maintenance of an old City, the authors question its true identity and purpose.

For an initial draft, see the document below.] Introduction 	The idea of a Future City emerged from a Neoliberal analysis of postindustrial society, but its realisation has proven elusive. Fictoeral planners have their projects, but they are usually incremental and temporary, designed to satisfy the needs of a particular geographical region or clientele. City dwellers are expected to embrace and participate in these projects as part of a ‘city in their own right’.1  The ‘City in their own right’ refers to the built environment, but what has been called ‘Neoliberal Real Estate Model’ entails much broader social, spatial and temporal changes. Urbanization has shifted the balance of economic, political, and legal power in favour of national governments and financial institutions; ‘</text>

Their proposal is for a city-wide community dialogue about how technology is impacting on community life, with the aim to create a Future City that restores trust between citizens and the new found wealth generated by the connected devices around them.  	Assuming that such a City could ever be built, the authors’ proposal is for a phased implementation of a City State-wide User’s Guide that would provide information on things such as electrical outlets, heating elements and water coolers, as well as detailing the specific services provided by the city-based biennials. Such a user’s guide would offer residents and visitors a clear understanding of what ‘the fuck is going on’. The authors’ proposal is for the phased implementation of the City’s first ever Open House Government - a City-wide public discussion forum that seeks to engage with and learn from the experiences and technologies of Open House Liverpool. The forum would provide a forum for citizens to propose, suggest, and leverage solutions to issues facing the City of Liverpool. Such a forum would not only introduce itself and its participants to an existing City Council and mayor’s Office, but would also act as a springboard to exploring other possibilities for city</text>

An example of this could be found in the use of drones in urban settings, where the authorities increasingly find themselves caught between the need to protect citizens and the need to maximise profits. If the latter is maximised, then the former may become scarce.  In their view, then, the future city is one in which citizens have a greater say in how, and where, information is generated and delivered. This is why biennials have for so many years been convened in the former ‘metro’ districts of Liverpool, such as Anfield, and in the outer cities, such as Brixton, High Street and Greenwich, and have included research projects there as well as in the city. It is because, in the past, such districts had a say in what was delivered to them. Research done in Anfield and High</text>

The artists argue that, unlike in many other places in the world, the biennial could operate on a 'sector-by-sector' basis, analysing the different aspects of the city and its people: be they artists, curators, architects, journalists, politicians or members of any other demographic or sub-demographic of the city. They suggest that, in a city such as Liverpool, the biennial could be engaged with as a city-wide cultural exchange, with the local populations of shops, neighbourhoods and surrounding area contributing to the overall health of the city through their shop, neighbourhood architecture and the activities that foster community. They also propose that, in a future city-wide cultural exchange, the biennial could be formed into</text>

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection on the consequences of capitalism, urbanisation and cultural absorption in the metropolis, coupled with a politics of archive, documentation and preservation that seeks to survive both the macro and microscopic changes that are happening all around it. A politics of archives, documentation and preservation that represents the past but fights the multiple threats that lie ahead. The current biennale has failed to deliver either of these two aims in the way that the biennale of the twentieth century did. In my opinion, the reason for this is that the contemporary biennale today – like every other kind of biennale – pretends to offer a solution to a problem that is far more complicated and unstable than it is, only to offer an inflated version of that solution on a world scale. The biennale of the twentieth century often seemed to offer a resolution to a problem that was far more intractable and prevented from resolving itself. The reason for this was that the twentieth century was an era of neoliberal global</text>

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection on the past, a firm foundation in philosophical, theological and theological questions, and a strong commitment to building collectively, not against the current, but against the future. This seems to me the only way in which the major contributions of my conference could responsibly be taken, and which is perhaps even more in keeping with the spirit of the biennial as an institution today. What is needed is a sustained and explicit response to the question, How should art be made, made in, and across cities? The answer to this question will allow us to create what is perhaps more appropriately termed ‘collaborative practice’, the emergence of which is a product both of the conference and of the city in which it takes place. What other questions could it possibly address? Perhaps a better question is, What could bifurcate the conference and the city, and thus the art world and the biennial as a whole? The answer to this is a resounding ‘world�</text>

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary urban analysis that puts the present in the context of a city’s future. Unfortunately, in the current cultural climate, and especially in the current globalised cultural economy, this kind of analysis is often presented as a task for a museum or a curatorial commission, rather than as an essential part of the contemporary art market. That is, the current biennial commission may be more interested in its historical imperative than its historical, ‘cultural’ value. As biennials become more institutionalised and more globalised, and as tour numbers proliferate and changes exhibitionary forms become ever more important, it is vital that curatorial and art-historical commissions are present in the present, present and future visions of city. What other kinds of biennials could this analysis possibly lead to? I have my own ideas. In an ideal world, I believe that biennials would lead to: a) historical research b) a kind of understanding of contemporaneity and c</text>

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection on the changes wrought by biennials, and a systematic revision of the historical and contemporary reflection on what constitutes a biennial. At the same time, there is a need to foster creativity in the right places at the right times, and to ensure that such creative endeavours do not become mired in the bureaucratic mire of the modern city. This last is perhaps my own main contribution to the contemporary biennial. It is true that in an increasingly urbanised world we are experiencing it is increasingly difficult to find art within the parameters of contemporary urban environments. Art is no longer provided by monoliths, or even by the ideologies of traditional urban centres. But this is to be expected. Cities now control most of what they use as material resources; they are the economic satellites of the planet, and artists are the last human remnants of a once in space human race. The only remaining strand of the once humanist strand of artistic thinking is urban. Biennials are the last</text>

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection on the impact of biennials on the city and on culture in the intervening years. There is no reason why these reflections cannot be interdisciplinary, or why they may well address the issues raised by the biennial in a variety of other ways. That is, cultural production in the present and in the intervening years may be useful in generating knowledge about the issues raised by biennials today, and in generating the knowledge needed to challenge those issues in the future.  The biennial has become the object of political control, and the political is a complex intersting process that requires great skill and concentration. I do not believe that political biennials are inherently uninteresting or that the institutionalised biennial is uninteresting either. I think that the biennial, as an art form and a cultural form in its own right, has become sufficiently institutionalised that it is no longer possible to conceive of its internal dynamics in art's old non-art socio-political sense.

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection on the past, taken as a whole.  The biggest obstacle to this kind of historical reflection today is the proliferation of the biennial, and the related biennial observation. While the biennial may seem like a large and conspicuous presence in major cities, in the countryside and in remote places, it is largely invisible.  The biennale itself is often exaggerated as an art form, often misconstruing its own significance and function. For example, the Venice Biennale, which began in 1994, was, for many years, the largest and most visible art form in North America. While it was active, it was almost entirely a visitor attraction, exhibiting works by international and local artists, as well as a festival of sorts – giving it a kind of annual budget. In recent years, however, it has become increasingly difficult to find a place in the biennale without having to pass through an exhibition hall, and probably most biennials these day are equally affected</text>

They should also be able to identify and understand the difference between a city that was once a vibrant centre of culture and a city that is now a city of exhibition venues, clothing outlets and cafes. Finally, they should be able to understand that the contemporary art market today is dominated by the latter type of city. There is no reason why contemporary art should not also address the new challenges that beset the contemporary art market in the future – challenges that may include, but are not limited to, the challenges of a densely populated biennale. What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection on the past, a dialectical relationship between the past and the present, and a long-term perspective. Without such a combination, the former would be ideal. The art market today is a complex phenomenon, and it is possible that the biennial market will remain static for some time to come. However, I see great promise in the ability of young people to get a sense of the scale of the change that is occurring. It is now or never, and although change may be slow and uncertain, it is increasingly clear that change must be brought about. If we are to embark on long-term trends, we need to be able to detect when they are occurring, and do something about it.  The biennial is a strange beast. It is embedded in the larger, more pervasive cultural system we have collectively evolved to accommodate; it is a double-edged sword, which many people in the art world would sooner or later want to take on board.

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection and analysis to produce a fuller picture. This is why biennials are historical reflections and why biennials should be contemporary. They are there to tell a story, and the story they tell is a story that is richer and more complex than what is told in most contemporary art museums. This is why biennials have a literary or artistic orientation. They are there to tell a story, and the story they tell is a story that is more likely to be told by people who were once artists and designers. Last but not least, biennials have a function. They are there to be seen, to be experienced, to be acquired, to be frolicked in the city – in short, to be there. This last characteristic is essential in any description of a biennale. It conveys the complexity of the social, cultural and urban context in which it occurs, and it is essential in any description of a city in which it occurs. The biennial as</text>

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection on the condition of urban culture in the future urban form, drawing on knowledge that has been gained in the past through research institutions, arts and cultural organisations. This is why, at the age of thirty-five, I embarked on a Fulbright Scholarship, sponsored by the Swedish Council, to undertake a Fulbright Fulbright – a Fulbright Chair in Urban Studies, and a Fulbright Fellow in Art and Architecture. I have to say something quite negative about the way in which the scholarship was presented, and the way in which the students were engaged. The way in which the scholarship was presented was not through a curatorial conceit, but by inviting students to engage with and map out the city in their own minds, drawing on their cultural experiences and observations. For instance, the way in which the Fulbright Fulbright Chair sits on a chair, or the Chair being driven by a machine, or the use of a robotic arm, and the Chair’s movements, is all</text>

What is needed, in my opinion, is a combination of historical and contemporary reflection on the past, a sort of collective unconscious that can be activated by the encounter of different types of urbanity. If done properly, this collective unconscious can act as a spring, and art can therefore play a part in its creation. This is the kind of thinking and deep thinking that, in a way, is missing in contemporary art. It is one that is committed to the replication of the experience of taste, and yet it lacks the gusto, the zest and the juice required to actually create a new urban environment. I’m thinking here of an art market that is acutely aware of its role, and an art market that is also acutely aware of its limitations. It can create a new kind of art market – one that is as ethically dubious as it is entertaining – but it cannot create a new art market on its own. In this sense, the contemporary art market – like its industrial cousin – is exposed to the vagaries of economic and cultural dynamism</text>

The book is a meditation on the ways in which truth is made manifest through language, and on the necessity of contesting that truth through various means. It is the response to the lack of a truly public stand in the way of manifesting the truth, and the consequent loss of face and self-image that results from surrender to the prevailing power of the prevailing notion.

And that is where art can play a part. It is possible that the biennial format could be adapted to artist-led initiatives, and that the biennial could adopt a full-fledged artistic director. But for the moment, the biennial remains the battlefield of the imagination.It is not clear where this uncertainty comes from, or what the answer is, other than to say that the biennial form has no idea what it is looking out for. If it had any spine, it would want to support an ongoing artistic direction, and it would want to know what is happening in surrounding communities. What it cannot afford is a lack of power, or in other words, a lack of knowledge. In order to have a chance of being taken seriously, an artistic direction should be well-coordinated, and knowledge shared. And as biennials become more and</text>

Whether it will or won't, however, remains to be seen.1. The term ‘battlefield’ is used colloquially by art historians such as John Urry, to describe places and issues with a high probability of being fought or won, and with a tendency to produce decisive outcomes. It is significant that the first edition of the Biennale was held in 1914, just as the First World War was beginning.2. The word ‘battlefield’ derives from Middle English berg, from Old Norse bergjaðr (&quot;battle field, field of battle&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰur- (&quot;to bear, bear, sustain, secure, secure, secure, identify, locate&quot;).3. ‘Berg’ is an adjective meaning &quot;steadfast&quot;, as in ‘B</text>

When biennials – and their authors, artists and curators – start to engage with the city in more formal and visible ways, it is often in an area or in a city, these ‘battlefields’ are rapidly becoming what Orwell would describe as ‘peripheral vision’. The perforated form of the biennial – with its many short-lived local recurrence, regional instants and ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ ephemerides – is a global visual system that organically assembles and distributes the visible, recording, surveilled, and identifiable places and behaviours of the past, present and future that are constantly with us. It is an ongoing, ever-present, and is evidently designed to last for thousands of years.  Whether urban or rural, centrally located or dispersed, the biennial is a visual language that emerged during the 1980</text>

The biennial format allows the visualisation of trends in a specific area, and the address of these trends, through a series of juxtaposed images, usually gathered in recent years from local communities, representing the history, the present or some future state of living in the area where the event took place. The images are intended to be confrontational, and often political. We often hear the term ‘battlefield’ but rarely do artists have a say in where such battlefields take place. This is one of the few places where artists can exert real influence, and these images can certainly do that. However, as with other aspects of the ‘battlefield’ – language, numbers and positions – it can also be a very slippery slope. As the biennial format is developed, and as the ‘battlefield’ gets bigger, the ‘battlefield’ gets more surveilled, and as new technologies make it easier to identify and quantify anything that happens in that area, it is easy to lose sight of the real battlefields. The real struggle continues. This is particularly true in contested urban spaces like Liverpool, where citizens continue to be the face of things, though increasingly the mere idea is being projected onto social media and websites. It is up to us, as citizens, to project the battle for our cities onto the social networks and maps, and to the courts and representative bodies that are supposed to be regulating and picking up the pieces when these technologies are exported and incorporated into everyday life. The battle for our cities may well be fought on social media and in the courts, but its terrain may well be increasingly surveilled and computer-aided. The battle for our minds may well be a close one, but it is increasingly looking like a battle for our very souls. This is happening at an increasingly rapid clip, and yet few are paying any attention. Perhaps we are failing as a city because we are too busy losing ourselves in the systems</text>

It is often said that Battlefield: San Francisco is the Apple of Battlefield 4, but more and more biennials are turning to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to find the big picture and long-term perspective, and while these technologies certainly have their uses, they are also tools designed by an increasingly sophisticated society to be abused. The slippery slope is real, and it is a feature not just of Battlefield, but of contemporary society. Sometimes a biennial can seem to be a front for a much bigger social process. This was certainly the case with the Liverpool Biennial, which repeatedly promoted itself as being about the struggles of its diverse parts, rather than the overarching social struggle. It was a very effective way to have a public event, and even though it was a public event, it became embedded in the city for a while, appearing in people’s heads rather than outside them, and appearing as though it were some kind of</text>

It’s as if the biennial were a global mapping system, and the battlefields it points to are the battlefields of the twentieth century. This is a dangerous game to be in, and artists are often at a disadvantage in this regard, but it’s also true that the biennial has far greater cultural resources at its disposal than any contemporary art museum. The biennial has a global reach because it’s a curatorial system, and because it’s constantly seeking to add new episodes to the cycle. It’s like a big interdisciplinary festival. It’s possible that the biennial could be restructured to address contemporary art’s current political situation, but in its current form, the festival serves a specific function – it radiates artist’s power and creates a favorable environment for art to be made in the festival’s vicinity.

It is easy to become attached to the biennial as a static artifact, and to forget that it is possible to simultaneously separate art from life and vice versa. The biennial field of view is a complex one, and it is this complexity that makes it so compelling. It is possible to grow disenchanted with it, and to realise that the lifeblood of the biennial is the constant shifting of exhibition numbers, and the constant on-going construction of ever larger and more encompassing displays of things – in effect, the ‘battlefield’ as an ever-expanding set of artificial surfaces.Art’s place in this modern ‘battlefield’ is in the peripheries, and it is this fact that makes the biennial interesting, and so fascinating in its own right.

I don’t think this is a bad thing, in fact I think it’s a step in the right direction. On the contrary, I think that the increasing surveillance state we are subject to now, and the fact that we are all interconnected via social media, makes it easier for the surveillance state to claim ever greater chunks of the pie. The battlefield in these images is the city battlefield, and the pockets that make up its raised frontiers are the battlefields of our urban future. I think that the use of these images as a blunt tool for surveillance is a mistake, and that the biennial format is the wrong format for the fight against inequality and injustice.

The project was ultimately about re-constituting a city in relation to the activity of transient culture, while simultaneously acknowledging its inherent frailties and vulnerabilities. Drawing directly on their experiences, these artists proposed ways of organising the city around modes of mobility that do not rely on formal hierarchies and do not require citizens to subscribe to specific identities or creeds. The proposal received broad support from within and without the city, with many citizens arguing that it was able to achieve this through a more traditional mode of city-building. However, since its inception, the project has faced multiple challenges, which were ultimately not able to survive in a city environment. As a project, it has been able to adapt its activities to the urban environment, while remaining sensitive to the needs of its transient community. As a result, today the Mapping Project is able to evolve into something completely different and innovative, while maintaining its commitment to the city at large.1  Hybrid theory and critical theory have long been at odds with one another. As Geoffrey Bowen describes in the Oxford English Dictionary, modern and contemporary hybrid theory &quot;…provides a vocabulary for combining elements of many different sorts, much as a modern and modernist dictionary can for combining parts of many different sorts.&quot;2</text>

The project was ultimately about re-constituting a city in relation to the activity of transient culture, while simultaneously acknowledging its inherent frailties and vulnerabilities. Drawing directly on their experiences, these artists proposed ways of organising the city around modes of mobility and flow as opposed to capitalising on them. Art may be used to counter capital’s propensity to locate where it can do the most damage, while simultaneously suggesting solutions to its problems. Art as a tool may ultimately serve the city in a way that is more beneficial to the people it is directed against. We begin to understand that the art that was produced in response to the crisis of the city was not necessarily created to defend the city from it, but rather was produced in response to its use in an ever-increasingly complex and privatisable society.  A panorama photograph is often used in an urban context to illustrate this transition. It is a portrait of a city at a distance, captured with a macro lens, often with a macro mask, usually taken from a tower. The image is often used as a horizon, or at least as a point of departure from which the photographer may draw a kind of conceptual or terminus for his investigation.

Drawing directly on their experiences, these artists proposed ways of organising the city around modes of mobility that do not necessarily necessitate the establishment of a new government or new ­class of ­citizens. The proposals were explicitly contextual and linked to present political situations and social dynamics in an effort to generate new understanding and new practices, but also to the ongoing need to think and act differently in the face of ongoing or impending displacement. It is this need for change and new knowledge that makes the Mapping Project so powerful and so timely in the present and in the longer term. But it is also the need to continually re-evaluate and re-tool in order to maintain and even accelerate that change. In other words, the projects suggested by the artists and their collaborators were not necessarily projects that solved immediate problems or guaranteed permanent advances for all involved, but rather projects that evolved organically from the very beginning of the project.  One example of this can be found in the sub-titled project ‘Birds of Paradise’ that was developed between 2006 and 2009 in cooperation with the Naturalis B</text>

Drawing from their own experiences, they articulate a ‘new urban landscape’ that would allow for the ‘emergence’ of ‘differentiated forms of cultural practice’, a future that would permit ‘a dense, diverse urban infrastructure for cultural activity’ and ‘a cultural epiphany’.[6] 	[7] In a broader sense, ‘mapping’ might be thought of as a cultural technique, or, to be specific, a way of gathering knowledge of</text>

There are of course far more of those who we should be contributing to the city, and far more of those who we don’t know exist, than there are of those who we do. Of course, the city today is complex and dynamic, and the interaction of all those with whom it comes into contact (including those who’ve never set foot in this city) is ever-changing. The ability of the Mapping Project artists to conceive and execute a city in a way responsive to the needs of all of those with whom it comes into contact is a key to unlocking hitherto undreamed-of power structures. 	It was not just theoretical musings about the immobility of people in a city that often got rendered as though people only lived in ‘one city’. The city is a much more complex system. In their</text>

The project was ultimately about re-constituting a city in relation to the activity of transient culture, while simultaneously acknowledging its inherent frailties and vulnerabilities. Drawing directly on their experiences, these artists proposed ways of organising the city around modes of mobility that are resilient to the pressures of a city full of people – but also dependent on the activity of a few transient populations.  A city is only as large as its population, and as the city grows larger, so does the need for new ways of organising itself. The proposals in this volume respond to the question: how do we create the conditions for the emergence of new modes of urbanisation through the medium of art?  Art’s ability to generate new modes of urbanisation depends on many factors, including the cultural values that it inculcates in its audiences, the productivity of its artists’ labour, and its position within a given society.  The volume addresses a number of key questions that continue to shape the mode of art – questions of territoriality, public space, public resources, public aesthetics, public needs, and public relations. Drawing directly on their experiences in the area, the artists propose a set of three-tiered public spaces (public realm, public gallery</text>

But we don’t have the resources or the will to tackle it because of our finite world.

Man-made global warming is going to have to be collectively managed. New economies are going to have to be created, and they’re going to have to be run on renewable energies and ecological principles. The challenge now is how to coordinate these disparate resources so that they all benefit humanity in the long-term. This is the ecological as opposed to natural resource challenge.Ecological principles and ecological management have been shown to be more economical and environmentally beneficial than other options. For example, the economics of biofuels clearly favour the production of wood and paper over the production of other building materials and biofuels. Aims such as lowering transport costs and increasing the density of cities are in part driven by the expectation that the greater the density of people, the greater the environmental impact. But there are other factors that also come into play. For example, the size and shape of a city is a significant factor in determining what kind of infrastructure is put in place,</text>

We don’t have the knowledge or the resources to address the systemic issues of inequality and injustice that are creating new forms of suffering. We need collective action. And collective action is coming from all over the world. As an example, we’ve seen an unprecedented number of refugees fleeing conflict in Syria and other parts of the world. Many of those fleeing conflict are women and children. The challenges we are facing, and the technologies we are using to manage our resources are coming from very different places. The tools that we use to manage our resources may be similar to the tools of terrorists, but there are also different kinds of terrorists. The kinds of terrorism that we as a society are capable of are different from the kinds of terrorism that terrorists employ. And so, when we</text>

But we don’t have the resources or the will to tackle it because of our finite world. We don’t have the political will or the economic capacity to challenge the economic and social systems that create the global predicament we are trapped in.As Clive Crook’s term describes, ‘space-making’ is a process leading to social phenomena. Space-making begins with the socialisation of space and the socialisation of people, and while individual people will inevitably fail in their attempts to create better publics and more just private spheres, they can learn to expect and appreciate better publics and more just private spheres in exchange for nothing. For example, the art world is a social enterprise because it offers a way of understanding the world through art that no other form of art can achieve. Art has the potential to reshape social norms and expectations because it is embedded in such a deeply ingrained way within culture that we find it impositions on our behaviour that we can break free of. Art is a powerful tool because it is able to exist in a perpetually shifting public sphere because it is both rare and cheap – both in terms of labour and material resources. Art has the</text>

We don’t have the political will or the economic capacity to challenge the economic and social systems that are fuelling the crisis head-on. So we try to tackle something that is systemic but individualistic (the fossil-fuel industry) and collective-focused (the environmental movement), while still allowing individuals and small groups to have a say in how the system is designed and constructed.This is what we do differently from other environmental movements: we focus specifically on the problems at hand (climate change, deforestation, pollution, depletion of wild habitats, depletion of freshwater, depletion of animal species), and we do it with tools and methods that are specific to that movement (research, writing, street action, festivals, petition-ing, theatre, art). We do it using what sociologist Ewan Birney calls ‘the problem-solving mind’. The problem-solving mind sees immediate, tangible gains for society from tackling the big picture. It sees big picture solutions that build towards a solution rather than acting upon them. For example, the destruction of rainforests could be</text>

More than that, we can all work towards a future where the temperature doesn’t rise more than a few degrees Celsius. That’s the goal of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): to reach that goal. The reality is that we’ve got to stop warming now. The question is how to do that. The IPCC has already admitted that we’ve got to do it ourselves. We don’t have the political will or the economic capacity to achieve that, and we certainly don’t have the social or cultural literacy to transition to a low-emission future without tackling the root causes of our climate change. So we’ve got to be creative and proactive in looking for other solutions.Man-made global warming</text>

I believe that what we really need are creative as opposed to reductive solutions. We need to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the existing order, and then draw inspiration from those communities for what are essentially self-sustaining ways of organising society. I would imagine that some of the answers to the questions above would allow us to identify promising places to be, and places where we can build together, and allow us to participate in creating a better world. Some solutions would see us thrown into chaos and in dire need of an intervention. I would propose that we instead try to identify promising places where we can work constructively with vulnerable people in a non-hierarchical, cooperative way, and create what I like to call a Community Land Trust (CLT).

It�s not just that the market dictates what type of project is possible, but that the market also dictates what kind of project is possible. What can an organisation do? How can an organisation create a project? How can an organisation persuade a developer to create a project? How can an organisation create a community to undertake a project? How can an organisation employ people to undertake a project? I want to know what the relationship is between an organisation and an organisation that, by its very nature, produces outcomes, and I want to know what that relationship is. Does the organisation produce outcomes or instigate processes?  A project that’s being done now by an organisation that I know very well, and I don’t necessarily know what their relationship is to an organisation that I don’t necessarily know what their relationship is to.

It�s no longer enough to say: this is a design concept that’s being considered by a city council; there has to be a collective understanding between the city council members and the local residents. Does the community want that kind of interpretation? Let me give you an example: the Cooper Union is planning to create a new programme of activities for the members. The plans are very exciting, but the question is whether the residents want to participate. Is the question whether the residents want to host a community fair? Let me give you an example: the local residents have a project called Homebaked, and it’s about the history of the bakery and the area. The project calls for the creation of a community trust, which would give the bakery a second life; the bakery would become a home for several years, while the community could use the space and become involved in the building of the community. The project calls for a participatory process, and so the local residents set up the bakery</text>

It�s no longer possible to design a city from the top down. The city is being designed from the bottom up. Is there still a chance that an innovative urban policy could be developed from the ground up, with an emphasis on green space and rural development? Let me give you an example. Take a look at an area that’s being developed in the city: the Near Eastside. This is an area that’s been earmarked for a new airport. The Near Eastside is a ‘golden age’ of residential and commercial development that’s dominated by the city, with a mix of restaurants, bars, residential buildings and a Whole Foods Market on the corner of Broadway. The airport would bring thousands of jobs to the area, along with huge tax breaks for developers. Unfortunately, the economic potential of such an investment has been squandered on a million other projects in the city, mostly in the form of luxury condos and the like. The airport doesn�</text>

More and more, we are seeing that the language between the architect and the designer is far more valuable than the language between the architect and the peasant or the worker and the capitalist. It�s no longer enough for the architect to understand what the role of a city was in the past; the city has to be reinterpreted and re-configured according to the desires and interests of the powerful. This is the age of the ‘design icon’ and the ‘design slacker’. The implication of these words is that we have to become radically more urban – radically more urbanist – in order to be taken seriously as architects and as artists. This is a radical proposition for a city to adopt. It seems completely backwards to me, as a city that’s been around for another 1500 years, and has been developing at such a clip, that it’s now time for cities to reinvent themselves. Why change the world when you can just change how you live? Why change the world when you can just move? Why change the world when you can just stop existing?

More and more, we are seeing that the language between the architect and the designer is far more valuable than the language between the architect and the peasant or the worker and the capitalist. It�s like saying and doing away with the working class. Instead of saying ‘I’m going to design a city’, we are borrowing words from various socio-political groups and groups of people, from different professions and stripes, and using them to make decisions about what kind of city to be. That is to say, it’s not the decision of the planners to make; it’s the decision of the working class to organise itself. How is that possible? It’s a question that interests me. September 11th, 2001, New York City. The Twin Towers are brought down by an enormous amount of kinetic energy. The architecture of New York is being shredded asunder by the true, violent destruction of the city. The city is being turned into a giant virtual desert, a kind of ‘metainterface’ where traffic, by virtue of being part of a global circulation, is part of the narrative. The urban space is being</text>

More and more, we are seeing that the language between the architect and the designer is far more valuable than the language between the architect and the peasant or the worker and the capitalist. It�s not clear to me how or whether the relationship between the city and organisation like the PRC is based on ideology or values; I don’t know what the values are in the PRC. But I do know that ideology and values don’t mix. And I do know that values don’t mix with reality.I think that the attitude that we need to have in mind when we talk about the future of urbanisation is that of a society that has different sorts of space.‘Public space’ is an outdated concept. Space is inherently privatisable, and I think that what we’re seeing in places like Hong Kong and Singapore is the inevitable consequence of this. Urban development has become so permissive, and spaces so limited, that people have to negotiate difficult compromises in order to access public space. But I do think that there’s a space now, and there’s a space of experience that’s missing. There�</text>

More and more, we are seeing that the language between the architect and the designer is far more valuable than the language between the architect and the peasant or the worker and the capitalist. It�s not always obvious what the differences are, but increasingly they are, and this is a good thing. It’s good that the urban centre is shifting towards sustainable ways of building, but it’s also good that the city is shifting towards sustainable ways of organising itself. Sustainable planning implies a certain amount of urban backtracking, which is good for urban growth, but it’s bad for the countryside: the backtracking necessitates the building of roads and rail lines, and the transition to more sustainable modes of consumption. Cities today are complex systems, and the increasing scale of the urbanisation process necessitates a greater integration of the countryside. The language we use to think about these things – the way we organise ourselves, the way we look at the world, and the way we perceive our place in it – plays a huge role in how we perceive the world. Cities today are often made to look progressive, but this is only possible at a scale of industrialisation. The rise</text>

More and more, we are seeing that the language between the architect and the designer is far more valuable than the language between the architect and the peasant or the worker and the capitalist. It�s no longer enough to say that the architect’s role was to envision an ideal city; now the city has to be planned according to these new technocratic codes. The city has to be capable of accommodating a diversity of modes of human behaviour; different modes of capital formation have to be accommodated. The role of the city cannot be an isolated condition. The city has to negotiate the complex interactions between people and modes of mobility; it’s supposed to be a city in which modes of production converge. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that everything has to be automated. There have to be ways for the city to support life, including by supporting cultures of craftsmanship and subsistence. There have to be ways for the city to be creative in its interactions with the world around it, including through the creation of sustainable urban environments.

I’m not sure what the relationship is between Art and Architecture, but I’m curious what the relationship is between an architect and a project. What does it mean to be an architect? What does it mean when an architect creates a project? What does it mean to be a designer? I’d like to know what the relationship is between a city and an organisation that is charged with designing a city? How is that relationship supposed to work? I want to know what it means to be a designer in a larger sense. More and more, we are seeing that the language between the architect and the designer is far more valuable than the language between the architect and the peasant or the worker and the capitalist. It�s no longer sufficient for the architect to design a city in her†schedule, but the city must be designed in her schedule as well. The city must be responsive to the needs of the people. The city has to be able to respond to contingencies. If the city is unable to do this, then there is a problem with the priorities of the city. In an ideal world, the city would simply be a place where people could come and do things without having to worry about what to do when they get there. But there is no ideal world. There are many possible futures for the city, and the reason why residential neighbourhoods are so important is that in a never-never land, ‘the future’ is always ahead of the present. In an ideal world, the future doesn’t bring with it a radical change in the present, but it does bring with it a progressive change in the future, because the future is always the most certain of possible futures.

It�s not always obvious how this happens, but increasingly we are seeing projects that are initiated by an organisation that’s both a broker and a manufacturer of spatial relationships, not necessarily necessarily necessarily both. This is especially true for social, civic and cultural projects, since the latter are often charged with the planning and execution of a city’s spatiality. 	Knowledge is power. 	Knowledge is power, and more and more people are accessing that through their local libraries, museums and archival collections. In the 1980s and 1990s, when I started, the local community was the only group of people who had access to this knowledge, but now there is a massive inter-generational circulation of knowledge happening. Local people are the future of the project, since they are the ones with access to this knowledge and are therefore the ones who will run the project into the future. 	Knowledge is power.

It’s a feeling of lost potentiality, as the dead hand of capitalism crawls back into being.But perhaps there can be some hope here, for the last days of the Hong Kong uprising were, in a way, like those in The Matrix, in that they signaled a return to something approximating a pre-apocalyptic future.

This may be the case in a future when everything we do is mediated by algorithms, but at this point in time, we’ve still got it all wrapped up, in our phones, in the form of pictures, blogs, tweets, videos, news feeds and so forth. These constitute a new kind of human being, perhaps even one with a moral compass. Perhaps we can call this new kind of being ‘the technologist’, someone with a sense of purpose and an emotional capacity for action. I don’t know whether my generation would agree with this. Perhaps we should all aspire to it, and nurture it in ourselves.Download this article as PDFKate HoffmanCompassion, Compassion InternationalThe Compassionate ImageWorkplace:  	Unravelled 	Compassion International (2015). Founded in Canada in 1971,  	Compassion International is a non-</text>

I mean, I don’t mean that digitally, as in the Terminator movies, but rather that constructively, destructively, androids are emerging everywhere, in every possible setting, bearing various forms of biological or cybernetic augmentations of human behaviour. And I think that is a very dangerous situation. We’ve all felt that our digital media – whether it’s Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram – play a fundamental role in maintaining the social compact. Whether it’s the social compact as a whole or just the subset of users who use certain services, whether it’s the collective cognitive compact that we as a species build into ourselves, whether it’s the collective will – all of these things are built into the system, and thus</text>

Call that what ‘existential fragility’. This is the condition of global nomadic capitalism. Nominative and international, it’s the moment to intervene.  The only way to really know what catastrophe might mean, to really grasp the scale of the challenge at hand, is for people to lose their minds and become deeply involved. But as we saw, that takes massive public assistance. I propose that we adopt two additional conditions. The first is that we work constructively with those who seek to destroy our cultural values. The second is that we actively seek to build new ways of inhabiting the places that are being threatened with destruction. My second proposition is the only one that gets taken up.

That was the promise of new media, and while some might celebrate that as a liberating insight, I don’t agree with it. The advent of social media and the drone gave rise to a new breed of media user – one who was nimble, flexible and capable, and could take advantage of ever more pervasive data capture and processing. These users were strikingly like their cyber-human forebears, only much more susceptible to the seductive lure of shiny objects and fast downloads. They were also nimble, flexible and capable, and could adopt almost any behaviour suited to the tasks at hand. For instance, the dashcam may not yet be a staple of media consumption, but it is becoming increasingly common for drivers to record their trips, often documenting moments of excitement and chaos along the way. In a sense, then, the dashcam is a convenient storytelling device, helping to establish the speed of travel as much</text>

But we don’t live in such worlds; we live in virtual worlds. And as virtual realities proliferate and evolve, so do our inhabitants’ social worlds shift. A virtual reality is one in which the avatar moulds and can be molded to meet our needs, desires and perceptions. It’s an evolving medium through which we can observe and experiment with new media and understandings of space. It’s the story of how we come to inhabit particular worlds and how those worlds were created.In   	The Trip, the protagonist, William Hartnell, describes how he arrived at his present predicament: ‘This was all possible because of a rubber bullet that was</text>

The nano- and meso-sized crystals of the cobblestone are broken up and the liquid hydrocarbons extracted from the mudflats. The extracted water and minerals are used in the production of bio-composite bricks that have the added benefit of being able to withstand further action of the decomposing organic matter in the soil. The extraction of water and the minerals is done in large mechanised extraction points on the Dartington and in the surrounding area by hand, using a mixture of sand, water and rocks. The extraction points spray chemicals into the ground to extract water and rocks, while the plants in the vicinity use kinetic energy to split the material into smaller pieces. Once the pieces are extracted, they are sent to separate stages of the chemical reaction that create bio-composite bricks.

The nano- and meso-sized crystals that form in the action of those chemicals will then bond to each other and form larger and more complex structures. These bonds can then be activated by the addition of iron or other trace elements. The potential for loss or enhancement of those structural qualities has, until now, largely been theoretical. 	Balasubramanian has a particular interest in the use of mudflats as building materials because he believes that the action of those chemicals in the environment results in the formation of microstructures that can then be used to make high-performance buildings. In the UK, that includes the use of binderless mills for the purpose of producing high-strength concrete, steel, aluminium and glass. 	But there are other uses of the materials as well. For instance, the action of those chemicals in the environment can be used to repair or augment the performance of existing building materials.

When considering the larger context of urbanization in the metropolis, the potential loss from the nanotechnology industry is also significant. The Leeds Biennial has already committed to replacing some of its assembly sites with automated assembly lines, and others, such as Brixton and New York, have similar programmes but are scaling back. If the Biennial can adopt a similar programme for its own sites, it will create thousands of new jobs and expand the local market for low-paid service workers. 	When considering the potential spread of these technologies, scholars, including myself, should also be paying attention. The biennial has the potential to become a source of new knowledge, and it is possible that this could happen at a faster rate than the related museum and zoos.

It is also understood that the aim of the research is to find materials and engineering solutions that are both lightweight and strong enough to be used in conjunction with the building materials. The ability to use these materials in a wide range of applications is an emerging concern. 	It is also understood that the main application for  	Brick is its ability to stand up to extreme pressures and temperatures. The thermal conductivity of the concrete is important in this regard, since it determines how well the building is structurally sound. The thermal conductivity of the concrete is expressed as a function of its mass per unit area: when the mass of concrete is less than the area of a human hair, the thermal conductivity is maximised. When the mass of concrete is greater than a human hair, the thermal conductivity is less than one Øhundred</text>

For instance, the impact of the use of mudflats in the production of bio-composite bricks by Prof. S.N. Balasubramanian, who is now Research Chair at Liverpool John Moores University’s Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, is being measured. 	The impact of media is expected to be similar to that of other building materials, with the exception of the potential that some of the media will have some of the nano- and meso-structural attributes of the materials that are being used. 	In the case of bricks and materials, the potential is that some of the nano- and meso-structural attributes of the building materials will be lost in the action of the chemicals that are being used to treat the bricks and the materials that are added to them. The nano- and meso-alloys may also have certain other desirable properties, but the fact of their existence and activity is a significant step in their pursuit. 	Balasubramanian is particularly interested in the potential of bio-composite materials to be used in buildings that are neither ‘muddy nor a clogging bog’. He is currently researching the bio-composite movement in India and is seeking input from civil engineers, physical landscape architects, journalists and others on how to harness the potential of these materials in such ways as building insulation, fuel cells and more. 	Balasubramanian is also seeking input from the media on how to cover the movement of goods, vehicles and raw materials. Should the use of alternative building materials become established, he suggests that it should detail the workers’ role in the production of bio-composite bricks, not rely on images of sedentary industrial uses of bio-composite bricks.

The nano- and meso-sized holes that hold the building materials in place will then allow the added strength of the building material to be created. In the event that a chemical reaction between the building materials and the building materials produces undesirable properties, the materials can be reinforced with additional nano- and meso-sized holes. This is similar to the way in which DNA is assembled in the human genome. 	Around 2200 CE a Neo-Platonist heresy was born in China, calling for a complete separation of church and state. In the wake of this, Emperor Qin Shi Huang outlawed all forms of religion, asserting that science and religion were mutually exclusive. Shi Huang was overthrown by a later Chinese emperor, but his atheism is generally regarded as a major mistake that laid the basis for much of the degeneration of the country. Today, places of higher learning in China are characterised by a monastic form of learning in which the emperor’s subjects are distinctly absent. 	The Emperor’</text>

The nano- and meso-composite building materials that are being developed will therefore retain some of the original characteristics of the artefact, but will also tend to break down into smaller components. 	The breaking down of the bricks and the nano- and meso-composite building materials into smaller components, and hence of the materials that make up the building, is part of the ongoing scientific and industrial quest to augment the physical and behavioural characteristics of buildings with highly adaptable means of self-repairing. 	The ongoing technological revolution that is unfolding in the world of architecture is also expected to produce new ways of thinking about the role of culture in the development of infrastructure and the social functions of art, architecture and heritage. These may be used not only in the production of architectural marvels, but also in the design of cultural infrastructure that mimics the actions of the urban environment, including the promotion and reinvention of civic and collective behaviours, behaviours and cultures.

Similarly, the use of aerial spray cans or similar materialised forms of material can have similar nano- and meso-like mechanical properties to bricks and other building materials. The potential is that the action of the chemicals added to the product, or the lack thereof, could be measured and taken into account in the design of the material or building material of the future. 	In the art world, there is a great deal of interest in the use of data, especially when it comes to data-rich media such as maps, but there is less attention being paid to the physical location of the data or the people who produce the maps.

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, but these two key attributes remain paramount. Localising the search for materials with these two key attributes in mind has put local engineers, architects and material chemists at the forefront of such efforts, which in turn is creating conditions favorable to the emergence of ‘high performance materials’, a.k.a. ‘high-throughput producing processes’.  But what is the role of such design in the current economic and political context? The current economic squeeze on local communities is placing further restrictions on local production and consumption. Is it really the case that the production of high-performance building materials in North America and Europe is being neglected? Or does the current productivity of workers and consumers of these materials not scale? If it is the latter, then perhaps it is the other way around: workers and consumers in developing nations are consuming and producing at levels not necessarily associated with the infrastructure required to support those with higher productivity in advanced nations, but which can nevertheless be exported at break-even</text>

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, which are better suited to be incorporated into high-performance vehicles and building materials. In the United States, this includes the development of new fire and climate-resistant building materials, and the research and development of new high-performance bio-composite vehicles and composites for buildings and pavements. The potential for these materials to be used in vehicles is another reason why the automobile industry is so interested in the materials that can be made to operate at higher speeds and sustainably in the future.

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, which are ideal for applications such as window and door components, but are becoming increasingly difficult to engineer with low-cost or zero-emission materials. Advances in robotics and computer modelling are expected to double the number of workers employed in the near future, and will enable new materials and engineering breakthroughs that can dramatically alter the landscape and workflows of life in these regions. It is clear that the production of high-performance building materials and components is the future in the region, and that this might well be the only place in the world where such materials and components will be made. But despite the abundance of materials and components available, the production of high-performance building materials and components is currently dominated by a few nations with their own dominant technological positions. This situation demands a new logic for the production of high-performance building materials and components in the region, one that actively seeks to the create flexible and variable production processes that embrace the multiple materials and components that are required for a thriving and electrifying</text>

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, such as aluminium, steel and concrete. Yet another example of the ‘permanent motion’ implied by new information technology.The current global economic order was forged on the back of the information flow; the information infrastructure is the very basis of the economic order. Yet despite the intensive search for raw materials and minerals, little attention has been paid to the production of these materials in the local or even ‘in the ground’ – specifically the production of such materials in the local soil and water, the atmosphere, along with the lithosphere, which is the sub-basement of the earth that makes up the interface between the material world and the machine.  A growing body of research from around the world has shown that the lithosphere is a promising candidate for the material substrate of a future city; materials with electronic structure and electrical conductivity could be manufactured in the lithosphere at rates comparable to those produced in the earth.

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, which are ideal for applications with high performance – those that can exploit the material properties of graphene at the nanometer scale. However, the relentless pursuit of high-performance materials is also transforming the world of architecture, as materials scientists from China, Russia and other parts of the world flock to the Silicon Valley to take advantage of the region's abundant minerals and explore for themselves the areas that will one day host app factories, data capture and management systems, and perhaps even the app stores themselves. The development of materials with superior thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity to those already used in smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronics is expected to add another 100,000 square meters to the global installed base of infrastructure, according to a 2015 report from the RAND Corporation.

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, while shortening the life of these materials to make them usable in current building materials and energy technologies. The focus on materials with higher electrical conductivity and higher thermal conductivity is premised on the premise that these technologies will one day be able to replace oil as a source of energy. The economics of this insatiable demand for high-performance concrete and steel have come a long way since the early 1980s, when the energy crisis rocked the continent. The shift from paper to metal as the primary energy source for the infrastructure of the global metropolis is being facilitated by the transition to electric vehicles and the increased use of biofuels. The rapid growth of electric vehicles and biofuels-powered vehicles is leading to ever-greater amounts of water consumed and generated, more deforestation and extinction of forested ecosystems, as well as significant portions of the destruction of wild habitats. The rapid increase in vehicle range and acceleration also results in ever-greater consumption of oil, which is being used up</text>

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, but these two key metrics remain vital to the survival of the local and global economies of these regions. The development of better, more versatile and more environmentally beneficial materials in these regions is currently being driven by a Silicon Valley-wide research agenda that is becoming increasingly apparent to be both lazy and diabolical on par with the recent vicious cycle of oil addiction and climate change.The quest for better, more environmentally beneficial materials is not a new one, but the connection between the environmental degradation of urban materials and the development of killer apps is becoming increasingly obvious. The explosion of global smartphone penetration marks a new era in which ecological footprints are recorded not only by the user, but also by the device. Consequently, the need to monitor and control such devices is a source of increasing concern, even as the ability to create new, more environmentally beneficial versions of existing technologies is increasingly questionable.

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, but these two key ingredients are two-thirds of the formula. The remaining third is made up of important trace elements, heavy minerals and water that comprise the basis of a future societal infrastructure. The recent explosion in information technologies and the associated explosion in industrial volumes means that it is now possible to build a large, low-volume production facility on the back of a remote community's fire and food stockpiles, as well as on the forested slopes of Mt. Everest. While these projects may have environmental benefits, their real value lies in their ability to produce high-performance, high-volume products at competitive prices – commodities with strong industrial synergies. The recent explosion in animal protein and the related explosion in plant-animal feed production means that it is now possible to produce high-performance, high-volume products with strong environmental and social impacts – materials with a wide range of economic uses. These three elements of the formula are now interrelated and can be synthesised into yet further complex combinations. The</text>

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, but little attention is being paid to the underlying physics that create the materials we use everyday. Structural equations play a fundamental role in the ability of materials to perform their critical functions – yet little is known about how these materials relate to one another, or with respect to the social, ecological and political conditions that create and foster such interactions. In this article I look at three potential materials futures for the connected connected infrastructures of humanity: high-performance, lightweight yet powerful, and transparent, yet strong yet flexible. The future that has emerged is one in which materials become advanced in all aspects of their behaviour, capability and resilience to all forms of environmental degradation, yet are primarily concerned with the production of value arising from the exchange of information and information-processing devices. The other two futures envisage the future in which civilisational change is driven by information and connectivity, but much more of the social and emotional side of things is taken into consideration.

Much of the momentum behind the recent research and development in these regions has been focused on materials with higher conductivity and electrical conductivity, which are at the core of the precious metals that are being used to make up the seemingly 'high performance' materials of the future world.However, despite efforts to mainstream these materials and pave the way for widespread adoption at a later date, the fundamental principles underpinning these materials have been around for thousands of years. Aristotle, for one, believed that the origin of human language was due to the influence of the earth and the sea. Aristotle was hardly an angel, as we learn in the next chapter. But he did believe that our modern human languages evolved because of the inescapable links between the sea and the land, and that language emerged as a product of this historical process. In Theaetus, Aristotle provides a powerful argument for our own thinking about life and language that is both scientific and poetic. He imagines a world in which we have overcome many of the difficulties of our modern world, and in which living things simply exist because we can. Talk, he believes, is the beginning</text>

Now it’s mostly a showroom and exhibition hall for the various art institutions in the area: it serves as a gateway into the community and a way of telling the story. The collection and display have become such an integral part of the vision of the area that a visitor’s guide has a very specific, powerful way of telling a story. The collectors, in turn, have created such a complex relationship with the community that it’s almost impossible to understand the vast majority of what they do and how they do it, and even if you could, how you might connect with the story of the area. The collectors may have created a complex set of relations with the community, but at the same time they’re also telling stories with extraordinary force and often astonishing clarity, often through direct action. The collectors have created a narrative that is very powerful, and it’s just us as readers and listeners.What the collectors create and the communities they inhabit is a very powerful practice that needs</text>

When we visited, the collection and display were mostly empty; there was a bit of graffiti on the walls, but otherwise it looked like any other gentrifying neighbourhood. By the time we left, the walls had been painted over with bright graffiti, and new people had started coming through the door. The collection and display are the new neighbourhood. The curatorial work is what’s left behind when the neighbourhood is sold.  	When we visited the site, the collection and display were very much a part of the experience. We felt as if we were there with the community, learning from them, and making their lives easier. We also felt as if we had a deeper understanding of their history because we had been given access to their documents.

Now it’s mostly a show for the local residents of Anfield who use the building all the time. The collection and display are what make the site stand out, and the fact that so many of the local residents use them – taking their clothes off in the ladies toilets, going to the gym, watching football games on the balconies – makes the whole neighbourhood seem small and insignificant. But the collection and display are what make the whole community feel important and memorable and connect with the site. They bring people together that have different lives stories, and give them a sense of belonging. That’s why the collection and display is a mark of a community: it captures the essence of the area and makes it visible. A community with a collection and display of artefacts is a community with a sense of place. That’s why the collection and display is a mark of belonging.

The curators who work for the new urban planner are unlikely to have the collections, displays, or collections of the old urban planners, so it’s important that they have the latest contemporary art and contemporary textiles to show off in the new urban planner offices. The collection and display act as a disjointed collection of experiences, from the extraordinary to the mundane, and so the new urban planners have an office in the old city, where the collection and display meet the new urban planning. At the moment when the collection and display meet the office, the collection and display are open to the public, but in an office they are still private, and so the public have to be invited in. When the collection and display meet the office, the collection and display are open to the curator and his or her staff, and so the public can come and explore and wander around the collection and display. In the new urban planning,</text>

The exhibition was a chance for the curators to work through some of their projects and to model the curatorial work they might do for the site. As well as displaying original artworks and textiles, the collection and display ensured that visitors could continue to connect with the area and the stories told by the area because they knew where to look. The collection and display were also a way to create a parallel universe of what the community wanted, and so the Arena needed to be accessible to people who might be interested in living there but didn’t necessarily have a place there. The collection and display were a way to create a sense of place, and the curatorial work to achieve that. When we started, the collection and display were mostly there to show off, show off to other curators, and to show off to each other. Now it’s mostly a showroom and conference room for the visitors, and the collection and display are what draw people in. The Arena needed something more, and so it developed a programme of events including school tours, community fairs, and even a bakery that sold bread and cakes. The collection and display became what we called the Local Homebrewers Organisation, or HLGO; short for Local Housing Market Underground Re-organisation Group. The collection and display became what we called the Architecture of Abandoned Places; from the bakery it became the base for a programme of mini-exhibitions, which would then develop into regular exhibitions. The collection and display used to be a significant part of the Architecture of Abandoned Places’ culture, and so the architecture exhibition was a turning point. It was a powerful way to show the city as a site of habitation and a place to gather and exchange, a place to show that part of the city that was once inhabited but which has now been de-habilitated:</text>

When we started, the collection and display were mostly there to show off, show off to other curators, and to show off to each other. Now it’s mostly a show for the local people because that’s what the art dealers want: people who can tell a story about a piece of art, and might be able to connect with the kind of place they live in. It’s also about connecting with a place in a more personal way, connecting with where you are physically and what you have inside your home. The collection and display act as a vector for the city to tell a story. The collection and display become more personal as you move through it, and the art dealers become more personal as well. This has happened in a big way in the area. When we started, the art was coming from far and wide. Now the art is coming from just us and a few select artists. I think the collection and display acts like a giant interwebspace, and the curatorial work like a giant factory. It’s as if the art dealer is everywhere and the curatorial action is almost impossible to ignore. The collection and display</text>

Now it’s mostly a showroom for the artist(s) who come through the door. The collection and display are what make the Arena what it is, what it represents, and what it hopes to become. It’s a complex, multifaceted collection, and the curatorial shift that came with the rapid population growth and intensive urbanisation in the city has impacted on the collection and display requirements. The collection and display requirements have changed, and as a result, the requirements have shifted. When the collection was initially conceived, the main focus was on a few artists and their works, but now it’s full of local and international artists; there’s a reason why the collection is called the Italian Artspace. The collection is made up of settings from different artists, and the display is made up of works from different worlds. One of the goals of the Italian Artspace is to house and explore the collection, and so the requirements for the curatorial shift that happens when the local population,</text>

When we started, the collection and display were mostly there to show off, show off to other curators, and to show off to each other. Now it’s mostly a showroom for displays – the artworks on show and the city for the day – and it’s mostly a showroom for the selfies of happy tourists. So the curatorial work – the visual arts work – has a social purpose and an ecological purpose as well. It’s a combination of the two. The collection and display are social, whereas the artworks that are displayed are not. The curatorial work is also often an act of exchange between people: exchanging one form of cultural expression for another. We do this at the Sydney Biennial, for example, by introducing a work from the area and the surrounding area. People come through the door, buy a pint or a coffee, chat, eat, meet other curators, and so forth. These exchanges happen because of the very real and very frequent movement of people and goods along the Embarcadero. The museum and the collection move, and sometimes we have to shut down a street for hours because of it. But</text>

When we started, the collection and display were mostly there to show off, show off to other curators, and to show off to each other. Now it’s mostly a showroom and conference room, and the artworks are either on display or disappearing. The collection and display are a paradoxical mixture of people coming and going, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of them all. The public gallery is a much more accessible place to explore the city.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the collection and display were a major part of the curatorial agenda. Today they are rarely mentioned, and even less seen, although they are an essential part of the fabric of the curatorial artefact. They are the missing link in the city, and so when we think of the curatorial agenda, we tend to think of curatorial work done in the past. But the collection and display are much more visibly visible and significant today, and the need to be accessible to them plays an ever-increasing role in the curatorial exercise.  The importance of the collection and display cannot be understated. It provides the framework by which other curatorial choices</text>

When we started, the collection and display were mostly there to show off, show off to other curators, and to show off to each other. Now it’s mostly a showroom for the community to be invited into and explore. It’s interesting that in the community theatres we created, the collections and displays were mostly for the residents and small businesses. Curators and artists alike started to collect materials and furniture from the community. For some, it was personal. For others it was to celebrate their engagement with the arts. We started to do workshops for the residents to introduce the building as a community to one another. The material and community gifts we collected, displayed and gave away gradually became a gift to the theatre in its own right. A small network of volunteers and community artists built up a portfolio of work, some original and some curated by the Arena, which through in-person and online community meetings, media interaction and other collaborative practices, became a full-fledged art form and a way of linking the community with the art.  The collection and display continued to grow, sometimes quite spectacularly. At one point we even had a Twitter account! This</text>
