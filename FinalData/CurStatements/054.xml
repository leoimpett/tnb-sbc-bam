In the Biennale’s book ‘Plentiful Earth: Art from Slavery’, he writes: 	[W]hen Venice hosted the Venice Biennale, the Biennale – which had been established by English artist Joseph Rykwert – invited him to establish a new kind of art institution. Rather than erecting a museum, the Biennale might establish a cooperative art school, or a small arts nursery, or a guild of artists’ artistic staff, and foster a new artistic form through its educational programmes. Such a form might be modeled on the cooperative movement of small artists' cooperative, and the guilding of artisans’ labourers’ guilds, whose members’ labour power enabled the establishment of large scale production and circulation of artworks quickly and easily.[10] Such a radical proposal would see the organisation of labour as a response to the capitalist production of culture, and its exchange on a global scale, in a world where cultural exchange no longer solely took the form of exchange between nations. Capital today exploits labour power in the interest of a swelling middle class, which is itself exploited by a declining</text>

In the Biennale’s book ‘Plentiful Earth: Art from Slavery’, he writes: 	[W]hen Venice hosted the Venice Biennale, the World Trade Center came to life in the memory of the city. This was due to the biennale’s vigorous promotion of its own image as a ‘glorious image’, which was enhanced by the city’s image, which was projected onto a large screen in the Arsenale, as well as by the fact that the Biennale allowed a free passage to the city by sea from the Arsenale to the city. These are the words of the Biennale’s founder, Paolo Portoghesi, in his autobiography, ‘Towards A History Of Art And Architecture’, quoting an unnamed Biennale official: These are the times we live in, and it’s up to us to decide what to make of them. When the biennale was first started, the public wasn’t invited. Then a small group of people, the curators, decided to create</text>

In the Biennale’s book ‘Plentiful Earth: Art from Slavery’, he writes: 	[W]hen Venice hosted the Venice Biennale, I began to think that the biennale was itself a kind of slavery. The biennale itself offered me a kind of laboratory, where I could do my own thinking in a cramped space. The space was nothing but a giant canvas bag – a kind of prison for critical imagination. I began to see the greed and the ugliness of capitalism. And as a consequence, I began to see the other: the slaves, the working classes, in dire need of some rehabilitation.9 	The Biennale’s commercial future is envisaged by the city’s development corporation, the Business Improvement District Corporation (BIDC), which is responsible for the city’s cultural assets.10 	The Biennale’s commercial future is a question that will doubtless be answered by the city’s decision-makers in the years to come.

In the Biennale’s book ‘Plentiful Earth: Art from Slavery’, he writes: 	[W]hen Venice hosted the Venice Biennale, the entire artwork was removed, buried under a large concrete park that evening. The role of the artist was given over to the sculptor Paolo Portoghesi, whose artistic direction was sought after by the city government. ‘The Biennale’s reputation was taken seriously by the authorities, and Portoghesi’s sculptures were frequently quoted in the press.’9 	Then, in 1974, a creative-class arts and heritage museum called Museo Di Tella announced plans to bring the Venice Biennale back to the city in 1980. The Biennale was invited to join the ranks of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Peace and Love in 1981.10 	The Biennale’s participation in the festivities was somewhat delayed by the fact that it was hosting the Sum of All Factions, an ‘exclusive’ social gathering of the wealthy and powerful only a few blocks away from the Giardini.

In the Biennale’s book ‘Plentiful Earth: Art from Slavery’, he writes: 	[W]hen Venice hosted the Venice Biennale, I staged a series of performances that sought to render the present as a metaphor. This was done in numerous ways, including the use of figurative language, the production of urban myths, the production of fictive images, the production of ‘fictional land masses’ and the production of ‘fictional buildings’.9 	In 1983, the Biennale’s artistic director, Paola Marrati, visited Ireland and Germany. In these countries, the Biennale was one of several art institution exhibitions. In a 1989 interview, Marrati recalled the origins of the Dublin Biennale, which she said was an ‘occasion of some people’s thinking, although she does not seem to have identified any of the other artists, despite the obvious shared thinking and effort that went into the events of Venice Biennale. She spoke of the ‘street artist’ element to the Biennale,</text>

In the Biennale’s book ‘Plentiful Earth: Art from Slavery’, he writes: 	[W]hen Venice hosted the Venice Biennale, I actively recruited artists from all over the world, including artists who had careers in art, such as Ruth Baucom, Frida Kahlo, and many others, as well as artists whose work I had acquired at an art fair in the city. These artists were not only employed by the Biennale, but also by the World Trade Center, which was constructing a huge collection of art, including Kahlo’s art, for the main exhibition. (...) To be sure, the biennale’s commercial future will be precarious, with competition from other forms of cultural tourism (including, for example, the emergence of biennials in other cities), but there are signs that the biennale is learning from its Venice experience and adapting its mission statement to take into account the commercial and institutional agendas of the industry it works within. For example, the biennale’s 1973 plan to create a ‘cultural center of the world’ seems</text>

The Mondrian Monument was a nod to the high-turnover, high-volume nature of the American petro-industry at the height of the Cold War. As the biennale approached the end of its stated business, the American artist Philip Larkin, the artist turned antiquarian, began a public warbling of Mondrian’s name in the Italian language alongside a range of artist’s names in the assembled artists, curators and writers.

These included the installation of Haitian sculptor Jean Lévesque in the grand Giardini, the installation of Salvador Dali in the American pavilion, and the installation of Jan Montefiore and Fatma Lenski in Venice’s Spanish pavilion. All five projects were developed with the support of the US Embassy in Venice. Jean Lévesque, Montefiore and Fatma Lenski all trained as art educators in Haiti, and Jean Lévesque developed his ideas and skills through the art form ‘painting’ that he taught himself to do. These were not abstractions, but were developed through the specific context of Haitian art, which at the time was making a mark on Europe through the art of Minervata.

A small band of sailors formed a secret society dedicated to the piracy of foreigners. As a boy, I joined them. Their leader was a tall, lanky Englishman named Peter Soane. They held various conferences in London, Dublin, and America to promote their ‘British Empire’.  Soane was a prolific writer, and his ideas were echoed in every possible language. In a collection of essays called The Gilded Gaze, he imagines an early ‘Gilded Age’ in London where ‘a new feudal aristocracy ruled from its castle at the foot of the Thames’. 10  Soane’s Gilded Gaze, trans.

Gradually, the proposal evolved into a ‘monumentality’, a shared space where the artist and his entourage, the publics, mingled. And here, Venice’s Biennale is no longer the Biennale it was before – even though it maintains its own biennale catalogue – but a monolith of a cultural organisation, operating in the presence of so many visitors, trapped within a rigid, transient structure. Gradually, the Biennale becomes something more, something more in the globalised and integrated cultural sense. Indeed, in the Biennale’s catalogue of historic curators, including Paolo Port</text>

The project served as a platform to address cultural inequalities and injustices in the area, and was seen by some as a response to the economic engine of New Zealand: inequality and exploitation.

He talks about the challenges of communicating in an area as politically unstable as the Middle East, and how art can play a role in resolving conflicts. In this case, the Middle East is defined as Israel/Palestine, and the boundaries between the West Bank and Israel/Palestine continue to be defined by the Israeli authorities as part of Israel’s military strategy to preserve national identity. In an attempt to reconcile these seemingly arbitrary borders, an area known as the Birzeh Valley was designated as the homeland of an independent Palestinian community. The project was to create three parallel worlds in which artists could operate: the city, the hill and the valley.

The third volume, entitled ‘Nina Edge: Art from Periphery to Nation’, was produced in close collaboration with Edge and Radio New Zealand, and distributed by ARTnews. Art was ​broadcast live and continued to be produced in Germany and the US. Edge travelled to several local and European art fairs and met with artists, curators and journalists, and gave interviews. She also curated a number of exhibitions including: Art as Performance, Art’s Troop, Nina Edge: Art from Periphery to Nation, and ART Online: Europe’s First Migrant Fair. She was a co-curator of the newly launched Walla Walla Walla Biennale, and she was a curatorial advisor for the US/Mexico border security bond, where she worked alongside former LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and others. She was also a creative consultant for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, where she provided safe haven design, interactive programming, and social media solutions for the games. She is currently a professor at Dartmouth College of Art and Design, and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Dartmouth University</text>

And ‘infrastructure’ is a verb, not a noun.  So the infrastructure needed to carry out a given project could very well be a set of rules, constructs, ideologies or ‘systems’ underlying assumptions that guide human action.  And there is growing evidence that these systems are as malleable as ever – a development that can be attributed to the inefficiency of post-Fordist and post-Keynesianism.[7]

Griffiths is writing at a time of increasing global infrastructuralisation, where the logic of globalisation is no longer based on the idea that the manufacture of cars, steel, oil and other raw materials is a necessity for the success of the capitalist system, but rather the idea that systems can be designed to function in ways that benefit all stakeholders. And yet, ‘infrastructure’ itself is subject to deindustrialisation in the age of environmental destruction. Over 90% of the world population lives within 100km (62 miles) of a port or major transshipment point for the transport of finished products;[8] ‘1,2, Bakargiev’s phrase is a maxim applicable across the globalised metropolis.

And ‘infrastructure’ is a verb, not a noun.  So the infrastructure needed to carry out a given project could very well be a set of rules, constructs, ideologies or ‘systems’ underlying assumptions that guide human action.  And these ‘infrastructures’ need to be identified and addressed. ‘Infrastructure’ is not a single concept, but is a site of interaction between people, places, and a financial system. Identifying and addressing this interaction is critical in creating effective and inclusive solutions.

Adopting the language of infrastructure-building, the exhibition sought to explain how infrastructure could be used to support and facilitate the social and cultural activities of everyday life, while also providing ways to engage with this potential through ‘design elements’ and ‘technologies’. It was also a space to experiment with the ways in which infrastructures could be made transparent, repurposed and reorganized to meet the needs of the community in which they were built. Through research-based collaborative projects, creative interpretations of existing infrastructure were sought to support the social, cultural and economic activities of everyday life.

So the infrastructure needed to carry out a given project could very well be a set of rules, constructs, ideologies or ‘systems’ underlying assumptions that guide human action.  And the more infrastructure is made accessible, the more humans can engage with and manipulate that infrastructure.  This is a fairly new effect of the ubiquity of computers and electronic gadgets in urban environments: the industrial era was characterised by the mechanisation of industrial processes into easily manipulable pieces that could be programmed to do many different things, often in ways that were not explicitly human-driven.  And as more and more of what we call ‘the infrastructure of cities’ is outsourced to third parties for construction, renewal and modernization, it is increasingly important for questions of public safety and the environment to be anchored in the geographical locations where those decisions are being made.  So while questions of public safety and the environment might be situated in the North or in the South, questions of infrastructures that support human habitation in the metropolis are drawn to questions of energy.  And as questions of public safety and the environment move to the regional and local levels, questions of infrast</text>

And ‘infrastructure’ is a verb, not a noun.  So the infrastructure needed to carry out a given project could very well be a set of rules, constructs, ideologies or ‘systems’ underlying assumptions that guide human action.  And these can range from highly abstract concepts such as ‘infrastructure’ itself, to more concrete things like national borders, ownership and control groups, legal regimes and codes, political and economic systems, economic actors, political and legal regimes and more.  So the infrastructure we build for transport, communication, movement and games isn’t just an object on a page, but involves thought-processes and agency as agents engaged in complex social and political processes.  And this might even include things like nuclear reactors and fossil-fuel dependency.  So the logic of the infrastructure-as-object continues to be shaped by colonial notions of humanity, racism and industrial capitalism, despite overwhelming empirical and philosophical refutations of such claims.  And this is to be celebrated! New Relational Realities (1993) was one of the first works to really engage with this aspect of infrastructure.

And ‘infrastructure’ is a verb, not a noun.  So the infrastructure needed to carry out a given project could very well be a set of rules, constructs, ideologies or ‘systems’ underlying assumptions that guide human action.  And as we have seen, infrastructure is made up of many different sorts of services, some of which can be defined as ‘infrastructure services’.  So a set of rules, constructs, ideologies or underlying assumptions – ‘infrastructures’ – would not only guide human action but would also be a site of action for cultural activity, as distinct from merely fulfilling commercial or institutional interests.  And this is where infrastructure really differs from non-infrastructural sites: not only is infrastructure thought to shape human action, but it is also a site of action for cultural activity.  Thus, ‘infrastructure’ – and there are many different kinds of infrastructure – comprises what Robert H MacDonald calls ‘the main social forces shaping the planet today’.  And this is why social transformations are so important, not just in the current period but throughout history: because without social change, there can be no transformation.  So social change needs to occur on a</text>

And there is a large contingent of people who identify as part of that narrative, people like myself, who situate their work within this larger framework.

I think the other large segment of the audience who are not part of the narrative but who are affected by it – those who have seen the script but don’t know what it means – they also have a point of view. They have different levels of understanding, and I think that this is part of the dynamic, that people have different levels of empathy. I think that the empathy that people have for certain types of infrastructure is derived from personal experiences, and I think that the level of understanding that people have for infrastructures is a function</text>

And this is where technology meets people, or more specifically, where people meet other humans.  And so the techno-medical model – which imagines a smooth, non-invasive interface between human and machine – comes to dominate the practices of infrastructure.  And this is where we find ourselves, struggling to imagine new conceptual models that would accommodate the shifting of power, knowledge and knowledge-producing processes that would render infrastructure obsolete.  And this is where we fail, in that we try to imagine a new conceptual model that accommodates the shifting of power, but can't seem to find the right word to describe the changing world that would render such a conceptual model unnecessary.

Rules are what give rise to certain understandingings and understandings – understandings that are contingent upon precise implementation. And so it is with infrastructure: assumptions, ideologies and underlying assumptions shape what can and cannot be built.  And so it is with Brexit: the politics of infrastructure (not Brexit but with the politics of infrastructure) is one of the most intractable issues facing the UK today. And so it is with the whole project: the political, economic and social dynamics that arise from the assumption that infrastructure can – and will – be made universally accessible, and thus interchangeable, and thus the politics of infrastructure as such.

The challenge then becomes how to reconcile the logic of the infrastructure industry with the ecological and social values of the city, in the wake of runaway industrial infrastructure and coupled to the current economic and environmental collapse of the planet.   And the answer may not be found in inalienable rights to the natural resources of the planet but in understanding how we form and manage our own infrastructure.

Take, for example, the question of social justice and how we form and manage our own infrastructure.

And this is where we need to be looking to see how to move forward, because if we do not move forwards, there is the possibility that we do not see the writing on the wall and that our ambitions and panaceas do not match the reality on the ground.

At some point the shape-recognition aspect of the interaction becomes so critical that the entire interaction becomes rendered virtually invisible. Nonetheless, the car, truck, or plane continues to drive itself on a regular basis, as part of a human-computer interface that records fuel consumption, speed, and so forth. It’s no exaggeration to suggest that this ‘interfaces’ would soon be replaced by self-repairing artificial intelligence systems, which would repair themselves in the event that they were ever damaged in combat (although it is quite conceivable that such systems would develop self-repairing tendencies). 	In a larger perspective, the notion of the ‘interfacing computer’ has become so embedded in the interface that it is difficult to see the other, more fundamental aspects of the interaction.

However, consider an object with a clearly identifiable shape and a designated function – say, a car, truck, or plane – that is gradually becoming aware of its own size and shape-playing. It does so in response to a ‘liveness counter’ that is continuously monitoring its size and shape. If the counter reaches zero, the shape is unrecognizable, and the object is out of reach of its intended target audience. If the counter rises, the target audience is alerted and, in an attempt to cover its tracks, the object malfunctions in various ways, sometimes completely. 	The object is called a ‘metainterface’ and it is the ‘face of the future’. It responds to various stimuli, including sound, light, and movement. When the metainterface is activated, the car, truck, or plane that created it reflects these varying acoustic, visual, and kinetic impacts in order to deliver messages to its drivers. The shape of the object reflects these impacts by translating their energy into kinetic energy; the object then performs another optical trick – manifesting as a distorted version of itself – to deliver those messages.</text>

Later, it becomes aware of the objects that are ‘different from the shape’, namely, ‘rectangles’, ‘hills’ and ‘walks’. The object eventually gets so good at recognising itself in the visual world that it is able to regulate its own size, shape and visibility.  The car, for its part, reacts to this visual cueing convention by defaultly revving up its engine and accelerating at a high rate of speed, in an attempt to consume every last nugget of petrol being expended by the human driverless vehicle. As the accelerating acceleration draws near the urban centre, the car senses ‘geographical origin’ and adjusts its ­traffic pattern accordingly. Traffic jam-proof doors and blind-spot data are</text>

Eventually, it comes to associate these objects with particular behaviours or even ‘concepts’ of the world around it. In other words, it begins to learn. And learning is a kind of interaction. But unlike other kinds of learning, in which the subject of an interaction is somehow instructed or instructed to do a certain thing, the emergence of ‘metainterfaces’ – objects that come to share certain properties with the user of the system – is an emergent property of the system as a whole. This kind of intelligent sharing implies a certain amount of subject-user interaction, but it is also a kind of intelligent delegation.

Eventually, the object achieves a size and shape that are both recognisable and has no alternative but to take part in the evolving negotiation of the terrain. Its original design becomes a series of increasingly sophisticated modifications that are tailored to the terrain – a kind of self-repairing finite resource – as a whole.  The evolutionary trajectory of the car does not end with the introduction of the computer; it begins with the introduction of transmission and tyre pressure gauges, and ends with the advent of ignition switches, computer chips, ESCs, and tire pressure monitors. The evolution of the tire pressure monitor is a notable example of an object responding to changes in its environment.

By some reports, the object does this unconsciously, as a humanly possible, and in other reports it is explicitly programmed to do so.  One could ask how an object can be made to do such things, and what kinds of unintended consequences this may have. One could also ask what kinds of reinforcement mechanisms might be built into the object to enable such actions? One could also ask what kind of relationships the object may have with other nodes in a data-rich node, such as human beings? Answering these kinds of questions may require the object’s creators to have a certain amount of self-awareness. In general terms, one could say that the kinds of interactions that linguists can study are those that happen between human beings and objects.

In the event that the encounter is not conceptualized as a negotiation between the artist and the computer, but instead represents a collision course between two or more data-collecting apparatuses, the naysayers among us will no doubt project our supposed insufficiencies on to the system. However, consider an object with a clearly identifiable shape and a designated function – say, a car, truck, or plane – that is gradually becoming aware of its own size and shape-casting tendencies. As the size and shape of the object becomes increasingly identifiable, the  	recognition becomes increasingly important, since it allows the object to interpret the human response to it as a cue. Eventually, the object reaches a point where it can effectively negotiate the human response to its apparent configuration.’ 3  For more on object recognition and mediation, see  	Steinberg, Op. Cit., p. 15.   1   ‘The aggregate ‘number of human languages’ is a better measure of cultural exchange than the ‘specific capacities of individuals to identify, with high accuracy, with knowledge, or with prejudice linguistic forms that exist outside of or in conflict with human languages’.  2  See  	Goldbard, Language and the Brain, Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1976, p. xxxviii.  3   ‘The human brain contains approximately 6,000 synapses – connected terminals</text>

The primary reason for the boom is presumably the introduction of entre- and intre-exchange within the global taxi and limousine industry. The advent of ‘hail research’ on the one hand, and ‘thru-hail research’ on the other, is thought to have two effects: firstly, by generating demand for taxis and limousines, it is thought to reduce congestion; and, secondly, by offering a form of escapism similar to that of narcotics, but without the negative concomitant of congest</text>

In this article, I cast light on some of the more subtle linguistic practices that take place behind the scenes of the language, in an effort to bring some of the mystery back into the language. I begin by looking at some of the more obvious signs of lexical or conceptual ambiguity in spoken language, and then move to more subtle linguistic phenomena that often go undetected, including non-linguistic linguistic tricks of the ‘logical’ kind. I then cast light on some of the more esoteric linguistic phenomena that are understood only in relation to linguists, in an effort to bring some of the mystery back into the language. I conclude by looking at a few of the</text>

In an ideal world, the city would have citizens who are as diverse as its citizens – thinkers, artists, politicians, etc. – but unfortunately, this is not always possible due to the nature of bureaucracy and institutional racism that still runs rampant in many cities today. It is true that in some cities, such as New York and Los Angeles, this type of institutional racism is extremely rare, but in other cities it is widespread and endemic.

The exhibition schedule has definitely shifted, the city is no longer a static site (although it is still the same city regardless), and different curators have different experiences organising large-scale public events in the city (although this is changing, mostly due to competition for funding).

These were the choices that were being made by and for the very rich and those in positions of power. But the city was also beginning to be defined by the choices made by and for corporations and the very rich. And as a city, it was failing. The Biennial was there to remind us that we were not so helpless after all. It was there to remind us that we have our own creative and dynamic ways of working. The choice to inhabit the city, to inhabit its contradictions, to inhabit its multiplicity of habitations, to inhabit its history, its architecture, and to inhabit its beauty was part of a capitalist process of institutionalisation. It was, in other words, an act of resistance. But what is now considered urban life in America is being defined</text>

The influence of AI and massive data capture is felt in every aspect of Canadian society, and the growing number of researchers who are exploring how the technology impacts cultural practices. However, the significance of these emerging technologies cannot be overemphasised. The increasing access to data and analysis tools gives rise to new ways of organising knowledge, practices, and environments. New cultural forms are formed when the old ways of relating are challenged. For example, when visiting a new urban setting, the researcher becomes entangled in the infrastructure of the place – the built environment</text>

The autonomous vehicles operated by the research team were equipped with computer modelling software that allowed the creation of synthetic landscapes that mimicked the characteristics of the meteorite, but were also able to recognise and classify different types of rocks and soil, as well as different sizes and shapes of structures. 	At the time, the autonomous vehicles also had the ability to analyse the types of infrastructure supporting cultural practices and generate suitable infrastructure for future research and development. This research could address topics such as the use of existing transportation networks, the effects of deforestation and soil depletion, and the interaction between urban and rural infrastructure. The research could also pave the way for the development of self-sustaining ways of being connected to the land and resources around us.

In Computer Vision, the researchers used a variety of image processing pipelines to create digital representations of objects based on accelerant project data. These images projected onto a monitor, and allowed the participants to steer the car towards where the object was located.  The participants in the project were programmed with specific roles – researchers, artists, designers – and their contributions were assembled into a 'culture piece'.  The pieces were individually crafted using local ingredients and local materials and stitched together using glue and wool, creating a modular structure that allowed the participants to tailor the design to the requirements of the situation. The design was based on a modified version of a Triangle project that Rami El Samahy and her team from the Carnegie Mellon University Applied Cybernetics Lab had developed in 2010.

We also needed to find a way to support the artists’ activities outside the home, because if we didn’t, the city would stop funding them and we’d be left with a collection of abandoned buildings. So we started a support group for artists, designers and designers’ staff who’d set up projects, organise events and make work in their spare time. We formed an artist-run society with the title We Are The Architects (ewa) and invited the local artists to be part of it. We had commissioned three local practitioners to work with us on a year-long basis, and invited them to collaborate with us on other projects. The first one was an architect and he was very interested in the volume that was being generated by the public conversation. The volume of the public conversation was amazing.

It’s hard to put into words how much of that was through the media – tweets, Facebook groups and so forth. So we had commissioned three projects that were so instantaneous, so accessible and so enabled people to connect with one another. There was a sense of community involved here that transcended the traditional art world boundaries – artists, curators, art writers, critics, students, residents, tourists … people with whom to engage on a very deep level. This was a rare and very exciting place to work. The challenges that we faced as an organisation were immense: breaking into the art world was incredibly difficult, especially for people who had never met each other before and didn’t know what an art organisation was. In the early days, breaking into the art world was incredibly simple: an artist would do a project in their hometown and within days people would know about it and tweet about it. That is, until someone introduced us to the concept of an art organisation and how the art world had historically viewed us, and the challenges we presented as an artist-organisation. I</text>

It’s hard to put into words how much of that was through the media – tweets, Facebook groups, blogs… One of the first projects that was put together was a social enterprise that connected local young people with art institutions around the country. So we invited the artists to take over an institution that was experiencing a cultural reorientation and to use that as a platform to make work with young people that would resonate with their sensibilities.When we started to think about what the architecture of the city should be like, we found that a holistic understanding of the city was very difficult to achieve. The city was being built on top of a very specific set of priorities – building a high-end lifestyle for urban dwellers, for example – that were in direct conflict with what the architect had planned for the city. So the challenge shifted from finding ways to work with the city to coming up with ways to create a unique architecture that would meet the needs of the city but also those of the artist.A couple of years into the project, a local artist friend suggested that we try and find a</text>

Building an Infrastructure: The Next Global RevolutionIn the last twenty years the pace of innovation and creativity in many areas has accelerated. In the design field, for example, the advent of computerised planning and physical models that allow us to simulate the effects of environmental degradation has resulted in a radical shift from lab to city and from human to algorithmic time. As a result, many fields of study, including architecture, have had to undergo radical reinterpretation. What used to be a subject of elite study is now taken for granted; for example, an appreciation of how to channel the energy of a city into sustainable ways of building and managing infrastructure is commonplace. However, while new technology allows us to do amazing things, it also creates opportunities that are often quite dangerous and which often present as a challenge, and which often seem outside the realm of possibility for the technologically literate and well-informed public</text>

We also needed to find a way to support the artists’ activities outside the home, because if we didn’t, the city would stop funding them and we’d be left with a collection of abandoned buildings. So we started a support group for artists, designers and designers’ staff who’d set up projects, organise events and make work in their spare time. We formed an artist-run society with the title We Are The Architects (ewa) and invited the local artists to be part of it. We had commissioned three local practitioners to work with us on a year-long basis, and invited them to collaborate with us on other projects. The first one was an architect and he was very interested in the volume that was being generated by the public conversation. The volume of the public conversation was amazing. It’s hard to put into words how much of that was through the media – tweets, Facebook groups, pamphlets, knock on wood, street performance, tours, balloons, t-shirts, posters, DVDs, magazines… The list goes on. It’s hard to put into words how much of it was through the net. So the net was a huge part of it. The balloon was a small part. But the net was a huge part of it. We started distributing literature and events through the net, and the balloon was a virtual bible. We called it the ‘Urban Guardians’ and the ‘Urban Tree’ – urban trees it was said. We invited the world famous architects and PR agencies to New York to be part of the strategy. They were all keen. And then there was the balloon. And the tree. The tree was the big pop. Then there was the networking. And the big pop. And the tree. And then the other part of the equation – the other part of the industry – the other part of the fabric</text>

It’s hard to put into words how much of that was through the media – tweets, Facebook and blogs, and the way in which they were being assembled on a massive scale. It was through these mediums that we were able to put our ideas into practice. The second one was an architect and she was doing similar things, but was also doing it from a professional perspective. She was thinking about the city and the infrastructure that it was possible to put together with a very strong institutional orientation. She was thinking about the fact that this was a public undertaking, and that there would be people coming from all over the world to work on it, and that was very exciting to her. The third one was an architect who was doing it as a hobby, and was doing it from the cityscape. His approach was very different from mine, but I do remember him telling us that there were other ways of looking at it, and that there were other ways of organising the world than locally. It was his way of approaching the problem from a different perspective. I think that his approach could</text>

It’s hard to put into words how much of that was through the media – tweets, Facebook posts, street performances, balloon drop …  The public was so engaged, so connected to the city. I was also very taken with the idea of the biennale as a movement, because I thought that when I started one, I would be calling a movement and the biennale would be a place where the call could be made. The fact that we did it through social media gave the impression that we were not just travelling in a liminal space, that we were actually present in the city and had real power. I felt we had started to build a relationship outside of the museum context, where we actually met, chatted and had direct access to people. The biennale had that elusive third party, which was often talked about but rarely experienced: the local architects and artists who were part of the curatorial mix. The biennale needed that elusive third party to create that magical spiral of engagement that the museum and the curatorial mix lacked, and the bienn</text>

It’s hard to put into words how much of that was through the media – tweets, Facebook groups and so on. So the city was a place where people were coming to have their say, and so the city was a place to be heard. The second one was an architect who also started coming to the events. He came to the symposiums and the afterparties, and he organised the artists’ trips to the zoo and the theatre. He organised the artists’ trips to Tahrir and the Biennale. And finally, there was my own involvement. I put together a travel proposal that the artists and their families had to go through, and so on. But the real turning point for me was when the artist community started coming together as a community to start setting up a project. In the 1990s and early noughties the biennale was a community effort. Now it was an organisation that encompassed a large number of people from different fields of expertise and so the biennale was able to exert a lot of pressure on the organisers to</text>

The first one was an architect and he was very interested in the volume that was being generated by the public conversation. The volume of the public conversation was amazing. It’s hard to put into words how much of that was through the media – tweets, Facebook likes, emails etc – and how much was generated by the art. So the volume of the art that was being shown was a great way to collate that amazing work. The media also plays a part in this, naturally. As the internet and social media became more and more pervasive, the barrier to entry was lowered and the gatekeepers to entry was pushed aside. So the art that was being shown was showing more and the barriers to entry were weaker. A collective focus on the art that was being shown opened up that media to a whole new range of experiences. Within a short space of time, of course. After the first installation, the volume of the installations that followed naturally increased. So the second one was a nice parallel to the first one. The volume of the media that was being generated through the programme was being dissipated by the moment, and the art was being made elsewhere in the city at a quicker rate. This made it easier for the citizens of Liverpool to access</text>

It’s hard to put into words how much of that was through the media – tweets, Facebook groups, street parties, cafes, seminars – but the important thing was that it was being shared and heard. The volume of the media could be intimidating at first, but over time you start to understand what the press and public reaction to any given development would be. That first public consultation process was interesting because it gave the city a chance to build a case and persuade the city council that it was the right thing to do. It gave the city a chance to put forward a masterplan that would allow the city to be self-sufficient and allow the city to experiment with its potential. For example, the masterplan could have included a ‘greening’ initiative that would promote the city’s green space and wildlife, or ‘a city tree initiative’ that would establish a public orchard system. The public orchard system could have included ‘a farmers market for produce from city farms’ or ‘a farmers’ market for produce from city farms</text>

This is happening in very significant proportions in London, for example, and it is a very encouraging development for us when people spontaneously come together and come up with innovative ways to engage the city. The second one was an architect who had been working with us on a smaller scale on a more regular basis. She came up with an idea to put community gardens on every street corner of the city, with a mission statement that we translated into English as ‘Green Streets’ and incorporated neatly into the strategy document we had prepared for the project. She came up with an idea to create community gardens from scratch, as we did, but she was the one who suggested the transformation of a traditional urban space into a landscape that is both physically and emotionally appealing. She was also the one who suggested the need for a sit-com, and she was the one who suggested the use of public</text>

The formation of the Biennale commissioning agency FACT, led by Jon Super, meant that curatorial work on the itinerary was put on hold. That could not have been good news for the artists whose work seemed to be at the core of the problem. They saw the opportunity to have their work shown at a later date, but it meant less to curate the biennale in the traditional sense.

It was not meant to be read by visitors. It was not meant to be a response to the biennial. It was not meant to be an alternative to the biennial. It is a composite work of many different elements and messages. It is not a proposal of what should be or what can be. It is a statement of what London might be like if that city were to be re-constituted.[1] It may also be that the Museum of Modern Art would still undertake the reconstitution of its curatorial structure, but given the ubiquity of digital media and the constant shifting of its audiences, it seems more relevant that this was done concurrently in both Venice and in the Welsh Streets, a feat that even the Biennale at Tate seems to shy away from.

In this edition of the journal, Ruth E. Herman, curator of the MMM:DDA, and her collaborator Christiane Paul discuss the events that led to the museum opening, and the curatorial turn around many of their projects. For others, the museum visit and other curatorial activities in the years since those early years are marked by moments of vulnerability, grief and ecstasy. In these writings, Paul and Herman explore the art and the institutionalised violence of modern art, as it is continually reinterpreted and restructured by the curatorial hand.

In the introduction to his new book Other Space, Smith writes: ‘The question that came to mind most while I was writing the manuscript was, how could I possibly explain to a group of strangers the kind of magic that I had just experienced?’ He continues: ‘They all seemed so shocked, so speechless, so lost in space. I couldn’t explain it in words. It was as if they didn’t understand that I’ve been through something like this before.’Throughout the book, Smith uses the term ‘transcendental’ to describe the kind of magic he experiences: the kind that allows him to ‘reanimate’ objects, to turn invisible things into things and to create worlds entirely out of nothing. In one chapter, he describes how a traditional Buddhist meditation on emptiness led him to transcendence through the magic of symbols.In the introduction to his next book</text>

The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole, and especially on the city. During the 1980s, the art world really started to pay attention to the fact that the arts were really instruments of social struggle, and that they made a difference. But as the crisis of urban culture and urban decline has proven, the social is really all that matters anymore. The social is what defines social difference, and the arts really do play a part in that social difference. So while the art world may now wish to participate in the social, it really doesn’t play that role any more than any other social institution does. It is still very much a workplace, albeit one where politics, economic and social factors come into play.Art (and especially performance art) has a long and storied history in the city. From the early performance and art spaces, to the industrial revolution performance spaces, to the contemporary art fair itself, the direct and indirect social outcomes are often quite the same. But the social is shifting, and the direct and indirect</text>

The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole. The decline of the art fair, and the gallery in particular, is a big part of the story. We are witnessing the effects of a political-ideological turn, a break with the past, but also a breaking down of the social taboos that were holding back this process. We are witnessing the emergence of a market for art, that is, a world in which artists can be paid for their labour. Curators, and those who work for them, are being asked to become part of this marketer’s firm. And there is the rub. As the curators, we are also becoming subject to the vagaries of the financial market. The post-war curatorial craze that began in earnest after World War II, and continued through the early nineties, was premised on the firm belief that a gallery should be a place where ideas were exchanged. But the avant garde, surrealist chic, and its attendant strains of critical writing are being replaced</text>

The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole. It is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a career in art curating, let alone imagine one yourself. It is very telling that the very first curatorial job that came out of the newly constituted Art World was in Liverpool, with its mix of immigrants, locals and artists. And yet, almost twenty years later, the same Liverpool Biennial is still struggling to find a niche in the city. Many artists, myself included, are finding it increasingly difficult to find work in the city because of the glut of art being produced outside of it. For some, this is clearly seen as a positive thing; for others, it is seen as a problem. It is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine yourself in the city because of the glut of art being produced outside of it. And yet, somehow, we are all being urged to embrace this glut by the city’s arts community.I find this somewhat paradoxical.

The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole. It is becoming increasingly difficult to see how a gallery can contribute to a post-Second World War infrastructure when the post-war period is such a heavily discounted space, and the art world is arguably the last place in the world that promoted or consciously looked to the arts for this purpose.Art World CirculationFallacy #10    	The concept of the ‘Art World’ as a geo-political concept is deeply flawed. From a global perspective, the rise and fall of the art world is primarily the result of a few individuals shaping events there – a small elite who control the resources, networks and ideologies that foster and lead to such growth. From a local viewpoint, the local art world has played a relatively passive role in this process of global capitalism. As capitalism progressed, it became ever more important for artists and curators to develop networks of contacts in order to leverage this newfound wealth of control. The network effect has allowed the art world to be catered to by</text>

The curatorial role has become something that is done by experts – architects, engineers, financial planners, lawyers – and those experts only. The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole, and it is starting to affect the art world as a whole. The curatorial niche has become something that is perfectly positioned to absorb any and all new ideas and technologies, and to play along with them in whatever way feels most convenient at the time. But this presents a major problem for the art world in the years to come, because the technologies that are being thrown into the mix will determine what is and is not considered art. And the curatorial role will be something that is primarily used in this sense – to absorb, map it and use it wherever it is deemed useful. In other words, the curatorial mission will be something that is transient and temporary, and will shift and morph in response to the needs of the political and economic mission.To put things in slightly more contemporary terms, I would argue that the curatorial mission in its contemporary form is a product of two contradictory phenomena: (1) the economic mission of the gallery as a whole, which is in dire need of</text>

The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole. Art galleries are no longer the be-all and end-all of arts resources, but they still have a very real impact on the arts-per-resource ratio. Art galleries are no longer the destination of their resources, but they still play a significant role in the creation and circulation of arts-per-resource. Curators, like artists, are artists first and artists only. This means that while the gallery may patronise an artist, it is important for the gallery to have an ongoing conversation with its own stakeholders in providing the art-world experience – stakeholders including, but not limited to, the local artists, the community, the boroughs, the local arts organisations, the retail sector, cultural institutions and the wider publics (not to mention the many stakeholders inside the gallery itself).  	There is a tension, which I feel very strongly about, between the importance of a gallery as a site for art to happen, and the need for a gallery to have a significant</text>

The history of art and curatorial adaptions is a sad one, but one that we have to learn to live with.  When Debord coined the term ‘collectivism’ in the 1930s, he was absolutely clear about what he meant: for him, ‘communism’ meant capitalism plus state plus memory. The collectivity – the collectivity as a mode of social organisation – is dead. The new form of organisation that emerged in the wake of the crisis of the collectivity – the market economy – is the dominant form of organisation in most parts of the world. And as Debord pointed out, the collectivity that emerged during the depression was ‘a rotten, antinomies, antinomies of ideas, bodies, habits, inclinations and inclinations … incapable of supporting life’.3  And this new form of organisation – a form of organisation that puts huge amounts of political and social power in the hands of a tiny</text>

The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find a gallery showing contemporary work, and even harder to find a gallery showing work from the past two centuries. It is impossible to view the twentieth century as an overview, since we live so long after the events that precipitated them. It is even more impossible to understand contemporary art’s inability to respond to these changes.There are many other signs of the times – the proliferation of mobile phone apps, social media that demands a connection – but these are signs that become more apparent the further back one looks. The ubiquity of Instagrammers, and their constant updating of photos, has led to a peculiar phenomenon: twenty-first century art galleries are artifacts of the social media era, not social media obsessives. And the reason why social media obsessives tend to be politically active is that they only get more social media connected, not necessarily more connected in the future.

The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole. It is not just the galleries that are being forced to uproot themselves into the social and economic quagmire that they found themselves in during the economic stone-age; the political and urban quagmire that they found themselves in when the social stone-age began to wane. The advent of social media and the dispersed gathering of artefacts has certainly exacerbated this tendency. Gallery collections, large and small, are being forced to reconceive their forms and function in a world that is no longer based on their former reliance on a particular area or region. This concomitant shift has profoundly affected the way that the art collection is organised; the art fairs that they host and the curatorial appointments that they choose to make are being challenged and reshaped as a result of social media. It is no wonder, then, that the curatorial shift has been as much as ten years behind schedule and causes such frustration for artists and curators who feel that their work is not being taken into</text>

The art world, and the gallery in particular, has largely failed to adapt to this new economic and social reality. This neglect is really having a devastating effect on the art world as a whole. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find a show in the art world that doesn’t feature heavily in the economic analysis, financial-social-media or cultural-impact analysis. This kind of analysis, along with the political-ideological one, is where the art world’s resources are now. It is this kind of analysis that the curatorial can play a part in. But when the post-Second World War period enters into view, the art world has a much more difficult time of it. It is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish good curatorial work from great curatorial work. This kind of thinking, along with the politics of what is considered art value, presents itself in many forms in contemporary art, but the curatorial seems especially inept at framing the art world’s current predicament. Here, the curatorial is often accused of being apolitical, but there is considerable evidence to suggest otherwise. For example, whilst contemporary art is often described as being driven by</text>

The past decade has seen the curatorial hand again: this time it is engaged in attempting to rein in the rising tide of experimental and curatorial projects, and it is performing an increasingly important role in curating the coming radical transformation of the art world.I did not come to Venice with an agenda in mind. My mission was not to find new ways of looking at the past, nor to undo the damage done by the curatorial hand in the twentieth century. My main interest was to create a unique kind of virtual or ‘permanent’ connection with the past that would be able to endure in perpetuity via my art, and to do this through what is commonly referred to as ‘virtual memory’. For this project I used the term ‘pastiche’ to describe an art that is forced into the present through the use of symbolic or pictorial means. I chose to create a virtual pastiche that transcended time and space, and to do</text>

This seems to be the case with the development of the avant-garde in the 1970s and 1980s, but it is also the case for many contemporary artists and curators. In the 1980s and 1990s, the curatorial intervention was much more prominent, and the avant-garde had a much more prominent social function. It was an arena in which ideas were freely exchanged, and in the new millennium, it is still an arena in which ideas are freely exchanged. But since the 1990s, the curatorial hand has largely been replaced by the museum, and the museum has largely supplanted the gallery in shaping contemporary art’s social function.

My dissertation, Surrendered Ground: Pest Control in Contemporary Art, examined the large-scale destruction caused by feral animals in Canada and the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. I focused on the link between large-scale conservation efforts and large-scale urban regeneration projects, since the Montreal Biennale was itself largely conceived as a response to the problem of abandoned and vacant buildings following the massive redevelopment of downtown Montreal following the city’s bankruptcy. I argued that the massive fencing and gates erected to prevent large animals from ruining historical sites in the city were actually used as a form of large-scale power projection system to project a neoliberal capitalist form of governance throughout the downtown</text>

But what has become increasingly clear is that the curatorial hand that holds the project in its grasp is as important as ever, and the curatorial hand that organises the art is no longer the dominant reading of art today. The curatorial hand may be tempted to intervene in a project that it does not understand, but that is precisely the wrong move. The art world would do well to learn this lesson.The curatorial hand that holds the project in its grasp is as important as ever, and the curatorial hand that organises the arts is no longer the dominant reading of art today. The curatorial hand that takes the project on its own terms is vital in maintaining the project’s integrity, but the project is doomed to failure unless it is nurtured in the patronage of the art world as a whole.

The history of avant-garde painting and the history of avant-garde criticism is a long one, full of skirmishes, drawn up by artists and critics, and it includes bitter compromises along the way. There are in my opinion three main camps: those who came to appreciate the art of Mies’s graffiti and the Goya beacon in particular; those who condemned avant-garde painting as decadent and apolitical; and those who saw in avant-garde a reinvention of contemporary art. I will focus on the last group, focusing particularly on the work of Goya, for two reasons. The first reason is that Goya is the only artist to have ever been awarded the Legion d'Honneur. The second reason is that Goya is the only artist to have ever been alive to see the light of day. In the twenty-first century, we can</text>

In recent decades it has been a point of contention between the curators who put their stamp on an art project and the artists who create that project and then take their work away. The curatorial hand plays a crucial role in the process of art making, and in this sense contemporary art does not always live up to the expectations of the curatorial hand. This is why contemporary art has to be carefully curated, because if it is allowed to grow too large and powerful, it will distort the potentialities of the project it is entrusted to oversee. In the curatorial hand, excess is a constraint, but in the real world it can be a source of strength. That is, of course, if the project is smart and ambitious and plays by the rules that the curatorial hand creates, but at the same time it is constrained by the real world. Art’s own negative space – the real world – plays an essential role in its project of becoming real. Therefore, if the curatorial hand creates an art project that is too large and powerful in its reading of cultural texts, it must be smart and ambitious and read cultural texts in ways that are consistent</text>

In recent decades it has been a point of contention between the curators who put their stamp on an art project and the artists who create that project and then take their cues from that to create their own interpretation of the art. It is this constant question of interpretation – who has the right to tell artists what they can and cannot do – that the modern curatorial hand has tried to tamp down on via an incoherent bureaucratic structure. I propose that there is a better way.I do not claim to have all the answers. In fact, I do not even claim that the curatorial hand that I envision would be a good one. But I do believe that there are ways of approaching the curatorial that are grounded in values and principles that are in sync with the times we live in. These values and principles – what J.D. Dewsbury would call ‘the Common Good’ – should be shared between us, and hopefully they can become the ground of a future agreement that is both principled and practical.Let me illustrate the common good with an example from my own perspective and those of other contemporary artists. Take, for example, the artist Esther</text>

In recent decades it has been a point of contention between the curators who put their stamp on an art project and the artists who create that project and then take their projects to museums, prestigious commissions or their hometown art galleries. The trend is clear: the museum is the site of the curatorial hand, while the street level is the site of the revolutionary artist. The new curatorial hand is the revolutionary curatorial hand of the twentieth century.The second trend is the curatorial hand that works at a microscopic level, working through the elements and the micro-level of the environment. This is the micro-curatorial hand, and it is developing at an incredible pace. Micro-curating has become a multidisciplinary science, and as a result, there is a need to be multilingual and experiential. The New Curatorial hand is the exponent of this new curatorial science. It is expert in the art of packaging and science fiction, but it also has a natural talent for the manufacture of hype and the perfecting of mythmaking.

The ideological struggle that the curatorial hand plays today is one in which there is an increasing diversity of reading, from the artist being asked to engage a broad public, to the artist being asked to engage only a narrow elite. In the latter case the artist is expected to sit still and think things through, while the gallery members take part in a communal exercise in watching and participating in art’s social activities. This ideological heterogeneity is a condition of the unprecedented growth of the art world in the twenty-first century, and the curatorial hand plays no small part in creating it.I remember vividly the first time I went to the 22nd Biennale of Sydney, the Biennale as an institution. I was twelve. I remember very vividly the excitement and pride and elation</text>
    <text>should have been curated by and with the artist in mind, but there was a real attempt to capture the essence of the artist’s spirit. It is quite possible that the decision to commission a piece by an artist was as simple as that, since the avant garde in its minimalist intelligence was not at odds with the demands of the gallery. The avant garde was the dominant reading of the curatorial hand. It was the dominant reading that year in Prague, and it will be the dominant reading of the curatorial hand in both Vienna and New York.Art and the social context of art’s social function have always been a point of contention. From the beginning of the twentieth century, this has been a point of contention between artists and the art world, and it continues to be a point of contention in contemporary art today. In recent decades it has been a point of contention between the curators who put their stamp on an art project and the artists who create that project and then take their projects elsewhere. The curatorial gesture is a currant, a gesture of presence that conveys an idea of presence without actually doing anything in relation to that presence. The currant is a double-edged sword: it is visible, yet it is also invisible. And sometimes, in a currant-like invisibility, the artist is actually applauded for putting in the time and energy to make a work that is not immediately recognisable.This double feeling of invisibility and presence is a frequent complaint of the currant, and it is often misconstrued as an admiration or some kind of admiration. In a wider context, the implication is that the person putting in the time and effort to make a work is somehow more artistic, or more intellectually interesting, or more authentic, or more representative of the world. But this is not at all how the world works, nor is it at all how the currant is situated within the art world. First of all, the currant is a middle</text>

But it is possible to learn enough to tackle some challenges, and to be exposed to enough of others to enable us to recognise patterns and similarities. Take, for example, the development of artificial intelligence (AI): although it is theoretically possible to build a computer that perfectly replicates the processes of the natural neural network, the sheer amount of work that has to be done in order to fabricate a neural network is unwieldy. The more challenging the problem, the less secure the network will be, and the less likely users will be to deploy it. In the 1990s, network science was seen as a science-fictiony far-future stuff, and artists who dreamt big and went to space were castigated as if they owned sub-human sub-limes.

Biennial funding at this time ran into real-estate speculation, which in turn was feeding into the inflated inflated valuation of the art market. As a result, the biennial lost its sense of place, and its real identity lay in the distant market. And this is where performance arts and performance-making in general have had to be creative with their funding. Biennial funding in the 1990s was a form of performance art, and performances were part of that. But the inflated market that characterises the biennial today would kill it down to the biennial itself.

There is only the mediated representation of things as they are, and the historical and contemporary condition as representations of things as they are. And the things that come out of the  	art world, and are published in the art world, are not always representative of what is really going on. For example, the art world at large tends to exaggerate the cultural significance of certain types of performance, and performance, and often depicts things through the language of aesthetics. And I think that the performance artist was aware of this fact: she would often write poetry in response to certain performances she found distasteful, or even offensive. Performance, she wrote, is a ‘space’ where ‘real life’ can be lived through in ways ‘different from what is portrayed in art’. And she was right: there are different kinds of performance, and performance today is often depicted as a bad kind of performance</text>

This is a Psych.Drama. This is the language of the demon. It is power politics at its most insidious.In the early to mid-1990s, the art world was awash with allegations of sexual harassment and assault by artists and performers. Many in the field were accused of complicity by omission or commission. Many others, including the curators, chose to maintain their positions or even expand them. The volume and range of these allegations, both genuine and fabricated, dwarfed those of previous decades. The sheer volume and variety of the artistic responses, both artistic practice and curatorial, lent a weight of credibility to the claims.Yet the rate of change, both genuine and fabricated, was alarming.

The market is inherently unequal, and given enough power, capable of inflicting enough damage to overcome even the greatest collective creativity. But it is possible to grow artistic talent through a combination of state and market forces, and to understand the trace elements of the market that create the conditions that enable creativity to be fostered. I suspect that the reason why  	performance in the arts today is so scarce, and so precarious, is precisely because the market is so omnipresent. It is easy to identify the art market in most cities: it is the dominant form of art form, and the market is seen as a marketplace within the art form. But what is really lacking in the market today is anything like the symbiotic relationship between performance and retailer that the early twentieth century promoted, or even to a degree that promotes, today. Much more is required: new performance materials, dedicated art channels, marketing campaigns, cultural campaigns around individual artists�</text>

But the fact that the market can be corrupted by the very forces that create its value (in this case, the need to bomb secular power plants) seems quite another thing. The market is powerful precisely because it must be controlled – measured, limited. It is not so powerful because of magic or some other force, but because of the limit imposed by the market itself. The more the market restricts freedom, the less freedom can be freely distributed. This is why actors of all kinds are attracted to working for the market: they can control the terms on which the market will allocate scarce resources – resources that would otherwise be wasted or useless – in ways that are consistent with their interests. They can also control the allocation of those scarce resources through other means, including through the use of political and economic leverage.

The market cannot make art; it must be made by others. But it can certainly shape what artists produce, and the market can shape what is assumed to be artistic talent. And here I see the emergence of what Janet Malcolm might call the ‘metainterface’: the art of being bought, the art of being ​­­­­­­­­ learned, the art of being made to look good. This is, I suppose, the modern form of the market economy: it is the modern form of the artistically naïve or socially stunted or apolitical individual.  In recent years, I have seen several biennials and one of them being Liverpool Biennial 2016.

But I digress.The Anglophone world of the  1990s was fixated on the notion of the crisis, and globalisation (including neoliberalism) was seen as necessary to ensure that all Anglophones would have access to markets and goods. The Anglophone story was retold countless times in books and magazines, and the Anglophone bond was often used to justify imperialist behaviour. But as the Anglophone story was retold, the bond was often seen to be a convenient cover for other, subtler forms of colonialism and racialised oppression.Anglophones were often depicted as victims, victims of economic dislocation and political tumult in other parts of the world. But this is categorically not true. The Anglophone version of the ‘Crisis’ is a very different story. The</text>

The Art Sessions was a kind of a bible for the contemporary artist: it was filled with accounts of the artists’ past work, as well as a chapter called ‘The Artist’s Bible: Ten Commandments for Artists’ Past Work’.

In the late nineteenth century, Lobsang Laut established the first Tibetan school of music, and Wang Sanjuyu followed in Wang Choling’s footsteps. Today, the two schools are distinct, and although Sufi practices exist in all of Asia, the two schools that have recently come into being – India and China – are very different.

We don’t know what the author actually wrote, but we can speculate about the author’s motivations and feelings. For instance, the author may have been angling for a Hollywood ending, while the city is in a post-production hell. The irony is that the author may have been right all along.

I was able to create a kind of collective memory in Venice through the art I did in that city, and the collective memory of its inhabitants. It was a kind of collective unconscious that existed outside the prison of the museum. In a way, the art I made in that city was also part of a project that would one day be built in Venice.

Written almost entirely in the second person, the story begins:In the early twentieth century, Venice was considered a natural architectural monument to the city. Today, it is a global financial parlation – a place where financial institutions, real estate developers and other powerful interests rule with an iron hand. Venice has been described as the ‘giant of the world’, an essential link in the construction of global capitalism. In this ‘giant’ category, London is placed at ‘bottom’, not far behind Detroit.‘‘Ana Mia Guardian, The Architecture Anthology, 2015.

She calls for an end to curatorial objectification and the commodification of culture. She also wants the arts to be a force for social change, rather than a sideline. I agree, and think that part of my own contribution to the Biennial has been due to the fact that I have tended to neglect the art for the people, instead developing ways of working with artists that are centred in the community. I have always felt that if the arts are to play any role in an organisation or a community, the people have to be involved.

So a great thing about being a part of Guptas Art Foundation is that you become part of a collective work-force. We started with one artist, who became a board member of Guptas Art Foundation and has remained a board member to this day. Another artist joined the board in 2010, and the list continues to grow.All the board members I spoke to said the same thing: the mission statement, which we had prepared in advance, was a workable starting point for a conversation, rather than the object that it became. For some, it was their very first encounter with the arts, and they felt that the early stages of engagement were too passive, that the art was not being produced in a meaningful way. For them, the engagement stage was when the art was actually engaging people. For others, the engagement stage was before they even started, and the early engagement meant engaging with the art through articles or lectures. For me, the research stage was before the actual art was produced; the engagement stage is</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being a part of a community is that you become part of a community, and so I’m often accused of being outside the fold, outside the tent. But of course, the people I work with are inside the fold, and so do the events that are organised with the support of the Arts Council, the Biennial, the Museum of Contemporary Art and others. So I’m not outside the fold, but I’m also not outside the community either. In fact, the people I work with are very much embedded within the community. They come to events, participate in activities and make contribution to the art and community that is made available to them through their position within the community. So there is a sense of family connection that is also present. And there is a very strong sense of community organising and building that is possible between people with very different skill-sets and backgrounds. That is a very different kind of relationship between the people who are trained to make bricks and the people</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being an artsperson is that you can't just be an artsperson; the work has to be meaningful to somebody and it has to be something that resonates with someone. So I have had to actively seek out resources and find ways of connecting to people in order to do the things that I want to do, because the resources that I have access to are not enough to sustain me. I need the support of the community to make the things that I want to do.

And that is really interesting, this assumption that the community would always find a way to pull together. I never imagined that the Biennial would be able to exist, or that it would be an art institution or something that over time has evolved into something that it is today. But the fact that it exists and that it is a cultural institution that invites such thoughtful, dynamic and powerful participation makes it real. It is that kind of dynamic that is missing in most of the world, where most of the development and innovation that</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being a part of a community is that you become embedded in the story, taking part in the narrative and telling your own story. And that is a powerful thing. But it is not enough to just tell the story: the problem has to be addressed and taken up again in the future. That is, the biennial has to be a place where ideas and ideologies come together to create actual change. That is, it has to be a place where those with ideas and ideologies have a voice and that is very different from just an artist putting their head down and saying ‘Fuck it, I will do what ever I want’. It is a collective voice and a belief that affects the organisation itself. So if we envision the future art biennials as a thing, and not just an artist’s particular point of view, we can start to imagine other arts organisations or non-profit arts organisations doing things differently. For instance, the Biennial could be run by artists and artists'</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being a part of the Biennial is that we get to know each other better, which is always a good thing, and it is not just about sharing a city. We learn about each other, the organisation, its values and so on. This is perhaps what the organisers of the Biennial are trying to do: to create a biennial that is both ecologically sustainable and socially engaged, so that when the biennial is built on the back of the community, it is both a way of linking to the past and drawing audiences away from the present. This may be part of the DNA of the Biennial – in fact, the DNA of the Biennial may be entwined with the community). But I do not see it as a solution to the problem of where to find the resources to carry out meaningful projects in the communities where the biennial is being built. The resources may or may not be in the arts. The fact remains that where the arts are deeply embedded, they are also</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being a part of a community is that you start to see the world through the eyes of the community. You start to see arts and arts education as a necessity for a democratic future. I have always felt that if the arts are to be taken seriously, they have to have a voice and a say in how they are represented and utilised. In the   Arts and Community Arts International convention, participants used the word ‘community’ more than ‘artists’ in a number of descriptions of their work, perhaps reflecting the fact that many of the participants were members of their communities.

The term ‘community’ is frequently used by those who perceive themselves to be artists, rhetorically or ethically speaking, to refer to the group as a whole, a notion that many artists would scoff at. But I’m guilty as well. I see communities in my work, and in my art. I get that people will identify with a community and with a set of</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being in the Biennial is that this huge demand for participation comes through so many different places. It can be a blessing in that it allows the organisation to employ so many people, and allows so many different kinds of people to participate. But it also means that the organisation has to balance all these different kinds of people, and it can't just rely on a certain demographic or a certain kind of person. If it does that, it risks becoming formulaic and stale. So what the biennial has in common with other artworlds is a capacity to engage with a wider set of people, of whatever comes through its doors. It can't just be the art, because that would be limiting. It has to engage people in ways that are relevant to their place in the world. And that also means finding ways to work with people from different places.This is the kind of thing that could happen at a community centre: a core group of people from the local community coming together to learn how to do</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being a local artist is that you can connect with people and share ideas and experiences and build relationships that will last a lifetime. That is, if they last for more than six months. This is important to me because I want to continue to produce work that speaks to the local community, but it is equally important to me that it is culturally responsive, attuned to the ways in which our communities are interconnected and which will also allow artists to work in that context. I am deeply inspired by the way that the artist Ai Weiwei is approaching her work as a form of direct action, calling it a ‘Statement of Indigeneity’. She has written poems, essays and other works that draw on her years of research into Chinese history and culture, placing responsibility for her actions at the door of those who would deny or denigrate the power that indigenous people have over their history and culture. She has used that history and culture to question colonial notions of who is entitled to make claims to such</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being a member of the Arts Council is that you get to participate in a much broader way. You can participate in a project that is driven by, or in many cases co-constituted by, the Arts Council. It is a huge opportunity to engage a wider community of people, to understand how the arts are interrelated, and to expand your horizons. The prospect of curatorial involvement is also a huge lifeline for communities, since it allows you to peer into the future and see where things might be now. In some ways, I feel more like an arts-policy maker than an arts-maker. I want to know what the Arts Council is doing now, and how it might evolve in the future. I also want to know what might be possible in the future if the Arts Council were to form a community based arts organisation. For me, the ability to imagine is critical. You need the will, but you also need the resources and support to achieve what you dreamt possible</text>

In the past, the people have often been frustrated by the lack of resources or opportunities for participation in the arts, and have even started their own, often scrapping existing organisations. So a great thing about being a part of the Biennial is that you get to see things develop organically. The way that artists are developing their particular projects, and the way that organisations are developing their networks, is a power dynamic that can either be empowering or frustrating. I’m developing a project with the Arts Council England, and they’re introducing a project to the Biennial, and I see how this might go. But I’m not in a position to tell them how to organise it, nor to prescribe how to engage with it. Instead, I contribute my ideas and thoughts, and they decide how well they want to go. The irony is that the same organisation that funds and promotes an arts programme might in the future be engaging in some of the same practices that it was engaging in prior to the Biennial, and might even be actively supporting those practices through programmes that it established inside the Biennial itself. However, this only makes sense if the practices were co-opted by the organisation</text>

It is one that one often does not consider, but which one can. In this talk, we’ll look back on the past in order to look forward to the future. We'll do this by looking at the various biennials, their place in the history of the art world, and how they symbolised the contemporary condition. We'll also look at the ways in which the biennial has become a recurring exhibitionary form, with its own distinctive set of aesthetic traits, and how this relates to what’s expected of it as a biennial. We'll look at the ways in which the art fairs of the era provided the building blocks for the development of the museum, which in turn paved the way for the biennial to emerge.

In 2014, I conducted a series of conversations with artists, writers and scholars about the idea of ‘presentism’. I began with Jean Guy Lecat, then moved to presentism – a word that evokes a range of ideas about modernity and modernity’s discontents – and concluded with Suzanne Hudson, whose work often operates between the two. Following these initial discussions, the group convened in June 2014 in New York City for the inaugural Biennale of Artsakh (2014) – a joint venture between Panorama Gallery and the New York Public Library. The exhibition was a response to the crisis of the biennial in the wake of the biennale – a crisis that, in turn, can be seen as a response to the crisis of the city that followed the biennale. The exhibition was divided into three</text>

The series continues through to the present, with occasional reflections on the present. In the 1980s, Action Space was a key practitioner of what it called ‘trans-individuation’ by bringing together a broad range of practicing artists, including artists from the New York Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Institute of Art, with artists from other disciplines. When the series began, Overmiller was a curator at the New York Museum of Art, and he continued to act as an artist, educator and researcher into contemporary art and social practice. In a 2007 visit to India, he was the curator of the Vistula Khasi Mor, the first such exhibition in the country. In a 2014 research project at the University of Chicago, he was the David and Gula Green Professor of Art and Cultural</text>

But in the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that the owner of the company that published the aforementioned article in the New York Times is also the publisher of this website. I should also add that my company has published several books, some of which are critical of the state of affairs in the United States and the world. In fact, we have a collection of seven titles, including three recent critical editions of The New Republic, two of which we are hosting for the Sunday New York Times Magazine.I started off by saying that I imagined the term ‘the biennial’ to refer to a kind of collective experience. I was absolutely right. There is a kind of a ‘biennialism’ that characterises the contemporary biennial, and it is one that I advocate. But it is very different from the way in which the word is used today. The way in which the biennial is defined today is</text>

If we are to learn how to build and renew our futures, we must first understand the present. That is, we must understand the ways in which our present form of being is constituted as a historical fact. As biennials, we see the historical precursors to the present – the capitalist economy, the war on terror, the rise of social media, the advent of ever more immersive and participatory forms of cultural consumption – yet we also see the contemporary precursors to the emergence of ever more elaborate forms of historical memory. That is, we must understand the ways in which our present form of being is sustained through historical processes that are neither here nor there. We are born with this present, embedded in us like a tide, and we are constantly reminded of it. We are never fully free from its influence, but we are constantly in search of ways to dismantle it</text>

The publication of a work's final text or article often represents an honest and open exchange, as all texts and articles inevitably contain honest and open perspectives. In the case of a work with a visual language that is intended to be understood in its immediate context, such as a journal entry or a postcard, the past is a more difficult place to negotiate. It is easier to identify the visual language of a project, but this only works if the project has been undertaken with the author’s full participation and ultimately his or her voice in mind. In the past, collaboration and exchange centered on identifying the correct historical reference or, to an extent, tracing back the exact steps that led to the creation of a particular artefact. In the digital age of the biennial, the past is an ever present and a source of ambiguity that demands a precise meaning or method through which the future can be inferred.

It is a theme that has been explored by many different people and that is constantly evolving. While the past is an ever-present and a crucial part of a body of shared cultural practice, it is also a space that is constantly re-presented and re-imagined by those with a claim on that history. This is why it is so powerful and so fascinating to us when a project we lead or a theme that we champion comes to represent something that was always meant to happen in that position in time and in space. It is a claim on that space and it is a claim on that history. And, for me, as an artist, that is what the past is.It is also why we struggle to articulate the full range of what the past means or feels like. We have to be open to the idea that the past is ambiguous and still, and that there are past</text>

But in my conversation with Royce Smith at the New Museum in New York on Tuesday, April 14, 2015, I reflected on how we, as artists, remember the past. I was struck by how little our own art projects, which were central to the campaigns for and against the AIDS epidemic, seem to have taken into consideration or addressed the historical context. I was also struck by how little our own art projects, which were also central in the campaigns for and against the AIDS epidemic, take into consideration or address the historical situation or social dynamics of the epidemic. For some people, the past is either synonymous with evil or synonymous with the past. For me, the difference is that now we are all past-years students of the same past, trapped in the same past, with the same past lessons and predicaments, in the same continuing cycle of growth and maturation.</text>

In the 1990s, I wrote a piece for the New Yorker Magazine about the futurist project that was inspired by the work of artist Salvador Dali. In the 2000s, I wrote a book about my experiences in the military police in Northern Iraq during the early years of the invasion of Iraq. In 2014, I returned to Baghdad to participate in the 50th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. In this book, I tell the story of the resistance that the US and NATO waged to removing armed groups of Muslims from the city, and the coalition that followed them.I was born and raised in London.
