But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a site do a great deal to constrain artistic ambition.The point of the tribunal is to question, and in the case of Palestine, to resolve. I believe that the process we’ve chosen, the public one, the one open to any citizen, is the one available to address issues of state violence and injustice. And I believe that the public tribunal can learn from the past to act on those memories and ideas. But I also believe that the public must exercise its own independent judgment about how it wants to be governed. The tribunal cannot be an arm of the state, and it certainly cannot become a home for privileged individuals. I hope to see what happens in the coming weeks and months. The fact that it is a public body – unlike the courthouse, which is private and rarely used – suggests that it will be used in a way that is not entirely transparent and which may have some unforeseen consequences. But that is its primary task, now that the Palestinian National Authority has taken charge and is</text>

But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a commercial project is what has created these conditions. This is not to say that there is not a commercial imperative to advancing space, but the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperative and the dynamic between the courts and artists means that the courts are far less likely to endorse artistic claims than commercial artists would like. In short, these factors do not necessarily derive from deep cultural roots or deep seated social trends, but rely instead on the material conditions of contemporary society and culture – material conditions that are, for example, making it easier and cheaper for artists to inhabit public space, and are, in turn, making it easier for artists to inhabit private space. It is this material shift in material conditions that artists and curators must address in order to inhabit and continue to expand artistic and curatorial imaginations.I would add another layer to the discourse of contemporary art, this one about the material conditions of the contemporary condition. This is the topic of ‘contemporary art’ – the material conditions of</text>

But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a commercial project are a further sign that the past is still very much a part of the present.In the end, whether one is talking about the past or the future, one mustn’t lose sight of the fact that a substantial part of the value of art is in the perception of the self – in so far as it is possible to articulate a representation of the past in art. This is why the court in Brooks recognised the ‘recurrent character of aesthetic criteria’ – that is, the need to recall what is aesthetically pleasing in the here and now, even if that’s what we might do with such criteria in a commercial context. The aesthetic is not just a judgment call, but relies on a number of contextual factors, including the prevailing socio-political context, cultural values and ideologies, and economic factors. Thus one will find aesthetic judgement calls in commercial art, even when there are no social or economic motivations behind them.Such aesthetic judgements have consequences for</text>

But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a commercial project come into play much more frequently these days. And again, this is to be expected given the nature of the shared cultural resources between the societies. More and more, we are witnessing the emergence of ‘representational communities’ – communities that together form a society – not unlike ‘cultural villages’ in earlier periods in which the concept was used to describe whole urban landscapes. In the past, village folk, artists, writers, children, animals – and sometimes even birds – populated areas when there were large military campaigns, during which time periods of gluttony and avarice were encouraged. In the current period, the shared shared terrain is the battle for existence as a city is contested by a dense, drug-addicted autonomous region that more often than not, is also the site of major conflicts. The dominant forms of critique in the public sphere in the age of the drone are the grotesque and the absurd. Yet the grotesque and the absurd are not everywhere the same.</text>

But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a commercial project – a break, I might add, that many artists would happily pursue if the opportunity presented itself. The commercial interest in cultural products is not confined to artists; it extends further. A number of the contemporary artists I know who are involved in projects of a political nature, whether political of a pro-democracy bent or not, are artists in their own right. The current political moment calls for artists to engage with the notion of the public good, and the need to protect the public good from commercial exploitation. But this engagement necessarily entails a certain amount of personal risk; the avant garde, critical take on things, and self-published poetry of every sort are likely to find a way into the disciplinary process. Indeed, many artists I know would be more open to engagement with the disciplinary register of cultural production if it were a real, ongoing literary and literary-like process; the avant garde as a process of knowledge, not just of discovery. But this engagement necessarily entails an</text>

But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a commercial project does give a considerable weight to vested commercial interests. In the vagueness decision, Brooks recognised this but held that: ‘[t]he principle that the public takes for granted is not absolute: the weight of commercial and ideological forces tends to corrupt that very essential “found” of public acceptance.’’[10] The current crisis of democratic government – represented by the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the United States – is a situation in which the rule of law is actively questioning whether its core values are truly public good.In his recent book The Crisis of the Secular City (2012), Brooks makes the point that the main task of the era is ‘to preserve the religious, while making them intelligible in a secular age’.[11] He argues that the public, as a whole, is unwilling to make fundamental changes to its religious hierarchies, but is more open to claims that religious hierarchies be made</text>

But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a business does tend to overshadow artistic claims. In the end, it is the artist, and not the court, who occupies the new economic zones, and holds the moral high ground.  	The end result of all this is a landscape increasingly characterised by ‘black-hole’s’ of the planet. It is a landscape in which the economically active merely exist, and the politically adept many other professions. It is a ‘glimmer of hope’ in the form of empty buildings, bad governance, over-determined futures, and a pre-existing urban crisis. It is to a large extent a product of market forces – though some might say that the market itself, though imperfect, is generally efficient at organising goods and resources. And it is arguably a product of the social pressures and institutions that emerged from the various market components joining together to shape the landscape, shape perception and shape behaviour.

It is true that in the 1980s and 1990s the courts gave greater weight to artistic claims, and in the seminal vagueness decision, Max Brooks, the court, although sceptical, did give a wider weight to aesthetic ones. But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a commercial project is different from the weight of a political aspiration. As a consequence, artists are more vulnerable to legal claims than other workers. In the landmark 1984 decision Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the court, while recognising the rights of individuals to develop their own cultures, recognised the overriding authority of national parliaments to enact such rights. The court recognised that a citizen ‘s right to take part in public life, to take part in the common good, is a much more substantial right to begin with than that of participating in one’s own culture.’ While acknowledging the fact that a citizenry can be collectively empowered, the court recognised that a like ability to regulate is also a much more powerful tool than that of individual citizens. Thus while the courts have the final say on issues of cultural primacy and primogeniture – such as who shall have exclusive rights to make cultural choices – they do not necessarily have the final say on issues of power and culture. Nor do</text>

But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a commercial project do more than just weigh down artistic efforts. As a result, many contemporary artists find themselves compromised by the need to deliver concrete results on the ground, whether that is through representing or being represented by an organisation. The converse is also true: many artists find themselves compromised by the need to achieve artistic outcomes on the ground. The disciplinary impulse – the making of art – is a discretionary one, with full recourse available to any dissatisfied party. But the growing financial and commercial entanglements in the field render claims to have an impact quite uncertain, and much harder to quantify. The decision to engage with a project, to follow through with a project, to produce a publication, to be seen to be a contributing factor in a project, to be funded by a commercial enterprise – these are claims that are harder to square with the growing weight of institutional power. The disciplinary impulse, however, remains, and likely will remain, a very important one. The notion of the artist as a political agent</text>

But the growing weight of commercial culture, its commercial imperatives, and the decision to break ground on a commercial project are all but exhausted. The moral of the story is that you can count on the courts to pick up the slack when the state fails to meet its constitutional responsibilities.  	[1] See http://www.brookside.com/lawrence_paul/lawrence_paul_v_brookside.html.

Such is the  	logic of the city. However, despite these elements of the equation being as contradictory as they are fascinating, there is one constant throughout the years of this ‘logic erasure’: there is only so much human behaviour that can be modeled, modeled after, and therefore quantified in a human-readable form. Therefore, while the logic of the city is ultimately describable in terms of numbers, it is human behaviour that remains largely unmeasured and unquantified. This lack of statistical or computational sophistication in the city limits one’s interpretation of the data; the inability to interpret the data limits one’s imagination. This lack of numerical interpretation also means that questions of interpretation are difficult, if not impossible to answer. 	With the advent of computers and the endless stream of data streams generated by them, the limits of human behaviour were inevitably questioned. 	One could ask why, in the age of ubiquitous computing and data capture, are questions of interpretation so crucial?</text>

Such is the  	logic of the city. However, despite this seeming contradiction, no amount of updating the operating system or programming the city into behaving in a certain way could ever replace the labour that actually constitutes the logic of the city in the real world. 	Such labour is precisely what happened in the 1980 Olympic Park project, but despite this, the resulting development never took off. 	Instead, over the next 15 years, a series of self-defeating initiatives ended up adding to the infrastructure of the fictional Russian city of Kazan, rather than trying to undermine it. Some of these initiatives actually improved the city in the long-term, while others merely added to the contradictions of the city. 	One of the most important contributions that programming made to the eventual success of the project was in central casting the city as a visually dynamic part of the games, rather than as an afterthought. This was a huge step towards the realistic depiction of the actual city, as a function of its built environment.</text>

Such is the  	logic of the city, but what little is recognisable as ‘logic’ is actually the job of the citizens of the city, who actively participate in the making of it through their actions and language. Public programmeing of the city’s infrastructure, whilst creating jobs and providing services to the city at large, ultimately derives its power from the labourers and not the computer programmers. In other words, the logic of the city is actually quite complicated, and much of what is done with it is done through the very workers who are its components. 	In the age of the internet and social media, it is much more possible to imagine what the social impact of such infrastructure development could be; what can and cannot be done within the city. One can therefore raise the question, what is the difference between infrastructure and the social? 	There are a number of different kinds of social infrastructure, but usually speaking, social refers to: (1) the built environment – the social organisation</text>

Such is the  	logic of the city. However, despite this seeming contradiction, there is growing evidence that such sweeping changes are actually necessary in order to implement truly transformative social and political change; radical social change. 	In fact, there is overwhelming evidence that such social and political change is already happening on a global scale, and it is happening much too slowly. Take, for example, the rapid expansion of Facebook users in urban areas as a result of Mark Zuckerberg’s eponymous initial public offering of 1999. 	It was a rare occurrence for an initial public offering to result in such transformative social or political change, but the fact that people around the world could access a business offering such potentialities immediately following the initial offering is testimony to the power of this initial public offering. 	Such potentialities included everything from increased consumption to more readily available housing to cultural orientations in education and travel. 	If we take the example of a city, such as New York City, that is experiencing an economic crisis</text>

Such is the  	logic of the city. However, the logic of the city is flawed in many ways, and a real appreciation of the city would show how fundamental is the city’s problem to becoming what it calls a ‘real city’. 	Events such as protests, riots, hunger strikes, and Gezi Park are real, and they are acts of memory, but they are also examples of the city’s capacity to be recreated – an impossible task in a city that is constantly replicating itself. The real question is how to re-create the city in the image of the worker, rather than in the image of the financial planner or the CEO of a for-profit real estate firm. 	There are of course other ways of looking at the city, but the way in which protests, riots, hunger strikes, and Gezi Park were taken up by other artists, writers, artists, activists and academics is significant in bringing attention to crucial social issues that still require resolution</text>

Such is the  	logic of the city, in an age when logic is increasingly being applied to data. However, the advent of software-defined networking (SDN) and cloud computing rendered data dissemination impractical, and with it, dissemination possibilities opened up. Within this context, possibilities for perforations such as the above were created. These possibilities were realized through the application of loosely coupled software (often referred to as ‘the cloud’) and the driven media of social interaction, which allowed for the collection and processing of massive amounts of data in real-time. 	Such is the  	logic of the city – but with the power to predict the future organised science fiction writers included. As an example, consider the possibilities of what could be imagined as ‘the “Big Data” initiative”, which sought to collect and utilise huge amounts of data on the behavior of individuals in order to optimise city services and the future of urban exploration.In recent years, major scientific</text>

Such is the  	logic of the city. However, the logic of the city is applied mainly in the interest of a few developers who control the purse strings and tend to adopt any policy that serves their interests at the expense of others. In practice, this impacts everyone and is generally considered to be a bad idea. So why do developers continue to build in the shadow of such resistance? Because it is profitable for them to do so. Developing a sustainable business model is a major component of any city’s future urbanisation strategy, and a large part of what a developer can expect from a site in a redeveloped area.  	So even if the city’s capacity to generate wealth is questioned, in the end all that matters is what can be achieved at the cost of little to no loss to the city’s residents and inhabitants. And while this may be the case in certain cases, historically, this has typically meant maintaining a high standard of living for the greater part of the city whilst</text>

The overwhelming majority of people do not benefit from the labour of a programmer or software developer. 	Therefore, while it may be true that in theory people should be able to code their way out of certain predicaments, in practice this is rarely done; rather, decisions are made primarily based on vested interests and socio-economic factors. A growing movement is developing to change this, to shift the burden of de-prioritisation to the people, in areas such as housing, education and healthcare, while empowering communities to take matters of their own futures.

In principle, this could be applied to any data set, but in practice, it is much more difficult to apply such a set of principles in practice, because of the nature of computer programming; programming is an extremely demanding discipline, and programmers dedicate enormous amounts of time to mastering the system. In addition, the infrastructure of a city is much more complex, and software written for the city is subject to change due to software upgrades and new versions of the city operating system being developed by the city. In such a case, it is the job of the programmer in the city to continually update the operating system so that it perfectly mimics the behaviour of the underlying data, while simultaneously adjusting the underlying programming to account for any new data being mined from the city. 	Such is the  	logic of the city. Despite this seeming contradiction, the logic of the city appears to operate in spite of it. A cursory glance at any city map will reveal a tangled web of regulations, codes, ordinances and laws that could easily be interpreted as hostile or inhumane. Moreover, the city is a complex system that inherently contains unseen forces at work in the background that can be invoked at any time. 	Such is the urban interface. The interface is the point where the visible interface meets the invisible interface, where the visible meets the invisible. It is where representation meets reality, where metaphor meets experiment, and where intention meets execution. It is a point where intentions meet means, and where ends meet means. It is a point where intentions meet means, and where ends meet no one. 	The interface is the point where the visible meets the invisible. It is where the visible meets the unsuspected. It is a notoriously difficult and ambiguous place to grasp, and much of what is written or</text>

Such is the  	logic of the city. However, the logic of the city is often abused in ways that negatively impact communities of colour, and in this context, it is important to question whether the underlying assumptions of the system are actually in conflict with the people who reside in the city. Is there a conflict between the people who live in the city and the people who work in the computer? If so, what is the role of the courts and tribunals that adjudicate on claims between citizens? 	In the United States, courts have traditionally been critical of legislation that undermines the role of the courts and tribunals, and have often intervened in such legislation to ensure that it balances the public and private sectors, in much as the founders dreamed of such a role. However, in the past several decades, decisions by courts and tribunals to abandon their traditional role have often been driven by activist judges and lawyers, who have found ways to undermine the public sector through creative means, while courts have tended to follow</text>

In 2007, Dutch artist Jeanne van Heeswijk assembled a group of artists, activists and researchers to explore the environmental and political motivations of recording. The project was titled Assemble’ng in Nederlandse Nederland (The Gathering in the City). The title was a play on the two names of the cities where the Assembleings were based: Liverpool and Amsterdam. The producers of the film, including director Peter Heeswijk, considered the project to be a public art project.

Surveillance via data mining has become an integral part of the infrastructure of the infrastructure of infrastructure, deployed at various scales and in multiple languages.The constant recording of data has come to be the fundamental building block of the new infrastructure of infrastructure. Its recording ensures that the data can be gathered and used in multiple ways; that is, it is possible to analyse the data in multiple ways and employ it to achieve different ends; that is, it is possible to embed the data in non-linearities and hierarchies of space; that is, to construct networks and hierarchies of use that simultaneously surveil and serve; that is, to explore the intersections between data and power. But what does it mean to embed data in non-linearities and hierarchies of space? How does the recording of data in non-linearities and hierarchies of time create new data?

Surveillance via data mining has become an integral part of the infrastructure of the infrastructure of infrastructure, deployed at various scales including of individuals, companies, financial institutions and even non-state actors. Surveillance via data mining has become so pervasive that it is often misconstrued as an incidental by-product of the metainterface. The very notion of 'innovative' is used to disguise the social effects of this industry, often deployed as a means to blunt any criticism of the status of women, ethnic minorities or other vulnerable groups. More and more often, the critical stance taken against large-scale data mining is employed by those with a financial stake in the continued commercialisation of infrastructure – a strategy that seeks to divert attention away from the structural causes of the crisis in order to pave the way for the emergence of alternative futures.Such is the imbrication of new technologies with everyday phenomena. The metainterface is deployed not only by but also by agents operating outside of the law – those who harness its latent potential for control.

Surveillance via data mining is understood as geo-political in that it organises information resources into defined roles and responsibilities. It is understood as a science-based practice in that it organises information gathering and transmission across national boundaries. But it is also understood as a daily practice through which people live their daily lives. 	In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the biennale sought to recover from its visual impact of the crisis by proposing a new communications strategy through information technologies. In the 2009 edition, the biennale revisited the idea of the archive in an attempt to demonstrate that it was still relevant in a global sense. 	The biennale’s 2009 Platform was a reaction to the visual impact of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.

Surveillance via data mining has become an integral part of the infrastructure of the infrastructure of infrastructure, deployed at various scales ranging from bridges to tunnels to railways. Data mining has become so pervasive that it is now performed by every type of computer, embedded within chips and embedded in transistors. 	There are many forms of data mining, but the most pervasive and pernicious uses of data are for the management of corporations and nation states. In 1990, for instance, a law was passed in the US Congress requiring that all charts documenting, describing or justifying any increase in the size of a country's armed forces be destroyed. The law went on to authorize the president to declare a national emergency if there is evidence that the US is headed for a conflict. The destruction of such charts is routine, but there is an exception allowing such charts to be retained as evidence of a conflict. 	There are various kinds of charts, but the primary kinds are those that chart money, and those that chart human behaviour. The main difference between the image of a war and a chart is that a war is quantifiable, whereas</text>

In many cases, the recording of passing trains, street lamps and trees is made compulsory by law. For instance, in the US, when Americans move, they are required to provide the city of San Francisco with accurate and up-to-date maps and information on transit routes. But in places like Istanbul, which is approximately the same size as San Francisco, the obligation is to provide these same maps and information to transit users. In many cases, these rights have come to be seen as basic human rights. In 2014, when the Stop Online Piracy Act was defeated in Congress, it was seen by many as a victory for online freedom. But as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and our online legal team discovered, this victory did not come without a cost.

Surveillance via data mining has become an integral part of the infrastructure of the infrastructure of infrastructure, deployed at various scales and in different locations. Information about where and how a particular node is located is routinely gathered in order to deploy surveillance and policing strategies. Such information enables the deployment of new surveillance and policing strategies that constantly seek to map the physical world in order to apply precise, albeit temporary, records of movement and behaviour to ever larger datasets of behaviour. Such mapping is inherently geo-politically unstable, and the deployment of such maps as metadata in relation to movements across the globe is a persistent source of contention. However, there are other ways of framing such materialities and mores that also arise from the same ecological and geo-politic factors. For instance, the use of smartphones and social media also affects the ways in which people understand and inhabit space. The constant recording and recording of movement across social media platforms through apps like Instagram and Facebook generates a phenomenal amount of data about individuals and groups. This amounts to a material form of data that becomes embedded in our bodies and behaviours, which in turn contributes to a</text>

Indeed, as surveillance technologies advanced, so too did the need for extra surveillance. New technologies have replaced old analogies of the invisible hand with new analogies of the visible and the audible, contributing to the politicisation of everyday life (see Fred Turner and Tom De Bruyne, Global Voices, page 78). Infrastructures of the Future: Money and its Place in the Public realm 	Regardless of what one might think of as technological progress, there is no doubt that areas of public realm are affected by it. The emergence of cryptocurrencies as a form of digital money in 2014 and their widespread use in the real-life economy of goods and services is a good example of this. 	In the twentieth century, infrastructuralism was often characterised by the proliferation of engineering marvels – the structures that permit us to access resources on a global scale but are also capable of sustaining human agency – and the prone public sphere – that is</text>

I’d never want my biennial to be a situation in which people feel like they’re not able to engage with the art in the context of a relationship because they don’t trust each other. There have to be actors in the system that can interpose between the artist and audience, and even though audiences tend to identify with the art, they also tend to hold in reserve certain kinds of feelings about the world that aren’t supposed to be expressed. In this sense, the curatorial job is a kind of a soupçon of unknowable ambiguities. It’s also the sort of thing that can happen between the artist and the spectator: the artist and the audience are two completely different sorts of beings. The sort of thing that can happen between the artist and the audience is much more emotionally charged and involves a lot of vulnerability, so the audience is more open to that kind of thing.

I’d never want my biennial to be a situation in which people have to ask, ‘What are we supposed to do?’ The other problem with the art department is that it’s a two-tiered system: the curatorial role is visual and interpersonal, while the more physical act of art is facilitated, the more it’s perceived as art. So the curatorial role basically stands still, whereas the interpersonal role evolves and changes according to the perception and actions of the public. If you remove the interpersonal element and let the interpersonal act take place, you remove the interpersonal act and you get a different kind of art. If you do that regularly, over and over again, over and over again, it becomes something that gets encoded in the collective unconscious and becomes part of the fabric of the city, rather than something that falls victim to arbitrary urban development and the abuse of power.  	The Inter-generative Curatorial Process 	Since 2006 the Biennale of Sydney has been curatorial in</text>

I’d never want my biennial to be a fiasco because of the biennial boom, because trustworthiness is a different kind of vulnerability. The kind of vulnerability that comes from being made vulnerable. The kind of vulnerability that comes from being made vulnerable by a community of people who need to work together to get things done. The kind of vulnerability that comes from being made vulnerable by the accumulation of power and money in the form of museums, the biennial, and the biennial boom. Trustworthiness comes from understanding that power is not always in your own hands. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s the biennial was a community effort, and as a consequence there was a kind of shared understanding of what was expected of artists and how they were supposed to perform. But now the biennial feels like a single entity, and the community feels like a collection of experiences. The community is still vulnerable to the narcissistic behaviour of the artist, the biennial in turn still needs to ask artists to find a way to work with it, but the</text>

The sort of interpersonal trust building that biennials are supposed to foster is fragile. Perhaps the greatest danger to the biennial as a cultural-institutional form is its tendency to become something it’s not supposed to be.In the 1970s and 1980s, the biennial experienced a period of considerable upsurge due to the proliferation of art-historical curatorial styles, the proliferation of art collections, and the proliferation of biennials, particularly in the US. The explosion of collections and the proliferation of biennials in the US coincided with a period of considerable cultural upsurge due to the monorail, and coincided with a period of considerable cultural malaise due to the excesses of urban development. The upsurge in art collections coincided with a fall in cultural tourism, which was associated with a fall in real estate values. Biennials in</text>

So the challenge has been to start from the ground up, and to build trust with people who might patronise the art department in the future. My approach has been to create a system that allows people to register their interest in the biennial by providing a way to engage people in the city through curatorial activities. There’s a process by which people can register their interest in a particular project through the biennial. So far, so normalised, but what happens next is interesting. The first steps are often quite dangerous, and the first thing a new government does when it comes to regulating things is to banish things from our planet. But what the biennial does is quite different. It establishes an interest in a project beyond the scope of what the normal gallery or museum might do. It establishes a relationship with people beyond the gallery that might otherwise be there for a visit. It establishes</text>

I’m in the art department, I’m the curator, I’m in a position of great responsibility, and yet I still manage to have fun. The problem with the art department is that it’s clear that something is going on behind the scenes that nobody is telling them to be careful about, or that they’re not supposed to know, or that they’re not supposed to do. The problem with the art department is that it’s easy to get sucked into the bubble of art appreciation: the curatorial job is a relatively new one, and the public gallery and art-historical archive are still relatively new arrivals. The curatorial job is also a post that requires a lot of interpersonal trust building. I’d never want my biennial to be a situation in which people feel like they’re falling for a crook. The art department needs to be constantly reminding the board, to make sure that they’re not in danger of falling for a crook. The curatorial job is complex, and trust breaks down barriers all the time, but there is a limit to how much the public is prepared to invest in something that they’ve never actually seen. If the public doesn’t perceive the value in what they see, or don’t perceive the need for what they see, then the art department will inevitably be overwhelmed by artists and exhibitions will be cancelled. Trust is needed between the artist and the audience, but at the same time, audiences don’t need to buy art to understand it. The audience needs to understand what the artist is trying to achieve, but audiences also need to be able to choose how the art is presented. In an ideal world, the audience would understand that the artist was</text>

I’d never want my biennial to be a &quot;I told you so’ situation, where the audience members deliver the inevitable critique of contemporary art, but somehow the art is still seen as somehow intrinsically tied to the institution that created it. The curatorial job is a double-edged sword: it’s also a job that requires a lot of transparency and invites us to question things that otherwise we wouldn’t dare to question. Ultimately, the art is up to us, the audience, to decide how we use it creatively. Whether we use it ethically is a different proposition. The question is whether the art can be collectively understood and collectively utilised creatively without becoming something that it isn’t supposed to be. The answer to that is a unequivocal &quot;yes&quot;.[1]Download this article as PDFNadine AttewellNadine Attewell is a writer, curator, writer and arts educationalist.

I’d never want my biennial to be a situation where people have to elbow their way through a mountain of notes just to get to the point, or perhaps just to get a few more notes to spend with their loved ones. The curatorial relationship with the public is a new one, and whilst it may seem like something that was inevitable, the fact of the curatorial relationship was also an invention of the twentieth century. In the twentieth century, the biennial was a collection of works selected from a larger collection of artists’ works in a particular city, and these artists were given a specific curatorial role. The biennial, then, is a collection of works selected from an artist’s body of work in a particular city, and the only way that a biennial can be fixed is if all of that artist’s previous works have been abolished. This is a general proposition, and it can be illustrated graphically. If a biennial can be fixed in its trajectory, it will be some point in the future when</text>

I’d never want my biennial to be a situation where the curator is asking me to recommend a gallery over a museum, or the other way around. The buck stops with the person who initiates the biennial. I hope that the biennial that we do get takes into account the people who will be coming to see it, and the context that they’re coming to. The biennial should come from the curator’s point of view, and not just the artist’s. If the biennial is going to be interesting and dynamic and give people the opportunity to come into the museum and into the city, the museum has to be accessible and the gallery has to be varied and interesting and welcoming. The biennial has to be able to do both. The museum is the first stop. The biennial has to be able to take you to places, people, people from the past, people from the future. And the museum has to be a place where you can do that. Since we don’t have</text>

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums, but this is no longer the case. The rise of social media and new media technologies make it easier than ever to become involved in a project, and so the curatorial role is no longer confined to the classical museum or classical art gallery. There are now also sites available at which artists can set up their projects and find a community of collaborators to work with them, allowing for the simultaneous experimentation and production of impactful works. This is a significantly different relationship to the traditional biennial, which operated mostly as a site for art-historical curatorial activities. The biennial is often characterized as a global phenomenon, but the fact that it is a biennial at all is an artefact of the past, a by-product of the specific curatorial strategies of certain historical and contemporary powers. In other words, it is a curatorial production that returns to the city with it when it is most needed, but it is different from the museum in that it is not interested in preserving</text>

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums and libraries, which, by establishing a shared common vocabulary and shared set of values, enabled a common knowledge base to be built across the board. As a consequence, criticality was often pinned on the level of institutions, rather than the content of the texts they represented. This is true of Museums of Modern Art being founded in Berlin and Liverpool, which are explicitly committed to the collection and exhibition of cultural resources, but also Manhattan’s M.I.A Institute for Art and Culture, which is dedicated to questioning contemporary art practices and producing sustainable alternatives through cultural production through cross-cultural in order to question capitalism as an institution and all its practitioners.Criticism and commentary on art is part of what makes art meaningful, and so is part of what makes art cultural.

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums, which fostered trust and made the cultural institutions visible and controllable. The relationship between the museum and the biennial, on the other hand, makes the biennial the dominant cultural institution in a city, while the museum becomes a visible third party. This is a situation in which biennials, although they claim to be non-mainstream and progressive, function as cultural institutions and realities in their own right. It is to a large extent a function of how the trustees in the biennial commission are selected, incentivised and supported. Trustees in the biennial commission may well be drawn from the museum and the biennial commission may well be drawn from the museum’s trustees. I have no reason to doubt the intentions of the biennial commission, but the museum and the biennial commission in their current form have little power in terms of shaping public or even professional perception of the world in the ways in which artists and the public realistically expect to be impacted.

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums, but I argue that the museum is a more natural outgrowth of the growing importance of people as artists, curators, makers and consumers of culture. The growing importance of people as artists, curators, makers and consumers of culture in the past half century has been driven by the institutionalised interest in knowledge, the museum being the prototypime of this new power relation. The legacy of this historical emphasis on institutionalised knowledge-producing power is reflected in the curatorial agenda of the museum, but despite its institutionalised commitment to learning, the museum is also a site in which power dynamics constantly re-negotiate. The institutionalised museum is constantly seeking to add to its collection of artefacts, to absorb new ways of engaging with art, and to adapt its collections to the needs of a changing world. In this process, it creates what I would call a proto-exhibitionary condition where artefacts are positioned in relation to each other, and work is produced out of thin</text>

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums and public museums, which promoted the institutionalisation of history and the production of images of the past in an image that could be used to justify future actions. I believe that the biennial is an artifact of the past that is aggressively repurposing what little relevance it has left, and which is doing so in a manner that is difficult to comprehend in the present. I also believe that the cultural and tourism sectors are increasingly interdependent, and that the former is in turn increasingly dependent on the latter. There is a real sense of competition between biennials, and this competition is about to intensify as new exhibitionary forms are developed and new trade fairs are launched. If the biennial is to retain its current character, it is essential that it is one that is visionary, responsive and can act as a catalyst for cultural change through its visionary, responsive and flexible exhibitions. The biennial should not only inspire cultural activity but also be a center of production and a point of convergence for cultural</text>

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums and ‘centres of culture’ in major cities, but these days it is often seen as necessary to address the challenges of an increasingly globalised and complex society. A museum is a last resort, and its primary purpose is to archive and present the past, but its role in the present may also be significant. If the present is not seen as inherently historical, but instead as a dynamic, ambiguous space in which historical events unfold, then we may begin to rethink how we value the past, and how we conceive of the cultural practices that constitute it. This is the current curatorial paradigm in most cities: the museum is often seen as a site of contingency, where cultural practices can develop or be rejected in order to allow for the future. While this is certainly a case of cultural practices being put to use in the interest of the present, it is also an artefact of the museum being built on the past, and serves as a kind of museum building in the process.</text>

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums and libraries, institutions that gathered and shared information and images, and disseminated knowledge. The rise of biennials in the mid-to-late twentieth century coincided with the spread of literacy and urbanisation strategies in urbanised areas, and so we can draw on the co-relevance of these two developments. As a result of this interaction, it is now commonplace for people to travel thousands of miles to see a piece of art or a performance, and for cultural activities to be organised by and open to people from faraway places. But while this is happening, it is happening mostly to wealthy people and the well-connected. We do not have the kind of collective cultural power needed to fundamentally alter this dynamic, least of all the kind needed by communities who are increasingly stretched to breaking point by the inaccessibility of so much of what they perceive to be contemporary art and culture. That could happen only through mass participation and political will. I don’t think we have</text>

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums and theatres, which provided resources for artists to work with, but also allowed institutions like theatres to establish a presence in and influence over new cultural practices. The development of critical arts practices was often tied to the establishment of cultural centres, which lent resources for artists to work with, but also allowed cultural centres to establish a presence in and influence over previous cultural practices. The important point here is that even though we might desire to think of our art as organic and responsive to the needs of communities, the social relations that exist between people and the world are also deeply embedded in the historical circumstances and dynamics of the world. This is critical, for a culture to exert significant influence over what art is made, who has access to it, and how that influence is exercised. I would argue that the art produced through this model is subordinate to the social relations that exist between people and the world, and that the social relations are produced through what can be regarded as ‘natural cultural processes’</text>

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums and such, with curators becoming both administrators and stakeholders in the organisation. The relationship between artist and museum became important in this context, and the role of the artist became strategic, but the museum as such is an antiquated historical building with limited adaptive capacity in the age of mass media. It must be replaced, must be taken out of commission, and in my opinion, must evolve into something more responsive to the needs of the people who use it and adopt of it. The role of the artist is to engage with people’s thinking and to help shape it in ways that are authentic to the community in which they live and make creative products from it. So, what is the role of the artist today in the new museum that is being formulated around the past, situated in a world where people are no longer descendants of slaves but have rights? How can the artist create experiences that are authentic to communities in a contemporary context? These are the kinds of questions that arise in a cur</text>

The development of new cultural practices was often linked to the establishment of institutions such as museums, which fostered the rise of biennials and the subsequent development of globalised urban economies. The rise of the biennial, then, is often credited to a ‘biennial fatigue’ that could be attributed to the ‘postmodern’ aspects of biennials becoming increasingly globalised.16 But biennials have always been globalised in their own right, and globalised in relation to other biennials. The rise of the biennial is a consequence of a historical and continuous process of globalisation that began with the rise of the first commercially active cities, and continues to this day. The biennial is a global phenomenon, and the museum as a globally active form is a past exhibit on a timeline. The biennial as a form is not some new discovery; it is part of a long lineage of art and art history.17 It is a potentially powerful tool, perhaps a decisive one, in our historical and contemporary quest for ecological sustainability.

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem is clearly put: ‘Maps symbolise change and evolution.’ He goes on to explain that the adoption of new technology creates ‘opportunities that cannot be taken for granted’. These could include new ‘business models’ that actively seek to exploit surplus resources, new ways of building ‘roofs of habitation’, and so forth. The point is that, increasingly, technology provides us with inexhaustible amounts of data that allow us to do incredible things with it, but also the possibility that such technologies could lead to things not always envisaged. This is one way in which Cahmaz Kazem is constantly reminding us of the limits of power, both physical and digital. Computers and data-processing devices are designed with features and mechanisms that constantly monitor and collect data, and which can do incredible things with it.

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem is quick to identify Britain as the site of one of the great technological migrations of the 21st century. The article then describes how the shifting of images and sounds across different social networks has been shown to have a significant impact on the social structure and value of the past, present and future. The shift in emphasis from images of individuals to images of groups and networks impacts our sense of place, our sense of history, our sense of identity – and in many cases, our sense of reality itself. As the article notes, images of individuals are of course still the dominant social form in many parts of the world, but the advent of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter has fundamentally transformed how we communicate, look for knowledge and discover new places. ‘Shifting Sightlines’ is a valuable, powerful and controversial piece of writing, but it’s also a long way from being a form of actionable political resistance.

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem, Andrea Sabella, ignores the fact that her work is interactive and data-driven, and more specifically, her work constantly requires users to 'upgrade' their digital maps to take them to places that are more accurately represented in the interactive map. For more than just an artistic purpose, users of the new medium are constantly updating and enhancing their digital representations of the world. This is done in large part through the use of sensors and data mining, technologies that constantly gather information on where they are at all times, what they have done in the world and how they behave, and how they are likely to behave in the future. In effect, every interaction in the world of maps is now captured, and used to generate information that is then passed on to companies that design maps and deliver them to users.

These 3-D images are not merely representations of places; they are actively engaged with and contributed to by digital means.’[7] A recent poll of 2,000 artists, commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, found that over half the respondents viewed digital images of the city as less representational than actual places. The breakdown in that poll was as follows: 53% viewed digital images of the city as less meaningful, while 24% viewed digital images of the city as greatly more meaningful. The findings were particularly telling in the context of Cahmaz Kazem’s recent San Francisco art project, where the spatial relations between artist and city were actively challenged through the placement of conspicuously digital images of artworks in the city. The poll also found that many artists felt that their work should be able to penetrate cityscapes and social systems</text>

The question is whether the new medium is one in which massive amounts of data are generated and continuously shared, or whether it’s one in which massive amounts of data are controlled and continuously altered in a transparent and economical way.

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem is quick to point out that the primary purpose of a map is to connect. Accessing a place, place, or object is a human right, and the primary responsibility of the user is on him or her to make the place, place, or object recognisable to others. However, Kazem is careful to add that the primary role of the artist is to the extent that the mapping is undertaken ‘on site’ and that the mapping is done ‘in collaboration with, and through, the art department’.[39] This last statement is at the heart of the controversy surrounding Cahmaz Kazem’s Mapping the World project, which was exhibited as part of the Biennale di Tella in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The project was initially presented as a one-off work, but as we now know, it turned out to be a long-term project, and so it continued to be a significant piece of the wider narrative of the Bi</text>

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem is quick to declare that the new medium is that through which ‘a new relationship between the artist and the user [is developing].’ The implication is that the medium of the map is somehow a platform for ‘a new relationship between artist and audience’, but the increasing privatisation of data gathering and manipulation is clearly not viewed as a new relationship. It is rather, in the words of David Slater, a ‘phantom economy’ that reifies the past, and that seeks to reanimate it.’[1] If this is the case, then the public engagement that maps bring to the public arena – bringing together, placing in front of us, placing in our rear-view mirrors, placing on our doorstep, placing in our front windows, placing in our pockets, placing in our pockets – is all but guaranteed to be a sham. Why? Because the public engagement that maps bring to the public arena is all but guaranteed to be a sham. Because</text>

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem is careful to point out that a driverless car and truck stop is not the answer; travel alternatives include aircraft, trains, and automobiles. Instead, she proposes a completely different approach: ‘mapping today is a science, not a religion’. In other words, the responsibility for mapping lies in the hands of academics and others with skills comparable to those of the drivers, not in the hands of a religious commission. While the responsibility for creating accessible and accessible ways to travel lies with the drivers, the responsibility for sharing and empowering those who drive lies with academics and others with skills comparable to those of the passengers. For this reason, the project was critical for its success: it set the scholars and artists on the road, but it also demanded critical mass in order to move forward. The mass of people who witnessed, participated in, or read about the project were crucial in pushing the project forward, because only then could the true potentialities of the project be realised.

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem, Norman Wilkinson, neglects to mention any names or regions in his ethnography of artists, especially those who are migrants or refugees. Instead, he writes: ‘As nations became richer and more powerful, and the needs of the commonwealth shifted, a need to be seen expanded also existed.’ He doesn’t seem to have considered that many of the artists who were trained in the UK and developed the skills and knowledge to be internationally visible were then sent elsewhere, mainly to countries with which the art world had very different political and economic histories. Wilkinson seems to have been unaware that the new media were starting to emerge in large measure through the connections that artists like myself and others like myself could establish between our local communities and those we were creating media for – in other words, between artists and audiences. As a curator, I wanted to know what kinds of capacity the artist base had to respond to this shift in the media landscape. I wanted to know what kinds of capacity the art</text>

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem, presented the need for a culture of maps, but mostly in the form of a lecture. The artist and his fellow artists Cahmaz Kazem, Saadia Bankole, and Farshad Manjavadi, as well as the writer and curator Tanweer Jalal, frame the need to read maps as a fundamental necessity of a healthy reading of the ancient and modern histories of the world. They point out that the proliferation of digital maps is a necessity today because digital maps represent the location of commodities, methods of production and flows of information about the world as if these traces are embedded in the surface of the earth. Digital maps are inputs into globalised capitalist systems that constantly reference points of production and distribution, from the factory to the port. In doing so, they create what Jalal calls ‘digital legacies’ that continue to influence how people think about the world and how maps are produced, distributed, and made in this world.

In an article entitled ‘How to Read Maps’, the lead artist in a multimedia installation about the Shifting Sightlines of the Multidisciplinary Artist Cahmaz Kazem is dismissive of the idea of self-organisation and the inherent randomness of human behaviour:Strengthening our sense of the uncanny in urban settings is key. Our perception of the world around us is governed by the forces that we unwittingly put in place. We can try to understand and anticipate the things that will happen to us, but we can also create our own imaginative and dynamic forms of travel that defy the odds and pull us out of the defined trajectory. While the first may seem like magic, the second depends on individual and institutional strength. In the larger context of a society, cultural production and its attendant practices are often characterised by a mythological root around a person or thing called a ‘His or Her “Trinity”. The name ‘His or Her” indicates a shared origin and lineage; a shared set of relations and obligations; and a shared destiny. In other words, it signals to us something like a collective ownership and dominion. But what exactly</text>

It’s not always going to be so, but it’s always going to be the case that you’re going to have to put in the resources, and that’s where we’ve got to be patient, always hopeful that the arts will come to us, and that they’ll come to the right place at the right time. And that’s exactly what we’re trying to achieve right now. We don’t want to impose our will on the arts community; they’ve got their own ideas, and we don’t want to override that. But we do want to be able to say: ‘This is what we think this is going to be like, and here’s how we think it’s going to be here.’ And so, there’s this delicate balancing act that artists and the organisers of the Bi</text>

But when we do it ourselves, we do it because we’ve got to have the funding; otherwise we’ve got to have the support of the state. And the funding that we get from the state is incredibly important, in a way that almost nothing else does. Because if the funding dried up, or the place closed down, or the artists left, or the place was dilapidated – which is happening to a large extent in our neighbourhood – then we wouldn’t be able to do what we are doing, which is curating the 8th Biennale of Sydney. We would still be able to do what we do as an arts organisation, which is to be seen as an art institution, to be reckoned with and to continue to be funded by the state.But the funding dried up long ago. When the funding dried up, the arts community was left with very real conflicts and anxieties about its future. There was a real sense of de facto or absolute powerlessness in relation to the space of art. There was a real conflict of power between</text>

But when we do it ourselves, we do it because we’ve got to have the funding; otherwise we’ve got to have the support of the state. And the funding that we got through the Community Arts movement was crucial: it allowed us to pay for art, it allowed us to fund the art itself, and it allowed us to start a non-profit organisation and start a community bank account and assistance from the Community Arts board. So, things that normally happen with grants, like art programmes, started to be supported by the state. And so the Community Arts movement had two parts: the funding part and the artist part. The funding part was about who could do what with the funding. And so the Community Arts board was very important in enabling the board to do what it did, because it undermined some of the power imbalance between the artist and the state. And so the Community Arts board was elected, and so was the Community Arts programme.And so the Community Arts movement has done this: once it started</text>

And the funding that we do have is vital: it’s what enables us to take the project forward and to keep going. And the reason why is that the more the biennale depends on tourism, the less that vulnerability is there. If the biennale is too present and dependent on tourism, it’s easy to lose focus of the narrative of the city, to lose the narrative of the community. So, the biennale has to find a way to connect to the city and, more importantly, to the city’s narrative of itself. Otherwise, it’s just another urban artefact that’s there to be visited, enjoyed and taken out again and again. But if the narrative of the city is written by art and tourism, it’s going to be written by art and tourism for the foreseeable future.Art’s stories have to be compelling</text>

The infrastructural maps that emerged from the financial crisis of 2008 are a useful tool for understanding the ways in which infrastructure can be reconfigured to support new modes of production and consumption. They show that there are ways to reimagine infrastructure in new ways, but also of transforming it (re)urbanise and developing new modes of infrastructuration. The maps also show that much of what is being done with this infrastructure is unnecessary and that something can be done with what is left. But they do not show where to begin building alternative infrastructures. This is why the infrastructural narratives that emerged from the crisis of 2008 and continue to be told in most urban centres and</text>

The importance of this spatial heterogeneity cannot be understated. If ‘the city’ is understood solely as a production zone for the urban development of the surrounding neighbourhood, then the ‘city’ becomes an obstacle to the ‘pace of everyday life’ that is required by the logic of neoliberalism.[36]Chronology and spatial relations in the cityJuliana Engberg, ‘Time and Space: An Introduction’, in David Harvey and Michael Slack, eds., Space 2000: Essays on the Quest for Meaning (New York: Routledge, 2000), p. 41.Download this article</text>

    The next Liverpool Biennial will take place in early 2019. Liverpool Biennial 2018 aims to bring together a diverse group of artists, curators, artists' unions, community organisers and artists’ organisations from across the globe to work together to discover ways to work together to change the world. The main theme of the event is ‘Destiny’. The word’s resolution is: ‘On a thousand faces of the earth, across the seas and in different time zones, we are crying out for rescue.’ In other words, ‘on a thousand faces of the earth’. The main partner organisation for this event is the Liverpool Biennial. The other partners are organisations representing art museums, libraries, grassroots groups and arts education institutions.

This is an area with a significant Jewish and Black community, who have traditionally held significant positions in the city. The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and owners, to create a shared heritage for the office and conference spaces. This is a unique approach, which breaks complex historical relationships into smaller parts, in order to preserve the integrity of the building and its use in the future. The idea is to archive the essence of how the building was designed and made part of the city – the way in which we inhabit it today – in a way that will be useful for the future development of the city. 	The new office and conference spaces will be set in a hybrid 3-D and 2-D model, combining the traditional office with the conference room. Their purpose will be recorded in the  Future City initiative, an interactive, 3D application of the Biennial’s research project to document the city’s urban pastime. 	The hybrid 3-D and 2-D models were developed by Forensic Architecture, a research team led by Professors at Liverpool John Moores University, and funded by the Leverhulme Trust</text>

This is an area with a significant Jewish and Black community, who have traditionally held significant positions in the city. The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and clear boundaries. These units will be called ‘plant platforms’ and ‘rhizomes’ respectively. These plants will function as ‘facilities for the production and consumption of cannabis’, a new drug to be developed in collaboration with the US pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly. The plant platforms will produce and consume the drug naturally, but also collect and analyse the cannabis’s various components, residues and metabolites. This is the premise of a new class of drug delivery systems that mimic the actions of the cannabis plant but with the active components extracted from other parts of the plant, and the structures that support the drug production from the cannabis plant. This technology breaks the mould and operates in the real world, where cannabis is a plant with many different kinds of active ingredients. 	This new class of drugs does not come as a surprise to those who have been following the development of the technology, for example, for pharmaceutical and industrial use.

The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and personalities, in an attempt to conserve as much of the historical character as possible.I was in Liverpool recently, and took part in a workshop for the Liverpool Biennial on the culture of renewal and the discontents of gentrification. Terry Smith, whose work I republished from the Biblio, talked about the challenges faced by artists and institutions in combating the destructive forces of gentrification. He stressed the need for independent artists to develop alternative strategies in confronting capitalism, and for arts education to be multidisciplinary, not confined to a few subject areas. He also mentioned the importance of artists developing alternative communication strategies with communities, and for arts and arts-funded organisations to develop effective grassroots art and culture campaigns.Independently-produced art is not always going to end up in places like Anfield, but it is always going to be at risk of languishing on the periphery, lost in the shuffle of bureaucracy and the packed theatre.

This is an area with a significant Jewish and Black community, who have traditionally held significant positions in the city. The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and owners, in an attempt to create a more ‘transactional’ space for collaboration and exchange. This is similar to what Indigenous People have been doing in the city, who have taken over traditionally Indigenous spaces and buildings. In the Biennial’s case, the goal is to create a 'permanent constituency of engaged citizens’ – people who regularly use the buildings and participate in the city’s cultural life, through arts, crafts, visits to galleries, take part in community events, etc. – who then choose to stay in the city and create a ‘relevance ecosystem’ around the buildings and neighbourhoods in which they live.

This is an area with a significant Jewish and Black community, who have traditionally held significant positions in the city. The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and themes. This is in part to make the buildings more accessible, with new management teams of which face the daunting task of rehabilitating the buildings after the Biennial has closed.  	The decision to break up the office and conference spaces into smaller units is a response to the challenge posed by the rapid growth of office and conference use in the city, which is driven by the constant need to connect to the digital connectivity provided by the connected office. If the spatial relations between the biennial and the connected conference centre are disrupted, as is now happening, then the biennial is left behind, and the connected centre is left with a mess. 	The decision to break up the building into smaller units is a response to the challenge posed by an office and conference density that is out of kilter with the city’s growth, which has led to an office and conference density that is out of synch with the growth of the city.

This is an area with a significant Jewish and Black community, who have traditionally held significant positions in the city. The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and owners, to create a shared common space for the exchange of ideas and data. The idea is that each office or conference space will have a specific role in the city, allowing ideas and data to flow freely and naturally. For this reason, the office or conference centre will likely have a number of reception and meeting spaces, including a café or conference area. Although not mandated by law, the plan is for the office or conference centre to become increasingly self-sufficient, with the biennial office becoming a strong presence in the city. 	The idea of a biennial as a federally mandated agency is new to me, but the way in which the Biennial is approaching this is very old-fashioned and European in its design. A biennial had its origins in New York, but its core mission was to house paintings from around the world for a specified period of time. Today, there is much less European, or international, presence in the artworld than in the museum. The reason for this</text>

This is an area with a significant Jewish and Black community, who have traditionally held significant positions in the city. The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and owners, in an attempt to make them unavailable to Jews and Black people during meetings or to visitors during exhibitions. This is not the original idea, but the new logic has caused quite a stir in the Jewish and Black community, who see this as an attack on their traditions and identity. Who knows what impact this may have on the city’s Jewish and Black population? If anything, this is a brilliant strategy to preserve the character of the buildings, to make them something different: something that is Jewish or Black specific, rather than the generic office or conference space of a major museum. This is what the Biennial has done in other places in the world, by using the character of the place as a tool to project its specific historical and cultural significance. For example, in New York, the Biennial has used the name of this area, and the historical relationship between the museum and the area, as a tool to project the city into becoming what the Biennial would like to be: a</text>

The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and owners, to create a landscape that is both physically and mentally different from the office and conference spaces. This is part of a wider project to rethink how heritage buildings are used. The idea is to create a ‘living room, a ‘kitchen, a living room’ where art and creative activities can take place, in contrast to the office and conference spaces that are predominantly used for administrative tasks. Future plans include the establishment of a ‘department store’ for art and cultural goods, and the establishment of a new cultural centre dedicated to the city’s arts and heritage.

The question of where to put heritage buildings in a city has recently come up in Liverpool. In an effort to preserve as much of the historic character as possible, the Biennial has decided to construct a series of new office and conference spaces in the city centre, in an area of the city called The Quarter. This is an area with a significant Jewish and Black community, who have traditionally held significant positions in the city. The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and owner-occupancy percentages, to create a shared heritage value chain. This is similar to how the New York Museum of Art has integrated its archives and its collections into its exhibitions, creating a new kind of biennale. 	Looking back at the history of the Biennial in the 1990s, Miriam Kramer, then curator of the Avent Museum, made a distinction between the traditional museum and the museum-like institution. As she said, ‘The traditional museum is interested in preserving its original form, while the museum-like institution wants to present its past in a way that people can connect with’. In other words, a biennial is interested in its own past, while a museum-like institution is interested in gathering people together to remember its past. In other words, what’s important about a biennial is what it creates within its present – what it can tell its readers about themselves and the world around them. This is a very powerful thing to be</text>

The Biennial has decided to break its office and conference spaces into smaller units, with different functions and ownership. These units will serve as exhibitionary platforms, separate from the main exhibitionary venue, the Liverpool Biennial, which will continue to occupy the historic site. This strategy is in direct contrast to the current strategy of breaking buildings into smaller pieces, usually in response to major urban transformations. The rationale for this latest break is that the smaller the building, the better the reflection of the city’s transformation. If the Biennial’s current strategy of breaking buildings into smaller pieces, with different functions and ownership, continues, then the office and conference spaces will be able to grow and change position, depending on the city’s needs and desires. This breaks the monolithic office and conference room form down to its constituent parts, allowing for the individualization of different parts and their interconnection. 	This new office and conference room structure will be called ‘Recreation Space’ and ‘Recreation Room B’ (the artist’s name has</text>

We see that the data-mining that characterises our times is being fuelled by the threat of terrorism, and we’re seeing the fruits of that in the demographic churn that young women and girls are forced to undertake as part of ‘reproductive capitalism’. But that doesn’t make the social. It’s the difference between ‘respectable’ men and ‘respectable’ women. It’s a distinction without a difference. When a woman is worn out and worn out, when she’s had enough, when she’s seen enough, and when she’s had enough, she either aborts or doesn’t take part in the reproductive process. She doesn’t choose to have children. She doesn’t choose to give birth. She doesn’t choose to breastfeed.

She doesn’t choose to expose a family to the elements. She doesn’t choose to work outside the home. All of these choices are available to anyone with access to a vehicle and the internet. What a luxury, what a commodity, what a humanity, when people can make those choices for themselves! So let’s look at an example from the Middle East. A few months ago, I was in the US for the Arab League meeting in New York. I was invited to take part in a symposium about art and activism in the Arab world. I chose to participate in the symposium, because I believe that the work I had been commissioned to do as part of the art commission for the pavilion at the Arab League meeting would have a significant impact on the issues of inclusion and inclusion in the Arab world.

She doesn’t choose to be a housewife. She doesn’t choose to be a mother. She doesn’t choose to be a housewife. All she can do is wait. 	Such choices are being force-fed to us by society, and we’re the victims. But what happens when those choices are overridden? 	When I was at Sewickley College in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we had a philosophy club. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we met in the chapel at Sewickley School of Art to discuss the meaning of life. We were both depressed, but at the same time we had different take on how to interpret what we were feeling. I was depressed because I couldn’t find anything worthwhile to do with my life; I was</text>

She doesn’t choose to partner with a local economy and community enterprise. She doesn’t choose to live by the sea. She doesn’t choose to bike. All these choices are characterised by the consumption of things, commodities, that in our cultural values are seen as essential. But in a world as connected as ours, what is seen as ‘natural’ has become objectified. And this is what we’re seeing today – the proliferation of gadgets, apps, social media, new media, and all the rest of it – just as we become more connected via fibre optic cables, satellites and the</text>

She doesn’t choose to shop for food or travel. She doesn’t choose to shop for cars or rent accommodation. She doesn’t choose to shop for travel or accommodation, preferring to travel alone or with a group of friends. Soon enough, we see that these are the kinds of choices women in patriarchal societies routinely make – and that these are the kinds of choices that inspire and enable the kind of hatred aimed at women worldwide.  One might ask: what if women could make these kinds of choices? Women could choose to travel independently or in small groups, or to have children out</text>

What does it mean when a woman is no longer a homemaking, nurturing being? When is the last time that a woman in that society took part in that process in a meaningful way? 	And what does it mean when a woman no longer has agency in that process? When does it cease to be a process? When does it become a threat? 	I ask these questions because, as we saw, the  	feminist movement in the 1980s and 1990s sought to create conditions in which women could achieve agency in their own right.

And we don’t even know that these replicas are being made in the name of science. We don’t know what those studies actually consist of.

All of those choices are bad for women, and yet men have absolute and utter control over them. Is that really what society wants? I don’t know. But I do know this: society has a huge amount of control over who gets born. And if that baby gets robbed of its birthright, or gets born somewhere else, and then society has to fix that, then that’s on us. And if that baby grows up to be an adult and then decides to leave home and start a family of her own, then we don’t have that baby in our care. Our society puts a lot of value on childhood, and if that baby decides to leave home and start a family of her own, then that’s on us.

But in the age of terrorism, in the age of quantified self, in the age of social media, in the age of ubiquitous data capture, in the age of economic commodification of everything, we are subjected to a different kind of oppression. We are subject to what Jürgen Habermas would call the circulation of forms of domination.[4] Which is to say, we are systematically and continuously influenced by the modes of transport, communication, entertainment, politics, food, sleep and</text>

So maybe what we can learn is this: when we hear a story about a girl being led to childbirth by her loving grandmother, maybe we can relate to her. Not in a sad way, but just in the way that she is. Perhaps we can learn something from her.  The other lesson is this: feminism is real. And as we all know, real progress comes through struggle. So maybe what we</text>

For instance, the way in which they captured the spirit of the community arts movement through Transmissions is interesting and powerful. The way that they depicted the history and development of the area through portraits and the narratives of individuals is a more contemporary and commercial move, and I wholeheartedly agree with Alice that a curatorial approach to art and artistic practices is essential for a cultural anthropology project to be credible. However, the way in which they depicted the city and its development through the portraits and the narratives of individuals is unique and rich. It captures the richness and depth of the area and its history, but also its subtle and global effects. It creates an entirely new context and paradigm in which artistic practices can operate. Curator-curator-artist-researcher-whatever. That is, artists can operate in a contemporary and commercial context, but also experiment in other creative ways.

I look forward to seeing what they do with that particular strand of community practice. 	Finally, I would like to thank Alice for allowing me to borrow Stagecoach from her office at UCL. It was a gift, and one that I will cherish dearly.I think that now more than ever, we need to learn to live together. We cannot be cordoned off from each other, let alone live in perpetual presentism. I hope that my presentation today, Building Blocks for Community Transformation , can serve as a starting point for further discussion and experimentation. I look forward to seeing you in September.DDownload this article as PDF28 September 2014To Osvaldo Sanchez25 November 2014Osvaldo SanchezMexico City, MexicoSan Francisco, California25 November 2014</text>

For instance, the way in which they captured the spirit of the community arts movement through The One Show was a valuable contribution to our understanding of community practices in the area. This was a somewhat opaque and submerged form of interaction between the artist and the community, in which the artist was able to inhabit the community and imbricate ideas and practices of the community in a way that was authentic to the locality. The fact that it was a public space and not an isolated practice may have made some difference in how people perceived the contribution. 	A third phase of our research may yet become manifest. It is the precondition for a city to embark on a revitalization process, and may well be the most relevant to the work of the area once urbanisation has occurred. At the very least, it should define the parameters of our research; otherwise, the city cannot reclaim what is rightfully its own. For instance, a city may decide to create a community development corporation, or DCC, to own and operate businesses in the area; this may or may not be in contravention</text>

For instance, the way in which they captured the spirit of the community arts movement through Projections in the Arts Unit at Universidad Di Tella, and the way that they are incorporating local traditions and magic into their projects is innovative and powerful, but it falls short of capturing the full richness of the movement. It is true that their projections in the Arts Unit at Universidad Di Tella are innovative and powerful, but they are at their best expressing the fragmented, fragmented way in which art is often experienced in the area. Art, as a concept, is malleable. It can be defined and defined as well as enumerated. 	The third phase of our research project may yet become manifest. It is the phase when art is created by those who neither grow nor work within the system, within which case, it is art by those who lack access to formal instruments or the means to produce artistic output on a large scale. This is the case for many other projects that we have supported or collaborated with, including those that emerged from the </text>

For instance, the way in which they captured the spirit of the community arts movement through Creative Time’s programme may not always sit well with residents and artists, but it does lend authenticity to claims that the city is rushing headlong into a crisis of poverty and injustice. In the end, art is supposed to be used for good and for the greater good. It is a blunt instrument, capable of causing pain and suffering as it unfolds across its numerous canvases. It is the ultimate in its set of contradictions, and art is meant to be used responsibly. As Eve says, ‘There is trauma in this city because of economic development.’ She goes on to explain that the Creative Time programme’s therapeutic function is twofold: firstly, to intervene in the pathologies of poverty and injustice; and, secondly, to enable those with disabilities to achieve their potential, through offering employment, healthcare and education opportunities. Creative Time was hugely influential in changing how the city was architected, and in disarming its critics, who were cast</text>

The third and final stage of our research project, on a much larger scale than we are proposing here, is the establishment of a Community Arts International (CAI) governing body. This will enable us to envision a future where Community Arts International (CAs) are established in every major metropolitan area in the world, and will permit us to propose and adopt local local template legislation for the development of such a body. For instance, the model code for a future CA might derive from the work of Stagecoach 2 artists, who themselves have their own unique and exciting local flavour infused into their work. 	There are numerous other factors that play into it, but these are the most fundamental.

For instance, the way in which they captured the spirit of the community arts movement through Community Arts International (CAI) was not by accident but has something to do with the historical associations and the deep roots of that movement. As far as I am concerned, the real artists of the neighbourhood are the local communities that have formed around them. That is, the Community Arts International (CAI) generation that I grew up with and the Community Arts movement that I am part of. The latter is in part a legacy of the former.  	Another aspect of the community arts movement that I should mention is the Concert Academy. This was probably the most significant and influential phase for me, as it allowed me to witness first-hand the influence that the Community Arts International (CAI) generation exerted on this movement. I was exposed to a new  	generation of artists as well as musicians who came out of the woodwork and into the arena, and it instilled in me a love of performing arts educationally as a means to engage and inspire</text>

Together, this would enable us to create an environment in which dialogue can take place, and which may well be more conducive to the perpetuation of such dialogue as a local artform. 	The second phase of our research project may yet become manifest. I will leave it to my colleague, Prof. Alice Eve, to elucidate this aspect. Regardless of what happens in the public sphere, local people are artists, and their work is always bound up with the fate of communities. In this regard, they are the true artists of the area. They are the curators of their own imaginaries, which in turn shape the city around them. I feel that Alice and her team have done an admirable job in capturing the spirit of the area, though perhaps there are elements of their project that could be refined and expanded upon. For instance, the way in which they captured the spirit of the community arts movement through St Vincent’s Day may not entirely represent the ethos and spirit of the community arts movement today, and may in fact be actively at odds with it. In the 1970s and 80s, artistic practices were historically paired with social agencies, and today they are seen as a necessity alongside other social services, especially in deprived areas. The fact that community art is often seen as an art form that is inherently anti-social is largely a product of the fact that such practices are seen as a threat to the capitalist system and often times, a prime suspect. Indeed, Eve’s research project may have inadvertently ushered the art world into a reactive mode, where the need to speculate about the nature of community art becomes paramount. 	However, this reactive mode must be circumscribed in order to permit a deeper understanding of the conditions that foster and foster-  such creativity. The creative forces driving such creative action are those very factors that enable us to grasp the notion of value and possibilities inherent</text>

For instance, the way in which they captured the spirit of the community arts movement through Community Arts International (CAI) was an improvement over the old days when the emphasis was more on maintenance and on preserving the image of the area as a stable and valuable asset to the city. However, there are still deep-seated cultural differences between the two organisations, and it is this element of deep-seated ideological differences and hostility that runs rampant in the area today. Community Arts International is a far more progressive organisation, while CAI is more conservative, and their approaches to the arts were much more institutionalised. And there are many other examples of progressive and progressive-minded organisations operating in the same city, operating alongside conservative and reactionary organisations, and in many cases operating alongside community organisers. CAI was founded in 1906, long before the term 'community' was even coined. It was originally a local branch of the American Community Land Trusts Association, which at this point was also an international civil rights and activist organisation. In fact, CAI was originally founded as a</text>

Perhaps this is an area of responsibility that the Biennial bears in mind when contemplating projects in and around Montréal. The fact that these were projects that were initiated and directed by the local artists and curators, as well as the journalists and critics who covered the area, is a positive development for the local artforum and the local artworld as a whole. 	The third and final phase of our research may yet become manifest. It is the phase in which the biennials themselves become visible, and in which the influence of the region they inhabit is felt most acutely. This may involve research projects on the ground, or it may involve visiting the biennials themselves, and being invited inside their facilities.

The term had entered not just the vernacular, but also mainstream culture, and its acceptance was as much a result of events such as the Liverpool Biennial opening and the installation of a series of murals in predominantly urban areas around the city, as it was of the city’s 2015 Biennial itself. The emergence, too, of a new kind of ‘community’ that was both artist-led and responsive to the needs and interests of the local community seemed in some ways apropos.  At the same time, the emergence, too, of a new kind of ‘community board’ – a body of artists, designers, artists and other stakeholders who could shape the course of a city’s development – seemed essential in any attempt to foresee the kind of development that would be possible through the adoption of sustainable development as a way of life.  So what is an Arts Council? And what kinds of capacities do they bestow?  The role of the Arts Council in my view should be multidimensional, but in order to achieve truly transformative effects, it is imperative that the arts be supported in all aspects of society.

The term had entered not just the vernacular, but also mainstream culture, and its acceptance was as much a result of events such as the Liverpool Biennial opening and the installation of a Damien Hirst portrait in the borough of Westminster, as it was of the introduction of the vernacular to art criticism. The popularisation of the concept is a good thing, but the fact that concepts are created (at least in part) by, and through, the actions of, artists, and their audiences is precisely why biennials have survived for so long, at least in part, because the cultural actions of millions of people are collectively absorbed in the collective acts of artmaking that follow.  Creators and their audiences have always been at the heart of artistic and artistic-regenerative processes, but the ubiquity, global reach and transnational character of the contemporary artist-centered biennial make it increasingly challenging to imagine and to inhabit any other kind of artform, to perceive cultural diversity, to connect with other people’s cultural experiences, to encounter new ideas and approaches and to really know and feel like an artist and your audiences are artists too.  </text>

The term had entered not just the vernacular, but also mainstream culture, and its acceptance was as much a result of events such as the Liverpool Biennial opening and the installation of a mural in the City Gallery that same year, alongside other public acts such as the re-enactment of the Battle of Cable Street alongside artists Joshua Rose and Dominic Willsdon, and the installation of a wooden statue of John Lennon among other acts of public engagement. Even the Duchess of Cambridge was seen taking part in some of the activities of the day. It was during these years that the concept of the community artist was actively interrogated, and it’s now generally agreed that the early twentieth century was a golden age for such work, a period when the public sphere was actively encouraged and understood. However, as biennials and later museum collections have grown in number and variety, so too has the questioning of artist-centred practices and curatorial inclinations, and it is this current of questioning that is increasingly being seen as a hindrance to the promotion of creativity within the contemporary artworld. In the main, contemporary art is often accused of being ultra-modern and ap</text>

The ubiquity of the concept in biennial texts and catalogue illustrations is testimony to the fact that they were there first and foremost to entertain visitors, and that their subsequent thinking on art and community was pre-empted by the impulse to produce a work of art through a museum or an arts institution.  But despite the museum and arts establishment’s efforts to project their collections and collections management practices onto the local art worlds that were the result of their support for the Biennial, the increased public engagement with the art form through the biennial as a whole was pre-empted by the desire to produce a work of art through the biennial.  This impulse to produce a work of art through the biennial was a pre-consequence of the increasing commodification of art worldwide, and it remains to this day the case that the major museum chains are drawn to the proximity of</text>

The term had entered not just the vernacular, but also mainstream culture, and its acceptance was as much a result of events such as the Liverpool Biennial opening and the installation of a fixed sculpture of a crucified Jesus, as it was of the introduction of poetry, photography and games into the arts curriculum. Such an expansive (and ultimately successful) interpretation of ‘Community Arts?’ seems inappropriate to this article, but it is useful in bringing to life a few of the ideas that were already circulating inside the biennial circuit at the time.  In the weeks and months that followed, artists and arts organisations gathered in Bristol, Liverpool, Doha, Toronto, Berlin and elsewhere to network and strategise. Our city was on the cusp of being selected for a future ‘World Community Arts?’ conference, and the emerging international community was being encouraged to get involved.  Local artists and arts organisations were being encouraged to experiment with creative ways of engaging local audiences in art-making through online media and traditional arts-supported educational models, as well as innovative ways of bringing social practices into the mix.  The language of community engagement is far more powerful</text>

The acceptance of ‘community’ in a broad sense seems to have become an essential part of the contemporary urbanisation process, and not just an effect of diffusion and globalisation.  How we define and frame our urban spaces is a watershed event that, as a culture, has profound effects on our conception of who is included and who is excluded from cities. It becomes evident that the inhabitants of a particular neighbourhood, or even a neighbourhood district, are no longer the dominant or even the proximal inhabitants of the area; new trade routes and modes of movement are generated, and existing tourism is often cited as a factor in these new modes of economic formation. It is here that the need for active and responsive urban stakeholders, including communities, comes into being. While the priorities of the developing nation�</text>

While the biennial may have begun as a curatorial device, its eventual (though controversial) installation of a public art project appears to have intervened as a curatorial device itself. It is easy to understand the impulse to introduce a new concept, new practice, and new aesthetic to a city in the service of an aestheticisation of the city. But introducing a curatorial tool into the service of an aestheticisation of the city is an act of war. It is an act of aggression against the very notion of the city as a place where art should be produced and celebrated. The introduction of such a concept as a curatorial device into the service of an aestheticisation of a city, however, is a convenient pretext for the art to be produced and the aestheticisation of the city propagated at an ever-expanding scale.

The ubiquity of the concept and the aesthetic of community art soon spread to other parts of the UK and abroad, and today, almost everyone who works in the arts is either employed by the arts council or works for an art organisation in some capacity.  	But despite the apparent popularity of the term and its associated aesthetic, there is still a great deal of disagreement about what is and is not considered part of a community. The aim of the Biennial was to engage with art from a broad range of cultural contexts, and thus artworks located in one context may be seen as part of a community that surrounds them. But what is considered part of a community? And who is considered part of a community? There are of course many different ways of measuring community, but the key to understanding how people are connected is to understand how much of the society is</text>

It was at this moment, however, that the concept of community art first came to be heavily criticised, and it is this that creates the tension between art forms and communities. For some, it is an inherently oppressive and exclusionary concept, and it is for this reason that many curators and art historians, including myself, have abandoned the field completely in recent decades. However, the very fact that art is expected to be produced outside of the prevailing social norms and paradigms does not negate the importance of what artists and art-historians call ‘community&quot;.[8] When the term was first coined, its precise definition was unclear, but the more we questioned and considered the nature of community activity, the more we realised how difficult it is to quantify. Is it just a set of practices, or does it actually refer to a collective action</text>

The term had entered not just the vernacular, but also mainstream culture, and its acceptance was as much a result of events such as the Liverpool Biennial opening and the installation of a mural by Scottish artist Adam Connolly on the home of the city’s art historian Keith McClelland, as it was of the introduction of new media such as social media. Adam Connolly’s work, ‘Get Lucky’, utilised the hashtag to engage with the city’s infrastructure and social problems, framing the challenge as a return to the intrinsic worth of individuals and communities. In such a way, the artist’s statement – a re-telling of a story that involves no government – is both a creation and a symptom of the political predicament of the UK right now. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the introduction of such a concept into the arts world would only empower such a politics. It would also invite very real conflict and hostility towards many of those who use the arts as a vehicle to express political ideologies and perpetuate racial and socio-economic inequalities, exploitation and oppression.

It is a format that relies on the fidelity of image production, as well as the scalability of image processing and storage. It offers significant flexibility in the deployment of resources and in the use of images, making it possible to simultaneously deploy images in a variety of contexts, at multiple scales, and in multiple languages. It is a crucial intermediate step between photographic still photography and digital still photography, allowing the former to render the urban environment into a digital image, while simultaneously addressing the urban controversy posed by the latter. The present exhibition was produced with the latter in mind. The various photographers and artists participating in the exhibition were obliged to engage with and contribute to the discourse on the structure and function of urban space, in a wide range of media, across multiple platforms and media formats. Their images and videos were distributed across various websites, social media platforms, and forums, with varying degrees of critical intent.

The biennial format has long been a critical tool for the production of images that are contested, provoking and diffuse. It enables the production of grievance and conflict through the production of images that are hyperlocal and hyperpartisan. It is a format that relies on the artist and the audience to undertake the difficult but essential task of negotiating the prevailing order of things, constructing spaces that are not predetermined, and organising the world according to the imagined map of the planet. A version of this view was expressed in the 1968 Monuments to a Movement – a project that merged the Museum of Modern Art’s Monuments to a Movement with the Museum of Modern Art’s Monuments to a People series. In 1969, Walter Benjamin developed his ‘surviving ideas of contemporaneity’ and applied them to the post-modern condition. This led to the project that is now being repeated across North and Latin America, Europe and Asia. It is a form that is evolving, and its adherents will follow, but the main thrust of the narrative of this narrative is being written by and for a white, middle-class, urban elite.  So, there is a difference between the narrative of experience provided by the museum and that provided by biennials.</text>

It enables the production of grievance and conflict through the production of images that are hyperlocal and hyperpartisan. It is a format that relies on the production of images that are not taken, nor seen, nor imagined, and that alter perceptions and the situations in which they take place. It is a displacement of images, images that have meaning and that create a different kind of experience from those of museums or other institutional collections. It is a deployment of cultural capital and social processes that are determined by the imperialist logic of representation and globalisation.[3]There are many other ways to conceive of the biennial as a cultural production, and at times a geo-politically engaged form of cultural circulation. For instance, the Museum of Modern Art’s MOMA Program (2003–2009) was a year-round, multi-disciplinary, multi-use art and art-related event, including a major exhibition of works by artists from various fields of art, a major workshop for the MOMA Program, a major exhibition of MOMA art, a MOMA exhibition of contemporary art, and a MOMA/MOM</text>

It enables the production of grievance and conflict through the production of images that are hyperlocal and hyperpartisan. It is a format that relies on the production of images that are persistent, durable and geopolitically ambiguous. It enables the production of images that can be repurposed and reconfigurable. It enables the production of images that can be digitised and aggregated across multiple platforms and devices. And it enables the production of images that can be pooled and delivered across many cities and regions. But most of all it enables the production of images that can persist in space and permeate time. Presenting his 20th Biennale of Sydney, Artistic Director of the Australian Centre Nina Edge said: ‘We are confronting these images today as a society and we are the inhabitants of these images. We are the users of these images, and we are the inheritors of these images.’[4]  Conclusion: Towards a Critique of the Contemporary Condition  Conclusion: 	In this volume we have sought to identify some of the artefacts of a bygone age – the curiosities, mythological</text>

It also depends on the museum as an organic whole, and through this whole, the biennial as an ongoing production. 	These conditions create the possibility of imagining a place or a scene that is not confined by the rigid, boxlike condition of the museum or the biennial. In the case of a museum or biennial, the space and its contents emerge out of the dynamic relations between curator and museum audience. Curators, visitors, artists and other interested parties convene at the museum or biennial with varying agendas and expectations. Sometimes the audience is expected to sit through lectures or take part in activities that are curatorial in nature, such as visiting galleries, visiting historical sites or even just having a wander around the museum. In this sense, the exhibitionary character of the biennial can be seen as a production of the museum. 	Artists, curators, collectors and other interested parties form a mutually reinforcing</text>

The aim of the project was to investigate how the contemporary development of communications infrastructure could be adapted to accommodate the production of high-resolution images of actual places and scenes, at a scale sufficient to enable a human architect to envisage a fully realized version of the spatial relations between people and places. The project was also directed by and co-constituted by the Museum of Modern Art’s MOMA Program, which is a division of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. These two divisions jointly administer the MOMA program, which offers funding and education opportunities to museums worldwide to support the ongoing production and presentation of permanent exhibition collections that are informed and contested within the context of the museum. The biennial format has long been a critical tool for the production of images that are contested, provoking and diffuse. It enables the production of grievance and conflict through the production of images that are hyperlocal and hyperpartisan. It is a format that relies on the production of images, images that circulate widely in order to support a credible image of events or places that are not immediately present in a photographic memory. This production of images is what is called the ‘image crisis’ that is routinely reproduced in popular media and popular art today.1 	The failure to anticipate the image crisis in the 1980s meant that images of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the dismantling of Cern became the basis for protesting images, as well as the basis for the theoretical construction of new spatialities and hypermedia relations of power and control. The introduction of nuclear power and the widespread deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe in the wake of the reactor buildings in Chernobyl and at Chernikovsky in the far north meant that these issues were no longer abstractions, but became matters of political and social power. The introduction of images of such sites into the urban environment (but not necessarily the sub-urban or rural) politicized the practice of image making and politicized the</text>

The biennial format has long been a critical tool for the production of images that are contested, provoking and diffuse. It enables the production of grievance and conflict through the production of images that are hyperlocal and hyperpartisan. It is a format that relies on the artist as a maker rather than the museum, and thus relies on the latter for the infrastructure that supports the artist’s political, economic and aesthetic projects. It is a specificity of the biennial form that demands that artists and artists-organisations’ establish and maintain local networks of audiences outside the museum, and thus the biennial as a production and occasion requires that it establish and maintain local audiences. This is particularly true for works that are works that take place in and are products of ‘the real’, urban environments and ‘regeneration’. The producers of the biennial must therefore choose among many different kinds of audiences, and must cater to diverse kinds of people: cultural, economic, spatial, sexual, ethno-politically diverse and finally ethnic and racialised.

The biennial format has long been a critical tool for the production of images that are contested, provoking and diffuse. It enables the production of grievance and conflict through the production of images that are hyperlocal and hyperpartisan. It is a format that relies on the museum as the site of contention, and the tribunal as the site of mediation. It is a criticality that is deeply resisted. But the biennial format is here to stay, and its proliferation and proliferation-a-day must be stopped. It is destroying the very fabric of the contemporary contemporary art world. But what can be done? This is the question that the Biennale Board, led by Peter Schjeldahl, sought to answer in their report to the Venice Biennale Board in 2013. The Board found themselves confronted with the task of regenerating the biennale, which had been hobbled by the weight of so many projects, the pressures of a globalized industry, and the weight of an increasingly urbanizing city. And so they voted to continue, albeit slowly, with Schjeldahl as director. They found themselves faced with the task of finding a way to work with the Biennale as a multi-year, multi-edition project, and Schje</text>

The biennial format has long been a critical tool for the production of images that are contested, provoking and diffuse. It enables the production of grievance and conflict through the production of images that are hyperlocal and hyperpartisan. It is a format that relies on the trustworthiness of images, images of everyday life and images of cultural artefacts. It is a format that is generating images of everyday life in ways that are not socially acceptable. This is not to suggest that images today are created equal. On the contrary, the production of images today is complex, uneven, precarious and contradictory. But the production of images of everyday life, images of culture, cultural goods and images of cultural products should be possible through research-intensive, cross-disciplinary and transparent means. Such images would tell the story of culture in a contested space, making the images publicly available and making them visible within contested social media platforms, alongside images of cultural events, artefacts of cultural conflict and cultural products. Such images would be produced in a contested society.  Such images would demand a contested social space. How images are made, who makes them and with whom they are made is what makes contemporary art unprecedented. It is what makes it contemporary. This is why contemporary art is ever-changing</text>

It is a format that relies on the museum as the site of persistent, persistent conflict. It is a criticality that is rarely recognised or appreciated by the museums and art institutions that produce these images, and by extension, the biennial as a form of art production.The Biennial as a PostscriptOn the occasion of its centenary in 2018, the biennial format is set to undergo a radical change. The key concepts and tropes of the biennial will remain the same, but the production will be led by artists who will have distinctive artworks that are representative of a given time and place. This will be accomplished through a series of commissions hosted in specially commissioned museums and institutions around the world, which will in turn produce independent annotations and reflections based on their respective collections. The annotations and reflections will function as a kind of postscript for the exhibition, responding to the cultural terrain and politics of the biennial format as a whole. This is anticipated to include a revision of the postscript for the exhibition – an epilogue –</text>
