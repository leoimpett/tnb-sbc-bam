The project began in 2004 when the artists who worked on the project, as well as the curators and artists who came after, selected 300 local people from the arts and crafts workforce to be artists in the space. The project was co-ordinated by the Biennial, the trade organisation representing the arts professionals, with the Museum of Contemporary Art in London, and the Royal College of Art in New York. The selected people worked in pairs, teams or small groups or in small private or public parties over several years to develop a vision for the ‘public sphere’ of the arts, including the role of the artist, the organisation and the community. In its initial phase, the project invited artists to develop a new engagement with the urban environment, using reclaimed or salvaged materials and creative approaches to artwork. Eventually, the artists, designers and organisations involved in the project moved on to other projects, or retired. We can learn a lot about the role of the artist in the social context through the account of</text>

The project began in 2004 with the objective to view contemporary art as a production across social and economic inequalities. Our project board now includes artists, curators, artists' groups and arts professionals from across the UK and internationally. Over the years, we have continued to expand our project beyond the confines of the city, exploring the significant role artists have in imagining possibilities for the future of artistic activity through research, analysis, poetry and art projects. We have also recruited artists from outside the region to contribute to our future research projects. While many of the artists we have invited to contribute to this periodical are already artists or artist-in-residence in an arts school or organisation, many are not and so this journal takes the view that the key to unlocking artistic potential lies in engaging artists and organisations with whom the area has a shared engagement strategy.

The project began in 2006 as a research project at Goldsmiths, London, and Chichester, UK, and has been a long-term, multifaceted project that has included visits to several European capitals, the USA, and Japan. In the last year, we visited Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Berlin. These are just some of the cities where the project has been staged and where art and craft fairs, and other cultural activities, have taken place. In these locations, we have met with major art fair organisers, curated by the Liverpool Biennial, in an attempt to draw attention to the region and the city. We have also worked with local non-profit arts organisations, whose activities have been documented in a book published by the Liverpool Biennial in 2015 entitled Local Organisations in Arts and Culture. Art and craft fairs, and the self-organisation that can result from such trade, are powerful enablers of collective imaginings, which in turn fuel creativity and the</text>

The project began as a project for the exhibition  	Viewpoint, Liverpool Biennial 2017, at the Mehrgarh and Aspen Museum, which featured works in the exhibition by Sello Peso, M'King Kunta, King Kunta and others from the area. The project then evolved into a full-scale project, which saw artists taking the project on the road, creating community projects and engaging with community members and supporters via community forums and events. The project continues to be a local project, taking place in and around Anfield, and art is a critical component of this. As part of the Public Art reception in Aspen, art was a critical part of the exhibition setting, with over 50 works from the exhibition on view in the venue. There were also over 200 works created or co-opted from various sources, including online sources, that were used in the production of the programme itself, which was then collated and published in several local and national newspapers including The New York Times.</text>

The project began in 2006 with the publication of a journal entry, titled ‘Viewpoints: Views from the Artists’ Communal Meetings’ organised by the Liverpool Biennial, in which the group discussed their experiences as artists and connected the events to wider social and political themes of the period. Eight essays were included in the publication, which was then pieced together from various interviews and collection of artefacts. The project is now published in order toiling away in a small underground publishing house in Liverpool. 	While the journal entry may not represent the totality of the group’s thinking or even the real thrust of their thinking, the growing body of research on the communicative potential of art as a political tool, its incorporation into the political landscape as a whole, and the implications for contemporary art’s place in society, is a strong statement that the artist provocations of the collective and the political purpose of art as a socially productive art form, not least through their journal entries, have</text>

The project began when architecturally-oriented s/k Project Viewpoint (a division of Merseytravel Ltd) commissioned architects and landscape architects to design cultural initiatives for the site of the forthcoming Mersey Ferry Terminal, within sight of the airport. The proposals were received with much anticipation and much criticism, with many artists and creative professionals, myself among them, voicing strong reservations about the proposals. Creative dissents included Damien Barratt (Glasgow-based artist), who argued that the project was ‘a cynical ploy by a small clique of mega-corporations to seize a piece of the rapidly depleting maritime industry’, while Gloria Anspach (Co-founder of Liverpool Biennial), who felt that the project was ‘a cynical attempt to cash in on the megastructure that is being built in Liverpool’, by creating a ‘band-aid’ to prevent or cool the ‘epidemic’ of HIV/AIDS that was sweeping</text>

Since the project began, its focus has shifted, and at times the analysis has been critical. In the summer of 2012, I curated a series of performances, ‘Stages’ of what was at first a ‘show for stages’. The performances opened to the public as a kind of ‘sting project’ – a kind of invitation to come to ‘the show’, a kind of observation and critique. The performance, ‘Stage 4: Montevideo’s Edge’, an intimate ‘walk-through’ of the edge of the city, took place in Montevideo, Uruguay, in December 2012. The Stage 4</text>

The project began with an intensive survey of the history of art and craft in the Liverpool area, examining how our cultural practices of the past influenced what we perceive as contemporary art today. The survey took place in phases: the first phase examined art production in the area (following the closure of a number of venues due to closure), whilst the second examined the role of artists in the area (through the provision of artistic education programmes) and the wider cultural sector (through the provision of arts education materials and funds). The project then turned to looking ahead, to the future, focussing on the ways in which art and craft could be supported by the arts and creative professions, taking the results of the first two phases as a starting point. In the coming years, the project would like to see Arts Council funding allocated specifically for the establishment of a Centre for Creative Studies at the heart of the arts and crafts industry in the city.

The project began as a concept project in the context of the Arts Council of Great Britain, then expanded to the wider Arts Council of Australia and the Arts Council of Canada. The focus of the project has shifted from the UK to locations in Canada, the USA and China. The project has been featured in numerous periodical and periodical-type publications, catalogues, monographs and journals, has received national and international recognition, and has been featured in exhibitions and was a keynote lecture at the Venice Biennale. 	[[207]] 	The s/k project continues to be a turning point in the development of the local arts and crafts scene, and a model for future projects. The shift has come about as a result of the emergence of new media and social media, which allowed people to participate in transformative ways through which new arts and crafts could be produced, delivered and learnt (see Community Arts?

The project began as a way to engage with notions of community engagement, but has since moved onto broader questions of democratic participation. In the intervening years, several artists, curators, artists' unions, community organisers and arts organisations have formed an Arts Council to oversee the project and oversee its evolution. Art is not always involved in the making of art; sometimes the works produced by the artist are used by other organisations; and at other times the organisation that produced the work is unaware or neutral (like the Chisenhale Ruiz Foundation, which produced Mark Maurette's work The Communal, in which the Association of Arts Administrators (AA) was unaware of the significance of its role). 	In the Community Arts context, knowledge and inclusion are generated through mutual trust and respect. In the arts' case, this can be seen in the work of many artists who have emerged through the various programmes of the Arts Council (despite the fact that their audiences may not necessarily</text>

The country’s first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi is grappling with the transition from the military to civilian government, and is facing questions about whether the mass protests that brought down Hosni Mubarak were created by the state to install a Muslim Brotherhood government, or whether they are an elaborate farce perpetrated by opposition activists. In Turkey, the violent anti-government protests that began in 2015 are still unfolding, and question marks are being cast over whether the anti-elitism campaign undertaken by the military and police during the height of the crisis of the 2014 Istanbul Biennale is an appropriate response to the ongoing anti-</text>

Many commentators have suggested that the election of Widodo as president could be seen as a ‘rebellion’ against neoliberalism, and may well be an attempt to undo some of the damage done by the economic crisis and geopolitical tensions that followed the Arab Spring. 	[6] However, there is compelling evidence that supports the notion that Widodo is merely trying to reverse some of the damage done by the economic crisis and geopolitical tensions that have resulted from the process of economic globalization. It is said that during Widodo’s first year in office, Indonesia experienced a GDP growth rate of 6.5 per cent, better than many Western economies. And although Indonesia has a sizeable Muslim population, the rate of growth for Indonesia's overall population was only 3 per cent. 	[7] Moreover, while Indonesia has very high literacy rates, a significant share of the population still lack access to formal education.

So, too, in 2011, when Occupy started in Zuccotti Park in Manhattan, when the financial crisis did the rounds in other parts of the country, when the financial crisis hit in Greece, when it reached the Arab Spring in 2011, when the Arab Spring began in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo, and then spread to other cities in Egypt and Tunisia. 	[7] And, now, in the 2015 Istanbul Biennale, a number of artists have been invited to create interpretive works around the city’s financial crisis and ensuing political instability.

Many commentators have suggested that the election of Widodo as prime minister may have also played a part in the terrorist attacks of 9/11. 	[6] And,  	perhaps more importantly, the state is often accused of failing to do enough to stop such attacks. A report by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 2002 highlighted numerous instances in which the U.S. government had failed to prosecute individuals alleged to have carried out terrorist attacks in the U.S. or abroad. The report specifically cited the Department of Justice and the Central Intelligence Agency, among other federal agencies.13 While it is true that the Senate Committee did not recommend prosecuting individuals, it is also true that the administration did not carry out a prosecution. In fact, as the Committee noted, there was no evidence of any prosecutions at the time.14 And,  	given the prominence of the Saudi Arabia in the U.S. media during this time, it is reasonable to infer that the administration also did not promote or assist in</text>

[5] This is the case in a number of Muslim-majority countries, where the state is frequently accused of failing to protect its citizens from violent extremism. A prime example is Indonesia, where violent anti-Muslim rhetoric has split the country along racial and religious lines during recent elections. The election of Muhammad Joko Widodo as president of Indonesia marked the beginning of a process that has seen him elected on a platform of anti-Islamism and anti-globalisation. Many commentators have suggested that the election of Widodo as president could be seen as a prelude to a ‘Muslim’ wave in Indonesia, where the first Islamic law is being enacted. 	[6] The Atlantic Monthly ran a 2015 cover story titled ‘The Enduring Crisis of Western Democracies’, in which writer-editorialist Margaret Carlson explores the ideas behind the issue and her subject of 2014, following the terrorist attacks in Paris. Carlson considers the ways in which the threat posed by radical Islam is conceptualised in Western democratic constitutions, and how much of the blame for this threat lies with governments and non-state actors such as militant Islamists. Islamic law is not a fully realized system of governance in most Western democracies, but governments and non-state actors are widely assumed to have the capacity to impose and enforce Islamic law, and this has consequences that are neither simple nor fixed, she writes.

[6] These ideas were further fuelled by the ascendance of the niqab during the election, which many interpreted as a sign that Islam is back, or that ‘there is no God but Allah’. In the popular phrase, ‘just say something, don’t say nothing’, this has been seen as a signal that there is a place for language in public discourse and that public figures, including politicians, should at least speak the truth to power.

These elements of the globalised economy have become embedded in the very infrastructures that we speak, read, cycle through, take to the beach and play football in. But they do not exist in a vacuum or without context or power. The infrastructural system we have become reliant on is impacted by the things that shock us – disasters, war, climate change, natural disasters, etc. – and it is these things that create the space and time for art to flourish, for us to live our lives according to our values and desires, and thus, ultimately, for art to be made.Infrastructures are made up of people, and as such, have certain capacities and capabilities that we must constrain and control. But they also have certain constitutive capacities that allow us to set in motion different forms of action, making possible, for example, ‘infrastructures’ that address the needs of an ever-expanding and complex public sector, or ‘infrastructures’ that exclusively serve the interests of a few financial firms, or ‘infrastructures’ that exclusively serve the interests of a handful of mega-regions.</text>

These elements of the globalised economy have become embedded in the very infrastructures that we speak, read, cycle through, take to the beach and play football in. But they do not exist in isolation or in the distant past. Rather, what makes these infrastructures contemporary is that they are constantly (deep down) influenced by the infrastructural dynamic that is the result of the urbanization and globalisation drive that began in the 1980s. A policy of infrastructure construction is a policy of influence, and the infrastructural current that results from it is a policy of implementation.Infrastructural policies have become so embedded in our lives that we have to be careful not to step outside of the system we have been trained to be part of. This is why new technologies and innovations have to be carefully considered in the context of their socio-political impacts. They do not exist in isolation or in the distant past. Rather, what makes them contemporary is that they are the result of interactions with other cultural forms and with humankind on a global scale.

Art, as an element of this larger whole, should be able to observe and probe these systems that enable, create and facilitate capitalism.  	Art has a pivotal role to play in resisting and exposing the infrastructural landscape of contemporary global capitalism. Because it is part of the infrastructure of the global economy, it is imbued with the necessary language, physics, economics and geology to map real-world location to social conditions that are specific to the particular artifice that generates the value generated by the global economy. It should be possible to ‘identify’ such socio-political conditions and social formations through such elements of infrastructure as a road, a port, a city, a ‘stationary’ structure, a ‘stationary’ object and a set of ‘consequences’.

These elements of the globalised economy have become embedded in the very infrastructures that we speak, read, cycle through, take to the beach and play football in. But they do not exist in a vacuum. They need to be interrogated and constructed from the ground up.Art has often been equated with infrastructure, or perhaps it is the case that infrastructure is more accurately thought of as infrastructuralised culture. However, there is a difference between art and infrastructure. Infrastructure is often used synonymously, but its precise nature and its reliance on capital make it a different kind of infrastructure. Infrastructure is the kind of infrastructure that creates, supports and accompanies (infrastructures) contemporary capitalism. Infrastructure capitalism depends on codes, regulations, maps, regulations, rules and regulations. It depends on the infrastructures of today that can be digitised and replaced. Furthermore, it depends on the modes of cultural consumption today that are no longer based on traditional religious or national identities. Culture infrastructure is the infrastructure of the contemporary global economy today. It is the social and political formation of this infrastructure in the age of the biennial.Infrastructures are the objects of their own modern</text>

These elements of the globalised economy have become embedded in the very infrastructures that we speak, read, cycle through, take to the beach and play football in. But they do not exist in a vacuum; they must be negotiated and negotiated. And this demands that we invest in educating ourselves in the ways in which infrastructure is constructed, created and constituting inextricable parts of the capitalist accumulation. This requires that we constantly question what kinds of politics and economics are transpiring in the world – and not in the ways in which we might wish to intervene in them. Such an approach to the built environment would render infrastructure obsolete and make a lot of people very rich indeed.Infrastructures are the objects of a political and economic construction that is no longer based on the relations of exchange of commodities, but on the relations of domination between nations, economic categories and nations. And it is this dynamic that we must confront in order to liberate ourselves from their problematic aspects and in fact all forms of capitalist society. For the object of infrastructure is no longer the thing that serves as a boundary between people, but rather the very basis of what people can and cannot do. This has been true since</text>

These elements of the globalised economy have become embedded in the very infrastructures that we speak, read, cycle through, take to the beach and play football in. But they do not exist in a vacuum; they must be negotiated. That is, dialogue is required between citizen and infrastructuralist to enable the production of infrastructure that is responsive to the needs of the people.2. The infrastructural dynamic is characterised by capital's relentless pursuit of exigencies – expanding at all costs, no matter how unsustainable the consequences to humanity. What kinds of modes of capital accumulation can we identify? How do the infrastructural dynamic and its stakeholders engage with its contradictions and carve out possible future trajectories? What kinds of capacities do they have to shape the future – positively and negatively?Infrastructural developments in advanced capitalist nations are characterised by neoliberal capitalism – the neoliberal era began in the US and in large parts of Europe. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was marked by several important cultural and economic shifts that shifted the balance of global cultural power in favour of a post-Fordist logic of increasing productivity and profitability. These included the technological revolution,</text>

It is this ongoing ecological feedback loop that creates the infrastructure of infrastructure – the political, economic and legal underpinning of global capitalist flow – and this is what art can/cannot do.Infrastructures are made up of many different kinds of infrastructures – infrastructures as in ‘infrastructure’, non-profit organisations (NPOs), mutuals (or non-profit worker-owned cooperative) and so on. The word ‘infrastructure’ has several senses – both namerule and figurative – and today includes not only commercial but also non-profit organisations, NPOs and other infrastructure companies. And although the biennale is often cited as an example of infrastructure, there is another kind of infrastructure that the biennale can and should inquire into and critique – the social infrastructure of communities.Infrastructures are made</text>

But they do not exist in a vacuum; they must be confronted and disrupted in order to create new possibilities and new worlds.Infrastructures are the objects of surveillance, the making and supporting of which is part of a larger system that makes possible (in theory) the future labour of ever greater numbers of people. The infrastructural turn of the century saw a massive expansion of science and engineering, which in turn generated enormous numbers of jobs. The turn of the century also saw a rapid increase in population: the industrial frontier was created in short order. But as population grew and contracts, so too do the health and welfare of workers and communities. Rapid growth and contraction of populations also happen in the core of the capitalist economy. The metainterality of the global capitalist economy requires that commodities meet needs – needs that shift according to market forces and trends. So the production of ever more powerful and more versatile ways of existing in ever greater abundance is part of the system that churns on. It is a work in</text>

These elements of the globalised economy have become embedded in the very infrastructures that we speak, read, cycle through, take to the beach and play football in. But they do not exist in isolation. They are embedded in a globalised capitalist socio-linguistic system that actively engages with and depends on them. The infrastructural and its infrastructure inevitably engage with and produce contemporary art in ways that are dependent on the specific infrastructural system that it is built upon. What artists create in and through these infrastructural systems inevitably enters and circulates in and through artworlds and the cultural sector, and the wider global economy. And although this ‘infrastructure’ may or may not be built upon, it is often built on the back of low and mid-income countries’s poor.Infrastructures are typically conceptualised as needing generalisations about the world in order to function. But the infrastructural that creates and supports modernity is an entirely different kind of infrastructural. It is a low-grade, low-tech construct that requires little human interaction and almost no knowledge of the world beyond its location, owners</text>

In this context, Poileau’s work is seen not so much as a kind of urban myth, a collection of anecdotes, but rather as the structural framework of a globalised capitalist society. And since there is no object without thought or sense of being constituted by such a society, then ‘nondescript elements of the urban fabric, such as plazas, shopping malls, stadiums, park-and-ride lots, parks and so forth, are tools with which to understand and manage such a society’s infrastructure, including its codes and regulatory regimes.

But while museums and galleries may be entering into a ‘regeneration’ process, the magic of the present is being replaced by a more technocratic, ‘regeneration’ that is more easily understood by those who inhabit the defined frontiers of globalised capitalism.The Biennale as EventThe biennale has a very specific and curatorial function in the modern biennial context. It is a ‘time of history, ‘a place where the past can be found and left behind, where questions of place can be asked and answers given, where imagination can take flight’.3  Well, this was true of the Venice Biennale as early as the fifteenth century, when Giacomo Beccaria, Giacomo Agambenotti, and company assembled in Venice every four years.

In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of recognising historical value. But contemporary art today is almost always accused of being postmodern and in need of a fundamental reorientation of priorities. A biennial's real or perceived value today is almost always affected by external factors, such as the financial crisis. As biennials decline in number and scope, their internal dynamics are increasingly questionable, even though they maintain a strong following and a strong capacity to sustain a museum through a difficult financial time. If contemporary art today is largely defined by its association with financial transactions, why are contemporary artists and their works often accused of being credit-ridden and lazy? It is almost as if contemporary art today is as ethically ambiguous as any other art form, with its own internal logic dictating what is and is not ethically acceptable. Yet this is only ever partially true. Today the standardised exhibition format and biennial form openly call for artists to produce and deliver a work of art in exchange for a donation, whereas in the 1980s and 1990</text>

In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of re-constitution. In recent years, this accusation has been cast doubly at the Brooklyn Museum and the Montreal Art Biennale. While the former are often accused of being antiquated, in their current state of decay, their pedagogical strategies often serve to accentuate the historical parallels between their curatorial interventions and the past, while ignoring the actual historical parallels. We suggest that a biennial's current frame of care might actually aid in its decline, giving it a constructively opportunistic character, while providing it with the necessary contemporary public support to thrive in the current environment.

This is a critical calling, given the increasing privatisation of both public and private space. In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of recognising the new ‘classic’ – a call that was repeated ad infinitum. But modern biennials, while marking a certain break with the past in many areas, are in many ways ancient in others. They are, for example, historically illiterate, refusing to recognize the cultural significance of certain events such as the 2000th St Georges de la Croix Day in Montreal. They are also often accused of being antiquated for their focus on a particular period in history. But biennials’ unique institutionalised form and historical dependency means that their realisation is always contingent on the party holding the institutional purse strings. And as biennials become more public and more accessible, they are also more likely to be contemporary and global in their significance. This is the ‘periodicity’ of biennials. It does not follow, however, that biennials should seek to recreate the historical periods in which they take place. Quite the contrary: bi</text>

In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of preservation. While there is some truth to this, there is also a critical need to ruminate on the contemporary condition and to actively engage with the institutional knowledge that pertains to it. A critical attitude towards the museum is a required first step in any such project, and the biennial as a museum of the contemporary condition and not an isolated entity is a necessary precondition for any such projects to have any real momentum. So, while the museum may be an ideal venue for reflection and action on contemporary cultural phenomena, it is by no means a perfect venue for such reflection and action. A biennial’s real power lies in its ability to generate knowledge, to entice visitors with a compelling story or a compelling attraction that will carry them away with its narrative of events unfolding right before their very eyes. Unfortunately, in the current global economic and political dynamic, this historical ability is suspect and frequently perverted.

In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of re-constituting. While there are legitimate concerns about the increasing privatisation of space and artefacts, we should also not forget that biennials were historically institutionalised, becoming what they are today: ‘a permanent fixture in most cities, a fixture in museums and archives everywhere, a powerful symbol of the city’s cultural capital’. What makes a biennial unique is its ability to capture the magic of the present through its continuous installation, continually moving image and repeated installation of art from different places and times. In doing so, it creates a spatial contingency and offers possibilities for change through contingency. How might a biennial engage with the culture of the future, and how might it create its own future?

But in this period of capitalist cultural malaise, the museum is often a surrogate caretaker, holding together the disparate fragments of what used to be called the ‘common heritage’. What might a biennial do in this situation? While it would certainly boost public coffers and help to define the curatorial agenda, a biennial's real mission is its ability to capture the magic of the present and to act as a catalyst for the future. This is a critical calling, given the increasing privatisation of both public and private space. In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of reformation, but the present is ravenous. The biennial market is heavily influenced by the celebrity culture of the 1990s, which is no longer in vogue, and the ubiquity of celebrity culture is a powerful narrative construct. Thus, biennials’ institutional forms of governance are re-formed through the magic of the present and the immediacy of its encounter. We are drawn into these spaces, encounter these people, places, things all the time – and we are not sure what we should do with ourselves or with the artefacts that are produced when we do. The biennial as a curatorial strategy is characterised by two acts of encounter: the production of history, and of significances. The production of history – the making of biennials – is a capital-intensive process that requires a high degree of artistic skill and organisation. It requires that biennials produce material that is both current and timeless, both contemporary and mythic. In other words, they</text>

In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of reclamation. But these accusations were often used as a pretext to unleash a series of radical changes in the form and content of the biennial, often at the instigation of the curatorial committee. Today, these claims are used as a pretext to unleash a series of radical changes in the form and content of the biennial, sometimes at the instigation of the mayor. In an ideal world, these changes would sweep away the political and bureaucratic impasses preventing such radicalisation from occurring, and open the biennial to the kind of public patronage normally accorded to art institutions. We would all be able to see how art institutions could be reformed and modernised under such conditions. This is the kind of thinking and political-ideological orienting that biennials like to espouse. It is a version of history that cannot be altered by popular will, and yet which all of us on this planet can participate in if we will. It is a version of art that is both ephemer</text>

In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of re-formation. But today, many biennials are middle-class institutions, built on the back of a shared identity and shared history. The new ‘cultures of the present’ are caused by the sharing of information, whether that sharing is significationally proven correct (the ‘quantified information’ of the social) or fundamentally flawed (what is referred to as the ‘common good’). A biennial’s historical mission is to capture the magic of the present and to use that magic to facilitate the future, while at the same time exploiting the present to serve the past. The challenge for contemporary art biennials is to respond to the present and to the ever-present tension between the two. From the 1990s the biennale has often been used to explore the past in an attempt to contribute to the future, as in the case of The International Exhibition. But the biennial has another mission: to orient the art of the</text>

In the 1990s and 2000s, biennials were often accused of being antiquated and in need of an act of renewal. But a growing number of biennials are in fact deeply nihilistic and patriarchal, and have lots of caring for the less fortunate members of our society. Many of them even teach courses in biennials. A number of biennials are actually feminised and post-feminist. Teaching and learning from the past are, we are told, apropos, as we march towards a post-racial world. So what does it mean for a biennial to be feminist or post-feminist, or both? And what does it mean for a biennial to be a museum or museum of contemporary art? We argue that a biennial must do both, and that it is both a curatorial imposition and a site of symbolic, historical and archival work in the service of the social. It exists to serve the common good, and to absorb and lend meaning to the fragmented and disrupted histories of our times. We also argue that it is a site of critical engagement with</text>

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months before our visit, showing as part of the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition on &quot;Spaces (New York and London: Museum of Modern Art, 2014). Despite its relatively brief existence (just over a year), the exhibition gained a great deal of attention (both from critics and the public at large) largely because it was forcibly cancelled by Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art. Its proposed, but ultimately ineffective, �double dissolution of museum and art institution� was used as a pretext to completely reorganise the city through a new, but old-fashioned planning process. The result was that (re)negotiating the museum was no longer possible, and that (re)negotiation of the city meant being squeezed between old exhibitions and new curatorial approaches. For a while, the idea that the museum might host or even be a site for a future (re)negotiation seemed increasingly unlikely, and visitors to the museum were (re)accustomed to museums in their current form.

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months ago, effectively non-existent in New York City due to the city government’s ban on new developments near parks. Now the city government has significantly expanded the project’s footprint, and (re)negotiation is a necessity in order to access the vast, expensive, time-consuming, and (very) rarely used curatorial toolkit. In order to achieve the massive, consistent results desired by the city, the project would have had to be both wholly successful as an art project (by itself) and completely blocked from the city (through strict curatorial and planning controls). The combination of a large-scale, long-term non-profit art project (with substantial cultural resources at a regional and even nation-wide level) with an equally ambitious art project with significant cultural resources at a city level is (in my opinion) the new curatorial paradigm.  The curatorial task is now fully vested in the artist and her team, and the important work of consultation</text>

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months ago, considered a failure (despite having just opened its doors a few months earlier than planned). Its partners in the US, who were then understandably very unhappy, decided that (re)negotiation was a good idea. This is important within the exhibitionary community because it signals to others that you are trying to engage with this culturally relevant material and that you are trying to discover what is relevant to you. It signals to those with whom you engage that you are open to new ways of understanding the world. For example, the fortieth street project did not end up being a museum piece, since the museum piece is usually seen as the most representative of the art in the city, but rather a project highlighting the cultural value of the place and its rich history. These are the kinds of exhibitionary experiences that can change the way we understand the world, and the way we engage with it.In the US, the Fortieth Street project came to symbolise the values and history of the place</text>

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months before the Dutch and North Korean curators visited, viewed by some as having a North Korean curatorial agenda. Both the Dutch and North Korean curators were greatly moved by the sheer volume, the vernacular, the panorama, the mass of people, the extravagant, ghoulish spectacle, the ��мキャラクタン, that the both the North Korean and Dutch curators viewed as constituting the exhibitionary structure. They were in many ways moved by the overwhelming human impact of the mass of people, and the extraordinary diversity and collective practices of the different cultures represented, that they observed in the city. Both the Dutch and North Korean curators saw the large, dynamic picture they were trying to create and wanted to make a difference. They were both moved by the same thing: the sheer scale and impact of the challenge. The real difference came in the way the curators approached the challenge. There was a real cordon sanitaire effect: the same problems</text>

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months ago, entirely cancelled due to political unrest. It is the World Art Biennale, after all, and the very definition of curatorial trickery.The existence of such potentialities, these unpredictable, often-failed approaches to the curatorial, is what makes the biennial format so interesting. For the history of the biennial format to be told, we would have to have (very) many previous attempts, and for each attempt to be memorable, memorable in its own way. And yet we do have several biennials, and each of those attempts has something in common. There is the 1998 Biennale of Sydney, for example, which was so over-the-top in its ambition that it created a sensation not just through being there, but also because, according to the BBC, a lot of people spent four days &quot;visiting historical sites&quot;. The fact that it was staged in a city centre, in a largely white arts museum, and in the middle class suburbia</text>

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months ago, considered a failure. Its failure to engage visitors as curators was felt, and its failure to provide a meaningful experience for visitors as visitors was felt. In the exhibition that followed, visitors were invited to create a 'review' of the project on a Tumblr blog, where they could share their thoughts and experiences of the project in a range of subject areas. The final piece, the curatorial presentation and the publication, of the project, was both a one-off and an eventful, quasi-documentary event that culminated in the curatorial projection of the findings and the publication of the project. As the exhibition progressed, we were invited to participate in a live Skype interview, in which we discussed the findings and the project from various perspectives. This was the case for the Forty Second Street project, as well as at Frieze, Granby Four Streets and Outer Sunset Auspices. The interviews were conducted in English, French, Russian, German</text>

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months before the exhibition, undergoing what its curator, Thomas Graham Strachan described as a ‘bad faith act’ by the developer of the site and the city centre’s hotel industry. It did, however, make the news (fame) and make some people angry.And it is with the Forty Second Street project that we can now add another venue – a single, brand new, never-used venue – to the ever-growing list of venues where art is staged – staged, interpreted and (in recent years) appropriated in all sorts of different ways. There are now more than 200 art spaces in the US and Canada, and the Forty Second Street project is no exception. The exhibitionary structure is – like the Forty Second Street project – undergoing a kind of irreconcilable deformation.

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months before the Biennale opened, in serious danger of failing that curatorial status. So the Biennale was already engaged in a process of fundamental changes, realigning its curatorial role, and trying new modes of engagement. There was a clear awareness that the Biennale was entering a new stage in its history. So it did more than simply commission artists to re-imagine the space; it actively engaged curators, artists, art historians, art teachers, artists and others with a range of expertise and perspectives to help guide the Biennale through the next stage of its history. It is a new stage in its history, and a stage that will continue to shape what it means to be an essential part of the art world in the UK and beyond.This last aspect is a major part of what the Biennale is about. It is about inclusion and how that is embedded in a public realm, and about participation, which is defined as ‘one of the ways in</text>

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months before our meeting, on the cusp of being completely demolished. Despite this seeming failure, the Forty Second Street project lives on in the form of a small-scale, multi-year retrospective (more or less) re-enactment of the Forty Second Street railway station, which was one of the city's last standing standing standing industrial parks. This is an incredibly valuable, rarely-celebrated role model for the art of the present and the potential for the art of the future.The Forty Second Street project itself is a rare, but very real cultural-economic-trending event on the cusp of becoming something truly spectacular. I was invited to be a co-curator for the Forty Second Street Re-enactment, which took place in June 2016 at the Chisenhale Gallery, New York. The re-enactment was curated by Sandeep Parmar and</text>

So it is with the Forty Second Street project, which was, until a few months ago, struggling with the difficult, two-pronged, two-front battle to be allowed back into the heart of the historic district. The Forty Street project, by the way, is a great example of a potentially very ambitious, very cool, and very moving art project that was, until a few months ago, struggling with the seemingly impossibility of ever truly being allowed back into the heart of the historic district. It is a great story, one that many curatorial approaches could easily adapt. Last but not least, we know that (re)negotiation is (very) often unsuccessful. I think this is a core tenet of the exhibitionary format, and I think that (very) often exhibitionary curators already have a sense of despairingly naïve artistic potential that they tackle from time to time, and that there is a limit to how far the art they create can be taken. This is perhaps why so many different curatorial approaches eventually converge on a common denominator</text>

In this new technological society, the images that make up the digitised social are augmented and contextualised in a way that anticipates the cultural practices of the future in all but formal terms, but with the notable difference that the cultural practices of the future will be those that render archive and archiveite obsolete and leave the biennial and its varied collections of artefacts and collections of images with a new cultural context. Finally, the exhibition is a society in which the collection, whether of an artist or a museum, is not a collection of images, but a complex collection of knowledge that includes knowledge of images that are no longer images. In this way, the collection not only records the image, but also anticipates the image through images. This last phenomenon is a function of what Matthew Arnold terms ‘biennials’, those object-based cultural formations that arise from, and are, produced by, the digital revolution. In the digital revolution, collections and archives are digitised and become online repositories that constantly update and augment the pictures that they contain – images that depict new events or instigate new behaviours.

In this new technological society, the images that make up the digitised social are augmented and contextualised in a way that anticipates the cultural practices of the future in much the same way that the social is concerned. But unlike the social, the biennial is not present in anticipation of a future that it neither creates nor anticipates. It is here, as it were, an event that is itself future-oriented. The electronic photo-realism of digital photos, the vernacular, as it were, and the accompanying decentralisation of cultural power and control are all here to stay. Whether one agrees with this vision of the biennial as a curatorial gesture, or whether one subscribes to contemporary more traditional concepts of the biennial, there is no doubt that the biennial is here to stay. But what has become increasingly clear is that this only happens when there is a large and sustained cultural and social context of the exhibitionary form firmly in place. Curators have to be creative curators, and there is no doubt that Marc Lévesque and Company find themselves in very different positions now that there is no established art-historical-</text>

It is concerned with the temporality of the contemporary digital image – and with the changes to image processing and storage technologies that are contributing to its increase. In this context, art and art history are invited to participate in the digital transformation of art and art history. Digital images and images of art are used as data to generate new image formats and protocols that render images and images of art valuably different from those of other media. The mission of the FACT is to ‘impart, create, and continually enhance’ its archive of art through documentation and through the act of archiving itself.

But this does not mean that images from the future should be represented in a particular way or that they should necessarily make sense in a given context. And in the exhibition ‘Future City’ we find another condition that could affect the presentation of images from the future: hypermedia. The hypermedia condition reproduces the qualities of the past but adds an additional layer of processing and cultural politics. We find images of cities projected at an angle, in some cases literally – looking backwards in time – in an effort to make sense of the social and political changes occurring in the world. The images in this exhibition are an attempt to bring together the different layers of the city in such a way as to allow the observer to emerge as a fully realised part of the social. But they are also an invitation to look back at the past and to attempt a politics of the present through images that recall the past but also project future possibilities. This is done through the use of drones,</text>

As the exhibition’s title implies, the film project aims to bring to life for real the social and political implications of the present through films that speak the language of the future. By bringing together archival materials, contemporary images, audio recordings, and drawings in a single project, the exhibition brings together, to a large extent, the archival and contemporary images from the same archive, but with a global aesthetic and political context. The exhibition is also concerned with the new technological possibilities that are emerging in the social and cultural contexts of the connected city. It is a society in which images can be taken back – but only if it has a condition attached to it – and in which images can enter into a constantly updated global register of cultural and social significance. In this new technological society, the images that make up the digitised social are augmented and contextualised in a way that anticipates the cultural practices of the future in all its richness and complexity. However, the digitised social also has the potential to descend into nepotism and dynasties of celebrity culture, oligarchic forms of governance, and even fascist nationalisms. The potential for this to happen lies in the way in which technological innovation is designed to be applied – and thereby to be consumed by – elites and powerful collectives. In this sense, the digitised social is both physically and digitally augmented to make it more relatable and more complete. But this only happens when the technology is advanced to the point where it can be applied to ordinary people, and only then for a limited duration. A digitised social needs a physical archive to support its potential, and an archive to support its consumptive function. Moreover, the digitised social needs to be distributed across a global audience in order to sustain its potential. How the archival materials are arranged within the exhibitionary format and presented in the exhibitionary structure is another reason why the digitised social</text>

But this does not mean that we should sit by and become spectators to the cultural flows of the present, for the connected city is but a vision, and future expectations must be worked out. The connected city is an evolving and dynamic system that constantly seeks to reflect and redefine itself through what it creates. The technology that makes it possible is called the Social, and as the story of the Biennale continues to tell, its emergence and ongoing evolution reflects the history and humanity of the world as a whole. I’m curious about how this story might unfold, and what kind of impact it might have.D: The question that comes to mind for me is, what does it feel like to be part of the creative process? With the Biennale as an exhibitionary form, there’s a certain weight and weightlessness to it: the weight of the historical material, the weight of the demands of the social.

This exhibition is not a ‘snap shot’ of the changes in technology to be expected in the social; it is a timeline of how cultural practices will be impacted by the new economy and society. The question that remains, however, is what kind of social practices will be developed through this history? This question is partly a function of the present, in which the artists and curators note-taking is widespread and apparent in the exhibition, but it is also a ‘quest of information’ that the connected city desperately needs in order to function. The connected city is in dire need of a good source of information – a daily dose of which, as the global information infrastructure is becoming ever more complex and resource-intensive, will have to be supplied from outside the city. The connected city is also in dire need of a way to reliably assess the cultural significance of its digital images, as new scientific and academic research suggests that images of cultural significance are being generated outside the</text>

In this new technological society, the images that make up the digitised social are augmented and contextualised in a way that anticipates the cultural practices of the future in all its richness and complexity. This is the ‘new normal’. But how do images, images that make up the digitised social, come to exist in the way that they do? How do images of the future connect to images of the present? These are questions that introduce new dimensions to the historical relationship between archival materials and contemporary art practices, between archival images and digitised images, and between archival images and the digital images that constitute the digitised social. Towards a Digital Society 168 (2016) is a project that explores these questions and more from the archival point of view. In so doing, it draws upon the curatorial process, archival materials, archival practices, and imaging culture of the past to envision the images of the future. Drawing directly on her time at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, the archival materials for the exhibition are selected from the collections of the National Gallery in D.C. and the British Museum, and digitised using</text>

The aim of the exhibition is to tell the digitised story through artworks and artefacts that chart the trajectory of archival cultural practices and the social. At the same time, the digitised projects are juxtaposed with artworks that chart the trajectory of connected technologies and infrastructure. These typologies – technology, art, infrastructure and media – are juxtaposed with each other in an ongoing dance of constant reimagining and parallel creation. The digitised projects and their countless images are juxtaposed with artworks that chart the trajectories of connected art forms – from the museum to the social to the spatial – that chart the cultural histories of the connected city.

The digitised images that make up the social are augmented and contextualised in a way that puts them at odds with each other. This is the ‘serendipitous side’ of technological capitalism: the images that make up the digitised sociality of the future are the images of the past, made apocalyptic by the very technologies that are creating the futures that ourselves envision.This odd hybrid feature of technological capitalism – the ability to image travel while also having to account for the images that it takes form – is a feature that is taking root in recent art and archival research. It is becoming increasingly difficult to separate the image of the future from the image of the present, and vice versa. In fact, some researchers think that the merging of the two is the critical step in the process that will allow us to create a ‘future society’.1 One example of this in contemporary art is the merging of social practice with</text>

Rapid advances in science and technology have made it easier than ever to move goods and people between different locations. But in the service of these rapid advances, employers increasingly rely on data to identify and deploy workers. This raises the question: how do workers become agents of change in this increasingly automated society? Aims in this direction have recently turned to look for new employment opportunities in the aftermath of the devastating effects of climate change, which is expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Many parts of the world are now experiencing their worst droughts in decades, and up to half of the earth’s arable land could be lost if nothing is done to regenerate it. Current trends are expected to double the world population growth rate, and do so at a faster clip in the coming years. How do we create opportunities for the growing number of people to participate in this</text>

Globalised economies no longer derive their value from the capacities of nation-states or large multinational corporations; rather, they are the result of the activities of many different kinds of companies operating in close proximity. This is increasingly evident at a global macro-level. Take, for example, the dramatic expansion of China’s industrial sector during the 1980s and 1990s, which accounted for around a third of global GDP. Now, many factories employ hundreds or even thousands of people, many of whom are migrant labourers. Many multinationals have their ‘green jobs’ programme, which provides training and employment to low-wage workers in the wake of industrialisation. But these programmes are only part of the story. A growing number of countries are implementing programmes that directly address the needs of their populations, such as land reform or urban redevelopment, or subsidising basic needs such as</text>

There is a growing recognition that neoliberalism ushered in by the oil crisis is neither good for workers nor the planet. A growing number of scholars are beginning to question the social, economic and spatial determinants of development, and the place of science and technology in generating social, economic and political change.  One of the most prominent recent debacles in the field is that of artificial horizon, a branch of mathematics that studies the effects of changes in the shape and scale of the Earth, and the use of material and immaterial forms in constructing the physical landscape. Some scholars are even beginning to question the place of the anthropologist in such critical discourses. Although there is no shortage of talented anthropologists with diverse disciplinary backgrounds and vocations, there is a fundamental lack of supply. There is a glut of anthropologists</text>

There are signs that the logic of biennials is awakening as well. A recent survey of biennial results by The Local, an international art and cultural organisation based in São Paulo, reveals that almost half of the US, UK and France cities that were present in the Top 10 of a global ranking of cities for the quality of their parks, playgrounds and cultural experiences during the 2011 Venice Biennale had either recently been affected by or are currently grappling with mass or park closures due to overwork, urban sprawl and other factors.3 In a city, the ‘performativity of art’ is a useful and crucial tool for the implementation of neoliberalism. It enables the city to function as a profit centre, but more importantly, it enables the city to function as a space for the production of virtual art and cultural consumption. In</text>

The habits of large-scale capital circulation no longer constitute the bulk of the economy, and the proliferation of low-cost labour is displacing large numbers of highly trained workers. The pace of technological innovation and the fluidity with which information flows across borders is disrupting old notions of national identities and constructing new ones. The logic of the urban sprawl of capital is shifting towards the city – and towards the city-region as a whole. This is evident in the expansion of the metropolis, which is becoming ever more like a gigantic data hub where information about the region is transmitted hourly across the planet. It is much more difficult to sustain a presence in the city when the pace of technological change is so intensive. The metropolis is becoming ever more like a global data hub, where the pace of information exchange is increasing exponentially. This is</text>

The financialised production of commodities no longer exploits labour, and technological innovation no longer produces (exploits?) labour through the conjuration of value. Labor conjuration is no longer the main factor that generates global profitability, and a larger part of the profit is now generated by the exchange of labour between nations. Nonetheless, there are signs that the desire to chain labour remains strong, and that there is a hunger for new forms of labour that challenge the status quo, even if these jobs are not necessarily located in the megacities of Manhattan or Beijing. Is there a way to reimagine the logic of global capitalism in the image of the countryside? If so, new forms of labour would have to be created that would map onto the terrain of the countryside, and this cannot be done through the logic of globalisation. New forms of labour would have to be created through direct action on the</text>

The labour force is waking up to the fact that it is not confined to the shores of national borders or national cities, but that it includes far more people in many cases than are capable of performing the jobs that need to be done. It includes workers from all over the globe, and yet employs only a small minority of them, because the rest of the labour force is busy running global operations that demand far more human labour than are possible within the confines of the national capital cities or even of the nation. The worker is not a fixed quantity, but a variable quality that fluctuates in relation to wage and other labour market forces. The global labour force is waking up to the fact that it does not need to be cordoned off by national borders or city-states.

The social costs of the capitalist accumulation, which includes the built environment and the social amenities that flow from it, are becoming increasingly apparent. The political and legal battles fought over the social goods and rights that flow from the accrual of labour are often won on the grounds that such rights are &quot;human rights&quot;. The social costs and social consequences of capitalist society, then, are those same for workers as for non-workers. The social rights that workers and non-workers now enjoy are those that were won through long and protracted processes of political and social change. The non-worker in this scenario is today a constrained and non-reciprocal client. He/she must either work within the system or change the system to accrue social benefits. In</text>

On the one hand, the mega-corporations that used to be the masters of the global labour force are being replaced by multi-national conglomerates that need to cater to a more diverse range of clients and target consumers. This means that there is a need for workers in many locations to have a say in the company they work for. This is why ‘right to work’ laws were passed in many cities and why ‘right to housing’ laws are also being passed. These laws ensure that workers have a voice in the company they work for. But this is only part of the story. There is a need for neighbourhoods to be places where decisions about how to spend local resources – whether it is money on housing or schools or roads – are taken seriously and decisions that directly impact on workers and communities are taken into consideration. This is why ‘zero-zero-one’ zones</text>

New social formations are emerging along the lines of the Occupy movement in New York and Black Lives Matter in the US, and there is a lot of engagement with the precariat—people who entrench themselves in the city despite not being part of the urban core but nevertheless constitute the city’s productive labour force. New forms of precariousness are emerging alongside of it—immigrants who find themselves trapped in cyclical migratory situations because of low wages and erratic benefits—and of course, there is a lot of attention being paid to the impact of climate change on the cities. But the priorities of the global north are awakening.

The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at the time run by a board of curators, came as a consequence of this ‘biennialisation’. I would say that the Biennale as an institution is an economic activity, and part of the reason why it is so productive is that it generates so many jobs for people who work in the art world. The relationship between biennials and museums is a different kind of productive. Biennials are the primary audience for the museums that are part of the city, and part of the world. The fact that these same biennials also have a cultural impact on the city and the world around them is what MOMA did well, and it is why they are so valuable: they open new places, engage with old things, and so forth. It is true that the biennial can be restricted to the periods just before, during, and after World War II, and especially during the 1970s and 1980s, but this is a kind of curatorial intervention that</text>

I had a personal relationship with the Biennale that evolved to the point where I could no longer ignore the changes happening in the Biennale. The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at one time the Museum of Modern Art, became an issue. The Biennale was a place of encounter, and for many years the Biennale was an important point of entry for visitors to the city, and for artists to come to the city and engage with its contemporary culture. But as the Biennale started to lose its archaeological edge and started to be influenced by cultural anthropologists, we started to see a limit to its potential. There was no place for art and no place for people in the biennale, because there was no balance between the different cultures. I argued that there should be a space for people to come to the Biennale, but this had to be something different from what we had now. In 1993, with the support of the Biennale board, I started to think about the idea of a ‘city in crisis’. The Biennale itself was not in a position to help in this crisis, since it was autonomous and immune from</text>

My interest in the field began when the Venice Biennale was transformed from a ‘place of exchange’ into a ‘place of consumption’. I had a personal relationship with the Biennale that evolved to the point where I could no longer ignore the changes happening in the Biennale. The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at the time run by the Biennale itself, felt very much like the relationship between the museum and biennials. The Museum of Modern Art was forced to change its name, and as a consequence there was a change in the way in which the museum was governed. This was done on the Biennale's behalf, but in the long run it was probably all for the best. The change allowed the Biennale to become more of an institution, more like a museum, while simultaneously creating a new generation of artists who would inherit the Museum of Modern Art's structure but would also create their own museum. This is the biennial today, but at the time it was a museum and a biennale in their own right. The Museum of Modern Art had to change, since it could not simultaneously host a huge art collection and present a systematic survey of contemporary art. The Biennale had to change, since it could not simultaneously host large-scale exhibitions and catalogue a chronological history of</text>

I had a personal relationship with the Biennale that evolved to the point where I could no longer ignore the changes happening in the Biennale. The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at the time a counterpoint to the biennale, was characterised by a kind of ‘cultural mudslinging’. The Museum of Modern Art was constantly accused of being obsessed with taste and aesthetics, while the Biennale was primarily concerned with the accumulation of monies. In the 1990s, the Biennale was influenced by the Museo de Arsenale, which in turn was heavily influenced by the Biennale of Sydney. The idea that biennials are concerned with the production of cultural assets, and the museum as a passive consumer, is something that has been repeated ad infinitum. In place of the museum as an asset, the biennial has an asset of sorts: it has the capacity to take shape, but it lacks any kind of intrinsic value. So while the Biennale has the capacity to transform into a museum, it lacks any intrinsic value. It is an artefact, and thus worthy of being studied (perhaps unknowingly),</text>

I had a personal relationship with the Biennale that evolved to the point where I could no longer ignore the changes happening in the Biennale. The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at the time housed in a different building, is a story that I will tell many times over. The relationship between biennials and the Biennial as a whole, and between biennials and museums is a relationship that has to be lived. Biennials have to be part of the museum, and part of the community. When the Biennale was initially conceived, there were two separate propositions: the primary objective was to create a ‘bridge building’ between the museum and the street, so that the museum could establish a presence in the neighborhood and the Biennale could inhabit the area. This was done by creating a ‘streetside plaza’ and a ‘street level garden area’ at the base of the ‘streetside’ that would house boutiques, a ‘gardening supply store’ and a small supermarket. The Biennale proposed a model of its kind, and the Museum of Modern Art responded with something very close</text>

I had a personal relationship with the Biennale that evolved to the point where I could no longer ignore the changes happening in the Biennale. The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at one time the case, came to an abrupt end in 1990. With the Museum of Modern Art planning to close, the Biennale was compelled to close early, since it was encountering financial difficulties. With the formation of a new Museum of Modern Art in 1993, its mandate was expanded to include an entirely new generation of artists, and the new Museum was able to put art back on the agenda, even if it meant changing the name of the Biennale. Biennials have a long and proud tradition of engaging with the museum and its collections, and in many ways this engagement is what the new Museum of Modern Art should do in its mandate. It should be able to show works from the current and future Biennale that are relevant to the context of the museum, and it should be able to invest its collection in these contexts. In some ways, the new Museum of Modern Art should mirror the traditional curatorial role, but it should put art back at the centre of the museum,</text>

The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at the time run by the Biennale itself, was in direct conflict with the way in which the museum was organising itself. The Biennale was in the midst of the crisis of identity it was experiencing, as a result of a combination of the very real difficulties in building a long-term relationship with audiences in several cities, and a general misunderstanding of how art was produced in the city in the context of the city. The Biennale was in crisis of its own self-regard. I remember one artist who clearly felt that he was being used by the Biennale: somehow, the Biennale was saying to itself: ‘We’re all becoming museum-like institutions and ‘we’re the museum’. And the Biennale was finding it very difficult to engage with this.The Biennale was organising itself in a very different way. It was using biennials as temporary institutions, and having artists and curators participate in these</text>

The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at the time run by the Biennale itself, was fundamentally different from the relationship between biennials and the contemporary art biennale. The Biennale was a ‘place of exchange’, and the Museum of Modern Art was a ‘place of consumption’. The concept of ‘exchange’ became an issue. The Biennale was a place of exchange, but it became problematic when the Museum of Modern Art decided to close its doors due to a lack of interest in the city. I argued that the Biennale should be an institution that actively engages with and produces cultural change, and that the Museum of Modern Art should be able to adapt itself to this changing cultural landscape. In other words, the Biennale should function as a catalyst, not a permanent static archive. So the Biennale opened its doors to cultural exchange, but it also has a curatorial function. The Biennale produced works that were specific to Venice, such as</text>

The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at one time the model for a Museum of Modern Art, ended up being very interesting for curatorial work, because the realization that art’s audience is a material substrate on which are being framed material – changes the dynamic. The Biennale has always taken its place as a contemporary museum of modern art, and its important role in this context will continue to evolve. The Biennale is a museum of exchange, and the Museum of Modern Art is a museum of consumption. Biennials are cultural influencers, and their relationships to the museum are a material form of cultural influence. The reason why biennials have this particular place in the museum is that their status as artists and their material form are considered more natural and normal, and therefore more accessible and quotidian. In this way biennials are seen as the representatives of the cultural establishment, and not just of the art establishment. This is a situation that can be found in most countries, but in a number of developing countries especially</text>

The relationship between biennials and the Museum of Modern Art, which was at the time run by a board of curators, became problematic. The Biennale was originally a biennial in its own right, and its curators had an agenda of their own. Their job was to find a place in the museum where the museum could place its art without having to engage with the art in the Biennale. They set up a parallel system, the ‘MUSEUM OF MODERN ART’, which allowed artists to work on the system without having to engage with the art in the institution. They also installed a computer system that allowed artists to archive their art. These and other features of the system allowed the Biennale to exist in parallel to the museum, and artists to maintain a relationship with the museum without having to engage with the art in the institution. Biennials have come a long way since then, and while there are certainly still a great many gaps to be filled, I look forward to seeing how the relationship between artist and institution develops in</text>

In this model, the museum holds a fixed position within the social totality – a position that can be changed with the push of a button – yet the biennial is expected to respond to this dynamic by creating its own unique form of temporality within this static social totality. This is to be seen not as a museum-based position, but as a position that is specific to the specific needs of the biennial as an art project. If the museum is seen as a static collection of objects, the biennial is expected to offer a radically different experience of time. It is to be seen not as an exhibition of objects, but as a position that is constantly evolving and mobile. This is to be seen as a ‘position’, and ‘either way’ it may change position – to move from the sphere of the museum to that of the cloud. In this sense, ‘the present’ is seen not as a fixed point in time, but as a dynamic continuum that can be reshuffled.’[9]Here, Biennials are expected to offer a ‘snap</text>

In this case, the museum would be seen as a historically specific site that engages with the biennial as a digitised process within a larger socio-political and economic system that continually makes technological advances. This is the ‘biennial condition’. In other words, the museum is a continuous transnational complex that can only survive and evolve within the parameters and systems that it is given. The museum is a particular site for the museum – a set of relations that constitute the biennial as a whole – but it is also a site where cultural exchange takes place, a point of entry into the larger society of which the biennial is a part. In other words, the museum itself becomes a digital node within the social totality. As a digital node, the museum is exposed to the very real-life dynamics and practices of contemporary culture and society. In this sense</text>

In this model, the museum is often seen as the locus of the project and the technological singularity, while the new ‘figure of the user’ is an expression of the potentiality of the new technological conjugation. The museum visitor is now more than just a data consumer, and data-collecting museums are now also cultural collectives. The museum visitor is now engaged in a cultural transaction between the museum and the social totality, and is contributing to the making of a ‘future society’ through his or her visit.

In this model, the museum holds a fixed position within the social totality – a position that can be changed with the push of a button – yet it also stands for many different kinds of interaction. In this model, the museum becomes a site of many different kinds of engagement. The museum is asked to be both a broker and a facilitator of this new interaction, yet it also has to be able to maintain the integrity of the original intentions of the project. If it is to survive, the museum has to be able to effectively coordinate all the different kinds of interaction that are happening now and in the future, and it also has to be able to effectively coordinate all the different kinds of art that is being made right now and in the future. The museum cannot simply assemble collections of objects, texts, images or images on a particular topic and hope that all of those interactions take place in a shared space. This is why art museums are continuously evolving and why biennials are so important for art’s survival: because they allow art to develop particular contexts and to negotiate different kinds of space, yet they also try to</text>

In this model, the museum holds a fixed position within the social totality – a position that can be changed with the push of a button – yet it is also exposed to the dynamic influence of the artist, whose identity is tied to the collection and museum in a continual and pervasive way. In this sense, the museum could become a media platform for the user’s identifications, allowing the biennial to experiment with this new media and thereby establish an identity for itself within the social totality. Within this new medium, the biennial could also experiment with the possibilities of archive-making and the direct relationship between art and archive. As we move forward into the digital medium of the museum, biennials are faced with a choice to either adopt the museum as a permanent node within the social totality, or else to adopt the museum as an object of technology’s surveillance and control. The choice is an important one, and it is this choice that biennials are expected to make. As Charles Bukowski once said, ‘Every biennial has to make a decision or risk becoming obsolete.’[9</text>

The biennial would then be faced with the choice between different versions of itself within this digitally mediated social system. In this model, the museum holds a fixed position within the social totality – a position that can be changed with the push of a button – whereas the biennial could theoretically seek to engage with and even override this fixed position. In this model, the museum also acts as a node within a much broader social totality that is globally distributed and interconnected, but at the same time it is a single institution with limited political or institutional power. In other words, the museum is a node within the social totality but also has a great deal of political and institutional power. The museum as a node within the social totality may be seen as the frontiers of the technological singularity, and the potential of the digitally mediated digital imaging these processes. This new spatial heterogeneity and shifting of places and objects of all kinds is in part a consequence of the constant need to find new ways to plug into the web of communication and economic connectivity that is the new ‘world market’. The museum as a single node within this global connectivity is a case study in this new ‘world market’. It is a building that is both a sensor</text>

In this model, the museum holds a fixed position within the social totality – a position that can be changed with the push of a button – whereas in the other system, the social totality is constantly evolving. In this new medium, the biennial could also adopt multiple forms: it could be an ongoing series of small-scale projects conducted at a regional or local level, a curatorial stunt or a gallery show, or it could be a permanent museum that exhibits contemporary art from different perspectives. The choice of form would determine the content and the outcomes – both the exhibition and the curatorial stamp. In the new digital world of the biennial, the museum would no longer be the locus of the artefact, and the virtual would supplant the real. This would mean that the museum would no longer represent the idealised form of the biennial in the form of a museum, but would instead contain various versions of the same, operating on a much broader scale. This is a much more direct way of putting it, and would require little revision of the biennial’s current content or form.[9] More</text>

In this model, the Museum of Modern Art becomes what it calls a ‘complexity’ and its collections, its programming, its exhibits, its programming, its exhibits, its programming, its programming, its programming, its programming etc. all interact with each other in various ways and hence are influenced by ‘different positions and styles’.[9] In other words, the museum and the biennial are not mutually exclusive and neither is</text>

In this scenario, the museum would be said to be evolving both physically and conceptually. This would make the museum dependent on the digital revolution, which makes it more difficult to define the museum as a museum of the future, whereas the biennial would be said to be evolving through its interaction with other cultural forms and the dynamic combination of different forms of culture. While the biennial would definitely experience this merging of different historical periods and museums of the future, its actual content would remain largely pre-digital and static. This is because the biennial is a curatorial tool: its job is to preserve or create what is considered to be the contemporary (i.e. trendy or new or hip) form of the art form, and to this end it makes frequent use of historical curatorial tools and styles – including historical photo-narratives and narrator’s</text>

Its current form and function – displaying, organising and lending its digital libraries to other cultural institutions – is part of this growing political and economic dynamic. The biennial is part of this growing dynamic, and the exhibition format is part of that dynamic’s organisational fluidity. When biennials first started out, they often sat on the boundary of this growing dynamic, uncertain about what kinds of positions to take, and politically vulnerable as a position. But as the biennial format has become more institutionalised, and the museum as a museum-like institution naturally succumbs to this dynamic, the museum has come to dominate the dynamic. The biennial is now the locus of power, and the museum is its limit. The now ubiquitous biennial may contribute to this dynamic in various ways</text>

At the same time, the title unknowables, the Biennale needs to be able to find new ways of naming itself.

The exhibition’s title, congruent with the curatorial purpose of describing the city as a ‘city of some…’, hints at a city of few, of many. Previous exhibitions of the Biennale of Sydney had introduced the city to a new audience, but this one will show its streets, its neighbourhoods, its history, its present. At the same time, the title unknowables, the Biennale needs to be able to find new ways of naming itself. Is the name now a cliche, a cliché of urban decay, or will it one day be a word that describes the urban condition, describing the way in which some of our cities are becoming, or will one day be the other? I like the latter, because then we can choose to be creative and imaginative and turn the city into a place where things that used to be urban can return, like the biennale itself. Maybe the best way to think of the area around the Biennale, as a ‘city of some…’, will be the way in which a biennale, for me, is a synoptic event, a kind of a ‘three-day ‘ that connects the past, the present and the future’. This is the kind of synoptic event that the biennale, for me, should be able to pick up: it’s the right time, the place and the draw. But for the reasons I have mentioned, and which seem obvious to most of you, the Biennale had better be able to pick up, too. If it doesn’t, it’s like</text>

Is the name now a cliche, a cliché of urban decay, or will it one day be a word that describes the urban condition, describing the way in which some of our cities are becoming, or were already becoming, indistinguishable from one of its iterations? I know that the Biennale’s present curatorial purpose will be to a large extent determined by the city’s biennale, or rather by the city’s tourism board, which may or may not be beholden to the city’s economic well-being. I also know that the Biennale’s future curatorial purpose will be to a large extent determined by the city’s biennale, or perhaps even by tourism board members themselves. And if tourism does play a part in the future of the biennale, I can play that too. The challenge for the Biennale is to find new ways of linking its diverse areas of operation into a shared set of priorities. That is, of organizing itself, of becoming more than just a tourist attraction. The biennale is a complex enough organisation that it is easy to lose track of the many different parts.</text>

Beyond the obvious titles, there are other, more subtle ways in which the Biennale can be reoriented. For example, the Biennale’s partnership with The Economist may be work, but its primary purpose is to sell books. The Biennale’s other partnerships, including its main book-sales platform, BinderTown, have clearly evolved into what is more or less a fixture of the exhibitionary complex. The Biennale has become almost like the exhibitionary complex itself. It has its exhibitionary purpose, but it also has a social, cultural and even geopolitical purpose that is often confused. The primary use of the name ‘Biennale’ today is in reference to a specific, limited edition of the Venice Biennale that was curated by Paolo Baratta and Todd Meyers in 2013, and which sold out in seconds.

Is the name now a cliche, a cliché of urban decay, or will it one day be a word that describes the urban condition, describing the way in which some of our cities are becoming, particularly in the world, what David Harvey has called, ‘cities of no return’? [3] And if, in the future, a city does come to mean something beyond the city it is named in, then the Biennale’s present and future identifications will need to be contingency plans for what happens when cities no longer exist. In an earlier experiment, conducted in 1990, the name turned out to be a mistake – initially, at least. [4] To understand the mistake made in that year’s Biennale, it’s helpful to know a little about how we name things in the world we photograph. After all, the world we photograph is a city, and its streets and lanes and congested cities are a museum. A city is a historical entity – a collection of places – and its streets, parks and streets – a city – a museum. A city is a place, and its citizens, residents, inhabitants</text>

The exhibition will need to find a way to describe the processes that are transforming the city, and naming will be crucial to that. This could mean recognising that the city is entering a ‘postindustrial era’ – one in which manufacturing is no longer the engine of growth – and that the city is experiencing a double-bind. On the one hand, the proliferation of service-providing industries means that it is no longer possible to completely eliminate waste collection, yet on the other, the proliferation of useless and superfluous forms of consumer goods-consumption means that it is also no longer possible to completely eliminate waste collection. The city is releasing huge quantities of waste into the environment, creating a multitude of problems that are difficult to solve, and finding it increasingly difficult to predict which problems will emerge from the chaos. New urban forms are emerging, punctured at the seams by a multitude of competing</text>

Is the name now a cliche, a cliché of urban decay, or will it one day be a word that describes the urban condition, describing the way in which some of our cities are becoming, or are they becoming yet another international destination for wealthy countries? We don’t know, and neither do the artists, who will have to find a word that describes the city in new ways. The challenge will be to find new ways of naming the city that are both poetic and true. This may mean coming up with a new form of urbanity that is both poetic and true – a form of urbanity that isn’t synonymous with what is happening in the city, but that is in no way a synonym for what is happening elsewhere.  [1] The Biennale is a collaboration between MUDE and ARS. Working title drafts were provided by both the artists and the curators. The proposals were then discussed and voted on by the artists and then the curators, with a final decision coming down to which proposal was taken as the biennale name.

In an exhibition that has a name and a mission, the Biennale is expected to act as a sort of back story, telling the same story across several sites, in different time periods. As the name suggests, the mission statement directs the Biennale towards a future city, a particular ‘mission set in motion’. This is the ‘mission set in motion’ that characterises the contemporary curatorial obsession with spatialisation, and that characterises the ‘mission of a biennale’. In other words, it’s the mission that has all the trappings of a historical mission, but with the added twist. The question, then, becomes what sort of twist can the Biennale afford to indulge? The answer, of course, is ‘many forms of presentation’. For the exhibition to be effective, it’s bound to be entertaining in some way, and if it</text>

Is the name now a cliche, a cliché of urban decay, or will it one day be a word that describes the urban condition, describing the way in which some of our cities are becoming, or are becoming yet another form of Hollywood complex, just as the old Hollywood studios were? Probably the latter, as studios everywhere are becoming ever more accessible and commodifiable, and the biennale’s present curatorial mission is to shift the museum away from its traditionally architectural perch and towards that of a biennale, just as the biennial itself shifts its audience away from its traditional architectural perch. For the exhibition to have any real meaning, it’s essential that the word be able to circulate through different forms of social media, and that its use not only mean what it says on the tin, but that which its users actually do and do not believe. For that to happen, the name has to be able to shift through different forms of meaning, and the term has to be able to communicate with the internet. In its current form, the word loses meaning, and the city only gains access to more of it. In an ideal world, the city would be</text>

In an ideal world, the Biennale would be able to declare its true purpose: the preservation and promotion of the city as a unique collection of distinctive sites, sites of extraordinary historical significance, sites of cultural and urban value, sites of future urban construction. Such a declaration would set an agenda that is truly global in scope, and would make the city truly ours. The Biennale should be able to do this, in part because it is a ‘curatorial institution’, and because it is part of a globalised, transnational, interconnected museum industry, which is increasingly important in meeting the needs of urbanization everywhere, as cities are consolidated into ever larger enterprises of infrastructure and services.[3] The Biennale’s current exhibition format is a ‘presentation collection’, presenting a set of objects from different contexts in a particular space.

In any case, the way in which the name is given off the original meaning of the word – by now a cliche – signals a change in the meaning of the word. If the Biennale’s project to name itself after a particular street in the city is a cliche, a cliché of urban decay, or at least a word that is no longer taken for granted, it does a good job of showing some of the transformations happening in the city. The Biennale’s project to name itself after a particular street in the city – henceforthforth to be known as St Vincent’s Day Parade – signals a new and unexpected turn of events. And St Vincent’s Day Parade itself, the Biennale’s announcement that it was holding its gala on the day following St Vincent’s Day, signals a different kind of acceleration.

These questions are thorny, and while the answers to them may be found in metropolitan centres with booming economies and massive police forces, it’s clear that many cities will still struggle to emerge from the shadows and emerge to play their part in creating the future that is promised by their future planners. A few cities are already showing signs of breaking free from the planner’s fantasyland: Pisa, for instance, which glorifies itself as the ‘city of arts and culture’, and Taipei, which recently set a new pace in terms of both architecture and urban growth, even as urban unrest, endemic poverty and a host of other issues still persist. 	But as the World Economic Forum recently noted, cities now account for half of all the world’s economic growth. Perhaps it is time to return to the question: what is the role of a city in this new economy? 	The answer to this question may lead not only to new technologies, but also to new forms of social organisation. 	As anthropologist Ewan Graham Kaylan notes, anthropologists have long known that human societies emerge from biennials: ‘families, communities, tribes, in which social organisation</text>

These questions are thorny, and while the answers to them may be found in metropolitan centres with booming economies and massive police forces, it’s clear that many cities will still struggle to emerge from the shadows and emerge to play their own part in the technological revolution. 	Similarly, as the biennale becomes more international in scope and scale, its own internal contradictions and external pressures are expected to grow. This is why biennials can be counted on to emerge from their local contexts and go global in scope and possibly in the next few years as well. The key is that they do it again and again and again, continuously. 	These are the kinds of things that the biennale must learn to live with, or it will fail. But the biennial must also learn to love being counted among these cities’s inhabitants, and that this lovesick love will eventually subside. Because if it does, then the biennial will inevitably become something else. 	The biennale must learn to be attracted to its local, and global, contexts, because these are the kinds of places where it can grow. And so the biennale must become something that is both deeply local and incredibly global</text>

Creating a headquarters for all cities in a single, national network would also give cities greater control over where, when and with whom they collaborate. It would mean assigning cities equal worth and place in a global map, and giving cities the authority to define their own future. 	Finally, creating a network of cities that all share the same infrastructure and relying on the principles of the ‘New Economy’ would mean creating a common language that governs how cities are produced, distributed and consumed. It would mean creating ‘common spaces’ – places and systems of public use – and ‘common values’ that guide the actions of all city dwellers. It would mean creating ‘common laws’ – social and legal principles that apply equally to all city dwellers. It would mean creating a shared set of symbols and norms that all city dwellers can understand and act upon. It would mean breaking the city down into smaller pieces and</text>

Finally, what does it mean to make a city? The answer to this may be found in a survey of the past few years of British urban history, conducted by architecture and urbanists Edward Sapir and Peter McCaughey, and published in 2008. Called the ‘Survey of Twentieth-Century Urban Change’, the article ‘reaches a consensus that cities are no longer the property of a distinct national or local elite’, based on research carried out on a city-wide scale. The majority of scholars agree that the dominant forms of economic, social and political organisation in cities are now generated and directed by information networks that exclusively serve commercial and institutional interests. The future urban centres are to be found in large, online data-mining operations, run by for-profit and non-profit organisations. These are the cities of the future, in other words — places where algorithms do the heavy lifting and where powerful algorithms</text>

The technological marvel of the 21st century may yet deliver its own horrific dystopia. 	In an attempt to put these fears into perspective, I turn to technologists like myself who have been researching and developing ways to inhabit cities for decades. Most of us were raised in suburbia, and while some of us actually wish we could return to our rural roots, most of us can't. 	Technology is often cited as the savior of cities, but as we all know, technology creates what it means to be ‘city’ in new ways. 	Anyway, the point is that while cities today may be source of so much noise, pollution, desirability and cash, they also breed the desirability of conditions that can develop in that city beyond anything that can be planned or controlled. These conditions are often quite awful, and while they may be desirable to live in, they are not so desirable for long periods of time that</text>

One answer may be found in the question, which has been paraphrased from G.K. Chesterton’s God of Small Things: 	Where Art Thou Now?, in his On Improbable Candor, where he asks: ‘Where is art thou now,  	when the fortunes of empires shifted?’ There, again, we see the metropolis emerging, now larger than life, in its own irresistible flow. We also see the city at work in an industry that depends on it: in this case, the biennial is a major promoter of tourism, and the industry it runs is a major draw for foreign visitors. Art is used not just as a commodity, or as a tool to be used, but as a source of values, a source of pride in a city’s economic success. 	So perhaps, in the present climate, the biennial is an asset,</text>

When I started my PhD, I decided to take a second to catalogue the things I had learned while researching Third World countries during my PhD. I ended up writing a book about my experiences in the Middle East, South Asia and the United States, which I titled  	Worlds Endgame. 	I used the term ‘third world’ loosely, since most of the places I visited during my PhD were located in the developing world. But I did find places where people I’d met before, who otherwise I wouldn’t have met, used the word ‘third world’ to refer to themselves. 	I first met Peter Singer, Ph.D., while researching the ecological ethics of The Waterboys, an American hippie counterculture group that I joined in 1972.

The rise and fall of global cities is one of the most studied phenomena in social science, and while it’s true that in the 1980s and 1990s there was a backlash against globalisation, that period is past and globalisation is here to stay. Globalisation is a set of forces that shape how cities are produced, distributed and consumed, and as a result, cities today are constantly at war with one another. Cities, and the people who inhabit them, are constantly seeking to be captured by these forces and ushered into the socio-cultural mainstream. In the age of the Big Data and Big Data-enabled cities, this is an even more critical concern. It’s easy to capture and control cities with ever-more elaborate bureaucracies and governance structures, but what happens when those people who call the city home wake up every time the core industries of the city change? What happens when the core industries of the city wake up to the</text>

Finally, what becomes of the discarded technologies that are too dangerous, too complicated, or simply don’t work anymore? Will the poor cities fall back into the black society they were in before social media made them invisible? Will the rich cities resort to black markets that use geo-location to map out every possible move an individual may make? Will the poorest cities become breeding grounds for terrorism? City councils, civic groups, academics and other interested parties may now be asking these questions in an attempt to anticipate and perhaps mitigate these effects, but until we collectively tackle the underlying causes and demand solving, there is no way to truly know.  	Ultimately, the role of the technologist is to offer solutions, not to govern or shape reality.

She hopes to one day lead a similar project that collects and integrates this data, in much the same way that Google does, but on a global scale.  	However, collecting and integrating all this data presents its own set of problems. How do you find the best candidates for inclusion in a project? How do you decide which technologies are valuable, and which not? What if the best technology isn’t available in your location? What if the city has a low density of employment? What if the technology doesn’t scale? These are questions that city councils, civic groups, academics and technologists are now asking themselves as cities morph and change shape, and millions of people move into them each year. These questions are thorny, and while the answers to them may be found in metropolitan centres with booming economies and massive police forces, it’s clear that many cities will still struggle to emerge from the shadows and emerge to play their own part in this massive and dynamic globalisation process. 	The main reason why cities are expanding now – by about 200 cities a year – is due to a massive inflow of people, goods and services: people-powered economies. People are the engine of economic growth, and cities are its sails. But these days it’s even more apparent that the vast majority of cities are run by for-profit corporations and their boards of directors. Public agencies are now even more heavily involved in economic development and social programmes – a development that can’t be sustained indefinitely – than in the past, and many local governments are turning to the private sector for public works and social programmes. 	Meanwhile, the inflow of people and goods does not always manifest itself as a growth market for the most benefit to the city. 	Over the past twenty years or so, a number of local and regional trends have converged to create what sociologist Britt Jurgensen calls ‘dis</text>

That is, I picture it as a place where the world can be made wild again, where nature herself is able to reanimate anything that falls into her purview. The idea of the horizon is used as a keystone of two great cultural systems that together constrain what is and is not possible in the contemporary world: capitalism and colonialism. The idea that there’s a way of thinking about and constructing the world that doesn’t include or include fossil fuels seems to me foundational. As important as it is to understand the ecological fallacy, comprehending its political effects is even more crucial.The other keystone that comes to mind is the value of labor. Capital maximizes the value of labor by promising tremendous returns on invested labor, which is to say, the amount of labor expended in a given product or service over and above what it takes to make that product or service in the first place. In capitalist societies,</text>

This is a fantasy, of course. But I’m drawn to the idea of the impermanence of meaning, the idea of the human potential for meaning-making. So I’m particularly interested in how these two dimensions of the horizon are related and how they intersect. I think that the ability to persevere in the face of uncertainty is a fundamental human capability. And so, for me, the ability to persevere in the face of uncertainty is a key concept that we can draw upon in our thinking about the world.And so, I think that during the past twenty years or so, the way that we conceptualised and conceptualised the human potential for change has led us astray. We have this notion of the ‘episodic’ where there’s some sort of fixed point in time where things happen. And so, if you take the example of climate change, we have some vague notions about what that might mean in the future,</text>

As our text 'Life and Death' from the Polish biennale of 1967 puts it: ‘Life begins at the boundary between what is real and what is not so that death might mean the beginning of something new’.  And so we’re told, and so it is with biennials: every now and then, a narrative voice or narrative arc starts somewhere, somewhere beyond the biennale itself, and it goes on to tell the story of the biennale as an entire global phenomenon.In the book I write about the 1967–74 biennale season, I reconstruct the curatorial process, its literary and curatorial components, and the curatorial mission statement of the Rome–based</text>

Biennials’ imaginations are forever open to the possibility that humans might devolve into subservient forms of cultural consumption. There’s a reason why biennials tend to inhabit the denser and more cosmopolitan parts of the globe. It’s a place where the limits of human potentiality are engendered. In that case, the biennial would be no more than the most recent appearance of the ancient Oriental empires – a rarefaction of art produced by and for a Western audience. I’m thinking of the medieval Islamic collections in museums across the world that are now overflowing with works by artists from all over the world demonstrating the same basic ideas. These collections would be collections of dreams, incomplete however as they are today.

I see a world in which art, poetry, history, architecture, landscapes, animals and all the strange symbiotic relationships among them all simply become things that happen to be human-generated, because that’s what human beings are made to do. And so I’m drawn to the notion of a primordial place and the capacity for art and creativity to emerge from it. I don’t yet know what that would look like or how we might build it, but I’m pretty sure that there’s no way that we would be able to build it ourselves.

The nature of the ecological fallacy has forced many artists to reconsider their artistic potential, and the potential for artistic destruction through consumption is real. But the force of technological culture is different now than it was in the 1980s. The potential for aesthetic disruption through technological means is greater. And the biennial can offer its members a range of creative alternatives, including travelling to different cities in different regions of the world for various reasons, such as to meet different cultures. 	The main obstacle to this dynamic is the biennial itself. It’s true that the 1980s were a golden age for the biennial, with the N.E. having been celebrated in Berlin for several days in January, and the Surreal Foundation in New York for several weeks in March. But the technological culture that emerged in the 1980s also restructured the biennial as a museum-like institution, and the museum-like institution became something that could be easily adapted to other circumstances, rather than an enduring unit that is always at odds with other cultural forms.

The potential for displacement and fragmentation existent within the biennial, but the potential for cultural renewal and political agency are also present within it. The relationship between the biennial and the local community is complex, and while the biennial is an institution with fixed places in the city, the community has the final say in the organisation’s future. This is why biennials can be so impactful in turning a city into a new cultural centre, turning it into a cultural tourist attraction, and thus can create so many new paths open up for artistic and cultural activity. After all, the biennial is an inherently political act, and so is the community it comes to. 	But the biennial doesn’t own those cultural spaces or those biennials.

The nature of the ecological fallacy has forced many artists to reconsider their artistic potential, and the role of the artist becomes suspect. In the contemporary art market, this is particularly evident in the form of the contemporary artist, whose work is often replete with ethical dilemmas. 	Art has always been a controversial field, and the biennial has its share of detractors as well. From its early days, when artists and arts organisations used to meet in secret places, to the present-day situation in which artists and arts organisations are often lumped together, there is a tendency to demonise the biennial as a whole. But the biennial has its moments of strength, and a place amongst them – as a valuable addition to a city – where it plays a vital part in enabling the city to function.

Her metaphor is powerful, and powerful metaphors can create power. But it is not metaphorical power, and it is not just to those who understand the power of metaphor. Power corrupts metaphor, and when that happens, power tends to corrupt. And Ndebele does not mean that artists should embrace everything that comes to them in the form of metaphor. On the contrary, Ndebele points out that artists need to be watchful not to let their idealizations of things outside of their reality interfere with their work.

The nature of the ecological fallacy has forced many artists to reconsider their artistic potential, and the importance of collective action. But the biennial has an inherent cultural edge as well as a material one, and its edge is what creates the biennial as a distinct species of art form. The kind of cultural edge that draws in members of the local community and produces distinctive art forms emerges naturally from the material properties of the biennial itself. The kind of cultural edge that produces distinctive art forms is a concept that has been continuously evolving (see my book Animals for an overview of this process), and its definition is a story that artists tell, and often modify their stories to fit their cultural situations.  	Artists, curators, artists’ associations and arts administrators have all developed formal and informal ‘buck-stops’ to discuss and negotiate the edge and materiality of the biennial, and the possibility of displacement and fragmentation within and against it. These cultural moments have all evolved out of a need to deal with the politics, the materiality, and the inf</text>

The nature of the ecological fallacy has forced many artists to reconsider their artistic potential, and the potential loss of engagement and engagement is common among those who have been conditioned by the biennial format. Meanwhile, the biennial also tends to educate, and in this sense, is itself subject to the discipline of cultural education. Both the aesthetic and scientific senses of the word are used the same, and the same intentions are promoted through both the biennial and the museum. The question is, which senses are experienced? If the biennial encounters the same crowd in the same place over and over again, with the same people in the same set of settings, and in the same cultural landscape, then it’s art in the same sense that you’d find in a gallery. But what makes the biennial different from other art forms is the fact that it encounters crowds in an infinite variety of situations, situations and orientations. It can take multiple forms: it can be static, subject to the same people meeting in the same place for centuries to come, moving from there to</text>

The nature of the ecological fallacy has forced many artists to reconsider their artistic potential, and many biennials are now doing so. But the ecological fallacy is real and can be overcome. Art’s ecological politics are political, and its political aims are economic. 	The biennial is a spectacular example of an art form that emerged during the twentieth century and has continued to struggle with the aftermath. The biennial emerged in part to address the fact that art events were no longer confined to major art centers, but spread out over the country, and that cities were major bases for art practice. The importance of this shift can be seen in the biennial’s tenth edition in 2017, when New York and L.A. emerged as the biennials with the most audience growth, incorporating both the art and the city at large. The biennials have become so prevalent in urban areas that they are now the third largest segment of the art market after the biennials and large curatorial programs.

The new cultural hotspot was created not in Berlin but in Liverpool. Yet the biennial’s technological edge has its roots in the theatre, and much of its cultural power derives from the technological edge. For example, the theatre is the battlefield of the biennial, but the cultural edge is in fact what draws in members of the local community, and what creates the biennial as a distinct entity.

The nature of the ecological fallacy has forced many artists to reconsider their artistic potential, and the powerful cultural and urban strategies that they once pursued. But the biennial is itself an inherently political act, and as such, it is also subject to the whims and fads of museum and gallery ownership. The current economic and political conditions in the world today would render many biennials virtually non-existent, but that does not mean that such biennials are not political acts. That is, in the world of the biennial, the art world is just as important as the rest of the museum, and just as important in its political engagement. The biennial is the world of the political. It is an arena in which art can play a role in creating social change, and its political implication is just as real today as it was then. 	What makes the biennial different from other art forms, and what makes it its own form? 	In its modern and contemporary forms, the biennial is an occurence, and the museum or art gallery is a</text>

The nature of the ecological fallacy has forced many artists to reconsider their artistic potential, and the role of the artist in decolonising processes. For example, the failure of the Biennale to secure funding from the Arts Council meant that other artists were free to attempt similar initiatives. The failure of the Arts Council meant that other artists had to be creative to fit in, and that some artists were already precursors to others in doing so. The failure of the Biennale meant that other artists had to be more nimble and nimble still. 	Finally, the failure of the Biennale meant that other artists had to find other places to be creative, and that other artists had to find ways to meet those artists’ needs in their local communities. This last condition is a continual struggle for artists to maintain visibility and sustain relationships with communities where conflict is common. It is a struggle that some artists, myself included, have had to wage alongside other artists, in an effort to maintain artistic independence.

The biennial may still desire to declare an area ‘ecologically pristine’, but it is now also clear that such a declaration is unnecessary. The ecological fallacy has also forced many artists to reconsider their position within the artworld, and the extent to which their work is actually meaningful in the larger scheme of things. 	In a recent poll of artists who have their works exhibited internationally, almost half (47%) responded that their work is now often or always situated within the context of conflict and conflict. Many (22%) said that they no longer identify with the genre, and 21% said that their work is often or always situated in the context of negotiation and compromise.

The exhibition will be organized in part to commemorate the centennial of the Canadian Space Agency (2013), and its history in transit and in the history of Canada — a country that it is often cited as a founding member of — and one that it still operates under. It will also be a moment to remember those who have died or are dying in transit. This is a difficult subject for a museum to tackle, partly because it is believed to be so powerful in capturing the public’s imagination and making it visible, but also because it is believed to be so powerful in erasing its presence in the real world. This last aspect is perhaps the most difficult for curators to master, although it is possible that a museum administrator will encourage a curator to pursue a project through a financial support or grant, or even to undertake the project on its behalf. In this case, the project will almost certainly be a self-serving one driven by</text>

The curatorial faculty’s research agenda includes a project on the history of artist-led transit art in Canada, a project on the Karen Family’s First Nations Historic Site in Vancouver, and a project on the South Fraser Valley's Gold Hill Transit Corridor. The curatorial faculty also organizes the International Transit and Art Association’s International Exhibition Circuit, taking place in early 2018 in Vancouver. At the U.S. and European levels, the faculty has been collaborating with the Biennalee de Montréal and the World Biennalee on a new research project entitled Institutions and Crisis.

It will also explore the role of art and design in the creation of a new architecture that will accompany the ongoing growth of urban centres in the North. An overview of the major transit transit routes, schedules, and stations will be provided. The North will be the site of a major transit hub, with over 200,000 inhabitants expected to inhabit the metropolitan region surrounding Toronto. Although Canada’s largest city, Toronto still lags far behind other major European metropolises in terms of population, with over 100,000 residents. Achieving the ambitious goal of creating a ‘transit culture’ is a top priority for the new urban development in Metro Toronto. This is evident in the city’s planning and development, which often times exceeds the capacities of the city itself. Toronto’s rapid growth necessitates a massive transit system, but it also necessitates a cultural and recreational district that is as physically expansive as possible</text>

I give the answer to that in both my first and second definitions, but you get the idea. In the first definition, I inhabit a place because I’ve lived there one way or another my whole life; I’ve been to the same schools, the same cafes, the same theatres, the same museums; I’ve seen the same plays, the same restaurants, the same football grounds; I’ve seen the same clubs, the same community theatres; I’ve taken part in the same marches; I’ve taken part in the same festivals; I’ve taken part in the same charity events; I’ve taken part in the same charity lectures; I’ve joined a church or a mosque; I’ve taken part in a political campaign; I’ve taken part in a kibbutz or a kibbutzim; I’ve taken part in a kibbutznik’s chicken‑ or pork</text>

I give the answer to that in both ‘On the one hand, a place means everything; on the other, it means nothing at all.’ On the one hand, a place has meaning; on the other, it has no meaning at all. On the one hand, a place has history; on the other, it has no past.1.  Urban space, from Panthéon Lefebvre, Environments Romain (Paris: CACCA, 2001).2.  The concept of ‘infrastructure’ is used in the construction of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, tunnels, ports and other urban structures, according to the Geography of Infrastructure: Transport &amp; Logistics, Third International Conference of the American Society for Engineering Geography (New York and San Diego, 2005), p. 28.3.

We need to make sure that when we visit them, we do so with the intention of inhabiting them and inhabiting the places we visit. And we need to do that in a certain way, so as to not just visit but inhabit those places and neighbourhoods once again.This brings us to the second aspect of the question: what does it mean to inhabit a place? I give the answer to that in both ‘On the one hand, and on the other’. I think that the key distinction between the artist and the urbanist is that the former creates a work around an idea, while the latter pursues a more accurate depiction of reality. The difference is that the urbanist projects outward, whereas the artist projects inward. So I think the distinction is important.For a place to be 'obscure', ‘itali’ – to have a name or a concept – has to be tangible, measurable, controllable. And to achieve that, a place has to be inhabited, and tangible, measurable and controllable to a specific group of people. Not all places can be considered ‘hidden’ or ‘under-the-radar’ places, because they don’t have a name or a concept, but they have to have that presence and that presence needs to be identifiable and controllable.

I give the answer to that in both ‘On the one hand, of course, but also of course, in the future, when we’re actually inside the place and experiencing its possibilities’.A place is a situation or set of possibilities, such as a situation or set of relationships between people or objects. Think of a city as a city as a situation or set of possibilities. And I think that part of the answer to ‘On the one’ and ‘Outside in’ is to inhabit the city as a city.As an example, the question that came up in the Liverpool Biennial 2016 exhibition was whether or not the Biennial could be a ‘city in which art does real work’. And the answer to that is: yes, it could. But I think it would be very difficult to achieve that in a city with its own unique character and its own unique set of possibilities.I remember, years after the fact, when a group of artists who had been invited to</text>

I give the answer to that in both ‘On My Words’ and ‘With Your Feet’: it’s a very powerful way to inhabit a place, to know the histories and present-day circumstances of that place, and to know that there’s life in the city that’s just as beautiful and just as varied. It’s to experience that sense of present-day reality that’s being imposed, whether it’s capitalism or whatever else is happening. We need that sense of inhabitation, because if we don’t have that sense of inhabitation, we’ll be unable to inhabit the life that’s being imposed upon us.On My Words: the opening lines of Terry Gilliam’s seminal neo-noir classic, Armor, are a chilling indictment of modernism and the violence of modernist infrastructure.

But even if you’ve done a great impression of the place, it’s still entirely possible that the artist has left out a vital detail or that the building they’re living in is a fantasy. In those rare cases when a place is rendered real and brings with it a wealth of positive changes, it’s a good thing, because then you can start reimagining the place.But even if you manage that correctly, there are still places that need to be visited. We need to make sure that when we visit them, we do so with the intention of inhabiting them and inhabiting the places we visit. And we need to do that in a certain way, so as to not just visit but inhabit those places and neighbourhoods once again.This brings us to the second aspect of the question: what does it mean to inhabit a place? I give the answer to that in both ‘Forks’ and ‘Treads’ – the two broad categories that make up the British notion of ‘heritage’. For example, ‘Forks’ are the areas around heritage buildings and exhibitions, and ‘Treads’ are the area around shops and other commercial activity. Heritage buildings are places of meaning and significance in British cultural history and architecture; they’re where we find the stories told and the traces of an organisation’s practices left. The significance of ‘Forks’ and ‘Treads’ becomes evident when we turn to look at a building like the ‘Curtains for Homes and Property’ exhibition that was mounted in the Forks at the Liverpool Biennial. We’ve all seen the news stories about the incredible things that have been done to them, but what does it mean to be ‘heritage’? When we turn to the arts, we</text>

I give the answer to that in both ‘On the one hand, of course, but on the other, of making the place meaningful and alive and … well, on the other’. In either case, the question is, how? If we start making the place meaningful and alive and dynamic and … well, on the other, we stop being people who live in it and actually move to it and become part of its fabric? This is an interesting point of entry into the city: it’s possible to inhabit one of its neighbourhoods and not be part of the city. I don’t think that would be my cup of tea, or that I would want to be someone who appropriated and appropriated from others. But it does mean that we need to respect and inhabit the places that are given to us. This is an important distinction to make, and it’s a distinction that cities like to make.It’s also an interesting distinction to make in the context of the current conflict in Gaza:</text>

I give the answer to that in both ‘In My Mémara’ and ‘In My Pocket, for Pete’. It’s not so much the place itself as the way in which it is inhabited. It’s as if the inhabitants of a city have their own metropolis, or perhaps it’s the same if the inhabitants of a city have their own metropolises. In either case, the metropolis is an entity that derives its identity from a set of relations between different places. Its spatiality derives from a common form of economic exchange that takes place between places. And so, for example, the metropolis derives its character from the fact that the city buses, which run every 15 minutes between each station, stop every 90 seconds at stations 3, 5, and 7, and 10, and which also happen to be the commercial streets. So the metropolis is a ‘spatial phenomenon’ that is constantly in motion, constantly changing, but also a phenomenon</text>

I give the answer to that in both ‘Where are the Queens’ and ‘When Is the Last Time I Was in Queens’.Queensborough – the place where the Concorde Will Never Walk Again?When I was young, I used to love to read the local newspaper, The One Show. It was the paper of the local Jewish community, a bastion of democratic values and a bastion of opposition to the racist political and economic machinations of the local Hindus. The Jews were often at odds with the political viewpoints of the Hindus, but they had a newspaper that the BJP couldn’t control. So the Hindus would often form coalitions with other political persuasions to fight the nationalist projects of the city, like the British East India Company. Sometimes those coalitions were so strong that the nationalist projects were defeated at the polls.Today, the Jews of Queens are more or less integrated into the community. There’s a small minority who identify as Bangladeshi, and they tend to be</text>

I give the answer to that in both ‘On the one hand, a place means everything to you’, but on the other, it’s also a concept that can be described as completely abstract, completely devoid of meaning, and utterly devoid of value]: ‘a concept describes an area or space that has been defined, or is defined, or is inhabited’. In short, ‘a place’ includes its inhabitants.I think that conceptually speaking, the answer is a resounding yes. I mean that in conceptually speaking, ‘a place’ includes its inhabitants’. But when we actually get to know and inhabit that place, we find that there are other concepts at play, and they’re very subtle and powerful. When we visit a place, we actually visit a different place: a different time, a different world. And when we move between those places and times, we actually alter our current location and time. This is one way in which the urban is</text>
