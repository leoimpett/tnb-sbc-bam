The museum, then, is a site of constant re-telling, in which the same people engage with the same objects and generate the same stories over and over again.

This is the current state of affairs in many cities, although it must be stressed that it is still relatively new, and many places have been around for thousands of years. The museum, on the other hand, exhibits the very real impacts and legacy of these past practices. It is a constantly evolving collection of objects that continually confront the visitor with a variety of dialects and approaches to their real-life practices, often generating new ones along the way. This is true both ‘on site’ and ‘in museum’ – in the sense that the museum itself is a constantly evolving collection of artifacts that constantly confront the visitor with a variety of dialects and approaches to the past. The museum as a real archive remains vulnerable to the real-life, contemporaneous conditions of our times, but it exhibits an impressive amount of the richness, depth and elasticity of the biennial form in its earliest stages. It is a museum of the future, but it is also a museum of the present. So it</text>

This is the current state of things in America and the world, and it is a site of constant change. The museum, then, is a site of constant re-construction, and its nominal curator is the architect Kurt Maier, an American geologist and geologist.8 ‘Kurt Maier’ is a name that has become synonymous with Birmingham, but his career began elsewhere. He was an architect and principal of Maier &amp; Company, a global construction and landscape firm, which was established in New York in 1898. Between 1910 and 1917, he was an Assistant Professor of Architectural History and Theory at Columbia University, where his work often focused on the social consequences of neo-classical modernism. From 1917 to 1961 he was a professor of landscape architecture at the University of Chicago. Between 1961 and 1969 he was a member of the faculty and director of the Center for Advanced Study, a division of the New York Academy of Sciences. Kurt Maier’s major works for the Academy</text>

This is the current state of the art in art museums worldwide. It remains to be seen whether there will be any future for art museums in this globalised and corrupting economy, which worships and depends on the museum as a global commodity and collector. In the present globalised and corrupting economy, the museum is the basis for a future global circulation of images and images – a kind of static display that seeks to capture what it thinks it captures and transmits back to its subjects and audiences, but which also creates and consumes things instantaneously and cheaply.)[3] I have been investigating the relation between virtual and augmented reality, and the curatorial role, in the context of curatorial politics and institutional reform. The way in which the museum is reproduced in relation to its digital replacement is also a site of renewed questioning and inquiry for many curators and artists. My research, conducted in collaboration with Peter Osborne and Elmgreen Bahadur at the University of Alberta, Canada, has uncovered rare and untapped</text>

This is the current state of the art in art museums, and it is a contingency that must be addressed. But what could be done? Would it still be called a ‘museum’? Would it still be possible to visit a museum? Would it still be possible to travel to a museum? In a word, no. The museum is both an object and a ‘present’ – both a building and a collection of objects, which is why it dominates our perception and remains invisible except to a select few. The museum is a ‘collection of objects’, and as such it is both an object and a mythological narrative, sharing with other collections of art and artefacts the burden of describing and documenting. The museum is both a collection and a mythological narrative. And as such it is both the site of exploitation and the refuge of its users. The museum is a collection of  	endowed objects, and as such it too is subject to change and change isomorphic</text>

This is the current condition in much of the world, and from the museum perspective, this is precisely what is needed. If the museum is to retain its cultural value, it is imperative that it becomes something more than a ‘futuristic’ artefactual endowment that serves as a source of capital for future cultural investment. It is needed to stand on its own two feet, and thus acquire a new purpose in and through the world. In doing so, it must adopt a new role within the museum that is not just that of source and consumable mass donor, but also that of a site of constant change and emergence. Ideally, the museum should become both ‘permanent’ and ‘changing’ – both an object of change and an event that simultaneously establishes and unsettles the site and its community of habit. It should draw upon the power of both the past and the future to produce meaning and politics in the world through its collections, but it should also foster a long-</text>

This is the current state of things in many places, and yet, despite this, art remains a component of many different cultural practices. Art today increasingly constitutes a last resort, a last resort because, right now, no one else wants or needs to use it. It is a luxury good, a last resort because, right now, there is nothing else to do with the art market in a given city or neighbourhood. The museum is a last resort because, right now, there is no longer any economic need for it. It is a relic of a bygone age, a relic of a bygone world. Yet, somehow, we feel somehow connected to the museum, its contents, its collection, its mission. We feel compelled to revisit it, to learn more about it, to admire its form and purpose. And yet, somehow, we don’t feel that we belong in any way to the museum. We don’t belong in any of its traditions. Art and art history are made up</text>

This is the current condition in which the Syriac Museum is situated. The building is sinking, has lost its character of a museum, and while its future is uncertain, its present – always in a state of flux and always on the verge of some sort of upheaval – is secure. The question of its survival, on the other hand, looms large.I thought it would be interesting to discuss the idea of the refugee in the Museum context, specifically, in order to understand the particular challenges that face the Museum in this context. The Museum has played a central role in the Arab Spring, but its main mission in the region is to chronicle the lives of the people living there – a historical task that requires a sustained and systematic narrative construction that creates a sense of place and identity for the viewer. While this is a challenging task, it is also critical that the Museum is not only a place where images of struggle and triumph take place, but that it is a non-recognisable image. It is imperative that the</text>

This is the current predicament of cities: they tend to decay and to be replaced by something else, but they also tend to get transformed by something else. This is the historical situation of the city in the 21st century, and although there are many ways to react, the main way to talk about and respond to this is through art and cultural institutions. This is the current situation of the biennial in the 20th century, and although it is possible to develop a biennial that is not in competition with other art forms, it is also possible to develop such an art form only at other art institutions. This is the historical situation of the early modern art biennial, and although it is possible to produce a biennial that is not in competition with other forms of art forms, it is also possible to produce such an art form exclusively at another art institution.

It is a mythological and archival artefact, but without any real markers of social or political significance. It is a mythological and archival artefact, but without any real markers of cultural significance. It is a mythological and archival artefact, but without any real markers of value or value-producing potential. This is the current condition of post-factum.  One could also argue that the museum is part of a larger urban-regeneration discourse, not just in the sense of an underlying agenda that is framed and negotiated by the museum itself, but in the sense of a body politic that is both culturally aware (the body politic) and economically responsive (the metropolis). The museum is a site of contact, making, and mythmaking, but it exercises considerable political and symbolic power as well. It is a powerful representative</text>

This is the current state of things in post-metainterface society. There is no clear or consistent understanding of what a ‘present’ actually means in contemporary capitalist societies, and no clear or consistent desire among artists, curators, collectors and others to create and inhabit ‘the present’. The notion of the ‘present’ is a complex one, and while it is commonly believed that the present is a fixed and certain state of affairs, it is also widely believed that ‘the present’ is an ever-expanding and ephemeral concept. Therefore, there is a tension, which is sometimes expressed as ‘contemporaneous’ness. This tension is particularly evident in the contemporary art world, where the contemporary art buyer is largely engaged with the idea of the contemporaneousness of art as it transpires that there is no longer a fixed time or place of contemporary art making. Contemporary artworks are produced at a price and in a form that continually</text>

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and ensuring that its 80,000-plus drivers have a smooth trip through the city. In addition, it will be able to monitor its surroundings and act accordingly, all while remaining in the driver’s seat. This kind of autonomy is unprecedented in human history, and it will confirm the fears of technologists everywhere that autonomy brings with it new kinds of social and political change, new ways of governing the urban terrain and in particular, new ways of oppressing urban dwellers.When thinking about how to build future urban environments that are as conducive to the flourishing of these new kinds of autonomous vehicles as possible, it is useful to recall the ways in which the automobile was invented. The automobile was originally designed to transport fuel between ports, mainly by rail. But in the late nineteenth century, new forms of transport emerged that could transport goods faster and more cheaply. These included fishing boats, which could ply their trade across vast oceans; and planes, which could be flown at extremely high speeds – superson</text>

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and ensuring that cars leave the city wherever possible. The question for researchers interested in this kind of autonomy is what kind of social consequences will this have? As autonomous vehicles become more and more advanced, the kinds of social and political changes that would follow from such developments will become increasingly difficult to predict. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of this kind of autonomous vehicle research may very well be the ways in which it can alter the social conditions that create and foster such chaos. This kind of research may very well lead to changes in the ways in which we govern society, including the way in which we govern ourselves.This kind of research may very well end up producing social changes that are as positive as the technologies that brought us them.

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and ensuring that everyone on the road has access to electricity and gas, but it will also be able to drive itself to work, exploring unfamiliar urban environments and the landscape around it, and learning from its mistakes along the way. It will be able to do things like park itself, or find a nice spot for lunch, or just wander about for a while. It may even find time to play with its toys and do some exploring of its own. This kind of expansive capability is unprecedented in human history, and it will make possible ‘technological unemployment’ – the future promised job opportunities created solely by algorithms.These kinds of capabilities may sound good in theory, but in practice they tend to blur the distinction between artist and artist. The autonomous vehicle that emerges from this race to automate will be able to produce beautiful artwork with minimal human intervention, but it will also be able to produce terrible art that people simply can’t deal with.

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and ensuring that travel plans are executed at the highest levels. It will also be able to analyse its environment and learn from its mistakes, as it continues to drive itself along the highway. This kind of autonomy is unimaginable in the real world, where people have to drive, but it will allow for massive amounts of data capture and transmission. In addition, the vehicles will have sensors that monitor their surroundings and act according to planned routes, based on data collected from the roads. This kind of autonomy is unimaginable in the context of cities, but it will allow for massive amounts of data mining and acceleration of data-collecting operations.The autonomous vehicle that emerges out of this race to automate will be able to travel at higher speeds, at higher altitudes and in more-complex situations. It will operate in zones where traffic congestion and pollution exist, and it will employ advanced computer algorithms to determine the optimal route and the maximum speed for travel.

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and other traffic problems, and it will do so autonomously, doing things such as automatically parking itself or turning off its Autopilot feature when it detects that the vehicle is lost or damaged. In theory, this kind of autonomous driving will also reduce the need for humans in the vehicle, since the vehicle will be able to park itself and return to normal traffic flow as soon as possible.The autonomous vehicle will also be able to recognise objects at a distance of up to 300 m (98 feet) in the city and act accordingly. For example, if a car breaks down in the city, it will repair itself by repairing roads, bridges, tunnels and other infrastructure along the route it takes to get to work. The ability to repair itself in this way is the singular ability to repair, or, more specifically, the singular ability to self repair. In other words, the autonomous vehicle will not only repair itself, but it will also learn and be able to do new things with this knowledge.Artificial</text>

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and helping people to get around the city in dense, urban areas where parking is an issue. And although it will likely need human drivers at the wheel, the autonomous vehicle will likely do most of the driving itself. This kind of thinking about autonomy and human capacities comes from Ray Kurzweil and David Deutsch, who were both employed by General Motors at the time. In addition to researching the origins of the enormous amounts of oil consumed in the US and in countries including Saudi Arabia, Kurzweil and Deutsch theorised that the rapid growth of population in the developing world would eventually lead to a crunch in the global supply of oil. If the number of cars on the road increases by 50 percent or more, the amount of oil consumed per car goes up by a factor of four. Kurzweil and Deutsch concluded that the way to stop that from happening was to build massive artificial cities in places where the car already occupies a majority of the market. These kinds of theorising are</text>

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and ensuring that cars leave the city only when there are cars available, rather than when there is no car available at all. This kind of autonomy will eliminate the need for drivers to be trained and will also eliminate the need for pollution, as a large percentage of cars currently run on diesel, a fossil-fuel that causes massive amounts of pollution and is a by-product of the car industry.Conversely, when the autonomous vehicle that emerges out of this race to automate begins to pollute, it will also become increasingly difficult to repair and maintain. This is the situation in the US and other advanced capitalist nations where autonomous vehicles are being developed. Once autonomous vehicles become commonplace, it will become increasingly difficult to reverse their development, because the pollution generated by them will outstrip the capacity of the infrastructure to deal with it. And this is why autonomous driving is predicted to cause such a mess – because the infrastructure is stretched to the limit trying to deal with the pollution generated by the vehicles that will soon be the</text>

It will be called ‘confined to urban environments’ and will be able to travel at speeds up to 70 km/h (43 mi/h).

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and making traffic lanes more useful, even while staying within the confines of established urban regulations. We could also consider the possibilities of this kind of autonomy in the context of war, in which case the vehicle would descend into a war zone where civilians are at risk and where warring nations would like nothing more than to turn around and flee the scene of the carnage.In any case, the autonomous vehicle will be able to detect and avoid obstacles, and it will know how to use its surroundings – knowledge that will enable it to negotiate urban environments and make smart decisions. For example, in the context of a war, the autonomous vehicle could devise a strategy to cross open terrain, avoid obstacles and maximize its speed, in part to avoid being hit by incoming fire. In this way, the autonomous vehicle could obliterate its enemies without losing any more ground than it gained in the process.Think of all the jobs that could be created in the context of war, and consider how this would enhance the prospects of developing nations</text>

For example, the self-driving Tesla Model S will be able to drive itself, avoiding traffic jams and other obstacles along the route it takes around the city. The race to develop such vehicles will be fierce, and some researchers envision it as a ‘race between worlds’. In this scenario, the autonomous vehicle would be able to explore worlds where humans have no place.This kind of thinking about the autonomous vehicle comes from the British philosopher and historian Edmund Blair, whose influential book Systemics, or the Philosophy of Automation (1977) captured a clear articulation of the way in which the machine is embedded in our contemporary social and political structure. In Blair’s account, the autonomous vehicle doesn’t have a body, but rather relies on principles of momentum, control and perception that emerge from a conceptual and empirical bottom-up approach to reality. These principles of momentum, control and perception allow the vehicle to accelerate or decelerate, change direction, take evasive action and more. In other words, the autonomous vehicle doesn’t have a body but rather relies on momentum</text>

This is especially true for the large scale biennials such as Venice, which have a board of directors elected by the artistic director or the museum board. 	However, it can also be the case that the art director or the curator is merely providing a platform or resources for the artist to explore the art/artism in a project that is either already underway (such as a museum project) or is about to be initiated (such as a biennial). In either case, the resources and/or platform should be used responsibly and ethically, while encouraging creativity in a responsible way. 	The biennial board would need to be empowered to make such a change, and it would need to be approved by the cultural commission (which would then direct the curatorial hand) and the cultural commission (which would implement the change).  	Another issue is the scale of the changes needed. Currently, the biennial is currently operating at a deficit of almost a billion Swiss Francs due to the Swiss National Gallery not being able to cope with the growth, and</text>

This is especially true for the large scale biennials such as Venice, which regularly rely on the services of an artistic director or curator in charge of an artist-selected group of artists. 	Artists and curators working within the biennial format are expected to deliver transformative experiences for their audiences, but are also expected to have strategies and tactics that are effective in influencing audiences to engage with art in new ways. In other words, there is a difference between creating art for a mass audience and teaching art to a specific audience. 	Artists, curators and art institutions are expected to have a long-term vision for how art will be made in their local area, and to adapt their programmes, activities and even language – changing art may be produced through strategies that are intended to appeal to a wider audience. This is particularly important in the increasingly globalised world of biennials, where the artist-curator relationship is vital for the survival of the art form.

This is especially true for the large scale biennials such as Venice, which have artistic directors who also take on other curatorial roles within the institution. 	Similarly, biennials have a board of directors who may include artists, community organisers, writers or other stakeholders, but also practitioners such as architects, journalists, GP divers or others with expertise in areas such as housing, employment or education. 	Finally, and perhaps more importantly, is the role of the artist or organisation in creating the narrative of the biennial or museum-based programme. As biennials become more institutionalised and involve more participants, narratives and themes, it is the artist or organisation who has a substantial say in how the institution is organised and presented. This is particularly true for biennials at the level of large institutions, such as museums, that are keen to engage with their curatorial interests and agendas. It is the biennial that creates the narrative, engages the public, develops the exhibitionary programme and culminates in a biennial itself. 	The biennial form</text>

This is especially true for the large scale biennials such as Venice, which have artistic directors who are responsible for strategic planning and international expansion, while smaller biennials such as Liverpool, which focus primarily on their local communities, may have a curator or a curator who is more interested in the natural world or aesthetic experience. 	Artists and curators are expected to operate in an ethical and socially responsible way, but also to operate independently. It is difficult to define precisely what a biennial is, or how one is defined, but several factors can be identified as being associated with biennials: the increase in the number of years since the last major art exhibition, the proliferation of biennials, the decentralisation of functions and departments, the decentralisation of responsibilities and power, the proliferation of biennials funded by art institutions, and the proliferation of biennials led by cities.

Meanwhile, biennials are usually led by an artistic director or curator, or their representatives, who may or may not include other curators or artistic directors. This is especially true for the large scale biennials such as Venice, which regularly add art and design to the mix of subject matter, pushing the boundaries of what is considered aesthetic. 	Similarly, biennials tend to grow larger with each successive installment, sometimes drawing large crowds to engage in an act of cultural consumption, as in  	The Egyptian Museum’s Egyptian Pavilion, which opened in 2014, or the 2015 Venice Biennale, in which artists from around the world visited Italy, Egypt, and the Levant. In both installments, artworks from the previous visit were brought back to Venice for an encore exhibition in the form of a multi-purpose gallery, a marketplace, a market and a performance venue. 	Although the biennial form has been around for a long time, its current form (commissioned or not) is often seen as an individual or collective decision, and institutions and artists alike often act in reaction to social, economic and political factors. 	For instance, the increasing economic dependency of the Italian region on</text>

Artists and curators often work with the local communities, sometimes through joint initiatives, and often times the local communities themselves. 	Artists, including those from other cities or regions, are often involved in initiatives that are centred around creating an aesthetic experience for the area, such as painting, street decorating, food trucks, live painting, events such as: 	Basilica, Action Bronson &amp; Migos, 	7-9- year-old Oakland Native Alumni of Venice Biennale, 	7-9-year-old Venice, CA Vogue Italy Today,  	8-9-9- inch Plywood &amp; Rubber Boards, Foundation, Los Angeles, USA (2000), 8' x 16' x 24' Base, Tile, vinyl, fiberglass, paints, grime, rope, duct tape, toilet paper, rope, twine, thread, camera,</text>

This is especially true for the large scale biennials such as Venice, which regularly employ hundreds or even thousands of volunteers to survey, photograph and document the city (and occasionally other parts of Italy), and other Italian cities. 	As a result, it is common for biennials to have a curatorial team consisting of a curator, an art director, a reporter and a editor. 	In a biennial, the curator plays a crucial role in guiding the artistic and artistic-political direction of the exhibition. He or she sets the agenda, develops the narrative, draws the artists together and engages them in conversation through engaging them in discussions, probing their motivations and positions and probing their skills. The reporter or editor captures the moment as it unfolds, reporting from the scene, while the curator engages the public via discussions, probing their motivations and positions and delicately weaving the stories together. The art director or curator sets the art, creates the narrative and coordinates the events.

This is especially true for the large scale biennials such as Venice, which often have artistic directors from other cities or regions present who are present and contributing regularly. 	Artists, curators, and artistic directors are often present at the various levels of a biennial, but it is the artists and their representatives, their networks of support networks, who are the true decision-makers. Art is often made accessible to a broader audience through the use of storytelling, but in a biennial format the real power is wielded by the artists and their networks. 	A number of biennials have recently been shown in cities including: New York; Venice; Taipei; and Berlin, which have a history of being creative and progressive, but also have a lot of ageing populations. As biennials become more and more urban, the need to modernise has become more apparent. While it is true that many artists are now working in their natural mediums, such as documentary and journalism, the increasing urbanisation of cities also means that artists are more exposed to the</text>

This is especially true for the large scale biennials such as Venice, which regularly host major exhibitions of new art and contemporary art, and whose collections often include artworks not from the California Biennale. 	Artists and curators have often questioned the necessity and desirability of such large-scale exhibitions, especially in a world warping tourism industry driven by the money of the biennale itself. 	Another issue that often arises is the proliferation of art fairs and the proliferation of curatorial styles. Most biennials these days are either ‘partnered’ or ‘partner’ exhibitions, with curatorial styles varying widely, and often embedded within the exhibitionary structure itself. 	Sometimes the partnerships and partnerships envisaged are actually beneficial, as in the case of biennials in the 1950s and 1960s, when curators from the same city or city regions worked together to develop a shared neighbourhood museum, or ‘community land trusts’, where communities selected, managed and were given ownership of large tracts</text>

Artists are often invited to participate in research projects in the region, but this is typically done through an artistic director or a curatorial slate, not an artistic commission. 	Artistic directors or curators may be invited to undertake artist-curated projects in the region, but this is usually done through an artistic director or a curatorial slate, not an artistic commission. 	In general, although the artists and curators on these commissioning committees may wish to follow conventions or practices that are familiar to art-histories, there is generally little flexibility for such practices to be carried out in the real world. In the case of an art commission, the art commissioner may wish to carry out such practices in the interest of public safety and to protect the identity of</text>

This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, in which we are increasingly compelled to consume media narratives that conform with our own. The number of artists currently residing in the borough has trebled over the past fifteen years, whereas the number of people has remained virtually the same. Perhaps it is that the borough’s economic resurgence has been largely due to the influx of migrant workers, or that the borough has been constructing new high-end district parks in an attempt to cash in on the huge development booms around them (which tend to generate huge amounts of cheap, convenient park space). Whatever the reason, the fact that the boroughs are no longer the main centres for production, consumption and accumulation of wealth in the area does not seem to register with the population. Nor does it seem to register with artists, whose focus has always been more around the community. This disconnect is perpetuated by the fact that the board of the Board of Regeneration is composed of representatives from the local authorities, representatives from the museums and local artists’ collective.</text>

This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, and it underlines the necessity for artists to take ownership of their work and destinies and to actively engage with the social life that results from them. The city is a site of constant change, and as a result the self-image of the locality is constantly in flux. As the Daily Mail article describes, the disinvestment in the borough is a disinvestment in the city. The artist Sarah Nuttall has a project called Moving Image, which is concerned with generating awareness of the effects of deindustrialisation in the borough. She calls it ‘a new normal’; it’s a formula that artists and others have found useful in generating public awareness of the crisis and in turning the disinvestment into something positive. Sarah leads the charge in the Town Hall Art Gallery with a campaign titled ‘Movement ›’. The artworks are strategically placed around perceived weaknesses in the narrative of the argument: the Town of Hastings is in crisis, and the artist Ken</text>

This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, and it goes some way towards explaining why artists are able to create something from nothing, whereas in the past when we were unable to do so we were subject to severe censure and even violence.During the 1970s and 1980s the arts organisations in the area came to develop strategies around displacement and its effects. These have been developed into what are known as the Arts Council UK Strategies. These provide an understanding of the ways in which the arts can be utilised in the council’s housing programmes. For example, the strategy states that: ‘The arts are essential to the provision of a decent quality of life for all council residents, but they are particularly valuable in communities where public art is not widely appreciated or respected’.11   	These strategies were developed through a cooperative between the Council and the Biennial, and were presented in 1980 at a conference of the Council of Europe – the international governing body of the European convention on human cultural resources.12  	These strategies</text>

This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, and it is a position that many younger generations hold to this day. I felt like a passive spectator as an artist was developing strategies for the benefit of the community around me, while my generation watched helplessly as the place that we call home was destroyed. Some of the projects I worked with and supported, such as the FACT and Action Space projects, were so important to me because they were so visionary in their visions of the future of the demolished homes. They connected the destitute with the fabulously wealthy and made them citizens of a community by showing how to live in harmony with nature. Some of the interventions we did not fund because we did not think the politics would ever change. The Homebaked Generation’s actions speak volumes about the state of our politics and society in 2017. The failure of state and municipal government to provide services to the communities where housing and social housing are desperately needed – in my experience, at least – is a pressing municipal problem.

This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, and it explains why artists are able to create transformative experiences through the things they create, whereas the masses who use art are not so easily induced to connect with things they see as beautiful. An artist's contribution to the cultural logic of a neighbourhood is often conditioned by factors such as her or his parents being poor, or the fact that the neighbourhood is in dire need of repair. The indignities of poverty and deprivation are frequently exaggerated in popular culture, but they are real and pressing. My parents are certainly not poor, and neither are the millions of other people’s poor. But they were certainly materially different from me, and although I wanted to be an artist, the fact that my parents would accept art from them because it was part of a scheme to help the area was much more meaningful to me. Even though my parents were not artists themselves, their contribution to the development of the area was significant to me.

It’s a task that needs to be done carefully, because the politics of displacement is all around us, and it’s not just the politics of inherited poverty. The politics of displacement could also be done by and for the people – by and for the communities that are materially affected by the housing crisis. In the end, the fight against the politics of displacement is a generational task, and one that will remain unresolved even if the boroughs around us are redeveloped. This generational context is what artist Norman Greenbaum refers to when he talks about the conditions of post-industrial society. He defines it as follows: ‘Industrial society produces a landscape of its</text>

Most of us live through it. I’m one of many who have had to grow increasingly detached from the projects that are happening all around us. The indignities of living in deprived areas are discussed, but the real agenda of the government, industry and other interested parties does not seem to be addressed.The failure to notice this disconnect and to actively participate in creating a community around the things that are happening in the borough has encouraged a generation of artists to explore the politics of displacement and take control of their own destinies. This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, and it underlines the necessity for artists to find alternative audiences outside of the art world.The ability of artists to create community involvement and generate change through direct action is a direct consequence of the inability to see the city through the prism of its urban development. Deregulation, the destruction of democratic rights, the merging of commercial and non-profit sectors, the privatising of essential public services – these are just some of the many ways in which the city is made visible. In places like Liverpool, the city is often unrecognisable from the landscape – a forest covering an airport terminal, for example – but art is frequently used to obscure or completely obscure the city. Art is not always right, but its involvement is vital in creating change. And it is vital that artists develop strategies that are practical and effective, because if they do not, there is a good chance that change will not be able to be brought about.In her essay ‘Democracy in America’, US scholar Joy</text>

This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, and while there is still a lot of poverty and injustice in the borough, it is now considered a desirable place to live. The city is no longer viewed as a static place – with all its problems solved – but rather as an imaginative and multifaceted place that can be explored and combined. This is an important change from the early twentieth century, when art was often actively engaged with in an attempt to promote a particular solution to a particular problem (as in the work of the MFA students and artists of the 1920’s and 1930’s). This shift is also part of a cultural and urbanisation process; the decline in population and the increase in wealth over the past two centuries has meant that there are now far more people to be around in the borough than ever before, which is why there is so much more turnover in the art world. There is a sense of displacement as much as infusion; the cultural tourism and new urbanisation that is occurring now is in large part due</text>

This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, where the politics of appearance is all around us – not just when we are trying to buy a house, but also when we are trying to leave a house and start a family. This is especially true for women – who are more open to artistic and curatorial intervention and command more of a hand in the creation of the spaces and destinies they inhabit.In the past ten years, a number of artists have actively tried to destigmatise and mainstream the idea that  	housing is a right, and that building is a natural and inevitable part of the process of urban growth. Examples of these artists include  Anna Best and  Monica Ross, whose work is often entwined with the phrase ‘New Economy’, and  	Rachel Maddow, who, in the famous 2008 presidential campaign ad, used her position to urge the public to vote for ‘Change Is Coming to Detroit’.

This is an important distinction in an era of mass media and internet culture, and it goes by many creative names: cultural campaigns, documentary-making, creative industries, and ‘creative destruction’. The term is now more associated with destructive urban developments and the excesses of megacities than with the projects that actually create or improve lives, such as urban regeneration and arts education. But the deep cuts to services, the dystopian decisions of local authorities to banish places from the city, the erosion of trust between citizens and local authorities, and the proliferation of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that do good works in the face of clearly defined public purposes – all these are part of the story. There is considerable room in the picture for the creation of new artworlds and vibrant new cultural districts. But most of us will not find ourselves in the position of Wallace Stevens creating ‘the Green Mile’ as a way to cash in on the environmental devastation of London’s transport network. Nor would we want to.

However, as our urbanisation continues to be facilitated by the biennale, we are increasingly reliant on these vehicles to deliver cultural messages, offer glimpses of hidden meaning, or simply serve as the ultimate laboratories for the exploration of human behaviour. Therefore, it is our responsibility as artists and curator to actively participate in the production of these cultural products in ways that reveal the socio-political context of the industry we are embedded in, the broader cultural consequences of our behaviour, and the prospects for social change.Citizen CuratorEthan Zuckerman explores the need to be autonomous and the illegality of curating at the American Museum of Natural History.

However, this is not realistic for many reasons, foremost of which being the ever-increasing size of the population to which we add to our overcrowded cities. Another is the ever-present need to protect our valuable natural spaces and heritage sites from damage by the ever-more powerful autonomous vehicles that will one day run them, changing the character of the urban environment in which they will be needed.A final but perhaps not idealised form of urbanization is possible, and may yet be possible, in a future city in which humanity is no longer the dominant species: in fact, some advocates of such a future city seem to believe that humanity is now more naturalised than at any previous time. But even this may not be ideal. The reasons why we miss out on great places like the Giardini, Ponte City, the Arsenale, are mainly because of overpopulation, not because we no longer revere the arts as a cultural value.</text>

However, there is no reason to believe that this will happen any time soon, nor the reason why it is so difficult to revoke a parking spot in cities where autonomous driving is encouraged. Instead, the autonomous-driving problem is one of the few remaining parts of the infrastructure that is virtually unchangeable, and the only reason why parking is an issue in cities. Overthrow of the Automobiles that Rule Our CitiesIn the 21st century, the biennale has undergone a radical shift in its programming, increasingly focusing on production and consumption. Demand for tickets has become astronomical, and technology is often cited as the main cause of this abundance.1 It is very easy to create an abundance of things to do with cities: buildings to be refurbished, museums to be reopened, neighbourhoods to be redeveloped. In these cases, the</text>

However, we can do much better than this. We could, for instance, adopt technologies that redirect traffic away from congested centres and towards environmentally sensitive corridors. Such corridors could allow cars to negotiate increasingly advanced physics and chemistry, allowing cars to travel at greater speeds and in much smoother conditions. Such technologies could also make it easier to travel by connecting points of arrival at the airport and ports, allowing cars to negotiate far more densely populated areas. More and more data about the environment that is gathered could be combined with information from autonomous vehicles to form much larger databases that allow much more precise control.Such databases could offer much-needed transparency, allowing citizens and citizens’at-large to review, compare, and ultimately change the way that roads and cities are built. Such transparency could raise awareness of real-time road conditions and allow citizens to participate in designing safer and more sustainable ways to travel</text>

However, we know this is not to be. The reason why cars are more reliable and economical is that people – people only – drive them. Therefore, the autonomy that we claim for autonomous vehicles is an illusion created by a society that oppresses and punishes its people, and this is precisely what happened in the 1970s and 80s, when biennials were given back to the art world.If we look at the situation objectively, our claims regarding the autonomy of autonomous vehicles are fallible, and we must rely on the judgement of those who drive them, as well as those who use them. However, the claim that autonomous vehicles are ‘dangerous’ is one that is constantly made by the autonomous-driving industry, and the claim that they are ‘inefficient’ is another. The fallacy of the autonomy industry’s claims is that the claims are untruthful, and the technology is misused. We are</text>

However, given the inefficiency of our current infrastructure, our dependence on fossil fuels and the inefficiency of our own technocratic capacities, this may prove elusive. Still, we could at least begin to envision a future in which travel is far less appealing and the biennale is once again a global phenomenon. In the meantime, we must plan for the impacts of an abundance of environmental degradation and environmental conflict. If we do not, we risk becoming what Leonardo da Vinci once called a ‘fugitive species’.Download this article as PDFJuliana EngbergJuliana Engberg is Professor in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the University of Alberta.

The upshot of this scenario is that we would once again be able to choose which cities we wanted to be located in and which didn’t. We could choose to live in cities with incredible environmental footprints or in cities that are energy-intensive and reliant on fossil fuels, in effect placing a premium on green credentials. The choice is ours. Right now, we lack the technologies and understanding to truly inhabit both worlds. The choice is only natural.What could possibly go wrong? Unfortunately, there is a reason why we have no interest in living in autonomous vehicles: they break down. There is a reason why we are so fascinated by watching they change shape and move: it is because they are constantly subject to driver error and the unpredictable.

However, despite our best intentions, such radical urbanisation is always bound to face resistance from property developers, urbanists and other vested interests, which is why so many biennials are still set in their historic downtowns or former ‘great urban centres’. We would still have to fight for inclusion and sovereignty, as well as other protections against the growing privatisation of urban functions and infrastructure.As biennials, we would still have to fight for inclusion and sovereignty, as well as other protections against the growing privatisation of urban functions and infrastructure.However, we could eliminate the need for autonomous driving and other technologies that augment the driver’s experience in order to achieve self-sufficiency, and we would still retain the capacity to control our urban spaces and landscapes.

But we don’t live in ideal worlds; we live in constrained and constrained space. And although we profess to deplore urban sprawl and urban factories, we know that building more urban space is good for business, because more space frees up real estate and jobs for people. And if more space is given up for free by the very systems that create and rely on it, we also tend to forget or destroy the spaces that are made available to us. A biennale that truly seeks to make an impact through its collection and dissemination of knowledge – rather than through its actual size or economic impact – would look to reverse the trend of ever-expanding urban bureaucracies, and it would do so by collecting and distancing actual people from the places that are made manifest through their use.

However, the development of self-driving cars and trucks is just one aspect of a much more fundamental change in how we live our lives, and as a result of developing and driving these technologies, we will most likely be socialisedists and bigots, not just with respect to how we live our lives but also in what form and how we choose to live it.The autonomous vehicle and its drivers may one day drive themselves, but to achieve that we must understand the larger philosophical underpinnings and political underpinnings of their motivations. Assembled by an AI, the biennale must assemble a huge number of disparate factors in order to arrive at a decision that is best for the planet. To do so, it often needs to consults a huge amount of text, audio and video data, and other data, in addition to gathering valuable information on its hosts.

The ephemeral forms of production became culturally significant not through their own inherent creativity, but through the cultural production of the social sciences, which promoted the ideology of the contingency of time and the contingency of culture. The social sciences have promoted the idea that culture is an inherently creative force since the beginning of their work, and have promoted the idea that</text>

The biennial as a cultural form and not just an art form. It’s a cultural form, and it’s an art form. It’s also an art form that has a very specific and curatorial task. To be authentic to its own particularised historic forms, biennials have to be able to draw crowds, people who come to see art in a different way from people who come to see art elsewhere. The curatorial and art world needs to recognise that, even though it may teach a valuable lesson in a</text>

It’s part of a broader project that includes research projects at the museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and the California Academy of Sciences, to tell the story of their respective worlds. These are not monoliths; they’re not monolithic historical works of art or architecture; they’re just collections of artefacts, some of which are remnants of a particular time, and others that represent the accumulated effects of a number of events and processes. The collection of artefacts that we call the biennial is a collection of living things, and its collections, or collections, as they’re called, are a back story that reveals deeper narratives and processes. They’re a fiction created by, for and in the presence of humans. And in that fiction, biennials have often had a back story that’s quite subversive and powerful.

It’s a very rich and varied archive. It’s also a very specific kind of micro-site: it’s a physical place to be found, not an archive or a museum but a kind of micro-museum. While the name sounds corny and clichéd, the fact is that this kind of material culture production is what happens in the city, and it’s happening even in the most obscure corners of the city, such as the back streets, where people regularly stroll by and take a look at art that’s being done in various ways. It’s really an incredible thing to see and to be part of, to become part of this rich tapestry that is being woven together. This is not some abstract/idealised notion of the city; this is a deeply political and cultural notion. The micro-biennial is the most at home in this regard, and the biennial as such is part of this</text>

Other times, as in the case of the Chicago Biennial, the biennial commission is the archaeologist Gerald Friedman, who is doing an excavation of the Near East shore of the Lusaka Metropolis, which is just across the border from Afghanistan. The excavation takes place under the auspices of the Afghanistan Archaeological Survey, which is funded by the US Agency for International Development, and so there’s a very real threat of conflict. In this situation, the biennial commission is the one who gets to decide what happens in and around the city. We can think of the biennial as a very specific event, and the reference is to the institution itself, which is made up of many parts and constantly shifting alliances. The biennial is a site where alliances are made and tested, and so the history of the museum, its mission, its resources, its users, and furthermore its audience are made</text>

It’s a very organic process. This is how the American Museum of Natural History, for example, constructed its collection of more than 300,000 specimens from its New York institution: it’s a collection of registers, a structure that gathers information about the past, and a collection of rooms, collections, and collections. It’s the story of how these different elements came to be assembled and what relationship those registers have to the museum’s collection, to tell the story in a wider sense. A biennial, in this sense, is an entity that emerged organically from the museum’s curatorial material. It’s a collection of identities, stories, registers, registers. It’s a collection of places, and the collections inside it. It’s a thing that happens to be happening at the moment when we might be considering what to do with those things.

It’s a very powerful way to bring together a huge number of disparate elements in a much more manageable way. We can think of these as archiving narratives, or at least the process by which such archiving might be understood as a narrative. What I did with my research for my master’s thesis was to dig into the story of the Biennale, and to look closely at some of the tropes and allegories that we might use in the exhibition of that story, such as the ‘black gate’ and the ‘garden of hatred’. I did this through research that I commissioned from a company called Art Link, who specialise in interpreting cultural resources and artefacts in order to support artistic projects within communities. We did this through interviews with curators, artists, historians, journalists and others with a range of expertise, and it brought us to specific points of convergence. It also brought us to questions</text>

It’s a very rich and varied collection. The challenge for biennial planners is to create an environment in which this last half of the museum or archive becomes a micro-site, and a place where this last half of the story begins to be told. It’s a fascinating story, and there’s a place for it in a biennial, but it’s also a place where this story has to be told in a way that creates a politics of the past, and a politics of the present, and a politics of the impossible. And this notion of the museum as a site of power and the impossible is a recurring motif in biennials, whether it’s the politics of the micro-collection, the politics of the archive, the politics of the museum as a collection, or the politics of the biennial itself.

It’s an evolving collection of collections, and their mission is to tell the story of the museum as a whole, and not just to tell the story of the museum as a collection of collections. The biennial is a set of collections, and the collection as a whole is a set of collections. It’s a story told by narrator and a storyteller. And so it’s possible to remove the layers, the registers, the big bureaucracies and the museums, and just get a sense of the present in which we live. It’s possible to reanimate the curatorial form, to get a sense of the contemporary through the movement of people, goods, objects, and so forth. And so biennials can be seen to be telling stories that are, at the same time contemporary and timeless. That’s the</text>

It’s a very interesting way to think about the biennial as a political project. The importance of this story, and the ways in which it is told, becomes evident in the figure of the encyclopedia entry. It’s a report on the world, its cities and their built environment, and the content of the entry becomes evident via a series of bold, fat and legible letters that appear at the top of the page. The crucial role of the index becomes evident in the figure of the first letter in the alphabet, which is followed by six hyphens. The hyphen is followed by a period followed by a letter that becomes capitalised and printed as a single letter: ‘E’, followed by a period and then an infinity of symbols.’ This is how the world is indexed in the index of a newspaper or magazine, or in a web search, as ‘E is capitalised over and over again in an infinite loop’.

And all of this material is then gathered into a very visible form of cultural expression that is generated and sustained by the biennial itself. Every biennial is, to some extent, a retelling of the monumental events that led to the creation of this century, or in some cases a complete retelling. But in the last century, most of the biennial was a creation of the museum, and not of the biennial. The museum was the main venue for the exposition of ideas, and the biennial was the main venue for a particular set of those ideas. In the seventeenth century, the British Museum was the leading biennial exhibition venue. During the eighteenth century, the Royal Academy and the museum were closely tied, and in the nineteenth century, the European Museum was another venue. The museum became increasingly important as a repository for ideas circulating in the wider society, and as a site for a</text>

This is particularly true of the Venice Biennale, a ‘glimmer of the promise of a new ‘cultural geography’ (2) reflected in the name of the exhibition, and (3) a gulp of the European capital of culture of the century, exalting the city as the locus of a new global ‘zone’. But Venice is no longer the locus of a globalised, international aesthetic culture. In fact, the Biennale has long been criticised for its 'giudginess’ – its boorish excess and excess of every kind, with artists exhorting an audience to ‘walk, chew gum, grab a mohair sack’ and ‘swirl it with a bunch of flowers’.

The real girth of the biennale has shifted to a point where it seems almost silly to mention the name again, except as a synonym for ‘this’. (What would a biennale be without girth?)The real girth of the contemporary art market has shifted even further away from the real girth of the exhibitionary market, where real girth is a thing of the past. The girth of the New Biennale is real, as is the real girth of the contemporary art market, where real girth is only possible because of the availability of cheap, abundant, curated art. But these are temporary imbalances, the immanent expression of a larger trend in which real life is displaced (mostly) in the abstract space of art.

But the real girth of the spectacle – the girth of the tissue – has shifted, and sometimes, quite spectacularly so. The real girth of the financial settlement has shifted too. And the real girth of consumption, if we are talking about the goods and services supplied by the Biennale, has shifted as well. Venice Biennale 2017 marks the twentieth edition of the Biennale, and the twentieth consecutive year of the biennale. The name of the artist has been changed to align with the new institutional form that records artists’ contributions to the cultural life of the city, in this case the collection of stained glass windows and window frames supplied by the Biennale itself. The Biennale itself is an undertaking, a ‘legacy‐making enterprise’, so it is sometimes said, and the new forms that it is creating are the contrivances of a curator, a group of curators, a collective of friends, a ‘plaything for public adoration’, that are united by a common pursuit, a common loss, and a common feedback loop</text>

The spectacle is no longer confined to the gilded cage of the museum or the ivory tower of the biennale itself. As the Biennale itself has pointed out, ‘a biannual with a global reach is an ideal venue for “deepened” inquiry and exploration, but it is also a conspicuous oasis between cultures, a den of transient, ephemeral forms of cultural manufacture…’ The biannual form has, in fact, become so embedded in the organisation that it is scarcely noticed anymore. But there is an emerging ‘space’ that is less ephemeral and more persistent, and that is where art will be found, and where culture will survive, thrive and moulder on into the future.’ So ‘real life’ will be made visible in ‘the real life’ of the Biennale. Art’s emergence as a permanent marker of cultural accumulation is a legacy that artists have inherited.</text>

The Biennale is a museum of spectacle now; it displays, because much of what it displays is of no value to us, and we have no use for it. But it is a museum of spectacle, and we are moved by, entranced by, and charmed by what it shows. And those things that make us want to ‘swirl it’, to ‘gird ourselves with flowers’, to ‘gorgeous shops and boutiques and boutiques’, to ‘swirl it in your hand and wave it at the moon’, and so forth. The real girth, I believe, is in the act of being displayed. And this is what contemporary art today attempts to replicate. It is a museum of display, but it is also a museum of repetition – it exhibits many different sorts of objects over and over again, in ever greater numbers, in ever greater amounts, in ever greater patterns, in ever greater</text>

The real girth is in the tissue, not in the buildings, and this is why Venice is so girth. It is a girth that is not of this world. The girth of the cultural commodity. And this is why Venice is the cultural commodity of a different world, in a different world, from the world we inhabit. The Biennale is the price of a different kind of voyaging. That is, it is the measure of a different kind of cultural consumption. And if we over-derive the cultural-materialist cotemporality, we also mis-induce the artistically curious public, who flock to the Biennale to see what a difference the new found wealth of information technology makes to cultural consumption. We over-diver, or design our information-gathering machinery so that it can only ever find the most relevant data, and on that account, the Biennale is growing in size and in quality, in quality-adjusted</text>

The biennale has also commissioned a number of works from artists and organisations operating in the United Kingdom and abroad, including from Liverpool, whose Biennial has been running since 2014, and from the Biennale of Sydney, which began in 1999.

The real girth of cultural capital is in the veins of the real-life performers, the audience. The real girth of cultural capital is in the real-life products of the real-life producers of the real-life goods and services constituting the spectacle. And this is what the Biennale is all about. It is all about the girth of the flesh: the girth of the body as commodity. The girth of the Biennale as a ‘material form’ is this: it is a ‘gift from the gods’, a gift given to the city by the gods, and it is a gift that comes with a price. But the giver of the girth is also the one who charges the giver of the flesh. And that is why cultural tourism today is so important. If the public isn’t aware of the girth of the flesh,</text>

The Biennale has always been about the city and the spectacle, about the world as image (or, rather, simulacrum), and so it is with the city and the spectacle. The Biennale is a production of images, images of the world as image. It is a production of representations – representations of the world as it is produced, depicted and narrated by images. It is a production of what John Berger would term ‘media trap’ – the image is trapped in a media of meaning and behaviour and so cannot escape. And so the Biennale – the production of images of the world as image through the art of exhibition – has entered an era of increasing data-visualisation and multimedia manipulation. Many artists, myself among them, engage with this new media culture of artefacts and symbols that is being created in ‘front offices’ of art institutions all over the globe, in locations all over the world, in venues all over the world.

The Biennale has always been about art being made in and for the Biennale, and about art being made in and for Venice. It is a ‘capital of culture’ in the most conventional and standard sense of the word. It is, however, also a ‘city in crisis’, as the mayor of Venice reminds us, as the Biennale matures and changes, and as the Biennale matures and changes, and as the mayor of Venice reminds us, and as the Biennale continues to grow bigger and more exciting and more unmanageable in the years ahead. And here we see another change, this time at the cultural level. The old guard of the Biennale, long dominated by artists from the city, is beginning to fade away. New artists, many from the city, are coming through the doors, and old guard artists are leaving. But the door that the Biennale left behind is opening quite wide these days</text>

The spectacle is no longer the object of aestheticisation in the form of the Biennale package, but is instead the subject of conscious, archival, questioning, interesting work. And this is what the Biennale does today. It engages with the very real sense of loss and loss of place, of loss of meaning and history, of loss of place, of loss of history. It is, in other words, about loss and loss of place and loss of history.Making the SENSE of PlaceLester ShiltonThe Biennale opened its proceedings on June 17, 1993, and despite the girth of the artwork and the number of works displayed, it ran for nine weeks.

This does not mean that the inhabitants of a given neighbourhood or neighbourhood-region will necessarily adopt the ways and practices described here, but rather that the descriptions here may serve to frame a possible future for the inhabitants of such neighbourhoods or neighbourhoods-regions. This may include, for example, initiatives by local grassroots groups, citizen-curators, artists, academics, grassroots groups and others to take part in the creation or refinement of specific neighbourhoods or neighbourhoods-regions.Such citizen-organisations may adopt a range of bargaining strategies, including direct action, direct association, learning from past mistakes, gathering data, research and analysis, writing to the Federal government and other political representatives, holding referendums and so forth. But one may argue that these last resort tactics are being used by the large corporations and other powerful actors in order to impose their will on the political system and the citizenry, and thus it is necessary to organise in different ways and create alternative or complementary systems.

This does not mean that the technological imagination has somehow replaced the artist or the designer in all aspects of technological culture and society; on the contrary, the sharing economy today emphasizes the role of the citizen in all aspects of technological culture and society. It means that new media technologies are constantly (justifiably) enhancing the capacities of their users to engage with and create meaning out of otherwise lifeless phenomena – things (data, algorithms, algorithms, algorithms), phenomena (facts of the world), and phenomena (data, codes, data, codes), that are themselves becoming ever more complex and multi-functionalised. New media technologies are bringing with them the potential to destress certain kinds of social  	understanding, by enabling many disparate kinds of interaction – new kinds of citizens, different kinds of citizens, different kinds of citizens, interacting according to criteria of intent, location, culture, skills, culture, languages etc. – which in turn can raise issues of identity, belonging, belongingness, belongingness, belongingness, belonging</text>

This does not mean that the creators of virtual and augmented reality should emulate the technological innovations of the sharing economy, nor that all such artists are engaged in the production of commodities but should instead engage in activities that create social and cultural value in the form of sharing and creating. Rather, the sharing economy is a dynamic arena in which the artist becomes a privileged user of new information technologies and media technologies enabling him or her to surreptitiously acquire and impart value through the sharing of; a point of departure from where social and democratic politics might be conceived. 	Artists who engage with this dynamic arena take into consideration the environmental and social considerations that might arise from the access to new information technologies; they also understand the potentialities of new media to augment and supplement the artist’s original medium of painting and sculpture – in this case, sound. As a consequence, they not only produce works that address an audience of consumers but also engage with the possibilities of new media, but also create works that address social structures and</text>

This does not mean that the art and design produced in these contexts is necessarily derivative from the economic labour that characterises contemporary in-depth fashion and the sharing economy. On the contrary, I would argue that many of the conceptual and electronic innovations that characterise the sharing economy are actually specifically designed to break the link between fashion and the production of goods and services at a scale at which fashion can no longer compete. As a result, there is a tendency to see these organisations that are the direct beneficiaries of globalised capitalism as being, by-default, opposed to rational human action: antithetical to what Marx called ‘the new industrial society … which seeks to maximize the value of labour over time through the utilization of ever larger numbers of workers’.[12] And this is to miss the point.

This does not mean that the art and design produced in the sharing economy is post-technological and will not respond to new technological paradigms, nor that it cannot address the concerns of the biennial as a curatorial gesture or cultural enterprise. On the contrary, as the sharing economy becomes more and more of a reality, the kinds of concerns that are being addressed will have to evolve in response. But it will have to do so in a way that responds to the inutility of labour, the politics of work, the practices of collective and communicative action, and the possibilities of imagining new forms of artistic and curatorial activity. This is not to suggest that there is not a future for art and design in the metropolis, nor that there is not a future for art and design in the suburbs or rural areas. There is a need for both urban and rural forms of art and design to be actively engaged in creating their own future. But this future will be precarious and uneven, and will certainly not be</text>

This does not mean that the technological imagination has somehow returned to pre-capitalist forms of technological society; on the contrary, recent advances in information technologies and deep machine learning mean that ever more sophisticated forms of in-the-moment data mining and automation are being developed, and may well be envisaged as a result of the sharing economy. Rather, this ‘technological imagination’ is characterised by in-the-moment data mining and automation, and its eventual endgame is a global networked interface that continually collects and distributes information about all manner of human behaviour.  	In a broader technological sense, there are many indications that the sharing economy is here to stay; as the sharing of cars, homes, and other goods of value becomes increasingly widespread, and as in-depth sharing of data fuels in-depth sharing of needs and desires, there is every reason to expect that the sharing economy will be there to recover, reborn as a differentiating cultural force, at a later</text>

This does not mean that ‘real life’ should be drawn up in terms of technical or industrial processes, but rather that it should be possible to ‘read more into it’. If machines can produce abstract concepts – objects – then we can infer from this example that at some level, at some point in history, humans had to struggle against the forces of technology.How to imagine a future with a future? I believe that there are three ways to approach this question: historical, metaphorical and practical. We can start from the assumption that there is a universal future – in general, a ‘big picture’ that encompasses all possibilities – and imagine what that future might be like. In either scenario, humans are at the mercy of unpredictable, sometimes disastrously wrong historical events, and our only hope is that history itself will intervene and restore some degree of predictability and order. This is the optimistic scenario – in the sense that humanity is a valuable resource that should be maximised. We also have</text>

This does not mean that the productive forces of culture are reducible to the drive for profit, nor that the sharing economy is immune to the ravages of capitalism. Rather, the sharing economy is characterised by the sharing of not only physical and virtual goods and services, but also of intangible assets – such as a citizen’s right to housing and education, but also of access to finance, insurance and employment opportunities] – which render in some cases real-life labour possible only through the sharing of digital assets.  	Art is an indispensable site of exchange, but in the age of in-depth data mining and automated production, the sharing of art and design becomes both possible and problematic. The sharing of a design – its content, form, criteria and so on – is often cited as a precondition for a citizen to share a piece of the pie, but while this is often claimed to be the case, there is another precondition as well: namely, that ‘a design shall be</text>

This does not mean that the social and political changes required to address this aspect of the dynamic are imminent or uncontroversial; on the contrary, many of the transformations described above are already happening in key urban areas, especially in the developing world. However, the number-one challenge of our epoch is the task of creating new modes of social and political organisation – modes of consumption and circulation not dictated by the commodity and technology, but capable of producing and emerging out of them – modes capable of radically rethinking the forms of organisation required to accommodate a diverse range of stakeholders and cultures, including but not limited to those with a stake in the development of infrastructure and the society it supports. Drawing on the broad concepts and body of knowledge regarding modes of consumption and circulation, from Bourriaud to Addai Toor and from there to Benjamin, from Debord to now former US president Barack Obama, from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter, from Taksim Square to Gezi Park, from Zuccotti Park to Tahrir,</text>

This does not mean that the creators of social networking or the sharing economy are not conscious of their societal effects; on the contrary, their techno-savvy ways of organising resources and making work into valuable resources (which is to say, valuable in ways that produce social impacts) is a reflection of the inefficiencies and injustices of the capitalist socialisation of labour. But it does mean that the inefficiencies and injustices that result from the capitalist socialisation of labour are understood and addressed in ways that are not the direct outcome of inefficiencies and injustices produced by the very nature of capitalist socialisation. For instance, the sharing economy does not produce a surplus for the social in the form of jobs and income growth, since the in-house DJing companies and service providers that it enables create a surplus for the workers in the host firms. Instead, the social impact of the sharing economy is produced by the in-house DJing companies and service providers, and distributed widely through the in-house spreadsheets</text>

The curatorial moment is influenced by many things, but perhaps perhaps perhaps what is most feared is the point where the gaze of a visitor somewhere other than the museum intersects with that of a visitor to the museum. This seems to characterize the curatorial gesture – the non-representational curatorial gesture. There is a non-representational, non-representational ambiguity about the curatorial gesture, which seems to characterize the contemporaneity of many curatorial gestures. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ‘metro’ and ‘street level’ elements of the curatorial gesture were greatly exaggerated and caricatured in art and design, while the contemporary urban element was exaggerated and distorted in works by prominent artists and designers. The 1990s and 2000s marked a change in this characteristic non-representational urbanism and façade-building, the latter of which is now favoured by art collectors and curators alike.

The curatorial moment is a point of no return, and it is this very essence that makes it contemporary. 	Modernity, in its historical, anthropological and literary senses, is the modern curatorial industry that seeks to capture, transform and return to the contemporary through the archaic and the bizarre. Modernity’s quest for a set of characteristics that characterise it as a particular type of contemporary (type 1 or 2) is a literary and anthropological form of the same kind of modernity that produced the Enlightenment and the common good: civitas, common heritage, commonplaces, a common language, common ways of living, common value systems, cultural values, globalisation, the spread of knowledge-producing institutions, and so forth. Modernity’s quest for a set of characteristics that it can then recycle and re-create through its various forms of intellectual production – which is to say, to thrive in the long term – is a kind of mythology.

The curatorial moment is a double-edged sword. It is seductive and persuasive, but at the same time deceptive and deceptive. It is easy to photograph and study the curatorial moment, but what is arguably perhaps its greatest strength is its ability to engender an appearance and understanding of the prevailing order of things, things as vectors and lines, of things as causes and effects. This is true even when the things photographed or studied are the very essence of the self-appointed modernisers' project, themselves: when the very images, sounds, and expressions of the contemporary modernisers are taken as a symbol of contemporary forms of human experience, of contemporary art, of contemporary art per se. 	The contemporary is a condition of constant and unbroken flow of images, ideas, and behaviours – a condition that must be taken seriously if the very existence of the contemporary is to be questioned and contested. And yet this contemporaneity that we inhabit has to be taken seriously also because, as the great Jean Guy Deb</text>

The curatorial moment is the point where two or more points meet, and it is this point where the modern curatorial object is seen to intervene in the world. It is both a locus of movement and a point of no return. Modern curators have had this locus of movement for a very long time. It was first articulated by Paul Domela in his landmark work, The Contemporary Curator, in the early 1980s. And it is relevant to note that in 1984, the year that the film Groundhog Day was made, Francis Ford Coppola, in his classic, Casino Royale, used the exact same theme as the film The Wizard of Oz. 	Modern art objects have a ‘curatorial’ dimension to them, because they are constantly (unfixably, as we shall see) intervening between themselves, showing, telling or inventing new stories or doing things that are not necessarily in accord with established narrative norms.

The curatorial moment thus appears to exist contemporaneous with and in opposition to modernity itself. In other words, it is contemporaneous with the non-modernity that is being created. But what the ‘curatorial’ – or art institutions, real or perceived – represents to the living world is not what it means to the non-living world, and in that sense the living world is itself 'incomplete'. 	The idea that the living world is divided into discrete and discrete parts that are constantly on the verge of destruction is what Bilal Herat believes to be the mark of decadence. And his theory goes deeper than this. He proposes that the very act of destruction, as we humans inevitably fall prey to, is part of a much broader global process of decadence that he calls ‘the End Game’. 	In a series of lectures and seminars, as well as in articles and books, Herat details the processes of decadence that are sweeping across the globe,</text>

The curatorial moment is characterised by the production, at the same time the preservation and the rediscovery of cultural property. It is a point of production in which new artistic and curatorial expressions are made, preserved and reinterpreted – works that are not only new and provocative, but also stand for what they say and do. It is a point of reoccurring production, in which certain practices are repeated ad infinitum, as though the very acts of artistic production were itself forms of return. If this is not a culture that can continually remind us that it is alive and capable of being reborn, then one must say something more specific and specific than ‘today’ to make the point that art today is both alive and the contemporary form of art is alive to inauthenticity, in both its production and in its consumption.  	The existence of the curatorial moment is made particularly evident in the exhibition that accompanies every major biennale, which is divided into three periods: new cur</text>

The curatorial moment is a point of no return for a reason. In the words of Marx, time and space are made to circulate – they are rendered malleable, subject to the whims of political and economic power. 	In recent years, as biennials and museums proliferated across Europe and the US, their cultural effects were far from clear-cut. But a new curatorial style is bearing down on the UK, and it is being urged on to us by cultural theorists, art historians and contemporary art practitioners. It is being proposed that the curatorial role should be replaced by an entirely new one, that is to say, that is being proposed for a museum that is itself an administrative unit, rather than a museum that documents the lived and collective experience of art and culture in the UK.1 Johnn Fouracre’s concept of administrative space is perhaps an example to be explored.

The so-called curatorial moment seems to capture the very essence of the curatorial state in its many forms. It is the moment when a curator exhibits a work in a museum, a school of a gallery, a synagogue, a market, a square, or an alley. It is an event that can be captured and returned to, captured and returned to again and again. It is a point of intersection – the point where two points meet, an intersection or intersectional intersection. It is also a point of no return, a point of return to the very essence of the contemporary curatorial moment – which is to say, the very essence of what it means to be contemporary. 	The curatorial moment is a point of no return for contemporary art, for contemporary art cannot be found in museums, in institutions, in the typical museum collection or even in the typical biannual such as Venice Biennale. On the contrary, what we would argue is that the curatorial moment is an essential precondition for the museum, the biannual or even the biennial, which we propose replacing it with a point of no return. The point of no return, we would argue, must have a strongly curatorial character, and must therefore exist somewhere between the art institution and the museum. And this is exactly what the curatorial character of the contemporary must have in order to be contemporary. Today, the curatorial character of the contemporary is precisely what is being brought about in a semiotic sense: the modern, in its extended sense, is the having of meaning and significance in and through the contemporaneity of the contemporaneity of art and life. Today, we are experiencing a conspicuous</text>

The curatorial moment is a point of no return for contemporary art. It is a point of no return for contemporary art because it is a point of no return for contemporary art to begin with. (JL) The curatorial micro-moment 	The micro-moment is the instant in which a work of art, or art object in this case, comes into being again. Here, the concept is used synonymously with a word or phrase that conveys a specific feeling or sensation. The phrase appears over and over again in different contexts: as a noun, as an adjective, as a verb. 	The micro-moment is the instant in which a work of art, or art object, takes form again – albeit temporarily – in a specific place, at a particular moment in time. It occurs when the work or art is moved from its initial position (the micro-moment), to one of its three levels (the micro-induction), to return to a position</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �big picture’. 	The big picture is crucial to understanding how changes in the structure and/or the composition of the city can impact (1) consumption, (2) employment, (3) publics, (4) governance, and (5) social life. It is not enough to understand how the city is connected to its citizens; one also needs to understand how the city is generated and consumed. For this to happen, other needs to be added, including (but not limited to) the modes of urban circulation, collecting and distributing of resources, and settlement and economic life that result from these resources.

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �systemic obscuration’. The elimination of each of the hundreds of layers would mean removing not only the friction – the different forms of urbanisation create a tremendous amount of friction – but also the information (on a macro-level, of course). This sounds like magic, but in reality it is extremely difficult to perform, even for the most talented nano-engineers. There are several factors that can limit the effectiveness of such efforts, including the complexity of the systems that are to be disrupted (ie, human capital), the infrastructures that can be disrupted (ie, financial services), and the political will (ie, institutional support). 	The task of dismantling the infrastructural base of the city is complex, and the ability to map it is essential. But in these cases (ie, disruption of key infrastructures) the ability to understand the system (the ‘city’) is essential as well. Without this, ‘the city�</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �systemic demolition’. The challenge is to identify the tasks that, if completed, would result in a ‘city with a clear future for its inhabitants’. The implications for the future of this system are enormous. The system must be dismantled in order to enable the future inhabitants of the city to build new ‘collaborative cities’. The dismantling of the system does not have to be politically incorrect or even popular. The biennale needs to be politically incorrect and need to be popular with the inhabitants of the city in order to achieve systemic change. In the past, this has meant actively participating in the history of the city in order to change the city. In this case, the system‑changing tasks would need to be institutionalised and the ability to innovate and fail removed from the city’s planning and architecture. 	The ability to fail and to innovate within the framework of the urban is a necessity for any new urban form, but is especially necessary for</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �big picture’. The fact that cities are often visited by name only serves to intensify the sense that there is ‘nothing’ left behind. The city is not simply a ‘building material and supply chain management system’; nor is it simply ‘a collection of streets that form part of a larger urban fabric’. Rather, the city is a complex of relations that arise and exist within it, and the city’s 'street level’ is a complex of relations between people.  	So the city is not simply an object or set of relations; it is a living organism with specific forms and relations that need to be understood and taken up as a point of entry into the city. This sounds simple enough, but it is much more difficult to define or even to articulate in a way that is both comprehensible for everyone and serves as a point of entry into the city. For many people, and for this reason, the concept of ‘</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �systemic desideratum�. The dominant forms of urbanisation need to be removed one by one, in stages, until a new architecture system emerges. If the financial and economic systems that create this architecture are not removed, but are instead shifted to better cities, then the biennale could conceivably be folded back into the city. 	The question is, then, how to create a biennale that is not just about the city, but contributes to its future creation? The answer to that question is a simple ‘yes’, and it is a yes that is shared by everyone involved in the project. It is a ‘yes’ that is rooted in shared values and traditions, and it is a ‘yes’ that is informed by a sense of the city’s rightful place in the world. This is not some radical-sounding statement, as some artists and artists’ associations would have us believe. Rather, this is the underlying �</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �economy of discontentment’. The economic of discontentment is not found in the cities themselves, but rather in the levelling of – and interaction with – natural resources, urban space and infrastructure. The urban fabric of the city is vitally important for the economy of the city to function, but it is also essential for the economy of the city to function in a way that is not disrupted by resource depletion or globalisation. If the former is taken for granted, and is promoted as inevitable, the latter is not mentioned at all.  	The biennale as a curatorial exercise 	[1] is an annual, three-day event curated by Curator at Kassel Wolf Jesús Rodríguez-Galindo, which takes place between October and December every year. It is the largest and most prestigious of its kind in Portugal. Its 2017 edition was curated by Arnascio Pascual-</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �big picture’ in which the ‘city’ is reduced to one of many interconnected modules. In the end, it is the city and its inhabitants, not industrialists and the city’s financial planners, who control the landscape.  	The ability to interconnect and weave large swaths of the urban fabric depends in large part on the availability of cheap and accessible energy. If the urban fabric is to be repaired, then the ability to access and exchange information about the city must be enhanced. If the recycling of raw materials and constructing of renewable energy resources is to be encouraged, then access to information about the city must be expanded. If the need is for a universal basic income, then access to social, economic and political change will all depend on the development of alternative forms of organisation – and in particular, on the proliferation and maintenance of passive and collective forms of knowledge.  	In sum, then, the future, as we approach its emergence as an increasingly visible</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �systemic injustice’. In the current global economic and financial architecture, the burden is on governments, local authorities, businesses, financial institutions and citizens to remove the friction – but that is a much more complex task. In the current period of austerity and social fragmentation, citizens and communities are being encouraged to withdraw and move away from the sites of friction, which is itself a form of resistance. The result is a situation where the infrastructure of the city is being remodeled in response to the demands of multinational financial institutions and cities with their ‘metro-regions’ and ‘metro-counties’ of distributional capital’. The result is that the social and ecological conditions that existed prior to the advent of such mega-regions are being erased or transformed. This is the ‘financial feedback’ that Svetlana Savrasova, Boris Karlov and their colleagues at the London School of Economics, seem to have identified. 	At</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �big picture’. 	In the current economic and financial conjuncture, the city is a complex system that requires a great deal of communication and organisational capacity, and so it is easy to understand how the city is positioned on the global marketplace. The challenge now is to shift the city from the marketplace into the city of the future; to that extent, to some extent, it is said to exist. That is, from the city that is ephemeral and ephemeral-looking in the sense that it could be anywhere, at any moment. The city of the future, then, is one where people actually live and work and move and interact and create and share and exchange and discover and discover and make new and different and extraordinary and interesting things and do all kinds of things and do them all in radically new and different ways. And that is a city that produces or creates new ways of living; a city where art is made, new ways of being made, new ways of</text>

The key is in the intersection of all the different forms of urbanisation, which can be articulated as a monolithic �systemic demolition’. The problem with the present urbanisation is not just the absence of buildings, but the ‘widespread and interrelated nature of urbanisation implies a multitude of moving parts that interpenetrate and interpenetrate – making it ever more difficult to identify a single element that contributes to a given level of density and complexity.’[10] Building and Real Estate Markets in a Massive Urban Encounter 	Urban spaces are produced, not necessarily created, according to the logic of the real estate market. This is perhaps what the urban theorist Howard Zinn intended when he proposed the ‘problem of urban blight’ in his book Signs, where he argued that the proliferation of skyscrapers and other urban structures was the inevitable outcome of a ‘housing crisis’.[11] In fact, signs are ubiquitous in the urban environment – they are part of the landscape, part of the urban fabric – but they are also props,</text>

In recent years, they have often been used as platforms to explore the post-exhibition period, and can be used as a way to consider the past, present and future of art performance. In a recent study on the exhibitionary scene in Venice, I interviewed Giancarlo Rutelli, curator of the newly inaugurated and the long-term project curator for the Biennale of Asia Pacific Theatre, and Professor of Art History and Curatorial Studies at UCLA. Together, they point to a positive development in the exhibitionary world: the emergence of a curatorial class devoted to artistic and artistic-historical repurposing, and the curatorial race that produces contemporaneous art that serves as a vehicle for cultural and historical enquiries. They also suggest a need for further research into the role and values that form the basis of contemporary art, and the ways in which art is constituted through and through this materiality.

In this respect, they are like ‘concerts but with a carefully calibrated audience of artists who are invited to share in the stage production, but who also have a part to play in the art’s future destiny. ‘[T]he convention is a critical platform through which artists can articulate their creative potentialities and simultaneously works them into situations that are more rigorously controlled and controlled, precisely speaking, because it has a very specific purpose and agenda that is fundamentally understood by the curatorial gesture, but which can nevertheless be questioned and changed.’[12] I think that the importance of this particular conventionality and objective marker is starting to be questioned in the contemporary artworld. I mention, for example, the exhibition at Tate Britain, which was largely viewed as a return to the status-quo of the mid-1990s, when biennials were the dominant form of art exhibitionary practice in the country.

In this sense, they are contemporary documentary-style spectacles that happen to be mediated through the medium of art. Aspects of the biennial form that are not typically recorded include the curatorial gesture, the curatorial note, the curatorial visit and the curatorial intonation. But these are not only transient elements that emerge and mingle with the artist’s artwork. The fact that the biennial is a media spectacle that requires no fixed site of performance or originates from a particular location also contributes to its enduring power. See: the transformative effect of location. The emergence of biennials as a media category through which other forms of cultural spectacle are simultaneously reduced and rendered more accessible is also a by-product of the information society. Biennials have come to represent everything from the humanitarian to the legal, but mostly from the social, political and legal catastrophes that characterise the contemporary world.

In this sense, the artworks produced within them are simultaneously material and symbolic, embodying and in part constituting the performance, while the artists who created those works, and who are now embedded within them, are also participants in a broader socio-cultural system that is also affected by the material and symbolic values that are produced and imprinted within them.⁘Art’, then, emerges, not from the act of creating visualisations of the world through art, but from the act of imitating its behaviour.⁘There is no greater demonstration of this than the recent Venice Biennale, which has become a global phenomenon. Each of the more than 200 exhibits has been reproduced in over 200 museums, and is now embedded within a cityscape that is as iconic for its architectural grandeur as its cultural history, or, perhaps, its economic history. The displays have become objects of global repetition, and the performance of each one has become the ensemble of all of those museums that can be</text>

In the case of Biennials at Tate, for example, the acts of production are chronicled through archival documents that record the people who are part of the Tate community but also the surrounding social and cultural conditions that contributed to the staging of the Tate Biennale. These documents – the curatorial gesture, the staging of the exhibition, the documentation of the archive – are not only historically accurate, but are also culturally relevant. They ‘ground’ the biennial in a narrative that emerges from its various productions, and ‘strengthen’ its thrust by enabling its audience to sense the journey that it is about to take. ‘[T]hemes have emerged as a mode of thought and a mode of feeling, and the chronicling of thematic narratives is a storytelling device that lends a certain amount of weight to the historical works that are being assembled in the form of books.’[12] As a production and a mode of feeling, biennials</text>

In this sense, they are ‘spectacles in their own right, but also ‘spectacles that emerge out of the performance of artists’, and so on. By recording the movements of artists and the world they inhabit, biennials can capture the essence of creative action, and so they are quintessentially American in their form and their media. And they are made in this country. In that sense, they are a kind of surrogate for the real thing, just as photographs are surrogate for things. The biennial is a kind of artifact that sits alongside the rest of the cultural world, documenting the movement of people, goods, and data across the planet in what might be called its exhibitionary character. Its emergence is also a story in itself – a sequence of related but distinct events that all narrate in the same fictional narrative. In this sense, biennials can be read as texts on the global circulation of culture, and so their status as a form of cultural exchange</text>

He also criticises the artworld for its tendency towards celebrity and its tendency towards the production of large-scale exhibitions, as well as its tendency towards the production of works of art through a numinous of curatorial gestures and decorative styles. Kaufmann concludes by noting that the biennial form is being drowned out by other media, which are producing their own range of curatorial gestures and curatorial styles. ‘The question that remains is, What should replace it?’[11] Biennials are film and media spectacles that not only record the performances of artists, but also the processes that produced and emerge from those performances. In the case of the United Kingdom, the performance of the Biennale was recorded in the 1866 edition of the London Port Arthur and the 1830 edition of the Times &amp; Seasons. The performance of the Biennale of Sydney in 2004 was also recorded and published by the Times &amp; Seasons. The performance of the Biennale of Montreal in 1989 was written and directed by Jean-Luc Nancy. In 1990, Nancy directed the biennale of Athens, Greece. In 1992, Nancy wrote and co-wrote the book The Biennale Syndrome: Culture and Capital in Crisis. In 1996, Nancy directed the biennale of Triennials, two of which have been published. In 1998, Nancy published three successor books to the first two, including the hugely successful Triennials of Sydney, Athens &amp; Istanbul.

In the case of the recent Venice Biennale, which is a ‘re-enactment’ of the 1971 Paris Biennale, the performances were staged in ‘different “pace”, with ‘different iddat’s – space, gravity, time, and so forth. The underlying themes of the various works appear in different ‘locations’ – space, gravity, and so on. In addition to narrating the material conditions that artists inhabit, biennials can also ‘institutionalise these conditions through their ‘representations’ of the present. This possibility of ‘institutionalising’ is a concern for the contemporary artist, since the contemporary artist is expected to be contemporary within the contemporary framework of art’s historical museum collections and the museum. The institutionalised condition of the biennial is a condition of increasing accessibility, and so the contemporary artist ‘will inevitably find it easier to access the collections</text>

In recent years, they have frequently been staged in the United States, and in London, at Tate Britain, and Kunsthal Aarhus, Denmark, in late June and early July. In 2007, a biennial was staged in Berlin. In 2015, a biennial was staged in Sydney. In 2017, a biennial was staged in Berlin and Beijing. In 2018, a biennial was staged in Istanbul. In 2019, a biennial was staged in Yokohama. The term ‘biennial’ is used here to describe more than one museum-level museum collection, but mainly one collection at a time. It is an adjective, not a noun; it denotes the ‘collection of art’ at a given moment, not necessarily a specific collection at that moment. So biennials are index cards, not card catalogues. They show how art is made, but also of what kind of art? In that way, they are more like museums than museum collections</text>

In recent biennials, the conventions of the art market have been displaced by the production of goods and services through data, which in turn calls into question the value of the art object itself. ‘Art never stops developing, but it also […] changes shape and shrinks to accommodate new data formats and media.’[12] This implies, of course, the possibility that art will still be produced and enjoyed in various forms, but the conventions and taboos that have emerged in the wake of the biennial will have to be altered in order to accommodate the new media that seek to engage us with the artefact through data capture and distribution. This includes the conventions and taboos that regulate the consumption of art, such as those surrounding the consumption of art by museums and the ethical consumption of art by artists.Art and artists have traditionally been placed in hierarchies of societal use, and it is this social role of the privileged to create ethical forms of art through their patronage of art.

Since then, countless other artists, intellectuals and others from diverse walks of life have been similarly expelled or are now living in countries where the state actively tries to prevent them from coming back. How much of this history is told in relation to the UK and the Rochdale Riots? I will show that there are several passages that give us a clear picture of how the Rochdale Riots and the history of working-class activism in the UK can be understood as the result of the xenophobic propaganda of the state.[3] Is this a general statement about the politics of exclusion in Britain? Of course it is. But the way in which the state attempts to repress artistic and political expression in the UK today, through legislation, policies and funds, is deeply reminiscent of the ways in which the state repressed artistic and political expression during the First Opium War. In the case of the Rochdale Riots, the ban was politically motivated. The city’s English Democrats (later</text>

Since then, countless thousands of other people from all over the UK and beyond have been similarly expelled from the country without trial or redress. And while the state has never officially returned to Chichester, there is growing support for a form of self-government for such people – a form that could very well include sympathetic legislation – among sections of the working-class and middle-class public. It seems almost absurd that the state – which for centuries had a clear interest in stamping out working-class identity – should now seek to preserve the identity of communities formed through labour. But such claims are being increasingly made by activists within and without the state, and even by those who claim to be acting in the interests of the state. It is worth recalling that at the height of the Rochdale riots, the police claimed that over 1,000 people had been killed in the county, with estimates of the scale of the slaughter varying widely. The scale of this claim, however unsupportable it was,</text>

Since then, countless thousands of other people have been banished from the UK under similar pseudonyms. The scale and character of the error – which was repeated several times over – remains unclear. Yet the tendency is towards the suspension of disbelief. The ban is lifted only rarely, and only sporadically. True, the courts eventually declare the ban illegal, but as soon as they do, the government attempts to re-impose the ban via legislation. And while this may happen infrequently, the tendency is towards the enforcement of such bans. A ban on the return to the UK of foreigners who commit offences is one thing, but enforcing a ban on the return of foreigners who commit acts of terrorism is quite another. A 1958 law criminalising certain acts of terrorism (Article 2(b) of the ECHR) effectively banned the return of non-Brits indefinitely, so that the ban would have to be renewed every six months. So while the ban on the return of non-white aliens</text>

What is distinctive about the way in which migrants today move around the globe is their degree of urbanisation: cities now contain the infrastructure of a migrant. The ability to move from city to city and back again is the essence of the urbanisation implied by the metainterface – and its precariat. For many migrant groups, this includes the ability to access and utilize public transport, which is a reality of urbanisation in many cities. Thus, the ability of migrants to access, and to be able to access, public space and cultural resources (including cultural tourism) is a precarity of their global movement.

Since then, numerous attempts have been made to return him to the UK. In 2011, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced that she would reinstate him, but this came after a ruling by an unknown senior judge, who had suspended his citizenship because he had not lived in the UK for five years.May’s decision to reinstate Lennon comes as no surprise to those who have followed his music over the years. When the Beatles released ‘Got A Gun’ in 1970, Lennon’s identity as a Liverpool musician was made official: he was a member of the Royal Family. But here, the reinstatement comes as something other than a statement of intent. It comes as a denial, as May said in her ruling, of Lennon’s right to ‘repose his identity in any manner he chooses’. In other words, the state has reasserted its claim to the identity of a person by forcing him to renounce his citizenship.This is</text>

His reinstatement petition was also recently amended to include a list of organisations that should be invited to join the Union for the purposes of campaigning in the courts of appeal.[3]In this sense, the ban on Lennon’s return in 1961 is an attempt to re-constitute a mutually beneficial union partnership that would allow both the public and the convicted terrorist to benefit from the successes of the early years of the British Communist Party. It is an attempt that is seemingly entirely absent from the present rendition of the ban. Under the present regime, both the public and the convicted terrorist are denied the right to challenge the ban in the courts. If anything, the right to challenge the ban is more frequently abused, and can lead to arbitrary deprivation of rights. A growing number of activists today would probably argue that the</text>

There are other kinds of fitting material or 'toolkit' that are not fully human-readable but can nevertheless serve as a starting point for further innovation.

It encourages contributors to create pages that draw on their knowledge of the platform they are using, and provides tools for these users to ‘stack’ that knowledge in ‘similarities’ and ‘contrasts’, thereby enabling the sharing and ‘understanding’ of different perspectives and beliefs.

In the event that algorithms replace human curators, artists and other cultural professionals, scholars and others with a view to enabling greater access to cultural resources, this is a question that needs to be considered. In the event that cultural resources are made available through an API, it is a question that needs to be considered whether the users of such an API are actually the creators of the artefacts they are accessing or whether they are fulfilling roles that are subservient to the creators’ ends.

This is true of songs that are programmed to play particular instruments, or platforms that automatically identify artists based on criteria such as their popularity, cultural relevance or relevance to an audience. In these cases, the users actually create the platforms and give platforms the authority to determine what is and is not suitable to be played. 	Issues of trust and legitimacy are enhanced in these scenarios, as users actually determine what is and is not suitable to be played. This type of empowerment is different from the type that is implied by the adoption of new technologies, such as the internet, social media or GPS, because it is not a result of technical capability but relies on social interaction and collective action. It is the kind of meta-empowerment that is often conflated with the advent of new technology, and this is problematic, for two reasons.

As the name suggests, the notion of the ‘anthropogenic’ in the context of the ‘greenhouse effect’ stems from the work of scientists who discovered that increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat in the form of heat-trapping substances, known as ‘greenhouse gases’.2 As a result of this, it became clear that certain parts of the world are more exposed to the impact of global climate change than others. For instance, in the tropics, the impact of global climate change is projected to cause extreme weather events such as floods, drought and heat waves, which can devastate local infrastructure and economies. In addition, the impacts of extreme weather events could contribute to the rise in sea levels that is predicted to occur as a</text>

Although machine learning can and should be applied to data, there is a limit to the extent to which it can be applied to cultural phenomena. The question that remains, however, is what can be done with cultural phenomena as data? There are a number of proposals that address this potential, but these do not propose a complete or even an approximation to the truth.1 For instance, there is no guarantee that data provided by a platform, such as Wikipedia, will reflect the real beliefs and practices of the platform’s users. As an example, it can be shown that platforms often modify their APIs to meet the specific needs of the platform developers, but this comes at the user’s expense of the platform developers. 	Similarly, there is no guarantee that cultural norms and values will be realised in the algorithmic data feeds of platforms, but there is a good chance that cultural norms and values will be modified in ways that are not fully captured or reflected in the underlying data feeds. 	Similarly, there is no guarantee that the underlying assumptions about the properties and semantics of platforms will be realised, but there is a good chance that the underlying assumptions will be modified in ways that are not captured or reflected in the underlying platforms. This is true for ‘native’ platforms, but it is also true for ‘third-party’ platforms that are installed, adapted or provided with services by the platform developers, but which are not ‘native’ or part of the ecosystem but instead are proprietary or obscure software).  	Finally, there is the question of infrastructures. Are platforms simply ‘platforms’ or ‘cultural artefacts’? If, as some have suggested, the answer is a self-generating algorithm, then the question becomes what to do with the increasingly obsolete and infrastructuralised media-</text>

Similarly, there is no guarantee that cultural norms and values will be realised in the algorithmic data feeds of platforms, but there is a good chance that cultural norms and values would be developed in the setting of algorithms. There is no guarantee about this, of course, since the users would not necessarily choose to embrace or adopt such desirable behaviours. However, there is a way to ensure that beneficial behaviours would be realised in the context of a given community of users: create and support the platform, not the other way around. 	Finally, there is the question of immigration. The ability to easily access cultural resources is a necessity for many platforms, but the inability to easily access those cultural resources in the manner and in the cultural space of one’s users – i.e., the native population – stands in the way of many platforms from offering the desired benefits to those who use the platform. In addition, native populations often live in conditions of poverty and tend to be marginalised in the socio-economic scale. More than that, many native populations live in conditions of racial and ethnic violence. In a technological sense, the inaccessibility of resources</text>

Similarly, there is no guarantee that cultural norms and values will be realised in the algorithmic data feeds of platforms, but there is a good chance that cultural norms and values will be modified in ways that serve the interests of the platform owners and their advertising partners. There is no guarantee that cultural norms and values will be realised in the data feeds of platforms, but there is a good chance that cultural norms and values will be modified in ways that serve the interests of the owners and their ad networks. There is no guarantee that cultural norms and values will remain constant over time, but there is a good chance that cultural norms and values can be revised and embedded in the platform in such a way as to be constantly available and disposable. There is no guarantee that cultural norms and values will remain constant over time, but there is a good chance that cultural norms and values can be modified and embedded in the data feeds of platforms, ad networks and other technology platforms, and that this process of dynamic updating and embedding can produce new forms of citizen empowerment and collective self-expression.  	One could ask what is meant by this  	transitive aspect?</text>

Similarly, there is no guarantee that cultural norms and values will be realised in the algorithmic data feeds of platforms, but there is a good chance that cultural norms and values will be imposed by the platform developers in an Orwellian fashion. In the context of a political or social transformation, the need to ensure that data does not influence or oppress will inevitably arise. In the long run, the challenge will lie in forging deeper bonds with platforms, understanding their motivations and recognising when such coercion is undesirable. 	There are other technologies that can and should be discussed in the context of cultural theory and potentially even developed into useful tools. These include  	Image Topology, which proposes a ‘bottom-up' approach to the design of platforms and infrastructure; and Cultural Curation, an applied approach to image processing and publishing, which addresses the ways in which platforms can be used to organise and direct cultural life. However, the focus of this report is on those platforms that are state-of-the-art and have been designed with the greatest amount of user data possible, and which are also deployed at the largest scale. These must be scaled</text>

Similarly, there is no guarantee that cultural norms and values will be realised in the algorithmic data feeds of platforms, but there is a good chance that cultural norms and values could be developed in the same way that algorithms can be developed into recognisable forms. For instance, users could become involved in creating and revising cultural norms through the use of algorithms. Such norms could be formulated and codified as data, and could be used to subvert the mechanisms of power that monitor and regulate cultural formations.

There are also proposals that seek to mechanise cultural practices outside of the context of closely monitored, regulated institutions. For instance, there is a proposal from Google to make cultural data available to all users, but this is outside the scope of this journal. 	Another area of research in which there is a strong interconnection between science and technology is connected data mining and the cultural industries. Although these two areas have their own distinctive approaches to understanding and use cultural phenomena, they also share a number of principles and approaches to data mining. For instance, many online services offer powerful tools for self-improvement, such as the Manifest’, which can be seen as a ‘template’ for other practices and ‘behavioural models’ that can be used to understand and map cultural phenomena.1 Manifest.
