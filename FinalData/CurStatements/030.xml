It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial is a trajectory that it is capable of taking. It can shift its location and even abandon some of its goals, but its fundamental commitment to engaging with the site and its communities remains. 	The biennial must also develop long-term relationships with its geographical locations, because they are the sites on which the art and artistic practices of the cities take root and prosper. The importance of this cannot be underestimated. The fact that biennials are increasingly being placed in the geographic centres of the city – in London, New York and Berlin – means that they too are subject to the vagaries of urbanisation and cultural flux. The biennial as a curatorial practice is therefore particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of urbanisation and creative destruction that can shake it up and lay bare its secrets. Its foundations may yet regrow, but to do so it will need the strength of will and collective imagination to bear the brunt of the new urbanisation achieved in the wake of the biennial. 	</text>

It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial can only exist within the community of supportive artists, the people who will patronise the art. In doing so, it creates a shared frame of reference across a community of artists, artists' organisations, community organisers and others with a shared set of skills and knowledge. It thus creates a mechanism that has the power to create change and thrive, but also a mechanism that is contingent upon the community for survival.

It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial can only ever be as truly ‘transformed’ as the people entrusted with its art.  	In an effort to make the art institution as a whole a better understanding of the communities that it is tasked with nurturing and educating, biennial commissioning agencies should take a leading role in the creation of knowledge-generating activities within their communities. For instance, the power of the biennial to shift and create knowledge-base should be realized when the people entrusted with generating knowledge about a community are predominantly artists, because then the power of the biennial becomes diffuse and non-representational. Art institutions – including biennials – have a unique ability to generate imagination and knowledge about a community based on history, for instance through participatory processes that take place within a community. But this ability also requires that artists exert great effort in creating engaging and knowledge-producing activities that are historically informed and resonate with a broad range of communities. This is particularly true for biennial commissioning agencies</text>

It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial cannot establish permanent positions in and through particular communities. It is this institutional relationship that is often neglected or disregarded in discussions of biennials – between artist, community, community board, local authority. It is this kind of long-term commitment that biennials stand to gain and lose if they are not actively engaged with and responsive to the communities that they are entrusted with rendering artistic, cultural or educational services.  	Drawing parallels between the experiences of community art and artist-led organizations is a mistake that needs to be corrected. Community art today is often led by a generation of young women, and it is almost mythicalically so – there is a pervading assumption about who young women are that prevents many from seeing the potentialities and risks that exist for their participation and creativity. In the 1980s and 1990s, when there was a feminist critique of art in many contexts, it was often accompanied by a fierce critique of the kinds of participation and creativity that were being encouraged and</text>

These are the types of relational forms that biennials can assume:   	Long-term, collaborative ‘institutional learning’ between the local community and the art institution, whereas the biennial can only ever grow larger and deeper, because it is the only form of cultural formation capable of sustaining itself. 	One final example of the power of community-based strategies is provided by the work of the Black-E, a project that I lead jointly as Director of the Arts and Culture Departments in East London and in the West London Centre. The Black-E is a non-profit organisation that brings together East Londoners and international artists working across a range of themes to produce work that speaks from East to West. The project began in 1991 with a visit to East London Community College and its East London Arts Workshop, where East Londoners would paint portraits and designs for the artspot and</text>

It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial can only ever sustain itself as a particular art form. If it is to be sustainable, it will have to engage with the land and resources of the city in new ways, and this will require a radical rethink of how art institutions and artists are placed on a city-wide and internationally equitable and powerful social and political terrain.  	Art institutions have a crucial and often overlooked role to play in envisioning a future for our city and the world. It is this opportunity that biennials and other art-use institutions miss, or act as if they do not have, because they do not have the institutional power or social standing to truly make changes. It is this lack of institutional power and social standing that creates the conditions for the emergence of new art forms, but also for the perpetuation of old art forms. It is this kind of vacillation and over-intervention that creates the precursory conditions necessary for the rise of technologically mediated and culturally mediated socialities.  </text>

It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial as a curatorial practice is more than just an art institution. It is a social institution, whose mission is to foster understanding, connect people and bring ideas together. 	When looking at art from the biennial perspective, we see that the art is constructed through many layers and permutations. Each layer represents a different kind of context, behaviour, interaction or encounter with art. The layers that we expose in our exhibition are just as relevant to understanding and art making as the work itself. For this reason, it is vitally important for artists and art institutions to understand the socio-political context of biennials and to be able to pivot through these with ease. Biennials have evolved from a social event into a curatorial one, and although social media played a large part in the creation of this transformation, its ubiquity and global accessibility make it a particularly effective medium through which to convey a range of ideas and behaviour.

It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial can only ever gather so much knowledge and data about a community in its short history. It is this long-term institutional commitment to the knowledge that it gathers that creates the power of its institutions and generates the authority that it wields.  	A biennial can only ever gather so much data and knowledge about a community, and this makes it inherently unstable. It is true that the needs of the local communities that it is entrusted with providing a specific education for will inevitably override those of the national or even international art institutions, but this is also true for all art institutions: institutions that gather and employ knowledge ultimately end up using that knowledge to shape and control communities in ways that are contrary to the needs of many communities.

It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial form is inherently dependent on such relationships. If the relationships between the art institution and the people entrusted with educating and empowering communities are not forged in the first place, the latter ‘will not be able to sustain this relationship’.[7]Here, we can move from the idea of the biennial to the actualization of a relationship between the art institution and communities. The biennial as an institution is a social practice that exists at multiple scales. It is a production that needs to be constantly (metabolically) updated, a symptom that requires timely intervention. It is also a form of curatorial practice that demands a great deal of collaborative and in-depth interaction with communities in order to function effectively. As such, it is prone to become entangled in complex social dynamics and political infrastructures.[8] In the case of biennials in their current form, the relationship between art and social practice is complex, even contradictory.

It is important for biennials to develop long-term relationships with local communities and to engage with these through ongoing educational programmes and projects, because the biennial can only ever generate knowledge and change through the power of its patronage and sales. Art biennials must actively participate in and contribute to the empowerment of their local communities because their patronage is ephemeral and comes primarily from the knowledge industry, which needs to constantly update its clientele to keep pace with the artwork produced.  	Since there is a clear understanding between the art institution and the client that is often not always the case, biennials can significantly influence their clientele and therefore their financial situations. This is particularly true for newer art biennials, since they are often set up with a full-time curator or curatorial team and are therefore expected to have a significant impact on their local communities and economies. It is also true for institutions established in the 1990s and newer, since their traditional curatorial roles are no longer needed or desired, since the knowledge generated by the new practice is passed on in the art world and is reflected in the art world in different forms.</text>

Through its experimentation, the New Economy of Art argues that the technology industry – which had largely been focused on the production of high-end commodities, such as cars and homes – was beginning to shift towards processes that would soak the city in resources and giving rise to entirely new modes of urban function. This was seen by some as a good thing, as it freed the city from the constraints of scarcity and poverty imposed by capitalism. But it also meant that artists who worked in this new industry were beginning to produce increasingly in ways that were indistinguishable from those working in the city, making work that was seemingly anything but low-end urban art. Indeed, as the biennale grew larger and diversified, its curatorial ambitions started to conflict with those of its larger cultural-economic backdrop, which started to dictate what kinds of art were produced and displayed. At one point, the biennale was said to be so busy with competing curatorial priorities that it became un-curatorial – exhibiting more than being present in exhibitions.

Through its experimentation, the New Economy of Art argues that the technology industry – which had largely been focused on the production of raw materials and infrastructure – was actually intent on processes that supported the social organisation of knowledge production, including the social organisation of labour. These new economic forms, it seems to me, required a radically different set of cultural forms, ones that weren’t pre-constructed by the existing power structures. The forms that were pre-constructed, in other words, served a capitalist logic, and the dominant forms of labour today would do well to remember this as a lesson. 2.

Here, the Biennial is a testament to the fact that, during its brief existence, it was able to experiment with many forms of what McKee, Cullum, &amp; Hicks call ‘culture of the negative’, which was characterised by the mass consumption of culture without thought processes or social cognitive frameworks.

Through its experimentation, the New Economy of Art argues that the technology industry – which had largely been focused on the production of high-tech goods and services – was now turning its attention to processes of cultural production that would enable the infrastructure of a city to support a new economy of ideas. The technology ‘industry’ was turning into a new stage in which cultural practices emerged to augment the infrastructure of the city. This cultural infrastructural turn also coincided with an understanding of the city as a site of large-scale infrastructure investment, fuelled by the logic of economic 'thermal inertia’. The New Economy of Art, by its own reckoning, takes the existing economic, economic-political and political-cultural framework of the city as a given, and then proceeds to sketch out a scenario where the social, spatial and spatial dimensions of the city’s economic and social life are generated and elaborated through the experiments now conducted at the RCA under the auspices of the Biennial. These experiments, it turns out, were already beginning to point to the conclusion that significant social change</text>

Through its experimentation, the New Economy of Art argues that the technology industry – which had largely been focused on the production of high-value commodities – was now turning its attention to the production of intangible assets such as culture, knowledge, identity and human connection. By capturing and storing the precious minerals and building materials that artists and designers brought to the table, the New Economy of Art hoped to create skills-specific work-stuffs that could then be exchanged between artists and designers. This is just one possible interpretation of the technologies of the time, and it goes against everything we believed we knew about the city. But in the end, the artists and designers who came out of that period with its history and its dense forms of social life are just as likely as any today to be stitched up into shiny object-collectors’ private collections. As museum collections go, however, this is a rarefaction, and the rich and powerful museums that emerged after the transition are particularly adept at maintaining a pretty face for the infrastructure that they build on. The reason is that the richer the infrastructure is,</text>

Through its experimentation, the New Economy of Art argues that the technology industry – which had largely been focused on the production of high-end products such as CAD models and website templates – was slowly but inexorably moving into the production of services (including self-driving cars and data capture and utilisation, as well as financial and legal systems). At the same time, the industry was slowly learning that it’s possible to produce more value in the form of human labour – through the employment of workers’ – than in the commodity form. The concept of the ‘utopian real estate bubble’ – which purported to show signs of fatigue with the ever-increasing rate of profit and to herald in the end of an era of panicky speculative property – provides a framework in which we can consider what the technology industry might do if it put its money where its mouth is.

Through its experimentation, the New Economy of Art argues that the technology industry – which had largely been focused on the production of high-tech products and services – was actually engaged in processes of cultural production that affected the very structure of capital itself. Through its market research and market research agencies, the New Economy of Art was engaged in uncovering ways to impact the socio-economic dynamics of the city in ways that would, in the words of McKee, ‘bridge the gap between public and private space’. The result was a converging set of disparate technologies converging on a city, producing public benefits and ‘bringing dense life forms back into urban environments’. This is true both of the electric car and the drone, but the city is now a full-fledged citizen science agency with its own autonomous vehicle and research agency. Art, of course, plays a crucial role in this process, but the significance is that it has a stake in creating a more just and sustainable city. It’s a role that the biennale today shares with other curatorial practices – such</text>

The experiments in ‘carbon capture and sequestration’ were looking for new ways of integrating waste heat and energy into the infrastructure of the infrastructure, rather than treating it as a pollutant. The incorporation of these new energy technologies meant that the materials, including the cars, could be made to break down and leave behind behind behind behind only the most valuable bits of rock and gas. These materials would enable the future infrastructure companies to recover the energy from the rock and gas – a recovery that would in turn allow the industry to expand – while also opening up all manner of new manufacturing and business opportunities. Inhabitants of the city would then be able to reclaim spaces, such as the streets, from the industry’s hand – and thereby, in the words of McKee, ‘reclaim the city</text>

And the biennale could go further and adopt a dynamic, multi-tiered structure that includes not only production, but also outreach, education and politics, catering to all parts of the planet. A city in transition would extend this radical potentialities of production into the future of the city. This sounds crazy, but it’s happening all over the world. The main biennale promoters in London are now the world's biggest curators of art spaces and art institutions. They’re positioning themselves as global art institutions, trying to commercialise their art form and generate significant shareholder returns for their shareholders. The art institutions of the city are caught between a rock and a hard place.

The fact that it was created as a ‘city in transition’ and then, in the fifth cycle, is one way to signal the inroads that this cultural-economic-technological revolution has made in reconfiguring the city. It’s another way for cultural capital to reclaim the urban space that has become increasingly commodifiable. But it’s also another way for cultural capital to infuse new life into the city through its own creative processes – such as the experiments in ‘carbon capture and sequestration’ described in the book I just re-bought, The New Economy of Art, by Ross McKee, Timothy Cullum, and Graham Hicks. Through its experimentation, the New Economy of Art argues that the technology industry – which had largely been focused on the production of high-end, high-return returns – was increasingly turning its attention to processes that required little or no energy (and were therefore cheaper and easier to deploy in the world wide south than in the world wide north). These included processes for capturing and storing surplus energy, as well as ways to use that surplus to power future technological innovations. This is consistent with the growing distance between the oil and natural-gas industries in the north and the oil and gas industries in the south, as well as the industry’s need for ever-cheaper energy. And this is consistent with the assumption that the technologies of autonomous vehicles will lead to the technologies of urban sprawl.The point remains that the technological revolution that began in the mid-1990s and which, as the name implies, is all about the rise of the machine, is happening now in the northern city of Edmonton, where the last auto plant closed in 2015. And as the author of the book makes clear, this</text>

Through its experimentation, the New Economy of Art argues that the technology industry – which had largely been focused on the production of high-return returns on investments – was finding new uses for technologic innovation. The novel argues that the infrastructural transformations that followed World War II also had an impact on the city, and that these impacts would continue to have an impact for decades to come. The infrastructural transformations described in the novel – the deployment of robotics and advanced manufacturing processes in the service of more efficiently managing huge amounts of produce – created new jobs and transformed the global economy in fundamentally profound ways. The novel also poses a question about the capacity of contemporary technological innovation to shape collective action across vast spaces of the globe. In the wake of these technological revolutions, can we create a similar rethink of our cities? McKee and Cullum’s account of the ‘collapse of the global economy’ places the novel firmly in the present. It’s a snapshot in time, but it reflects the trajectory of a society that is increasingly disconnected from the physical world. The</text>

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the partnership of three professional artists: Ray Conway, Billy Curzon and Joe Lennon. Ray Conway was a painter and director, while Billy Curzon was a photographer and editor. The name of the group came from a magazine they had read together. Their interest in the supernatural and the supernatural in general, and the arts in particular, was what Conway and Lennon called ‘a shared temperament and set of convictions’.[7] Their joint 1931 Self Portrait is a portrait writing about the natural world, but it is also a plea for a return to the magical world of the ancient Middle-Eastern myths and fantasy. It is a plea that is shared by the other artists, including the Jack London Prize winning George Paul Welsh, who portrays the enfant terrible as a wizard’s apprentice in a series of four paintings, one of</text>

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the merger of the Birds of Paradise chamber and the Liverpool Art Gallery. The Liverpool Biennial was established in 1988 and the 1998 Granby Four chamber was closed. The Liverpool Biennial 2016 opened with an exhibition of new work, and the Granby Four’s 2016 exhibition was inspired by the Chronicle’s 1922/23 collection, including works by Mies A Schiff, Janet Lee, Mary Turner and Peter Kenny. It was also presented as part of the Future City programme, which also featured Mies A Schiff, Janet Lee and Peter Kenny.

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the partnership of two local artists: Frank MacConnal and Mary Turner (both artists were from Liverpool), John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Frank MacConnal was an American photographer born in Liverpool in 1903. He was a founder of the Liverpool Biennial, the Liverpool National Portrait Gallery, and the Glenn Head Gallery, and was curator of the Australian and New Zealand Pavilion at The Whitechapel Gallery. He was a curator for the New York Times, Geoff Cox Gallery and the New York Gazelle Gallery.

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the merger of the Granby Four Novels and Granby Four Magazine. The Granby Four Novels were published in the early instalment in the four-volume set, with Kenny as the author. Lennon was the editor of Granby Four (with W. W. Simpson) and editor of Granby Four (with W. W. Clarke) magazines. All four were regular readers of The Granby Four (and The  One Magazine), and had been for many years. In his review of the Granby Four Magazine, W. W. Clarke cited the Granby Four’s history, noting that ‘the  Granby Four were part of a tradition of artists, writers and traditions in the area...The  Granby Four’s contribution to the Comradery was a turn of phrase that, throughout</text>

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the union for artists Ken Mowbray and Bill Clark, and the Transvaal Film &amp; Video Workshop, whose members included John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The Granby Four formed a royal council and councilors included William Brewster, Edward Kayne, Sarah Jane Churchill and John McCartney. The councilors included both artists and people with a wide range of skills, professions and experience. A list of councilors can be found at Kayne Collection, London. The Granby Four worked hard and on a regular basis, developing a long-term relationship with the Transvaal Film &amp; Video Workshop, which produced many videos and still images throughout the 1920s and 1930s, among them some very popular with the new postgraduate generation of film artists. A special interest also focused on the arts education of young people, particularly through the provision of theatre, dance, photography and games to local schools.</text>

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the merger of two art gallery organisations: Granby Art Gallery and Granby Performing Arts Centre. The Granby Performing Arts Centre was a fringe arts organisation with a secular mission, operating under the auspices of the Granby Performing Arts Club. The Granby Four were not authorised to engage in performance or teach at Granby Art Gallery, but they made a show for the gallery, performing at events there and at other venues, and organising a series of community fairs and free public performances. Ken Mowbray, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr formed the band The Beatles, while Ringo was a keyboardist. The Granby Four performed regularly at Granby Performing Arts Centre, with Ken Mowbray playing bass. The band members all maintained homes in the area and used their stage names interchangeably.

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the merger of two trade unions: the National Union of Postal and Truck Drivers (later the Transport Workers Union), the Professional Box Office, and the National Association of Theatre, Film and Stage Workshop. All four unions had their roots in the city, and their origins in the trade unions were in fact industrial in nature; the only difference being that the Transport Workers Union had its origins in Liverpool. Yet, the Granby Four (along with other postal workers in the city) were able to develop a politics of their own, one that was as much about the needs of the community as it was about the needs of the transport company. It wasn’t until the mid-1920s, however, that the politics of the community was brought into focus in the way that it was for the first time in Liverpool. The political culture of the area began to be defined by the needs of the transportation companies. In 1920, for example, the C.N</text>

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the merger of the Lennon art collective and Peter Kenny’s Modern Art. Kenny was an artist and writer, while Mowbray was a photographer and writer. All four were active in the arts and community, often exhibiting their work alongside written comments and observations. The Granby Four’s writing appears in several places as a trio of quotations, some in a conversational tone, others in a furious hunk of hunk-up with lyrics. The quotations are a combination of affectionate jibes aimed at the nostalgic appearance of the arts in the city (Kenny’s is particularly vicious) and a fierce indictment of the social devastation wrought by modernism. One of the final paragraphs of the book Mowbray narrates: ‘The greatest error of modern art was to give place to reason, and that mistake is making art today a mockery of itself.’ There are several more viciously</text>

The Granby Four’s artistic director, Kenn Brown, offered the role to his friend and long-term collaborator, the John Lennon biographer John Lennon, who took it up. Lennon was an avid Beatles fan and wrote several songs about the group’s life in Liverpool. Lennon wrote ‘Mean Streets’ and ‘Mother’ as gospel lyrics and ‘Mother’ accompanied by a ‘hippy drum roll’ as the middle part of the piece. Lennon later recalled the day with the Beatles when they visited his childhood home in the Welsh Streets. The Beatles were on the radio playing ‘Mother’ and ‘Good Morning’ and ‘Good’ days’ and ‘Don’t Think Twice’. Lennon wrote ‘Mother’ as</text>

The Granby Four were formed in Liverpool in 1921 by the merger of the Banff Centre and Banff Springs Hotel. The Banff Centre was renamed the Banff Hot Springs and the Banff Springs Hotel renamed the Banff Hot Springs. The name change was part of a wider ‘cultural detoxification’ programme undertaken by the National Gallery and the Canadian Cultural Institute (later renamed the Chilean Centre for the Performing Arts). The aim of the programme was to rid the local community of the scourge of poverty and homelessness by turning the Banff Hot Springs into a socially engaged arts centre.[7] And, indeed, the cultural values of the day are strikingly similar to those of the  	Granby Four members who formed in 1921. The main difference is that today ‘the Banff Hot Springs’ are an iconic urban landmark and symbol of wealth and social progress in the town’s downtown core, while the  	Granby Four’s heyday is defined by homelessness and poverty</text>

Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary that we actually need to engage with the places we’re not seated in. Perhaps it is that the biennale has such a strong grasp of its real estate market that it could actually be a good thing for the city’s soul. We don’t know what the real economy is, or if there’s even such a thing, but we do know that cities now account for about half of the global GDP. If we do know, however, that cities now generate so much of the world’s wealth and feed into this wealth, then we must ask: what kind of politics of space is this, and how does it impact the future of urban life? Modern cities now largely inhabit the city, but they used to be much more spread out. Cities used to be places where people could afford to live and play, to go to restaurants and shops, to take public transport and so forth. Cities used to be places of exchange, and the</text>

It’s as if, in a strange parallel universe, we actually control where those numbers come from. 	Perhaps it is this disorienting effect that the biennale needs. Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary that we are drawn to them in part because we can no longer imagine that nature has a future for ourselves or that she is somehow more capable of providing for her own future than we are. Perhaps it is that we are able to inhabit the imagined city because we have bank accounts and can no longer imagine ourselves to be landmines or floating in the void. Perhaps it is that today’s urban landscape is too attractive and our fantasy is more readily translated into a physical landscape. Perhaps it is that, in these increasingly virtual and dispersed ways, we are rendered more vulnerable to the vagaries of nature’s unpredictability. Perhaps it is that, in the contemporary biennale, a real city is the enemy of a virtual one. 	But, as always, there are those who would deny the enemy offhand, too easily dismiss such concerns as ridiculousness or simply deny that they exist. A little skepticism is always encouraged, and, as we saw, certain elements</text>

Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary and globalist-oriented that we actually need the biennale to tell us about the city’s urban condition. Perhaps it is that the biennale cannot capture the richness of the city in its own proper venue, and has to be stimulated by the city’s growth and development in order to have any real impact. The reason why biennales finally started to build their publics around specific sites and specific curatorial projects, and started to develop specific art collections and arts institutions around specific sites is that art was the one element of the cultural experience that remained largely unaffected by the new economy and the new way of life. Modern art, and the values that flow from it, becomes almost aesthetic in its own right, with its own set of aesthetics and ethics. It’s as if the biennale is the art gallery of the future, but instead of selling art, sells values. The Biennale as a Curated Event 	The bienn</text>

It’s as if, in a strange parallel universe, we actually control where those numbers come from. 	Perhaps it is this disorienting effect that the biennale needs. Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary and transient that we need to create something more physically dynamic and cinematic in the presence of nature, in order to draw people in. Perhaps it is the fact that, in a city as ever, the city is constantly on the verge of a creative and disruptive form of redevelopment, which can be counted on to add another layer of meaning and mystery to the urban environment. Perhaps it is the fact that, in the biennale’s current incarnation, the magic of architecture and urbanisation, while it continues to deliver economic value for the city, is itself a source of confusion and anxiety for visitors and urban dwellers alike. Perhaps it is that, while the current form of the biennale may well be the most ephemeral and transient of the many forms that it takes today, the underlying ideas and values of the biennale are timeless and can offer valuable, radical and poetic continuance to an otherwise ‘abstract and immobilising’ world.

Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary and globalised that we need to actively seek out and engage with wild spaces and cultures. Perhaps it is that the city has become such a large and imposing structure that it is no longer possible for a city to sustain such a diversity of cultural experiences across the city. Perhaps it is a combination of the above. It is difficult to define the precise capacity of a biennale, but we can all agree that it is something that is constantly expanding and evolving, and that is of great concern to the city. Whether it is a continuous, ‘once in a lifetime’ kind of event that is unique to Paris, or a ‘once in a decade’ kind that occurs every two years in a city of its size and shape, but with significant regional variations, like the Asian financial crisis, the biennale needs to be adaptable and responsive to the needs and preferences of its users.

Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary that we can no longer call them cities, but it is also that cities no longer constitute the bulk of humanity’s population. Cities are in fact no longer the dominant form of human geography; the vast majority of humans now inhabit rural areas, the vast majority of which are either cattle ranches or farming communities. Rural dwellers constitute about a quarter of the human race, yet urban habitats are the bulk of what remains when habitat is counted. How do we create habitats that are fertile and water-scarce, and which can support a growing human species? One option is to abandon the pursuit of economic growth and instead strive to build nature’s capacity for self-repairing through cooperation and mutual aid. Such cooperation would mean accepting and responding to the elements that cause urban sprawl and generate climate change, rather than attempting to negate them through wasteful growth. Such cooperation would also mean acknowledging that some cities would become far more ‘economically valuable’ through the reduction in</text>

It’s as if, in a strange parallel universe, we actually control where those numbers come from. 	Perhaps it is this disorienting effect that the biennale needs. Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary and dependent on transnational markets that we have to actively seek out and engage with other cultures, or at least those cultures that we think are capable of creating alternative futures. It is quite possible that the biennale could be engaged with in a way that is not reductive and blind, and that is driven by factionalism and not ideology. 	There are of course far more cultural producers than we can ever imagine, and it is quite possible that the biennale could be engaged with by a diverse range of audiences, including those who do not identify with a particular art school or tradition. Nevertheless, the fact that the biennale is most able to engage with its subject matter, and to produce significant literary works and cultural products does not necessarily follow from a primacy of cultural values or discourses. The biennale must find ways to engage with and, ultimately, produce on its own unique identity and priorities. 	Finally, and perhaps most crucially, the</text>

It’s as if, in a strange parallel universe, we actually control where those numbers come from. 	Perhaps it is this disorienting effect that the biennale needs. Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary that we need extraordinary physical exertion and physical activity in order to be able to inhabit them. Perhaps it is that the sedentary nature of the city has created an environment in which the biennale must operate at peak efficiency, or at least in order to maintain its place in the cultural landscape. Perhaps it is that the biennale is able to affect change in a city because it is able to identify and mobilize those with whom it can work constructively. 	But it is also true that the biennale typically begins to lose its shape and personality when people have had enough of the city. The art museums, which always seem to populate the cultural landscape, take on a life of their own, competing for audiences with the very architecture and urban transformations they were commissioned to present. The biennale is, in effect, becoming what it calls a ‘policy shop’. It is able to produce results, but also to act as a powerful blunt instrument when those</text>

Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary and globalised that we need spectacle in order to sustain interest and imagination. Perhaps it is that the biennale is able to achieve significant engagement and fundraising success because it is able to inhabit the city in such a way as to be visible and resonate with the city’s resources, but at the same time, unable to create a sense of place or identity for the city. Perhaps it is that the biennale is able to do both because it is so embedded in its institutionalised form and has been trained to do so. 	The question, then, becomes whether the biennale can achieve both the symbolic and material objectives of the city. I believe it can. Whether by reflecting the city’s fragmented urban landscape or its spectacular urban fabric, the biennale can create new experiences for visitors to the city, or both. And I believe that the biennale should do both, in a way that reflects the city’s rich cultural heritage and</text>

Perhaps it is the fact that modern urban environments are so sedentary that we actually need to engage with them, to get a sense of their physical and psychological impact, to grasp the social implications of our physical presence. Perhaps it is the fact that cities today live in ever larger and more complex ways, with ever-greater financial burdens on the shoulders of citizens, which makes it impossible to simultaneously inhabit the city and expand it. Perhaps it is the fact that in an ever-greater city, the biennale must also simultaneously inhabit the city’s infrastructure and infrastructures, which means that in an ever-greater city, the biennale must also inhabit the cultural landscape. If this is the case, the city will of course also become increasingly complex, and our ability to perceive its heterogeneity and diversity will be greatly reduced. 	However, this kind of complexity cannot exist in a vacuum; it’s not possible to inhabit the city in its current form while remaining oblivious to its changing appearance and character. The</text>

And so, for example, I come to a place and I am supposed to like it, but I feel compelled to ‘join’ the hundreds of thousands of people who are already there. And so, I feel like I am part of a community that has a stake in the city’s destiny, and so I join the thousands of people who are already ‘involved’ in the city’s destiny. 	But I also feel like I am missing out on something because I am not following the herd’s lead, and so I am drawn to different traditions, to different ways of interacting. I do feel like I am missing out on so many levels by not following the herd’s lead, and so I listen to art and artists who are not part of the herd. 	The other thing is, of course, the politics of culture. And so I</text>

And so I’m not entirely clear what you’d say when someone says, well, I follow the national dress, or something along those lines. It’s not like I say, ‘I’m going to follow the national dress’ and then find something else to do. I can see the benefits of that, but I don’t see how that is different from thinking about a community of people who happen to live together in a given city or in a given community of nations. 	I guess what I’m getting at is that there is a difference between what we think of as ‘the collective body’ and what I would consider ‘the individual body’; between what we call ‘nature’</text>

But I also find it really difficult to imagine a crowd of people coming together because they share a common set of beliefs and practices, because it is not possible: there is no shared common ground that people come to. James, speaking at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, 2017. Photo courtesy of the Edinburgh Fringe Archive. 	I also feel like I am missing something by not thinking about crowds as a collective assemblage of human experiences, but rather as individuals engaging in an experience with a collective identity. 	I think that crowds have this in common with cities: they are often transient. I also feel like there is a gap between the people who are coming to work out, play football, go to the cinema or whatever and the people who are actually coming to see art or to engage with research or to come to a conference or a demonstration.

The other thing is that there are certain shared values – these shared sets of relations – and so while the city itself is a complex place, and so is its crowd, it’s also a complex place because of its size and the complexity of its built environment. And so the crowd in a given city has this shared set of values, and these shared sets of relations are also what make it ‘different’ from other forms of cultural tourism: it’s the crowds that travel to see the art of a particular place, or the crowds that travel to a particular place on the island, that’s why they come to Hawaii, or the crowds that come to see plays by Aaron Burr in particular. It’s because the city itself</text>

But I also mean something quite different when I say ‘being present’. I mean something quite different when I say ‘being present’ in the sense of becoming embedded in a particular place and behaving in certain ways. And I guess what I mean by that is that in a given city or in a given community of nations, there is an assumption about who is ‘in’ and who is ‘out’ and that these things are not just assumed, but actually part of the DNA of the place. It’s as if the place adopts them, or derives a meaning from them. 	Jameson, op. cit.

James also suggests that we might start to consider cultural tourism as a kind of ‘gift economy’: the exchange of things, or services, across cultures. I wholeheartedly agree with this assessment.

And I’m not saying that everyone who comes to visit Paris or any of the other places I visit in the world is going to identify with every ideology or every custom or every ‘culture theory’. 	But I do find it difficult to reconcile a certain kind of cultural tourism, where the art is clearly going to be appreciated and the people who engage with it are going to engage with it with a particular set of values, with the current institutional racism that exists in some of those places. I’m not saying that every white artist in that part of the world is going to be an equal or even a good representation of the people who are actually in those places, but I do feel like if the audience is made up of people of a certain set of values, or people of a certain culture or set of beliefs, or people of a certain religion, then they can’t possibly all</text>

And so people who live in the same city or the same neighbourhood or the same village and have the same politics and the same religion, or share the same tastes in food and so on, are likely to share similar curatorial approaches and so forth. But what I find even more difficult in such cases is the crowd’s ability to support that which it perceives as its true shared meaning or identity. For example, I live in a Jewish neighbourhood in the East Bay, which is predominantly Armenian-speaking but also Chinese, and so as a result of the occasional random encounter between a Chinese and Armenian person, or a Chinese and Filipino person, or a Chinese and Argentinian person, who is Chinese, the Chinese have this idea of a shared identity, or more accurately, that they have a shared identity that is not necessarily the identity of the people from whom they are speaking</text>

So, if you take the traditional idea of the pilgrim, or the tourist, or the pilgrim, or the pilgrim in medieval times – which was a pilgrim in many ways – and we combine the modern idea of the tourist, the multi-brand shopper, the multi-lingual marketer, the ­museum ­tourist, and we introduce the new multi-cultural traveller, we get a multi-level traveller that engages with the city in many ways. 	I think that in our current globalised and multi-cultural society, it’s important to think about the people and groups that are still drawn to specific places and their particular histories and languages, and to think about how that relates to the larger globalised dynamic that we live and work within.

In an effort to reconcile the contradictions of contemporary culture, curators and artificial intelligences are being trained to collaborate and exchange across platforms, operating on a global scale. While the relationship between curators and AI may seem exotic and speculative, the growing convergence of information technologies, cultural consumption and media technologies is illustrative of a larger trend of cultural fluidity paralleling those of AI. In an age of ubiquitous AI platforms, it is important for all participants in the art form to be vigilant and aware of the capabilities and vulnerabilities of their systems.

In a poem that has since been appropriated by a range of other writers, Truscello reflects on the poetic encounter, the bureaucratic nature of the art form, and the limits of artistic imagination:Job-seeking is a common situation in which artists are engaged in seeking work outside the artist’s context or country. The encounter with Herbert Gödel, however, places an entirely different frame of reference – one grounded in what can be called ‘national identity’. In the event, the poem is a defence against what is perceived as a hostile work environment, a perception of things which are perceived as not belonging to ‘</text>

It is not just the medium, but the point at which the medium encounters the social world, which may be more complex and dynamic. The challenge then becomes how to address the social world with art, while avoiding the complex and powerful social forces that can lead to war. In other words, might makes right, but art has to be contextually political, powerful and conscious in order to achieve this status. I propose a new curatorial paradigm that seeks to reconcile the multiplicity of forms of social world-making through the art form of architecture, but also the social world through the art form of architecture.

In the 1990s she co-founded the biennial Aarhus, Denmark, and the then-future archipelago of Aarhus Archipelago, Denmark, with Fredrik Slotow, Fredrik Styger and Peter Weibel. She has worked on the historical period between World Wars I and II in the contemporary period from the 2011 film The Water Diviner to the 2017 documentary We Are Floating, which was filmed in the archipelago. She is a co-curator of the Fifth Biennial in Istanbul, Turkey, and the curator of the exhibition The Floating Press, Istanbul, Turkey. She curated the 2016 Venice Biennale and the 2016 London and New York Museums. She was a curator of the 2017 Venice Biennale, Istanbul.She is the Creative Director for the forthcoming Doha Biennale, Qatar, and the eight-city Seattle/Tacoma International Airport Sculpture Ensemble. She has also curated the U.S. Coast Salish SeaTacos, Washington. Biennials have always remained an important event for the cities that host them, and biennials are a part of that history of interest. But the shift from the historic biennial to the increasingly popular art-historical biennale is striking, and it is partly a result of changes in the curatorial role. The advent of social media curating processes has made it easier to access, and also to change, a biennial as often as two years in advance of its actual arrival. And the proliferation of cities sharing a biennale, even within the same</text>

The present is a complex era in which cultural production requires multidisciplinary production, and biennials are vital for the survival of the cultural commons. However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to a significant degree to today, are changing. That is, the past is still a major site of contention. In the 1960s, artists and arts organisations fought over control of the exhibition – which was then divided into smaller, more discrete episodes – and over who would be able to take over the biennale. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a general assumption that the biennial could be freely chosen by the public, and so the number of episodes was further restricted. But the number of episodes has expanded considerably in recent decades, and so now the public has a right to choose between more than one episode of the same kind at the same time. To take part in an episode, a person has to be a specialist in one field, and be a member of the audience for at least one of the other. So an artist could have a socio-political or ethnographic focus in a local art context, while a biennalist could focus on a particular region or sub</text>

However, their historical positions and the ways in which they constrain cultural exchange are critical to our understanding of their contemporary relevance. The present is a complex era in which cultural production requires multidisciplinary production, and biennials are vital for the survival of the cultural commons. However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to life in general, are becoming increasingly complex, even adversarial. This is partly due to the advent of mass media, which makes it easier and more accessible to report on cultural phenomena. It is also the result of the advent of digital media, which make it easier and more accessible to collate and share cultural phenomena. But most of all, it is the consequence of the enormous, often unchecked, part played by corporations and the wider economic sector, which contributes massively to cultural production worldwide. We need to be aware that the exhibitionary form is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain, and events such as the Venice Biennale are a symptom of this.In the coming years, I plan to embark on a three-year research project into the social and political circumstances that created the biennale, and to come up with a set of themes or paradigms that will articulate the inescapable interconnection between art and economy.

The present is a complex era in which cultural production requires multidisciplinary production, and biennials are vital for the survival of the cultural commons. However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to the future, is also a critical moment. The biennial is an episodic show with a spatiality that is constantly shifting. It’s an art form that has developed a spatiality with particular worlds, and these worlds are constantly evolving, constantly evolving in response to the world around it. In this process, biennials create a temporal context that is constantly in motion, constantly shifting, and in which different worlds can be found. This creates a spatiality that is both real and fictional, and this is essential to their spatiality.Real: the spectacle of the present. The biennial is constantly making new worlds possible through a process of de-realisation. It creates new kinds of historical situations, new kinds of imagined futures, and it generates new kinds of stories. It calls into being new worlds that can be found in the present, or creating pasts and futures – worlds that can be imagined and constructed from the past. The ‘present’ is constantly (re</text>

The present is a complex era in which cultural production requires multidisciplinary production, and biennials are vital for the survival of the cultural commons. However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to the future, is developing and changing. At the same time, understanding and acceptance of the cultural commons is developing processes that may make the form less valuable and the future more valuable. The past is often a complicated world, and understanding the future is even more so. This book attempts to bring our understanding of the historical dynamics of the exhibitionary form into the present. Its first chapter describes the history of the biennale, its genesis, its evolution and its future prospects. The chapter titled ‘The Exhibitionary Complex: Its Character and Structure’ describes the evolution of the biennial as an exhibitionary form in modern and contemporary societies. It also offers tentative ideas about what the future may hold for the form. The next chapter ‘Present and Future Curators’ profiles ten of these most prominent artists and their work in an attempt to bring their understandings of the form into line with today’s practices. It starts with a brief overview of biennials as an art form</text>

However, their historical positions and the ways in which they constrain cultural exchange are critical to our understanding of their contemporary relevance. The present is a complex era in which cultural production requires multidisciplinary production, and biennials are vital for the survival of the cultural commons. However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to capitalism in particular, are only part of the story. The real commons-producing agency resides in the hands of cultural producers and users, and the other is a story that is increasingly constructed by other people, often through their own actions. The artist becomes a cultural producer, and the artist’s contribution to the story becomes a story that is shared and commodified. Art has great power because it is both blunt and blunt tools. It is both able and unqualified in its ability to make things happen. But it has to be used responsibly because it threatens the status quo. The real commons-producing agency lies elsewhere. The real agency lies in the people with whom the art is made.The lesson, then, is that real agency and a revolutionary end result must come from above – from the top down. The biennale must be a once-in-a-generation event, and it must be a catalyst that brings artistic production and cultural life together in a sustained way for the whole</text>

However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to the future, is developing as an ever-more complex set of exchanges take place within them, and in the world around them. As the biennial becomes more of a transient phenomenon, and as cultural capital expands across multiple sites and borders, it is vital for the cultural commons to be discovered and unearthed. Even if the biennial is identified as an art form, and is widely perceived as such, its organisation, historical and contemporary, plays a role in the historical formation of the biennial, and in the future curatorial agenda. For the cultural commons to have any lasting claim on the biennial, it is critically for it to be discovered and unearthed.  	[i] Curtis Ioannidis, The Culture of the Future: Contemporaneous Imaginations of a Shared Future (New York: New Vessel Press, 2015), p. 21.Download this article as PDFCurtis Ioannidis is Director of the Centre for Contemporary Art Research at McGill University</text>

The present is a complex era in which cultural production requires multidisciplinary production, and biennials are vital for the survival of the cultural commons. However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to contemporary art in particular, is developing to the point where the past is no longer a major input into the future (just as the biennial was in the 1960s). The art biennale as an institution is changing, and with it the types of cultural exchange it supports. But the art biennale as a form is developing more and more like other art forms, becoming more like a museum, where the past is no longer the primary input into the future but acts as a variable through which the curator builds future art. This is happening at a rapid pace, and the biennale that emerges as a ‘curatorial discovery’ in the forthcoming decades will be no different. The interest in the past, as we age, tends to heighten with each passing generation, whereas the interest in the future tends to diminish. This is true for art and artistic practice, but it is especially true for artists. The major art biennials are those that emerged in the twentieth century (</text>

I have chosen to pay particular attention to the ways in which the biennale is different today than it was in the 1960s. The exhibitionary form is no longer the dominant mode of cultural exchange in the world, and biennials are increasingly rare, and often displaced within the curatorial agenda. However, their historical positions and the ways in which they constrain cultural exchange are critical to our understanding of their contemporary relevance. The present is a complex era in which cultural production requires multidisciplinary production, and biennials are vital for the survival of the cultural commons. However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to the future, are also essential. Even if some might argue that biennials should be curated to generate more attention to the art they are exhibiting, or perhaps to engage more people in the art form by offering more activities, exchanges and cultural value, their primary role is to deliver the art to be displayed. The fact that art is culturally reproduced in the biennial format is a fact of which artworld stakeholders must be aware. If they do not ensure that art is reproduced in the most relevant ways, or engage more people in the art form through exhibitions, and especially if they do not create environments that foster a more dynamic exchange between art professionals and artists, the value that they create will be curated largely by local artworld stakeholders rather than judged on the merit of an artist’s art alone. The reality is that most biennials today are engaged in one or another of several things: coping with declining audiences; meeting increasing numbers of new art-seeking visitors; or both.</text>

However, their institutional forms and their relationship to the past, and to the future, is developing. The biennial as an exhibitionary form is no longer enough to sustain cultural life in the world; we need cultural production at its larger scale. Further, we need to create means to map, coordinate and circulate cultural ideas and images across vast geographical areas. This may require the creation of parallel, interconnected but distinct cultural forms, which are not reducible to the basic biennial form. For example, the biennale as an art form is no longer able to exist in a city with a limited number of biennials, and may need to find other places of cultural exchange outside of cities. Art and artists’ congregations are key to this need. However, the creation of culturally significant artworks is only part of the equation. Art has a much more significant cultural impact than that, and artists need to know how to use artistic media and perceive cultural change. I have drafted a list of questions that artists should be able to recognise when assessing the impact of</text>

I have selected seven themes that capture the current creative inflection in the art and art-related curatorial agenda. These themes are ‘Exhibition + Event’, and ‘Unfold’, two phrases that capture the dynamic between art and commerce that characterises the ‘Exhibitionary Curatorial Agenda’. ‘Exhibition + Event’ captures the underlying principles of the exhibitionary curatorial agenda. It describes the conditions on which the biennial can or cannot rely on, and the conditions on which it or it may or may not embark. It describes the mode of cultural circulation within and across nation-states, and the practices and ideologies that enable or impede its circulation. It describes the conditions of cultural inaccessibility. It describes the mode of symbolic or archival exchange, and the inaccessibilities of metric representations in cultural production. ‘Unfold’ describes the modes of symbolic or</text>

There would be no war, no revolution, just massive data capture and analysis.   A few weeks into the symposium, we were invited to a launch event at the Tate Britain, where the symposium would be visited by a live band. The symposium was an art event in a social media era, so there was that too. The symposium was a kind of odd duck in the art world. It was open to the artist community, but the audience was mostly twentysomething to early thirties students of art and visual culture. Most of the artists who came to the symposium were artists either newly minted or had been for some time. The majority were artists from the local area who had worked with or under the guidance of the symposium organisers. It was an isolated event, most of the artists staying away from the media (or their art on the periphery). The media rarely comes to ‘home’ or ‘roots’ events. The media tends to capture and narrate, while the</text>

There would be no war, no revolution, just a future that is guaranteed to deliver big business, infrastructure and social benefits.  Having rehearsed the event in my head many times, I took the opportunity to ask questions of the audience during the symposium. The question of how art can play a role in the future of a community that is already experiencing a revolution is a good one. The symposium was open to the public and the audience. I was invited because I was a specialist in the field of infrastructuralism and the social consequences of art making. The symposium had been commissioned by the sustainability company Save the Art and was part of their research into the future of art and the arts. The symposium, a public forum, invited artists to speak about the issues and hopes of the symposium. The symposium itself was an artistic opportunity for the artists to speak openly and build campaigns around the issues. For example, by the artists' own admission, their engagement with the idea of community as a community of</text>

The film would then be about the past, but this time we would be in the presence of people and objects from the future who can influence the future. If the symposium started early, with the film projected on a wall in the Art Gallery, the N.G.C. would have started early to commission artworks for the building that day. The artworks would have been delivered late in the building – partly because they were delivered to the Biennial Council in time by post, but also because they were part of a series of new works commissioned by the council in response to the symposium. These works, which included works by artists including Meehan Crist, Wim Wenders and Ray Bradbury, and organisations including Children Rising and The Royal Academy, brought together thinkers from a range of disciplines to explore</text>

There would be no war, no revolution, just technocratic advances in science and technology. But the question of community would still be played out in-depth in the symposium, as it is in the biennial and the biennial Council 2018 report.  The symposium would also have invited artists to share their current projects and projects in the future. I declined the invitation because I felt the need to share projects with an audience who might have different kinds of experience of cities and places. For me, the important thing is to tell stories that people can identify with; to draw people in by showing them places they might want to be.  The important thing is to share stories that people can relate to. If I can raise my profile by telling a story in front of an audience of thousands, that’s an important step.  But I also felt the need to be open-minded and diverse in how I told my story because I wasn’t sure how people would relate to a story told by an artist. In</text>

There would be no war, no revolution, just displaced populations and a future that seems bleak and empty.  The symposium had been designed with participation in in mind. Participants would engage with the theme of their own futures through an in-gallery exhibition that would ask, ‘How might we create new possibilities for the future based on the past?’ The participants would be allowed to explore the idea of displaced populations in greater detail, through questions around migration, but the main thrust of the symposium would be about the cities themselves. The participants would then be allowed to offer their own futures in a set of six case studies: Belfast, Istanbul, San Francisco, New York and Mumbai. The themes of the symposium would be influenced by the curators’ own interests and values, but the participants would not have any authority or vested interest in their futures. In the case of a joint venture, the symposium would function as a launch pad for further developments including an independent publication of the artist-led symposium.  At</text>

There would be no war, no revolution, just a future that is more variable and unpredictable. For the symposium, I was asked to reflect on some of my own past curating, particularly when I was curator of the Liverpool Biennial in the decade immediately preceding the Iraq War. I thought I would reflect on the situation from a curatorial and cultural point of view. I asked the artists and organisations who had commissioned me to imagine a world in which social media had not yet fundamentally altered the curatorial role. I envisaged a future in which artists and organisations still actively engage with the behaviours and ideologies of their communities in a way that cannot be replaced and in which art is essential to enable that engagement. The audience was divided into two groups: those who consider themselves part of a rarefaction, and those who consider themselves part of a public. The curatorial role today is defined by the participation of an increasing number of people in a given situation. At the N.G.O.I. conference in October 2013, Geoffrey</text>

There would be no war, no revolution, no dystopia, just the general potential for the future to be a conflicted one.  Its just possible that as technology advances, the future could be a pre-apocalyptic one in which only AI can hope to protect us from.  So far, so normal. But what the symposium implied was that we were also witnessing a moment where the curatorial might intervene to intervene in the very fabric of the city in a way that is most impactful in its ability to foster creativity and imagination. The intervention might well be artistic in nature, as in the symposium suggested, or it might be technological, as in some other recent biennials, including the Liverpool Biennial, which has recently funded a programme of projects exploring the impacts of AI on art’s future.Art and the BiennialThe symposium itself, Curators on a Mission, invited us to engage in a dialogue about the role of the arts in a future urban environment.

There would be no war, no revolution, just a general algorithmic future. As usual, the symposium would be a place to engage in idle talk, lost in the noise of the metropolis, its economic nadir and a future that seems limitless in the possibilities of what might be.  A symposium is a place where art and social critique meet and intersect and where art can exist alongside a social purpose or fulfilling a function in the social. It is a place where the two meet and intersect and flourish, and I was invited along for part of the symposium.  The other part of the symposium, the audience, was a fascinating and dynamic mix of artists, activists, artists, curators, writers and others who came together to discuss, debate and ultimately find common ground on the nature of the symposium. In the early stages of the symposium, the audience was a mix of young and old, from university students to artists, academics, artists and others with a range of experience and knowledge.

I was invited along for a 'soft' look into the future through the symposium. As usual, the symposium would be an exploration of a specific future with no specific past. There would be no war, no revolution, just ordinary ways of being online and offline. This time, though, the symposium would have to address a future that is both present and future in character. Its scope would have to encompass both the physical and virtual worlds. Because, as the exhibition at the Liverpool Biennial Commission showed, the virtual is everywhere and the real nowhere. Interactive media such as social media, apps, websites and augmented reality are everywhere and create both the present and the future. They are the medium of the future, but also the past. They re-present and redefine what the word ‘present’ means, and how we act and think within it. This symposium would be nothing without the virtual. It would exist in a different world, but it would also be a ‘present’ record of the past. Its content and tone would have to be crafted with social media in mind. The symposium would have to be interactive and memorable, but it also had to be real, so</text>

I was invited along for a 'soft' look into the future through the symposium. As usual, the symposium would be an exploration of a specific future with no specific past. There would be no war, no revolution, just technological change. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, computerisation and social media allowed for instantaneous access to data that made it easier to map neighbourhoods and follow trends. It was also easier to follow hashtags connected to specific behaviours. The symposium would be a perfect place to look for a hashtag that means something different in 2017 than it does in 1990. The idea of the symposium would be to follow a theme from many different perspectives and bring together different curatorial approaches to a single overarching idea. For this symposium, we looked at how social media and analytics are changing urban development and how those changes are affecting curatorial approaches to imagining, organising and organising that future. For me, the theme of the symposium was affected by the information technologies that were emerging in and around the city at that time. As new information technologies became more commonplace, symposia such as the one in Liverpool became less able to keep up with the times. In the 1990s, art and</text>

The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism.

This tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the shifting sands and the shifting sands of history, and as such, it is intimately tied to the displacement of people and the movement of humanity.But what if, instead of the modern and the moving sands of history, we instead called the present an episode, a point in time, a sequence of movements culminating in the present? This would make the present the living and the motion of time itself, and would entail a new way of organizing contemporaneity itself.

The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it is closely tied to the rise of finance capital and its various regulatory agencies. As such, it is part of a larger global trend toward the society of the future occupant of the social space that is increasingly mediated through technical means. Thus, the postmodern is a condition of increasingly mediated historical conditions. It is neither here nor there, but constantly strives to incorporate elements of the past and to reconceive the past in ways that are mutually exclusive of one another. It is a condition that is no less real, and no less exploitative, than everyday life. This is why Marx gave the ‘postindustrial’ sector of toto technology the name ‘cause célèbre’, and why, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, economists and political scientists were drawn to this sector of the economy. It is why, in the 1980s and 1990s, the arts and aesthetics were cited as a key distinguishing feature of the new ‘public’ sphere of the</text>

The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it is understood as a ‘materialization’ of the past, including the dead weight of bureaucratic capture, domination and exploitation that characterizes modernity itself. It is a tendency that can and must be changed, but achieving this change is itself a fraught and complicated enterprise. What is at Stake in the Quest for Automata?What is at Stake in the quest for autonomous vehicles? The answer to this is clear. The future is a place where machines are not at all constrained. There are no borders or technological singularities that stand in the way of machine learning and machine translation. There are no records of human history that need to be erased. There are no taboos or social taboos that need to be broken down into smaller pieces. There are no cultural taboos that need to be forcibly removed from the contemporary world. There are no taboos or social taboos that need to be forcibly removed from the public sphere. There are, however, certain fundamental assumptions that need</text>

The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it is understood as a process of continuously regenerating and upgrading the technology of historical materialism. And to a large extent, this process of upgrading is automated: new kinds of biopolitics are projected onto the planet as new kinds of workers are recruited to fill jobs that used to be done by robots.Yet the postmodern condition is also characterised by the tendency toward the projection of new media of historical forms into the physical world. And this is to be found in all of the technological revolutions that have taken place since the late nineteenth century, and in all of the technological advancements that have been made in the biological sciences and in the humanities over the past half century. As a consequence, the physical world is constantly undergoing transformations that can be classified as postmodern, whether we are talking about the ways in which images are produced and received, or the ways in which images are constituted and acquired. And this tendency toward the reproduction of images as media of historical forms can be found in any technological revolution</text>

The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it is also a product of the cultural species, which includes, among other things, biennials, which are exhibitions of things, exhibitions, exhibitions, and so forth. And yet, the postmodern is also a pidgin, a lump of disparate elements, which brings with it its own set of problems. For one thing, the postmodern condition is inherently unstable, subject to both the prevailing forces of nature (climate change, industrialization, wars) and the cultural species’s own creations (political ideologies, economic ideologies, racial ideologies, gender ideologies, religious ideologies). More fundamentally, the tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is itself a cultural artefact, the artefact that produces its own set of problems.

This is the situation in which we find ourselves, mired in a muddled mess of possible futures. We have no clear idea what the future might hold, but we can make educated guesses about what we might like to see.What if, instead of future, we instead called the present an episode, a point in time, a sequence of movements culminating in the present? This would make the present the living and the motion of movement as opposed to the dead and static of automata? Could this offer new perspectives on the past, or at least new ways of organizing events? Here, we can consider the impact of neo-classical and technological modes of historical historical reproduction. The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it is difficult to imagine a world without the postmodern tendency toward the living. It is also becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a world at all. The postmodern tendency toward the living is the product of the proliferation of global information networks, media, and economies of exchange that all require the products of historical processes in some form or another. It is to a large extent a product of the historical and geopolitical event known as the ‘endgame’, which is understood as the moment at which technological capacities become unlimited and political will is all but non-existent. Hence, the postmodern tends to refer to the endgame, while continuing to be haunted by the wreckage of its former splendor.  One might even agree that the inevitable endgame is already here and will at some point in the future be needed to permit the living to continue to operate the technological marvels of the postmodern age. But this is to neglect the role played by the social and cultural forces shaping the aspects of</text>

Here, we can consider the impact of neo-classical and technological modes of historical historical reproduction. The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it is a by-product of the tendency toward ever greater scale and weight and with it, a tendency toward ever greater integration and mobility. But the postmodern condition is also a profoundly visual condition, one that demands a visual language capable of accommodating the multitude of different modalities and intensities of historical movements. Hence, the postmodern aesthetic is itself a form of visual anthropology. It is a set of aesthetic criteria that render aesthetic judgments about things according to their relative amounts of movement, from the quotidian to the conspicuous, from the sublime to the surreal. It is a set of criteria that prescribe what counts as beautiful in the world and what is not.The postmodern aesthetic begins to have a palpable presence in art and design, but its objectifying character remains largely unexamined. The influence of this aesthetic quality, however, can nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless be detected in the design of many modern and contemporary artefacts.

The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it constitutes the very definition of the ‘differentiation’ between today and yesterday, between modernity and barbarity. But what happens after the technological species has exited the realm of the living and moving? What might become available to the imagination as alternate modes of historical production? Here, we can consider the impact of new media and performative forms of art. New media have made it easier than ever to document, take part in and engage with historical events, and to a certain extent, recreate them. A digital camera produces a continuous stream of photos that can be taken anywhere, at anytime, and store this information indefinitely. And as new media have proliferated, so have their uses, which is to say, they have made it easier to take part in symbolic and historical acts of reenactment and re-enactment, and to create new media-based representations of the past. But what if, instead of capturing photos and videos, we instead creatively create and enact new</text>

The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it is intimately tied to the emergence of new media (wired and wireless), social media (Snapchat, Facebook), film and TV, and a host of other new technological platforms. In this new environment, the postmodern is both object and event, but the capacity for both to generate and constrain novel kinds of historical situations. The postmodern condition is both animate and historical, but more specifically, it is a mode of movement that exists in and through the temporal conditions of the contemporary world. It is a mode of movement that is both eventful and dead. 	What might be called the postindustrial or postmedia condition is a global phenomenon. It is becoming ever more evident that the former ‘glorification of labour’ that we were constituted to uphold is no longer sustainable under the weight of ever-greater amounts of information, ever more demanding technologies, and ever more commodified forms of labour. The global circulation of labour generates ever more of it, and the post</text>

Here, we can consider the impact of neo-classical and technological modes of historical historical reproduction. The tendency toward the living and the motion of movement is a product of the technological species, more specifically, the ‘postmodern’ element that characterizes the ‘new’ technologies of historical materialism. As such, it is driven by material interests and desires. When these are fulfilled, they produce a multitude of new ways of organizing historical materialities. But when these possibilities aren’t fulfilled, the surplus of space and animate life that characterizes the historical past inevitably stands in the way of humanity’s future. And so we live in a world that is always moving in some form or another of historical contingency. We can either embrace this as a given (as technology implies) or we can design our futures according to the inbuilt contingency.Our present predicament is a function of how we conceive of the past. If we imagine the past in terms of what is happening now, then we can begin to imagine an alternative future. For example, the alternative to the present is the possibility that humans will one day return to the past and return with an understanding of what life was like before industrialization, and perhaps even a capacity for artistic expression. This is the kind of imagining that occurs through critical and</text>

But this is only possible because these events happen all around us, in the form of continuous repetition, repetition, repetition. We don’t simply perceive these things as patterns or collections of patterns; we have to actively participate in the construction of these patterns. For example, we can create awareness of certain variations of temperature by observing various types of art, by noticing that art exhibits with unusually high or unusually low temperatures tend to be displayed in certain parts of the world, and we can learn to like or dislike art based on observations or observations of art’s actual behaviour.These actions, which may or may not be based on data, are part of a much broader social-political-cultural narrative that is built into the art form; they are part of what Michael Hardt writes about as ‘the culture industry’. The language of ‘impact’ is part of the cultural construction, or the institutionalised desire to explain, that underlies many of the social and political changes occurring in the world today. And although cultural production may be culturally productive, in the end it is also economically destructive. A key question for any such attempt to be grounded in concrete empirical data is</text>

But this is only possible because these events happen all around us, in the form of continuous repetition, repetition, repetition. We don’t simply perceive these things as patterns or collections of patterns; they are the very thing that generate them. And this is the art of the biennial: it captures and describes what’s happening in the world, at a scale that human beings can grasp.What makes the biennial different today is that it is possible to grow old and also to pass away: to cease to be. So the biennial is a ritualised event that invites artists to engage with the very real sense of 'time' and its possible collapse, as a likely future possibility. But it is possible to engage with this possibility in yet bigger, more profound ways. There are ways of experiencing and participating that are more robust, more authentic, more experiential.There are, however, ways of experiencing and participating in the inevitable and ever-present nature of biennials that are not art biennials. And these are the art forms that have, since at least the 1980s, developed their own repertoire of legitimate, even aesthetic, criticism. There is no universal</text>

We don’t simply perceive these things as patterns or collections of patterns; we have to actively participate in creating and emerging from them. And this interconnection and repetition is what biennials are historically about; they’reful of repeating themselves, and that’s why they’re there: to be witnessed, to be repeated.So how do we become conscious of our place in such monumental processes? One way to think about this is through phenomenology. A phenomenology is the study of a specific type of event, occurring or non-occurring, and how it’s possible that such and such a thing could have happened. A phenomenology begins with the characterisation of a phenomenon, and continues with phenomenology’s of the event, event’s. So the first phenomenological approach to the city that I gave at Liverpool was phenomenological. I gave a set of principles that apply to all types of phenomenological experiences – basic to all types of phenomenology – and then I began to talk about what it means to</text>

But this is only possible because these events happen all around us, in the form of continuous repetition, repetition, repetition. We don’t simply perceive these things as patterns or collections of patterns; we actually generate our own patterns through our movements and behaviours. These patterns are generated by all of us, and though they may be generated by an artist, we certainly don’t necessarily share them. When we see a pattern, we can generate a set of recognisable elements, and though we may not all be equally capable of creating such a pattern, we all certainly have the potential. For example, we may all be born with certain physical features and physical capacities, and though we may all be capable of becoming emotionally unstable, we all also have the potential to become physically stable. But this potential is still subject to the development of critical thinking skills, and whilst we may all have the potential to attain that fragile third place in society where people start to question our behaviours and decisions, we do not necessarily share it. Nor do we necessarily share the same levels of empathy and compassion. Yet our behaviours and decisions today are the result of long histories of racism and sexism, and they still have significant</text>

But this is only possible because these events happen all around us, in the form of continuous repetition, repetition, repetition. We don’t simply perceive these things as patterns or collections of patterns; we actually experience them as combinations of patterns. And this is what biennials are good at: they can create contingency, or they can act as catalysts for innovation, or they can narrate the emergence of a new reality. But this complexity is also what makes them vulnerable: they’re fragile, and their very structure cracks under the strain of time and continual alteration. And this reality is constantly evolving, constantly on the edge of collapse.In an effort to keep up with this constantly shifting material world, biennials typically inhabit a particular spatiality – the urban, or ‘archipelagos’ – that are part of a larger dynamic context that includes cultural capital, or ‘cultures of urbanization’. These are places where art is often not celebrated as much as experiencing it is. Art doesn’t normally lives up to its potential in cities, but biennials are a rare instance in which art is actively promoted through a mode of symbolic,</text>

But this is only possible because these events happen all around us, in the form of continuous repetition, repetition, repetition. We don’t simply perceive these things as patterns or collections of patterns; we experience them as repertoires of human behaviour. And this is precisely what we haven’t yet experienced, despite having access to biennials all around us. The biennial is a living thing, exhibiting itself as a way of bringing together elements from different parts of the world so as to reveal a living interconnection. In other words, it’s not just the art of the art (the art of being alive) that makes a biennial interesting, but what it does for a living organism. This is why biennials have lives of their own, and are marked by their own particular set of distinctive marks. A biennial can be counted on to remain alive and creative, contributing to the ongoing creativity of its local community (and the wider world).  	If we take the example of Glasgow, and move it into the present, we can start to see how important it is to understand that Glasgow was a location for many other things around the city as well,</text>

But this is only possible because these events happen all around us, in the form of continuous repetition, repetition, repetition. We don’t simply perceive these things as patterns or collections of patterns; we actually implement them. And this is what biennials do; they introduce a new element into the mix, a new way of looking at the world. The question that arises is: what next? Biennials are now commonly organised into smaller iterations, into sub-genres, into 'locations'. But this is only ever a temporary solution: the biennial will always outlive the particular city in which it takes place, and will always shape what is imagined to be possible in that city. Biennials today also operate in an environment of their own making, shaping what is possible within the city. This may be seen as a quality of the event itself, as distinct from the internal contradictions within the biennial itself. And today, biennials occupy a position of great power, often influencing what is possible within the city. They are, in effect, the embodiment of the city’s destiny. But how does that destiny shape what is possible for the city? And</text>

We don’t simply perceive these things as patterns or collections of patterns; we have to actively participate in their formation and proliferation to truly grasp their dynamic power and strange properties. We need to understand how patterns form and evolve, and why they’re there in the first place.What do we mean when we talk about the biennial? What we mean is a recurring, layered, layered, or bedded set of exhibitions that take place over a sustained period of time; a periodic or ‘biennialised’ set of artists’ residencies; a curatorial or ‘curatorial methodology’ that continuously seeks to expand and contract this set over and beyond what it was before. There’s no singular ‘biennial’ or ‘plateau’ that can be counted on to provide this kind of longevity or ubiquity.

And this is why biennials can be counted on to create enduring images: they’re there to be counted on, and if they’re counted on, then that’s quite a story. The problem with the biennial today is not just a lack of resources; it’s that it is the exception, not the rule. There are so many other forms of art to be having, and happening all around us, that it’s hard to imagine the demands of the biennial anymore. And this is part of the problem: once the biennial has happened, it’s gone and done, and its memory lives on in the form of curatorial intention, curatorial legacy, and biennial stamp.

This is what biennials can and do do: they feed these increasingly elaborate historical patterns that we create. This is what biennials can and do: create these historical narratives that we can no longer ignore; create these historical spectacles that we can no longer take part in; and, above all, they function as a base for all of us to emerge from these conditions and emerge fully capable of creating the future we desire. This is what biennial are today, and this is what biennials will be all over the world in the future.

The Palestinian Centre for Arts and Humanities was established in 2005 and is an independent, non-profit organisation. It is housed in a former madrassa and was established as a centre for education and free expression in the Palestinian diaspora. It is a hub for the exchange and circulation of ideas and arts knowledge pertaining to the diaspora, and a place to publish, present and engage with the art and creative activities of the Palestinian diaspora through events and programs designed to foster mutual respect, understanding and appreciation. The Palestinian Centre for Arts and Humanities was established in response to the violence and displacement caused by the September 11th, 2001 attacks. The Palestinian Diaspora Arts &amp; Humanities was established in 2007 and is a unique collaborative venture between the Palestinian Centre for Arts &amp; Architecture (P.O.A.), the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the New York–based Museum of Modern Art, Paris. The partnership’s mission is to archive, conserve and promote contemporary art from the Palestinian diaspora through collaborative research, exhibition and project-based initiatives. Its current projects and initiatives incorporate the P.O.A.'s original mission of archiving, conserving and promoting modern art from the Palestinian diaspora in the West Bank and Gaza; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Museum of Modern Art, Paris. The Museum of Modern Art, New York, has been a hub for the Museum of Modern Art's activities in the city since 1971; on the museum’s website, it is described as a museum dedicated to ‘the playful, the playful creative, and the playful architectural work of the past, which is now and forever ajar’.[1] The Museum of Modern Art, New York, is a publicly accessible, 21+ museum, open to the public beginning January 1,</text>

The partnership has been developed with the understanding that it will remain independent of the political will and programmes of the Palestinian Centre for Arts &amp; Architecture. This view is evidenced by the fact that the Palestinian Arts &amp; Humanities was initially not a ‘Kafala’ institution, but a ‘kafala’ institution during the Arab Spring. During the 2011–2012 academic year, the K.A.F.R.A.F.E. program was replaced by a ‘Bakladesh K.A.F.R.A. program’, and the Museum of Modern Art’s BAKLASHAR program. During this time, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, opened a Division on Cultural Affairs &amp; Public Practice, making it a centre for contemporary art and culture.

The Palestinian Diaspora Arts &amp; Humanities was established in 2007 and is a unique collaborative venture between the Palestinian Centre for Arts &amp; Architecture (P.O.A.), the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the New York Public Theater, New York. It was initiated in both English and P.O.A. ‘roots’, an Aramaic root meaning ‘roots’ in Arabic. The partnership’s first artistic director was the P.O.A. artist Nasser Rabbati. In partnership with the New York Public Theater, the P.O.A. performed the former’madrassa’ and subsequent ‘temple’ in the P.O.A. building on West 56th Street in Manhattan, a building designated as a public domain by the New York City Department of Transportation. The P.O.A. was the only artist to be invited to perform in the renamed ‘Temple’. The partnership’s current artistic director is Reem Akram.

The Palestinian Diaspora Arts &amp; Humanities was established in 2007 and is a unique collaborative venture between the Palestinian Centre for Arts &amp; Architecture (P.O.A.), the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Human Rights Watch, New York. It is a hybrid space designed to address both the contemporary art market and the diaspora art market, catering to the interests of artists of both communities. It was founded in both Venice and San Francisco to address the needs of the diaspora, and its mission statement reads as an implicit refutation of the violence and displacement associated with the occupation of Palestine. It calls for both the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside of the established Israeli state and the establishment of a democratic, just and accessible future for both peoples. It is a paradoxical hybrid position that effectively seeks to protect both the interests of the tourist and the diaspora from the violence and repression of the state. It is a strange but perhaps very effective formula. The Artists Placement Fund has placed great emphasis on the need to support artists and their projects in the West Bank and Gaza, and have funded a wide range of projects in both.

The institution’s mission is to provide education and cultural stimulation to the inhabitants of Palestine, including the diaspora community, while promoting the integration of art and culture into the social, economic and political life of the Palestinian diaspora. For this, the Palestinian Diaspora Arts &amp; Humanities has partnered with the Open School of Architecture (founded in New York in 1961) and the Palestinian Centre for Cultural Studies (P.C.S.), Jerusalem. The Palestinian Diaspora Arts &amp; Humanities is a multi-disciplinary team of curators, artists, cultural specialists, historians and architects dedicated to imagining a future for the Palestinian diaspora based on the histories, social and political circumstances of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The team includes Prof. Eyal Weizman, Director of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem;</text>
