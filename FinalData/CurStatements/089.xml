In the nineteenth century, the metropolis was built on the back of the railway, its infrastructure providing access to raw materials and cheap labour to build a variety of transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational industries – transnational in nature – that regularly intermingled with local communities. The biennial is now a complex of its own pre-constituted bureaucracies, media, and symbolic forms of transport. It is a form of cultural exchange that simultaneously seeks to impose its own definition of the city on those who visit it and internalizes the internal logic and intentions of its visitors. New biennials are the result of various combinations of these three interacting elements: the old biennial form found in the form of the major exhibitions, the contemporary biennial form found in the form of the major monographs, and the biennial form found in the form of the periodic table.Art is the contemporary product of a changing urban environment, and art is a complex, multi-faceted and variable commodity. Its value today is primarily determined by its inclusion in a consumer society; if art is to retain its intrinsic value in the face of ever-expanding digital collections and social media consumption, it will need to be widely accessible and accessible at</text>

Nevertheless, the biennial has its own unique set of relations with the city that can be understood as constituting a partial update of its nineteenth-century form. The biennial is an episodic event that happens to be occurring at a time when the city is undergoing a radical transformation. In the nineteenth century, the metropolis was built on the back of the railway, its infrastructure providing access to raw materials and cheap labour to build a variety of transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational industries – transnational in nature – that regularly reshape and fabricate new forms of urban life. Today, the railways no longer provide the means of access in the vast majority of cities, but rather, in most cities, the means of production, communication, and transit continue to be built on the back of ever larger financial infrastructures that primarily support the global circulation of commodities (i.e., oil and cash). Consequently, the biennial has emerged as a position that calls into question the very nature of contemporary urbanisation and its relations to the site and time. In recent biennials, this has meant that the art of the episodic has become a necessary precondition for the capacity to engage with the episodic. In the case of Venice, for example, the biennale was initially conceived as an event that could be repeated several times, with different artists taking different sides of the episodic and showing different facets of the city. As a cultural-political-ecological artifact, the biennale has a</text>

In the nineteenth century, the metropolis was built on the back of the railway, its infrastructure providing access to raw materials and cheap labour to build a variety of transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational industries – transnational in nature – that regularly reshape urban environments and are increasingly the basis of a range of international financial flows. Today, the metropolis is widely considered to be in a transition to a ‘knowledge society’, i.e. one that engages with the potentialities of science and technology through innovative techniques that render the city intelligible to globalised financial services and logistics infrastructures. There is much speculation about what this technological transformation may mean in terms of urban infrastructures and the social forms they may foster. It is common to read of ‘brainstorms’ as the modern-day equivalent of ‘brain fusions’ – technologies, or new ways of organising knowledge generated through experiments, that find expression in new ways through what are often called ‘deep learning’ or neural networks. It is also common to read of deep learning as a synchronic process that occurs across all cultures and across all epochs, influencing everything from language to art to architecture to human behaviour.</text>

In the nineteenth century, the metropolis was built on the back of the railway, its infrastructure providing access to raw materials and cheap labour to build a variety of transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational industries – transnational in nature – that regularly reshaped the global landscape, from port cities to urban centres to financial centres. The biennial is a cultural form that appeals to the vanity of urban planning and the vanity of capitalism. It is a form that effortlessly modifies everyday life in postindustrial urban centres, where the everyday is no longer defined by the work performed in them as manufacturing, office buildings, roads and bridges, as in the nineteenth century. The biennial is a form of cultural tourism organised by the city to extol the virtues of a given culture, often in a self-congratulatory way. The biennial has become so critical of late that it has even begun to write its own history, this time writing from the point of view of the city as a fundamentally different form of being, one in which individual and collective identities are actively contested. The biennial is a form that can no longer be accepted as the rightful place of global cities. The city is globalising at an ever greater rate, and is no longer</text>

Today, the city is a collection of disconnected fragments that, assembled by an increasingly urbanised and migrant population, is increasingly vulnerable to the ravages of globalised capitalism. The biennale is the only true representative of what has been called ‘the postindustrial society’. It functions as a register, a map, a symbol of the city’s growing complexity and an essential part of the capitalist metropolis. The biennial needs to clarify its relations to the city in order to become a site of possible futures. It is a site of exchange and potential for the emergent, but it is also a site of destruction. That is, of course, if the city doesn’t become a museum of the ruined metropolis.

In the nineteenth century, the metropolis was built on the back of the railway, its infrastructure providing access to raw materials and cheap labour to build a variety of transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational industries – transnational in nature – that regularly reshape and profit from urban transformations around the globe. Today, the infrastructure of the metropolis is a collection of sensors, data, towers and data, which together with organisational rules, create a description of the city as raw material for the production of wealth. The biennial form thus becomes intimately related to the production of wealth, and the increasingly global positioning of capital, while at the same time displaying the city’s fragility and vulnerability as a result of its occupancy. My plan B in The Art of Not Being Governed is a project in which the biennial format is blended with other artistic forms (including performance forms), and in which the contemporary composition meets the historical medium (including multimedia art forms). The key is an understanding of the biennial as a relational art form that is not reducible to an artist’s singularity or singularity alone, but also to the production of wealth as a whole. The key is understood by those calling the shots, and in that</text>

Today, the city is built on the back of the biennale, which is a kind of globalized version of the tobacco trade. The biennale is a multi-billion dollar business that requires an ever-larger infrastructure to sustain itself, and the biennale thus becomes, in the development of otherwise passive consumption objects, a kind of horizontally displaced capital. The biennale has a particular interest in the city in the early twentieth century because its capital was needed: a globalized metropolis is needed to sustain the industry. A city represents a set of boundless possibilities, and the biennale is therefore a global extension of the city as an object of consumption. The biennale therefore becomes vitally important in the development of a city, and in that it may be able to capture the city’s potential.

In the nineteenth century, the metropolis was built on the back of the railway, its infrastructure providing access to raw materials and cheap labour to build a variety of transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational industries – transnational in nature – that regularly reshaped the world. Today, the metropolis is often argued to be an afterthought in the formation of the global economy, and globally competitive only at the margins. Yet the biennial has become one of the most powerful forms of global exhibition, regularly taking the place of major exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale and the London and Sydney Museums that typically showcase local artists. The biennale has come to occupy an episodic position in the exhibitionary complex. It is incident to the historical account of how art is generally produced and presented in the world today. The biennale is an episodic event that occurs periodically, occurring most of the time between major exhibitions. It is a rare event in its own right, and rarer still when it is staged in response to a major exhibition.1. The Biennale, 1893, New York, USA. Unravelled, 2017.

In the nineteenth century, the metropolis was built on the back of the railway, its infrastructure providing access to raw materials and cheap labour to build a variety of transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational industries – transnational in nature – that regularly reshape urban environments in ways that can be traced to the rise and spread of global capitalism. Today, the metropolis is largely built on the back of the Chinese diaspora (along with a steady stream of tourists) who are largely drawn by the economic opportunity offered by the cheap flights and cheap accommodation found in the city. The biennale, on the other hand, is a ‘transnational, multidisciplinary, and multi-lingual event’ that engages with aspects of the city that are as yet largely unspoken of or under-explored. This in itself can be considered a ‘tourism’ activity, and part of the ‘transnational’ category that includes ‘tourist attractions, cultural associations, ‘natural history’ and ‘histories of history’.1.

In the nineteenth century, the metropolis was built on the back of the railway, its infrastructure providing access to raw materials and cheap labour to build a variety of transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational transnational industries – transnational in nature – that regularly reshape global modes of production and circulation. These seemingly benign inputs – materials, labour, ideas – create a landscape that is conducive to the making of ever more technologically sophisticated but also increasingly precarious creatures. The biennale, then, is a production for the infrastructure of global capitalism, taking place at a time of increasing surveillance and control, in which the art of becoming is emphasised. The biennial needs to be responsive to the changing needs of the metropolis, and its emergence as a site of conflict is frequently used as a way to suggest the absence of meaning and of future potential. But in this production, the production of biennials is also a function of a capitalist logic of immense scale that constantly reshapes the planet according to the needs of capitalist accumulation. The biennial could become an object of critique, but it is more important to recognize its own logic and to question how these various elements are meshed to produce ever more technologically complex creatures.

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] mere institutionalised support for a newspaper enterprise is insufficient to sustain a community-based press complex, especially if that enterprise happens to be promoting a ‘fascist ideology’. The newstand arrangement was a short-lived one, quickly snapped up by other newspapers eager to take up space on the newly acquired pages. The advent of the internet also intervened, shifting the balance of competing ideas and ideas. Newspapers had always enjoyed a significant readership, but the internet made it easier to digest articles than ever before, making them accessible everywhere. The proliferation of online sources of information, combined with the sheer number of articles published daily made it much more difficult to ignore. As a result, some may argue that the New York Times is more ‘representative of the nation’s modernity and urbanity’ than any other newspaper, even though the Times itself once proclaimed that it was reporting ‘the truth as objectively as truth as a bull, inveighing against falsehood</text>

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15]  the introduction of new technologies in the media industry at an early stage often outcompetes the decisions that need to be taken at a later stage, because the decisions at later stages often have a decisive effect on the competitive landscape. Goffey traces the technological breakthroughs that emerge during this transition from the proto-computer to the internet, and the consequent changes in the way in which images are reproduced, distributed, and communicated. These images are produced on enormous data-storage devices, and distributed across huge networks of ports. Each image has a unique ID that identifies it, alongside other metadata.  The new medium of photography emerges during this transition, and is the direct descendant of the proto-circulation of images during the Neolithic period, around 8000 BC – 4000 BC. It is an evolving form of writing that records, alongside photos and video, the movements of peoples and objects across the planet.  The emergence of photography and video marks a shift from images of vegetation and rocks</text>

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] the real reason for the success of such schemes was precisely the emergence of competing visions of the city – competing visions of urban life – which in turn provided the justification for greater government intervention.  The emergence of competing visions of the city was facilitated by the emergence of what Michael Slackman has called ‘the Great Public Relations Campaign’[16] (later renamed the ‘Urban Information System’ or UIS), a system of public relations agencies – PR agencies – which functioned as if the city were an actor in its own ‘public image’. So much of what we think of as the urban commons was created through the power of image, whether portraying the urban commons as a fully realized stage on which a performing arts collective could deliver a performance, or how the commons is perceived by the public sphere through images. The emergence of the PR campaign coincided with the emergence of what Michael Slackman has called ‘a new media ecology: massive screen</text>

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] the construction of public spaces and the emergence of new media transformed the newspaper itself – and the city’s image. Goffey traces this transition from the pulpits of the pulpits of the Pioneers and Great American Smokescapes to the billboards of the automobile and the magazine spread – which proliferated across the US in tandem with the development of interstate highways – in his term &quot;The Great Transformation&quot;. As the image macro shows, the horse-drawn car arrived first, then the magazine, and then the novel. As the image indicates, the novel itself was a response to the influence of the automobile. But the city also experienced a transformation. Its streetscape was retouched to cater to the car, and nearby streetscapes were given a facelift to mirror the new car culture. The result was a complete transformation of the city into an automobile-obsessed tourist destination. The city entered a new urban configuration with dedicated car-free zones</text>

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] a more potent media campaign can emerge from the city’s image crisis through the kind of cheap publicity afforded by cheap property. A campaign strategy that actively seeks out images of blighted urban landscapes, but also actively distorts and obfuscates such images in order to project blight on an ever-widening range of people but particularly on migrant workers, homeless people, the urban poor and urban dwellers in general is a campaign tactic that is almost always unsuccessful. The most blighted neighbourhoods in New York City never feel that way. Image courtesy of Andrew Goffey.  The advent of photography in the early twentieth century allowed urban photographers like Goffey to peer around every nook and cranny of the city, capturing images that became legendary in the field. Goffey’s images are legendary; he was a leading photographer of the First World War and remains so to this day.

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] the contrast is vital in structuring a city’s media market, since a stable of established players can only benefit from the imbalance. Goffey suggests that the early capitalism of the United States relied on a ratio of access to information about the political institutions of the city as well as access to cheap labour: ‘a form of political labour that is no longer available to the biennial’.[16]  And as the biennial has shown, this reliance on the spectator is no longer enough to propel it forward. The biennial has to actively engage with the city in a way that counters the tendency towards neoliberalism and towards the kind of urban sprawl characteristic of postindustrialised countries. It has to engage with the fact that, in the age of the biennial, the biennial is no longer a visitor and not a permanent resident. It has to engage with the fact that, as biennials, we are entering a digitised age</text>

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] the New Journalism standard bearer was William Randolph Hearst, publisher of The New York Times. Hearst offered a tempting new angle on the city’s problems: a chance to reinvent the ‘wild west’ in the image of New York’s suburban landscapes. He offered a monthly supplement to the newspaper, peddling a ‘futurist tract’ on the back of a new, urban-sounding ‘titled ‘The West Point of the West’.  He offered a monthly ‘trekkers’ tour of the West Point, ‘a.k.a. the West Point of the West’, to coincide with the opening of the new hotels, schools and office parks. He even offered a ‘cheap pass’ to nearby hotels, airlines and public buildings that housed the ‘most valuable real and valuable real estate in the city’.[16]  If the ‘West</text>

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] the aim of such legacies is to promote a particular set of social relations between people – a tendency that is bound to generate conflict and antagonisms. The Graphic’s support for the City Council came at a crucial time as the city struggled to find new ways to support itself. The acquisition of First National Bank – which came with generous tax abatements – and the subsequent building of public housing came as a huge surprise to many New Yorkers, who had expected the opposite. As a result of the bank’s rapid expansion, the confines of the ‘hipster haven’ were made clear; now a den of ­hipsters stretched across the street from the bank. The city also acquired a string of vacant buildings across the river, including the now-demolished Biscuit Factory, which manufactured ­Biscuit components, rope, pulleys and bolts.

But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] the aim of such protections was ultimately political: the interests of the rich were often quite opposed to the interests of the working class. Once developers had secured eminent domain, the city’s poor were often left behind in the political process. The Daily Graphic was an outpost of the city’s liberal arts community, and its owners probably valued its position highly. After winning the controlling stake in the American Gilded Age, the Daily Graphic became a champion of progressive causes, standing up to corporate America and championing the interests of the underclass. Its support for women’ suffrage and gay and lesbian rights is well documented, and its support for the Black arts community is likewise impressive. It was a newspaper that spoke from the pulpits of poor and working people, in stark contrast to the silences that dominated the press.  The Daily Graphic was a champion of progressive causes in the working class community, and its support for women’ suffrage is well documented. Its support</text>

The newstand deal protected the city’s nascent photographic industry from competition from the nearby Pennsylvania Mint, and the Graphic also secured a publishing deal with the City Council.  The newstand arrangement also granted the City Council considerable editorial discretion over the newspaper’s content. As a way to insulate the city’s image, the contract stipulated that the council should avoid ‘imitating the natural features, stratagems and arts of the country’.[14]  One might argue that the newstand arrangement gave the council a leg up in the competition for commercial real estate, since it shielded the council from the unpredictable effects of market forces. But as Andrew Goffey has shown,[15] the City Council had a hand in the newspaper company’s expansion, since it provided the newspaper with editorial assistance in building public support for the newspaper. The council also had a hand in the newspaper’s decision-making, since it provided editorial assistance during the newspaper’s first several years. As Goffey shows, however, the adhesion of ideas and interests was the real arbiter of what was desirable and what was not, and this was to a large extent an outcome of the interests of the wealthy and well-connected. The adhesion of ideas was a big part of the newspaper’s success, since it determined how the newspaper was distributed, distributed and used. While the adhesion of ideas to places and people was an important part of the newspaper’s publishing business, the adhesion of ideas to newspaper production itself was a critical other. The importance of this last point of production cannot be understated. As early as the mid-nin</text>

It was a real artistic homecoming, so to speak. The biennials that we did have in other cities – New York and Liverpool – were very much about the place of art in a city, and the importance of that art in that city, rather than the city itself. The fact that Liverpool is such a short trip – only eight hours by plane – and the fact that it is such a short distance from the North Sea coast to the coast of Scotland meant that the artists could spend a good amount of time in the city, rather than spending so much time in their studio somewhere further afield. I think that is important when you are thinking about regeneration. You need to pay attention to such things.

What if we collectively decided to destructure our lives and become producers rather than consumers of housing? 	Such is the agenda of the community land trusts now emerging across the UK and beyond. But what do they actually do? Most of us would agree that a large proportion of housing is now socially constructed and unsustainable – and there is a way to address that in the form of a guaranteed income – but how do we actually achieve that? Many people would advocate a city-wide moratorium on new developments until at least 2026, but that sounds like a long time until then. Many people would also advocate a city-wide green space and wilderness creation fund – but that sounds like a long time after-endangered species-only zone. 	The reality is that these initiatives have to be supported in order to achieve wider sustainability goals. So how do we fund them and put them into effect? The answer is cities – and large urban districts – with substantial, well-funded cultural and educational portfolios, including museums and galleries, large scale artist-run organisations, including but not limited to: Academy of Art, Baklava Art Foundation, Baklava Art Trust, Bluecoat Art Trust, Blue</text>

But what do they actually do? Most of us would agree that a community land trust is an inherently unstable relationship, and with the ever-increasing privatisation of public resources (including housing) it is increasingly evident that any political will to maintain or improve public infrastructure is being increasingly eroded. 	So what does a community land trust do? A community land trust is a legally binding public partnership between the local government and a designated number of socially and economically engaged stakeholders (community organisations, grassroots organisations, community organisers, artists’ organisations etc). It provides long-term, shared management and control over a specified area. In most jurisdictions, this would include preserving natural resources such as landscapes, forests and open space, but also the powers to levy taxes, create boards of directors, and adopt rules and regulations governing use of land and resources. A community land trust can create its own Board of Directors, which can include representatives from the local government, local grassroots or other stakeholders, and artists’ organisations. The Boards of Directors may also empower and employ local youth</text>

What if we collectively decided to stop living in the bubble and started living differently? What if we collectively decided to create different forms of urban environments? What if we collectively decided to destructure our lives and become producers rather than consumers of housing? 	Such is the agenda of the community land trusts now emerging across the UK and beyond. But what do they actually do? Most of us would probably agree that the role of the arts is large and that the key to creating innovative practices lies in the collective. But what happens next depends on many factors, including the individual(s) and their expertise, the institutional arrangements (including the role of local authorities), the artist’s perspective, and even the political will of the government. 	One thing is certain: engaging with the arts is no longer seen as a right. Arts funding has declined precipitously; arts organisations are increasingly political; and in some cases, the arts are actively opposed to their traditional roles. Is there still a place for the arts in education, for example, but funding for arts education is now critically dependent on political and social factors. Even if funding did exist, it would only make up for a small percentage of the teaching load. In most subjects, the majority of teachers would find it difficult to deliver engaging learning environments. And this is where collective action can and should be taken. But how? Often</text>

What if we collectively decided to stop living in the bubble and started living differently? What if we collectively decided to create different forms of urban environments? What if we collectively decided to destructure our lives and become producers rather than consumers of housing? 	Such is the agenda of the community land trusts now emerging across the UK and beyond. But what do they actually do? Most of us would probably agree that a strong focus on housing and supportive services for communities is a good first step, but what do community land trusts actually do? Very often, they’re used as a way to generate additional affordable housing for low-income communities – a strategy that starts small but builds into a position of power. A position of power allows the developer to negotiate low-income housing through a negotiated set of housing provisions, and then uses the leverage to pressure poorer areas to adopt more efficient development strategies. In the case of a community land trust, this could mean developing alternatives to demolition, such as reclaiming derelict buildings and creating hybrid green spaces. In the case of a new business start-up, it could mean creating coworking spaces and introducing paid sick leave. In the case of a community land trust, it could mean funding for arts education or childcare or simply providing a stable business for the area. All of these actions have a cost – usually quite a bit – but are necessary to achieve</text>

What if we collectively decided to destructure our lives and become producers rather than consumers of housing? 	Such is the agenda of the community land trusts now emerging across the UK and beyond. But what do they actually do? Most of us would probably agree that a strong central government is needed to really put things into motion, to lay the foundations for a truly transformative set of changes. But given the current political climate, it’s clear that the only way such changes will happen is if a large number of people sign on as stakeholders. So who actually stands to gain from such a plan? Who actually benefits from such plans? Who ultimately owns the changed urban environment? Most likely, the people with a stake in it will end up owning a percentage of the new developments. But this isn’t necessarily true. Most likely, these stake holders will end up owning small minority interests in the new developments, which will still control most of the levers. This is what happened in the housing market in the 1980s and 1990s, as a case study: while the stake holders owned a significant percentage of the land and buildings, their financial condition made it nearly impossible for many people to buy houses and flats, which in turn hurt the wider</text>

What if we collectively decided to destructure our lives and become producers rather than consumers of housing? 	Such is the agenda of the community land trusts now emerging across the UK and beyond. But what do they actually do? Most of us would probably agree that what is needed is a strategic and visionary focus on the needs and interests of communities in order to ever become aware of these. But what is required is a collective imagination and a persistent commitment to imagining things differently. In order to achieve this, critical thinking is required within all stakeholders, but especially within those yet to become stakeholders. Whether this means creatively creating mutually beneficial co-producing arrangements with other stakeholders, investing in culture through arts-funded enterprises or creating innovative ways to support socially engaged art-making, cultural organising and cultural-making, there is a role for creative thinking in this process. 	Sometimes the task of imagining new ways of organising things simply isn’t there anymore. It’s time for creative people to step into those gaps and come out of the woodwork. Creative action usually emerges from unexpected quarters and unexpected origins, but it usually needs to be initiated and supported by those who have a stake in the outcome. Creative action requires resources and are more likely</text>

What if we collectively decided to destructure our lives and become producers rather than consumers of housing? 	Such is the agenda of the community land trusts now emerging across the UK and beyond. But what do they actually do? Most of us would probably agree that there is a contradiction between what the city is trying to do and what our community land trusts are doing. But what is it that the community wants and needs? What is it that the city is producing? If our city is to deliver decent, affordable housing to its residents, we all need to work together to produce what the city produces. If our city is to attract and retain businesses and other organisations that support talented workers and communities, we all need to ensure that our neighbourhoods are attractive places to work and to play.  	At the same time, what is being produced elsewhere in the city is not being sustained by the city. Businesses that once employed thousands of people are now employing infrequent or low-wage workers; neighbourhoods are becoming gentrified; and boarded-up housing is a problem. What is being produced in the neighbourhood is being displaced to outside markets. And some of the projects that are being developed are quite antiquated and may not be relevant in the age</text>

But what do they actually do? Most of us would probably agree that what is needed is a long-term vision, a clear definition of what works and what doesn’t work within the local community. What is needed is a long-term perspective, too. In my view, the way we produce housing in Liverpool’s outer boroughs is by building high-quality of housing for a locally relevant population, and by supporting local businesses and organisations that produce and support socially engaged or ‘relevant localities’. This is not some radical tinkering around the edges. These are core business models and organisational principles for what I would call ‘a city within a city’. These have been around for a long time and are simply the way to go about it. 	However, even if we agree that it is a mistake to try to create a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship through the building and funding of representative bodies, it would still be useful to be able to say what we think are the priorities of the city</text>

But what do they actually do? Most of us would probably agree that a community land trust is a last resort, a last resort reserved for those people or organisations with a clear sense of destiny, a purpose, and a strategy. But what is the sense of destiny for such a community? What is the sense of the city when its inhabitants no longer feel that they belong to it? What is the sense of the arts when its practitioners no longer feel the need to aspire to higher standards? What are the arts supposed to mean to such communities? 	Well, the arts community is supposed to mean a mix of things to a broad range of people. But what is the sense of the arts when its members no longer identify with what is traditionally considered the rightful heir to the art-making potential arising out of the back of the contemporary economy? When its practitioners no longer identify with their place in the city? 	The arts community is supposed to be a land of shared resources and ideals.

But what do they actually do? Most of us would agree that what is most needed is a willingness to be involved in creating a better future for the area. But what is most encouraging is the emergence of collaborative legal and community action frameworks that actually empower communities to achieve that future. Such models are sprouting up all over the place, depending on who is talking about them and where they are headed. 	One example of this is the Together Towns Action Group (CTAG) formed in 2009 by local and national communities to reverse declining population growth in the Welsh Streets and create new community plans for the area. It is run by a Board of Directors consisting of local people with expertise in all aspects of urban and local government, architects, community organisers and others with a particular focus on arts and culture. It has developed into an organisation with a full-time jobs and training programme for young people and artists, as well as producing a range of educational and research projects. Its mission statement is: ‘To envision a better future for the Welsh Streets’</text>

If we don’t like what we see, we can change our minds and go back to the way we were. But that will change everything. If we do that, then we’re stuck with what we see. And if we don’t want to change it, we can never change it. We need to be able to change our minds, and get on with the business of art and culture that we have created.And we need to be able to experiment. We have the tools, the innovation, the drive, the imagination and the will to tackle any challenge. But what we lack is the ambition.

So there’s a new Bulletin out there with stories from the 2011 Biennial, a story about an event in the history of art in the UK, and so on. So that’s a story that’s set in the present.There’s another kind of narrative that the Liverpool Biennial can tell, and that’s the kind that gets told through the art exhibits that are part of the Liverpool Biennial: the kind that are made by artists and come out of their commissioning and curatorial minds. It’s the kind that has narrative form and so it’s possible to bring the multiple forms of narrative together. There’s a project that’s doing a kind of micro-presentation of the narrative of</text>

It’s going to be a last word on the subject of art and it’s going to be a — ­— moment, in a way. And this is what I’m getting at: I’m not saying this as a proposition, not even a proposal. I’m just saying things that have been happening to a certain extent, and is part of a trend.

A big part of what the Liverpool Biennial is going to be is going to be a journal of events. It’s going to be a place to find out about the past, the present and future of art, society and culture in a major European city.Issue #3 features a conversation with Margaret Atwood, who wrote the Civilization and Other essays that appeared in the first two issues of the Bulletin. The conversation is part of the 2011 Documenta 13: Art and Artifacts, Volume 2: Essays, Margaret Atwood #3: 'Beyond Water and Fire'  and part of this issue of the Biennial, with Margaret Atwood, Naomi Klein and others. From the Bulletin: Margaret Atwood: In your 2005 book Things Fall Apart</text>

They’ll be collecting tips, tricks and tricks for what to expect on the day of the event. It’s going to be like a ‘Best Of’ series. The 12th and 13th issues will be published simultaneously. It’s going to be a massive amount of text, so the 140 characters or so of text that make up the biennial each year are going to be a collective, collective, collective deal. We will be able to exchange information, share experiences and draw on different knowledge and expertise. We will be able to recognise patterns. We will be able to recognise clusters of interest.

    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is set to open with a public programme of installations and public programs, as well as an exhibition and a variety of public programs curated by the publisher. The programme for the biennial itself was previously developed by and for the Liverpool Biennial, as part of the 'Promised Land' initiative. The programme for the main exhibition, including the main exhibition itself, was developed and directed by the Biennial with the support of the Mayor of Liverpool and the Biennial Trust. The exhibition was originally commissioned by and delivered as a part of the Promised Land initiative. It was conceived as a public experience with a public mission. The public was invited to be part of the narrative. It was to be a part of a narrative that was told through works of art and culture made in the city centre.

The narrative we created would be told through immersive video, augmented and virtual reality (AR) and text that would allow the narratives of artists and cultural organisations to come to life. It would also allow the public to participate in the creation of the narrative through written and oral expressions. ALfheimrad Artspace, ALF London, was one of the places where the interactive narrative was created. We invited artists from the interactive narrative to create works for the museum or the museum archive, or both. ALF London was a natural home for the AR and VR narratives because the artists had worked there before. ALF Hamburg, the virtual museum, was another place where the AR and VR narratives could be enacted because the artists had worked there before. ALF got its start as an art school for young artists and artists, and it has been developing through its various branches into a modern art institution with an AR and VR programme that engages artists from all over the world. ALF Berlin is the last surviving AR and VR school in the city, and it continues to offer free and low</text>

It would be a work that is both history-making and a prescient reflection of the future city. The iteration of this project over the years has been a way to come to terms with the fact that the narrative we tell ourselves can shape reality. It can also serve as a vehicle to explore possibilities beyond the city.

The narrative we created would be told through immersive video, augmented and virtual reality (AR) and data (booth seating and data recording), as well as literature, radio and film. It would be written by city and region, citizen journalists, grassroots groups and other interested parties. We invited ideas from a range of disciplines, including architecture and urbanism, culture and development, media studies, architecture and infrastructure, indigenous studies and media ecology. In the end, the project was a crowdsourced, iterative process that sought to tell a story through various modes of narrative formation and re-construction.  	Arrival City (based in Renton, Washington) is a cultural centre and port city, with a strong maritime and First Nations presence, with a financial centre for intellectual property and a port for transshipment of products from the port.

We invited artists from across the city to collaborate with us on a narrative that would encompass the history of the city and its people. The narrative we created would be told through immersive video, augmented and virtual reality (AR) and text narratives that would be woven into biennials of all kinds. We invited artists to create immersive environments in which to tell their stories, and to invite the public into that narrative. The narratives we created could be told simultaneously as VR and AR, or they could be told through texts that were both figurative and allegorical. We chose to tell the VR narrative through artist-made AR and text narratives. This allowed us to create worlds that were both real and fictional, allowing the public to step into them and take part in a fictional world. We also used 3D modelling and printing to create worlds that were both sky and earth, the future and the past. These were then used to tell another fictional story – that of the inhabitants of a mythical planet – that we would establish between images of the real world and those of the fictional planet. These images then created a kind of imaginary link between the real world and the fictional planet, linking the real and the imaginary worlds.</text>

The immersive video could be made in the city centre by the Biennial itself or by artists selected by the curator team. The selected artists would develop a VR and AR narrative through their work in the city, using data and innovative mapping techniques to bring the spatialised and the virtual to life in a way that would be both captivating and provocative. The selected artists were asked to propose works that would be part of a new narrative that would be told through works of art and culture made in the city. Their works would be developed in PR and Mapping, two new division of the Global Urban Map (GUM) project, an international collaborative research institute. The new narrative would be told through the curatorial support of three biennials in different cities around the world: Venice, Mumbai and New York. The curatorial support for this new narrative would come from three sources: the Biennial, the Fondation Royale de l'Art Moderne</text>

The narrative we created would be told through immersive video, augmented and virtual reality (AR) and data (PR) software that would let visitors inhabit places and move through time. The narrative would be made up of shared narratives, given voices, images and objects, while also featuring distinctive individual contributions from individuals. In our version, the VR and PR software would augment the visual arts with narratives, while the data and AR suite would tell the full story. We wanted the whole narrative to be told through the works we selected as prototype sites. The VR and PR suites would augment the visual arts with narrative software, while the data and AR suite would tell the parts they were tasked with. We called these narratives the Participatory Arts Contemporaneity Project (PACT) languages.

The narrative we created would be told through immersive video, augmented and virtual reality (AR) and data (broadly applicable to the urban environment) and would render the city as a living, breathing work of art. The title of the project was a catalyst for people to come out of their homes and work in the city. It signaled to people that this was a story they could engage with. This story was crafted using many different storytelling means and in many different mediums. The interactive media became an essential part of the project. It was an indispensable part of the project because it allowed people to come to the site, walk through the streets and find out about the project, and come to understand what the city was like before the biennial. It invited them to be part of the story because it allowed them to become part of the story. This interactive narrative was created through many different mediums and is now an essential part of the city. In fact, the interactive narrative is the whole city.

The invited artists formed a multipurpose team led by a curator and involved with the project from the exhibition business. The researchers, practitioners and artists subsequently convened regularly over the next five years as a director, a co-researcher, a co-explorer and a final visitor. The team was comprised of: Anish Kapur (architect, Liverpool Biennial) as project lead, Denise Lewis (architect, National Museums Liverpool) as project scientist and Cherie Boyd (architect, Liverpool Biennial) as project manager. The team visited the city every other week for a series of projects that reported back to the Biennial on their findings and to the wider community via social media. They also engaged in research on the Biennial and the city.The research and reporting process started in earnest with the Liverpool Biennial 2016, when we invited architects and creative professionals from across the city to participate in a research project.

The narrative we created would be told through immersive video, augmented and virtual reality (AR) and other new media. We invited artists to create works that would allow the user to enter into a parallel world, or dimension, with real people. This was done in a number of ways. The first was through the use of key fob and bag-like devices, which connected to the computer and allowed the user to enter into a different world. This was done through clever use of lasers and other related tech. There were also other ways in which the narratives could be told, such as through charts, graphs, news clippings or poetry. The important thing was that the narratives were real and lived and breathed by people. We used the term ‘reality check’ to mean something different in different ways. We did this by creating a series of events that would foster a sense of community and bring together people who might not agree on many issues but would all agree that they needed to work together to try to make things work. For example, we would create a series</text>

The interactive virtual reality (VR) and AR pieces would be made specifically for the Biennial by using technologies that harness virtual and augmented reality to offer enhanced storytelling experiences. The VR and AR pieces would be made in collaboration with the local communities and would foster direct communication with the places where the works are located. We invited artists to explore how they might engage with and make work for the biennial that is informed by and addresses the places where the stories they tell are constructed and fabricated. The narrative they tell is constructed in many ways and engages with ideas of the city and of the citizenry. It should be able to engage with and build upon the narrative of the city, while also addressing other narratives and concerns of the community.Text narratives are especially well suited to biennial narratives because they</text>

And so it came as a surprise to many in the 1970s and 1980s when, as a result of cultural-practical-thinking curators such as Tony Parsons, the art-world was invited to a conference called The Art Manifesto, which coincided with the Venice Biennale in 1981. Tony and his fellow artists, Jean-Luc Nancy and Marianne Moore, formed the core curatorial team for the conference. All three artists were present in New York at the time – Nancy as a curatorial artist, Jean Guy as an artistic director, and Royce W. Smith as an artist who arranged the works. Tony was accompanied by his wife, Rosalind, who was an art administrator at the New York Art Museum. Both Rosalind and Royce were present in Venice as part of the curatorial team for the Biennale, which was organised by the Fondation di Venetiana from 19–22 November 1982.

And so it came as a surprise to many when, around the time that I began work on The Contemporary Condition in 1980, the Museum of Modern Art in New York started a ‘30 Years of Art’ campaign on its walls, in response to this ‘contemporary art’ narrative emerging at the time. The campaign reflected the inroads that this ‘contemporary’ art movement had made into the museum collections, and the museum curatorial handbook, as well as the pressures it felt under increasing public funding. It was a series of increasingly pointed curatorial interventions that, rather than attempting to impose a narrative or a position on the art, made art visible in a way that it could sustain itself. Titles such as ‘Modern Painting’ and ‘Painting in the Context of Cultural Studies’ provided the curatorial team with a specific vocabulary and set of concepts that could be flexibly applied to various art forms and social situations.

The aim of the whole enterprise was to make the machine visible, to make it possible to ‘see’ it, to ‘talk’ to it, to ‘listen’ to it. And so it was that the machine became a cultural touchstone, a point of convergence for artists, art collectors and the media that together form the basis of the so-called contemporary art museums.The question of what makes a contemporary art museum emerged as a central theme in the 1960s and 1970s. It was at a time when the contemporary art of the post-Impressionist period was being written off by curators who were, in turn, responding to a public-art generation that had begun to take root in the art world. And so it came as a surprise to many when, around the same time, a generation of artists emerged in the US and UK who were deeply critical of Impressionism, even though they shared many of the same political beliefs as Impressionists. They were artists such as Wittgenstein, Scarlatti, Kandinsky, Debord, Surrealists such as Jean Lévi-Strauss, Paul McCarthy and Benoît Carré, and Ingmar Bergman. These were but a few among a diverse group of artists who were active in the 1960s and 1970s, and their works are as timeless as they are distinctive. But there was a generational divide that had to be bridged in order to allow in a meaningful number of artists to move into the contemporary art canon. And so it was that in the 1980s and 1990s the art space was awash with interventions that attempted to make the current curatorial push as modern as possible – intervention by an arts organisation, a major museum</text>

And so it came as a surprise to many when, some years later, the Museum of Modern Art in New York started holding a series of events, including a biennial, in 1974, to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Museum of Modern Art. And so the museum was born, an artifact of the past, a repository of the museum, and a present. And today the museum remains a vitally important artifact in the city, a place of cultural exchange and home to the rich and powerful.But the museum as an institution has undergone a tremendous shift in its structure, functioning both as a permanent home for art and as a site of political, social and economic oppression. Its curatorial agenda has shifted from the preservation of cultural resources to the external expression of power, often through the direct manipulation of the public. Its mission statement now reads, tentatively: ‘Recreation is a vital component of any cultural district.’ This is followed by a plea to ‘engage youth’ and a call to �</text>

It was at a time when the contemporary art of the post-Impressionist period was being written off by curators who were, in turn, responding to a public-art generation that had begun to take root in the art world. And so it came as a surprise to many in the late 1970s and early 1980s when, as a new curatorial approach to art-historical data, curatorial curators began to experiment with what they called ‘temporal curating’. In a word, they did not know what ‘temporal curating’ meant. They had no concept of time. And so they performed a very risky experiment in curating – they promoted a very particular understanding of time to a very specific audience. And their experiment was wildly successful. But it has not been successful in creating the kind of infrastructure or the kind of cultural capital to sustain the kind of work that was produced, promoted or imagined to be possible through the arts. In fact, the biggest casualty of this experiment has been the art museum. I mean, the art museum is still important in its own right, as a building and as a collection of collections, but the cultural curators who created this experimental curatorial approach to art did not give any thought to</text>

And so it came as a surprise to many contemporary artists and curators when the Museum of Modern Art (MMA) in New York launched a ‘Centennial’ programme in 1974. The idea was that the show would grow in number of exhibitions and number of publications, tapering off to a minimalist ‘tour’ in 1982. The ‘Centennial’ was a point of convergence, a point of departure from which curators could begin to tap into the cultural resources of their local area, and a place to begin to network with other artists and curators from around the world. And so the museum became the site of the next event, the next convergence, the next migration of curators, and the next convergence of art-histories. And so on.Over the decades that followed, the museum closed several times, moved locations, and published biennials and books that catalogued the life of contemporary art. But it kept telling the story, relaying it through archival materials and archival research</text>

And so it came as a surprise to many in the 1970s when, some years later, the Museum of Modern Art in New York decided to catalogue a number of works by Andy Warhol – a move that came as a complete surprise to the Museum of Modern Art in Boston, which had been anticipating its own publication for some time. The Museum of Modern Art had curatorial records, but also a publishing operation that supported the exhibition of Warhol’s work for the museum, which at the time was dominated by biennials and presentist museums. The curatorial record shows that the Warhol archive was a frequent target of biennials and their readers – particularly those from London, who saw the curatorial record as evidence of decadence. But Warhol was a rare commodity in those years, and the rare commodity that year was Vincent van Gogh.The story of how the Museum of Modern Art came to be, and the reasons why it failed, is one that is told in many places – first in the book I Have</text>

And so it came as a surprise to many when, during the 1980s and 1990s, a curator in New York City, Peter Schjeldahl, opened Upstairs, his first show in 1987, to rapturous reviews. The reason was that, as the title implied, Schjeldahl was curating a new structure, an inverted pyramid – inverted, because it housed objects – inverted because they were no longer part of a museum collection. Nevertheless, the exhibition was a total reconfiguration of the items on show before, during and after the event. It was a way to make contemporary art relevant again to the times in which it takes place.Upstairs, Schjeldahl placed his curatorial lens under the pyramid and found himself faced with a ‘world’, a ‘different world’. And although Schjeldahl did not come up with the idea, many contemporary curators and art historians have taken up the idea and applied it to a globalised art museum.Schjeldahl,</text>

And so it came as a surprise to many when, around 1980, the LA County Museum of Art decided to put on a show that was a direct response to the Impressionism of the Paris Salon of 1864. The result was a revolution: the LA Center was transformed into a cultural centre for artists and a hub for the emerging art of the Impressionist era. In the Museum of Modern Art, Norman Stone wrote: ‘The impulse to make art today, the impulse to make beautiful things, the impulse to show art … is the impetus that has created, nourished, and continues to define the Museum’s mission.’ And, a few years later, in 1984, Bill Smith, Curator of Entomology at the Royal Standard, said: ‘Art, like all artistic activities, is an inherently political act, involving politics of identity, politics of feelings, and politics of perception.’ He meant that ‘political “towards a political world view – a world “in</text>

And so it came as a surprise to many contemporary artists and curators when, sometime between 1968 and 1974, LIFE Magazine ran an article about the Charlottesville Museum of Art featuring a profile of John Lennon, which was curated by Robert Frank. In the article, the artist and musician is described as having been driven mad by the Vietnam War, and his collection of art is called ‘Vietnam: The Forbidden Empire’. But in the museum, his collection is catalogued alongside those of other artists and curators, including Arnold Palmer, Walter Benjamin, Maria Hlavajova, Boris Groys, Ingmar Bergman, Josh Fox, and many others. It is not until the 1980s, with the rise of biennial form, that the museum period is explicitly mentioned.And yet the museum is explicitly described as having a life of its own. It is a collection of objects, or, to be more specific, an exhibition of objects from different times and places. Thus, the museum is a contemporary form that emerged in the</text>

I invited the artist Ella Gibbs (1879–1971) to collaborate as an artist on a project that would, in effect, be an extension of what she was doing in Liverpool. Gibbs was an accomplished painter and a world-renowned authority on the visual arts. Her Spanish Influences are evident in her collection, which includes over 1,000 paintings from different periods of the history of the art world in the United Kingdom and throughout the world. But her interest in the social construction of art is equally evident in her art. She also edited a magazine called Feminista that published essays on gender and social development. Her output as an artist is full of social commentary. Her most famous contribution to the Biennial was a series of public interventions that she conducted as part of the Women’s Arts and Crafts exhibition in Liverpool. These included writing essays on the occasion of the Liverpool Biennial, the role of women in arts and craft, and the ethics and politics of art as social activism.Her account of the intervention in the Liverpool Biennial is one of many that she has engaged in over the years, many of which are recounted in her book</text>

I invited the artist Ella Gibbs (1879–1971) to collaborate as an artist on a project that would, in effect, be an extension of what she was doing at Tate Britain, but in a different context. She responded by creating what she called the ‘Year Zero’ project, named for the first letter of the Greek alphabet. This was the first attempt to formulate a set of rules that would allow future generations to create ‘Ancient Greek Writing Systems’, a kind of ‘digital Egyptian handbook’ for writing in the future. Inspired by the digital technologies of the time, Gibbs drew up a set of rules that would allow future generations to construct a kind of proto-universal database of information – a digital version of the organization she was trying to abolish. These rules, she said, should be able to ‘reproduce themselves’ – making possible what she called ‘the New Economy’ – but should also ‘serve as a permanent archive of social history’ through ‘institutional memory’.[2]These are bold claims, not least for a woman to make in the era</text>

I invited the artist Ella Gibbs (1879–1971) to collaborate as an artist on a project that would, in effect, be an extension of what she was doing at the Philadelphia Centennial. She declined the offer, but in the spirit of the biennial, I put together a team of artists and put them together with materials from the museum, including plaster, wood, fabric, letters, map prints, photographs and sculptures. I arranged to have a meeting with the Liverpool Biennial to discuss the project, and invited them to join me in Liverpool. After the initial meeting in Liverpool, we went on a second course in the Liverpool Biennial, in which we discussed the project from various curatorial perspectives. The project was a collaboration, but it was also a partnership: the artworks and the museum embodied the museum as a whole, whereas the grid placed particular emphasis on the individual works. But the art was there first, and the museum and the artist were there as secondary. The collective was there as a co-production, in a very real sense, in the sense that it was there as a site of production, a site</text>

She did not know what an artefact was at the time, but she developed the idea of the biennial in her own way. She introduced the term to me by way of example. 'When I saw that brief space in the window of that old chemist's, thinking about the way it might be used, the idea of the biennial as an institution took root in me,' she said.Her idea was that she would bring together a range of artefacts from different periods in time, and over the course of three weeks, each family member of the artist would present a fragment from the same artefact. She would then ask the audience to imagine themselves in the present of that period, and the next period. How would they discover the artefact? She would then ask the same question of the audience again, and ask them to imagine a different future. She did not yet know what a biennial was, but she had an idea. Gibbs then rolled out of</text>

She agreed to do the exact same thing, but instead of engaging the public as an artist, I invited her to collaborate as a researcher. Her research would be a kind of curatorial exercise, but it would be a research project. So the project would be curatorial in nature, but it would also be participatory in the sense that you would be a part of the curatorial conversation. A kind of archiving, in other words.The project would begin with a workshop for the curator and the artist, during which the curator and the audience would engage in a kind of curatorial exercise. They would create a scenario in which they could ‘walk away’ from the item they were presented with, and they would leave with a kind of a question that the artist could then address in the event. For this we would set up a question-and-answer session, where the audience could come and engage with the artist, the organisation that she was working with or</text>

Her 1942 project Animals raised awareness of the plight of animals in agricultural settings; her 2017 project Women in Bodies produced significant responses when it was exhibited at the Dolphin, but less widely recognised work when it was exhibited at Tate Britain.4 A rendering of a possible American dream, taken from the artist’s letter to the American public. Courtesy of the artist and Diane von Furstenberg Institutions had their origins in part as a response to the potential loss of control over one’s resources that followed from the growth of industrial capitalism.

In her own words: ‘My project with Gibbs would not serve the institutional interest of Liverpool, and inasmuch as it was not intended to do so, neither would it be recognised by the authorities’.5.

I invited the artist Ella Gibbs (1879–1971) to collaborate as an artist on a project that would, in effect, be an extension of what she was doing in France. She agreed to do that, but in order to do so she had to agree to the installation being called The Cage. So the project was renamed The Cage and its role expanded. Gibbs was an artist and a philosopher, so the new programme of work addressed a philosophical point of view. Her contribution to the project was a disquisition on the criminal law, the prison population and its various penal codes. She argued that ‘all legislation which attempts to regulate or allocate space … violates the representative … biennial’ by creating a fixed or predetermined outcome, which cannot be changed.’ She produced a set of drafting desks and a board game ‘All in the Common Good’, for the audience to interpose themselves between imprisoned individuals and the law. She also produced a series of greeting cards with inset images of political cartoons of the United States in which the images appeared to endorse the actions of the federal government.

I invited the artist Ella Gibbs (1879–1971) to collaborate as an artist on a project that would, in effect, be an extension of what she was doing in Liverpool. She arrived via chartered chartered flight and was met with enthusiasm and even an offer to collaborate. Gibbs made numerous sculptures and drawings of landscapes in the UK and abroad, including on the front cover of a children’s book. Her most famous work, however, Liveströnd, is a lesbian love poem that was read out at the 1917 Venice Biennale and which was performed at the 1917 London Biennale. While she was an accomplished and popular artist, her work is notoriously fragmented and lacking in detail and figures. Her sculptures are typically presented in terms of categories; ‘trophy’ is a common trope. She was, however, a pioneer in the field of biennials and in developing international reputation as a leading feminist artist. Her interest in the exhibitionary form and its potential as a staging ground for cultural activities made her sculptures stand out in a crowd. Her interest in the domestic rather than</text>

I invited the artist Ella Gibbs (1879–1971) to collaborate as an artist on a project that would, in effect, be an extension of what she was doing in the US. She declined the offer, claiming that she had other priorities. At that time, she was working as a reporter for The New York Times, and her work as an artist was often used as a way to suggest that she was involved in something larger than herself. From her essay in Self- Portrait (1927), her photographs of the docks and dockside ‘episodes’ in the Liverpool Daily Post, the Liverpool Echo and The Times of London, she introduced herself as a journalist for the 19th Volume of The Times and a writer on the New York Post. Her interest in the docks, and the nature of her work with them, was also an element of her reporting. In the 1930s and 1940s she was a reporter for The Times, as well as a reporter for The Times Literary Supplement and The Illustrated London News.

    a machine curated by art dealers, art students and collectors, art and curators, journalists and collectors’ contribution to the dialogue on the future of art is a dialogue that needs to include not only art dealers and collectors, but also people from the wider art world. It cannot be a museum, it’s an artifice. 	The second pillar of the Vision is the creation of a bi-annual, three-day, free-exhibition, ‘The Contemporary Condition’, taking place in October 2018, 2019 and 2020. This will be the first European edition of the festival, and the first time that the word ‘contemporary’ has been used in the title of the exposition.

The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial will remain the centre of the exhibitionary universe, and its productions will be the final word, word, word, word of the art. The only possible intervention in the form of the biennial is that chosen by the curators: a miracle, perhaps, if the biennial is destined to be a miracle. Contemporaneity is the preferred temporal mode of the biennial, and that is why art dealers and collectors will be there, because that is the preferred temporal mode. 	The third pillar of the Vision is the collaboration and exchange of different cultures in the space of art. That is to say, cultures that are capable of sharing, exchanging, and blending. Contemporaneity is a great gift of the biennial, and what it can do is to foster the possibility of sharing, exchanging, and blending across cultures. That is, cultures that are capable of coming together and coming together well, in a way that is rich, dynamic and unexpected, and that is</text>

The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial is a static form, in which curators have a fixed role, a set of tasks that they can choose to dedicate themselves to or not to, which is usually defined as the agenda of the biennial itself. 	The biennial has become what it calls a temporality. It is an evolving entity that can trace its lineage to any number of previous biennials, and from previous curatorial interventions. It is a term that has specific connotations in this country, and internationally, and this is why curators here tend to gravitate towards areas with a history or heritage to which they are intimately connected. The ‘contemporary’ in ‘contemporaneous’ is a synonym for ‘intelligent, connected and social’.’[1] And the biennial as a social form has come to be intimately connected with the social. A social context is critical to the safe functioning of the biennial as a social form, but it</text>

The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial is also unlikely to intervene in a perennial, perennial, or perennial mode of artmaking; it is the art dealer who, in the vast majority of cases, will not be interested in anything changing their business strategy. The biennial is a form of cultural tourism organisation, and its main objective is the commercial re-sale of art, whether that’s a work they produced themselves, or the artistic exploitation of a new market opportunity. Biennials have a very specific set of curatorial approaches that they adopt when negotiating a specific site, and in this case it is necessary to develop a co-conscious strategy to control the art that is produced and consumption in a specific city. The biennial needs to be able to negotiate contexts and overcome their inherent idiosyncrasies, and this requires negotiation not only with artists, but also with the city. The question that artists and curators alike often raise is about the political nature of contemporary art, and contemporary artmaking in particular. Contemporary artworks often</text>

The biennial as temporary exhibitionary form is a myth, and the word ‘contemporary’ has been used in the twenty-first century to mean contemporary with a fast pace and with little in the way of a future.

The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial is a stable form: it is the single most widely distributed exhibitionary form, and it is the main venue for the accumulation of cultural capital in the world. Contemporaneity is therefore a crucial concept that we must master in order to anticipate what is happening in the world today. But what is contemporary? In an ideal world, our cultural capital today would flow out of the contemporary art market, into the contemporary art museum, into the contemporary art fair, and into the museum of art itself. But these are antiquated forms, and the trajectory of the art market today is different from what it was in the late nineteenth century. The art market today is an island in the ocean, and its inhabitants are its only inhabitants. The island is crowded with goods, and the goods are the goods of a different world. So what has the contemporary? In an ideal world, we would all be able to touch and taste all the cultural capital today floating around in the form of art, and we</text>

The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial is an artifact of a bygone age, and at some point in the future we might want to revisit the exhibitionary form it emerged from. 	But the biennial is an artifact of a bygone era, and its future is now. The biennial is no longer an exhibitionary form, and the advent of mass entertainment may well change the form it takes today, and today we inhabit. 	The twenty-first century may well bring a new curatorial form, but it may well also bring with it a new cultural form that is no longer concerned with the maintenance of an object of cultural value, but rather with the creation and circulation of entertaining things. Mass entertainment will make it easier to see the world through the prism of cultural consumption. 	The biennial may well acquire this form through its many public offerings, but its true asset is its curatorial offering.

The term is a misnomer: the more exciting the art that is being made today, the more exciting is the prospect of tomorrow. The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial is the ultimate episodic exhibitionary form: it has been around for hundreds of years, and its current form is a function of historical trends and particular biennials. Contemporaneity is the temporal aspect of the artworld: it is a feature that has survived into the present, often in unexpected places. Contemporaneity is a feature that is highly resistant to any real or perceived urban change, and so it is virtually certain to survive into the foreseeable future. Contemporaneity therefore has two forms: that of the biennial and the biennial as an episodic form. One can therefore say that the biennial will always be into the future, and thus the art world will always have a place in its temporal landscape. 	The other, more powerful form of the biennial is that of the twice yearly, global mega-exhibition, ‘The Contemporary Condition’. In the key words of Max Horkheimer, ‘Two to three</text>

The term is a misnomer: the more exciting the art that is being made today, the more exciting is the prospect of tomorrow. The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial exhibitionary form sees curators working across a specific time period – the artist’s individual exhibitionary project, the museum, the biennale – and in this sense the contemporary biennial forms the museum-like exhalation of knowledge in the form of a biennale. Circulation, as we know from art history books, is a form of institutionalised circulation that is both permanent and non-permanent. It is neither a museum nor a museum-like institution. It is a curatorial intervention that creates its own form of institutionalised knowledge. It is not a museum, and neither is it a museum-like institution. 	The biennial form is most prominent in Western, but it is increasingly so in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and it is increasingly so in China. It is a curatorial invention, and as a curatorial intervention, it is equally not a museum. The biennial is a curatorial invention that creates a new form of</text>

The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial must be a multi-year, multidisciplinary exhibitionary form, and the only way to truly know it is to attend to its various forms, which are likely to remain unsettled, unsettled, and unsettled, and to witness its ever-expanding, multi-sited, multi-format catalogue. If the Contemporary Condition is to convey the urgency and the diversity of the contemporary condition, then its publication in a major art museum only accelerates the museum’s essential role, since it allows the museum to intervene and narrate the condition, to some extent in anticipation of what it will be like to be present. It is a back story and a narrator’s back story often intersects and intermingles with one another. The biennial must relate to what it means to be contemporary, and what it means to be contemporary art. It is not enough to tell a curatorial back story. One must also know what it means to be contemporary, and be able</text>

The biennial is a fixed exhibitionary form, and the biennial as such is unlikely to experience a curatorial intervention. The biennial has a budget, a set number of tickets available, and a limited number of spaces available, and so it’s easy to understand how a biennial can be constrained. 	The biennial itself is a building block of the contemporary condition, and like all forms of modern art it must be constantly renewed and renewed. Each iteration, or variation, of the format will require a dedicated ticketing market, and so the biennial will always require a dedicated public. 	The biennial, like all forms of art, is a transient exhibitionary form: it will most likely be displaced by another form of art, and so it must be curated with care and production. Contemporary art today is made possible by rapid transit, and so the biennial must also be creatively curated with care and production. 	The biennial is a curatorial device: it is a form of art exhibitionary that exists at a particular moment in time, presenting a specific artistic proposition at a specific moment in</text>

In a footnote, the authors note that, ‘Since the mid-nineteenth century, the biennial has generally been represented as an event at which artists were present as a curatorial gesture and a public entertainment. However, this is no longer the case. While contemporary biennials may be entertainment in themselves, they are rather research institutions, keeping abreast of current ideas and issues in art and culture, and presenting contemporary art in a particular ‘present’ context.’[17] This is supported by the increasing number of contemporary artworks being produced in temporary exhibitions, the proliferation of biennials being curated by established art galleries, and the increasing number of biennials being created by grassroots art and cultural organisations, such as the Charts on 22nd Street Arts Centre, whose members include leading artists and curators, musicians, poets, writers and community organisers.

The second edition of the Dictionary of Biennials was published in June 2017.3. Biennials, the exhibition form and the biennial itself, are two parts of a much broader idea of the biennial that emerged in the 1970s, when the biennial was conceptualised as a transnational, international journal of the art form. The museum form had its genesis in the European context, and the biennial had its origins in North America. Biennials began as individualised exhibitions, usually catalogues or collections of art collected for a specific purpose, and in this sense they are both objects and collections of art. They are, however, also ‘part of an evolving national discursive and cultural practice that will increasingly take into account the social and cultural dimensions of art’s social effects’ – that is, of the social consequences of art as a social form, and how such a form impacts on material goods and services, including how art is made,</text>

This is also the case for biennials in other cities, but as biennials in London are relatively new, and museums in other cities have recently started to be established, this assumption is questionable. It is true that the Museum of Modern Art, New York, established in 1888, was the first biennial to exhibit its collections in New York, but the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Incorporated, one of its titles, soon shifted to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which opened a museum, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which soon after opened a branch, both dedicated to the collection it had been established to preserve.

The main object of the biennale is now often defined as the host city’s cultural district, but this is not always the case, and host cities play a significant role in shaping the terms by which the biennale is defined and experienced. In recent years, the host city has come to represent a range of diverse practices and objects common to a given city, but it is often forgotten that the biennale is a cultural event that is centred on a city and its neighbourhoods. The host city is a crucial point of entry into the exhibitionary form, and so it is not surprising that bienn</text>

It includes articles on biennials’ early history as collections, their contemporary significance, and their future. However, the articles do not attempt to present a unified picture of the collections and curatorial challenges facing biennials in the twenty-first century. This is due to the fact that the curatorial role has changed considerably since the nineteenth century, and it is also the century in which biennials are most vulnerable to a large-scale de-recognition of their collections and their collections as a “real”. Although the biennial is the global icon of its type, the earliest documented example of a museum turning an exhibition of artefacts into a museum is from the Byzantine and Herodotus Museums Collection, held in Athens, Greece.

In the twenty-first century, this includes the ‘British Museum’, which has been classified as a National Historical Landmark by the British National Exhibition since 1922, and has been a museum of modernist art since its founding in 1888. The institution is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2015. The designation is particularly significant in the context of the museum’s current exhibition business, which is dominated by two major trade fairs, the annual trade fair of Sydney and the Biennale of Sydney, each exhibiting a significant proportion of the institution’s work. In these, exhibitions that are not ‘historic’ in their own right garner significant media attention and often major curatorial intervention. In the case of a bi</text>

The editors suggest a re-narration of the specific collections and museums housed in the biennial – a sort of collaborative index to the art and exhibition making processes that began during the nineteenth century. The collection of museums and collections, ‘the museum’, they speculate, might also include a range of objects that are either in or through a biennial. Drawing on their own collections, the editors suggest a kind of public-articulation of the collections, a public-art that is both tangible and intangible, both literary and ad hoc, grounding in time and space. The editors suggest another kind of biennial – a kind of public-articulation of the collections, a kind of inductive tour that draws visitors to a place or series of places through a kind of parallel history.

The twenty-first century should add a biannual reference to the collection of early twentieth-century collections, since the biennial has come a long way since its beginnings in 1899. A biannual reference to the collection of collections, or even a complete edition of the Journal of a biennial, would give us a sense of the density and depth of the museum’s collection, which is a scarce and fragmented commodity in the age of the biennial. A biannual reference to the collection of collections, or even a complete edition of a journal, would give us a sense of the idiosyncratic idiosyncrasies and idiosyncrasy of the particular biennial. A biannual reference to the collection of collections, or even a complete journal, would allow us to read the unpublished stories and the past in a full range of voices, which is one of the reasons the biennial is, for the public and the curatorial, so riveted by</text>

The collection included works from forty-seven countries and twenty-one dialects.[15] The Dictionary of National Biennials, edited by Terry Lau, Mark Easton and Elizabeth Povinelli, defines a biennial as follows: ‘The word “biennial” has several different senses. In its broadest sense, it can mean any kind of exhibition or exhibition, ranging from a commemoration of an event to an advertisement for a given product or service. In its historical usage, it refers to the collection of collections kept at the British Museum, which form the basis of the museum.’[16] The Dictionary of National Biennials provides a complete list of titles, followed by a bibliography of articles, some dating back to the nineteenth century. The articles include a wealth of historical and literary quotes about biennials, their place in history, and the biennial as a museum form. However, the bibliographies of biennials often refer to collections within the museum, often in the form of a directory, with subjects grouped together or arranged chronologically. In the case of the American biennial, the articles often reference the specific collections within the museum, often listing collections grouped under themes. Examples are the popular ‘50 Great Centenarian Biennials’, which were organized by the American Museum of Natural History (1922–27) in New York (with Charles Darwin as its artistic director) and London’s Tate Modern, which followed a similar theme in Berlin, and the ‘Gulf and the Homeless’, a now defunct ‘study hall for the far right’ in Venice. All these biennials catalogued works from the American Museum of Natural History and Tate Modern, but the ‘50’ series was the oldest and most widely distributed, and it included works by many artists from around the</text>

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, I chose to initiate a new phase in the development of the Biennale’s portfolio. In the intervening years, I’ve curated six exhibitions, including the spectacular 2016 Liverpool Biennale, which was co-curated by Joasia Krysa and Mark Loudon. 	In 2017, I curated 'Outlawed Social Life', a project with the artist Aida Al Sayeh that brought together previously produced works from the Biennale with new media, installations, poetry, photography and games designed to challenge the conventions and values of social life in the UK. 	During my term as education minister, I started the ‘schools, communities and communities’ programme that’s now part of the Department of Education, Science and Culture. This involved organising school trips for school children, youth groups, youth-led creative enterprises and wider community organisations, along with regular community events and exhibitions.

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, and featured a number of international and local artists, including Sabina Huq, and others, the Biennale’s immediate post-auction trajectory was very much affected by the city’s financial crisis and ensuing displacement crisis. Since the Biennale’s early years, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Liverpool has hosted several biennales, most notably the Venice Biennale (1999), and the Grantham–Museum of Modern Art’s Global Art Cribs in New York and Beijing. All three biennales have been deeply fragmented and dispersed within their sites, with the largest concentrations stemming outside the biennale grounds. Sabina Huq’s contribution to the 1998 Venice Biennale was a visible and important presence in the city, but the bulk of the artworks from that event remain conspicuously absent from the cityscape. In fact, as biennales become more regional</text>

Media such as video, documents, images, infographics and social media has consistently been a part of this mix, and continues to be so. 	Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, a local community organisation, Together We Stand, established a program of events, activities and exhibitions devoted to the city and its people. These were followed by two biennales in 2018 and 2019, with a third scheduled for 2026. 	Historically, biennales are times of great creativity, transformation, and upheaval. They are unpredictable, sometimes destructive, and often define future directions for art form. However, the biennale has proven exceptionally adaptable and responsive to the changing times, thanks in large part to the work of artists, curators, art writers and art’s many publics, which it has benefited from in ways we have not yet discovered. 	Within the context of urbanisation and suburbanisation in the 1980s and 1990s, the biennale established a shared, though often maligned, vocabulary to categorise contemporary artworks and exhibitions in a shared public space. These are some of the ways in which the biennale has benefitted</text>

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, I decided to take a similar approach to the Biennale’s next edition. I invited a number of artists from the local community, including two young artists who had recently exhibited at the Bluecoat/Welsh Streets artist’s residency, to collaborate with me on a project exploring the experiences of cultural tourism in the Welsh Streets. These artists were Ben Whittaker and Svetlana Boym  as well as the artist Ella Gibbs. The project evolved from there, as I found myself increasingly concerned with the level of engagement that the community could bring to the art event, rather than the other way around. Biennales are art events that usually happen in the context of a cultural or tourism industry, and art in this case was seen as an effective way to bring the community together with arts-related activities. The interaction between art and commerce was emphasised, and art was frequently used as a tool to bring cultural practices and identities together. Art</text>

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, I set out to create a multi-disciplinary symposium on the exhibition’s script, both script and text, in the form of a conference. This was prompted by the Liverpool Biennial’s 2017 publication ‘The Resident’, an in-depth feature in the journal The Resident entitled ‘The Biennial Experience.’ The article rejected the convention of presenting a work in a biennial for the same reason that a curator might do, presenting the work in its real-life context, in an attempt to bring to light a particular detail, a story, a myth or a combination of myths or traditions. The article, written by Claire Bishop-Jones, rejected the convention of presenting a work in a biennial as a form of objectification of women, describing the work as one that reifies and fetishises their unique place in history: ‘The biennial is expected to celebrate what it means to be a ‘</text>

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, I decided to revisit the idea of the artist’s studio in order to explore the legacy of the Biennale in Liverpool, and the need for a contemporary art museum there.  Lacking a studio, I turned to the art school I had attended, which at the time was running a series of workshops designed to equip students for a career in art production. Since I was fortunate enough to have a place in the art school’s recording studio, I used this as a platform to experiment with new media and sound, and to produce and present my exhibition alongside the music and visual arts teachers. 	As part of this, I joined a wide range of artists, writers and collectors who gathered in June to discuss the ideas and practices of biennials in cities around the world. During the conference, which was organised by the Liverpool Biennial, a group of artists volunteered to lead a project that created a hybrid biennial, producing works in either the biennial format or</text>

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool in exchange for the redevelopment of abandoned (but popular) cinemas, the local art college administration decided to participate in the Biennale’s ‘celebrity’ trope, in order to campaign for the institution’s future use of prestige-generating venues – a scheme they hoped would one day ‘reanimate’ the city. Aspiring artists were instructed to produce a ‘twist’ in the form of a celebrity’ in exchange for ‘exclusive use’ of a building or a right of way, or both. 	A few artists, including Nicole Starosielski and Amber Dean, were able to persevere despite these heavy-handed tactics, and their work lives in the Biennale’s catalogue as historical artefacts. In the case of Dean and Starosielski, their take on the biennial format was both playful and uncompromising, relying on straightforward storytelling and an awareness of audience expectations.

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, I sought to engage with the notion of the ‘city in motion’ as opposed to the ‘individual in the place of community’ in my exhibition ‘Homebaked’, which opened on 27 October 2017. In the event, the architectural forms that’s often cited as being a part of ‘the city in motion’ are actively reproduced in various ways, often in creative new ways. The exhibition was divided into three parts, each examining a different aspect of the architectural style of the city. Part One examined preparations for the opening of the Biennale as part of a wider renovation programme; preparations for the installation of a new generation of artists, designers and curators; and the curatorial role of the museum in this process. Part Two looked at the role of the museum in this process, and its curatorial agenda; and Part Three looked into the future. 	In these three sections, the curatorial team worked alongside artists, designers</text>

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, I started looking into what it would mean for an institution to embed cultural activity in a local area, and internationally. I came across a fascinating study done by historian, Peter Weibel, who defines cultural activity as follows: ‘Cultural activity is defined as “the act of coming together as a community of people or cultural groups for a shared purpose, typically in the interests of a community of people or groups: to understand, to talk about, to experience, to ‘walk around’, and to ‘talk to’ people or groups through the act of gathering, sampling, and conversing.’ This definition makes it clear what’s being done with cultural resources: what’s being done with the cultural resources of Liverpool, and internationally, is precisely what Weibel defines as ‘cultural perforation’. 	The concept of 'cultural perforation’ is deeply rooted in the notions of imperialism and colonialism; notions that</text>

Following the Biennale’s 2017, which was centred on the city of Liverpool, I decided to take a different approach to the art that was being produced in Canvey Island. 	Acting as a sort of buffer, I decided to produce a series of events in Canvey Island around the institution, with a curatorial team led by Dr Rob Drake and comprised of artists, that would bring local artists together with international curators from a variety of cities to canvas the city. These artists would commission work from local artists, and would have full creative control over the projects produced. 	Four artists approached me with ideas for the first time around the institution, in the early 1990s. One of them was Wendy Harpe, who would go on to found the Chisenhale Gallery, and would go on to be an iconic figure in Canvey Island. The other was Tania Bruguera, who would go on to be a major figure in progressive pedagogy in the UK and internationally. 	In a way, I</text>

I’m not saying that it’s ‘going to be like Newtown’ or something like that. Newtown’s the old ‘Churchill’s Study House’ – it’s a single-purpose place, and it sits empty, but it fills up quickly. It’s a place where a lot of thought and planning is given to, and sometimes that’s all that’s needed. And so, what we’re doing at the moment is necessary, transformative and it happens in a city, and so if it’s happening in the city it’s happening because of the city. If it’s happening elsewhere it’s happening because of some other city that is also the site of another city’s future. I think that in this moment, and with all the noise and things that we’re experiencing, we’re not seeing what we’re really working towards.

I’m not saying that it’s ‘going to be like Newtown’ or something like that, because it’s not that easy to make a city into something it isn’t supposed to be. But I do think that the way in which we are structuring our city now is fundamentally unjust, and I don’t think that there is a way to make it otherwise.  Whether it’s the way in which the city is being remade by a rapidly evolving metropolis, or the way in which the city is being remade by an organisation that has a clear agenda and clearly defines its role, like the police force or the fire brigade, is to a large extent about resources. If the resources of the city are being stretched thin, if the infrastructure doesn’t work out – which is a reality of much of what’s happening in Liverpool – then there is an issue that has to be addressed. And so I’m not saying that everything that’s happening in Liverpool is going to be wonderful or seamless or ideal,</text>

I’m saying that it’s going to have to be something different, and that’s why we’re having so many conversations around the city, because if it’s just a place where people say ‘hello’ and ‘good morning’ and ‘how are you?’ then it’s not going to be able to support that in a way that creates change. It’s going to be able to deliver what the city needs, but it’s going to have to be something that is transformative in its own way.In terms of the exhibition itself, I think that we haven’t found the right format yet.

I’m not saying that it’s ‘going to be like Newtown’ or something like that; it’s more like ‘we need to find new ways of organising ourselves, and the city is a living laboratory that we are constantly shaping and evolving into new environments.’ But it’s a question that arises: how do you create a unique relationship with the city that is structurally different from what you’re used to? And there are of course many ways of approaching this: there are many architects and landscape architects who’ve been working on ‘new urban forms’ for decades, and so on. But there is a tension there: there is an intrinsic conflict between the kind of architecture and the urban form that you typically associate with the 1980s and 1990s, and the way in which architects of new forms are approaching the problem from contemporary design perspectives. Perhaps it’s a misunderstanding of the problems that we face today: in an increasingly material world, in fact. But I do think that there is a tension there, and I</text>

I’m not saying that it’s ‘going to be like Newtown’ or something like that; it’s more that we’ve all been trained to think of infrastructure as something that is ever-present and ever-changing, and so as a result it’s more likely to happen in the places that we are trying to save. If it does happen in those places, then that’s great; if it doesn’t, then that’s disappointing. But in the way that architecture is composed, and the way that it is generated, its nature demands that it’s going to be there forever.     That was very interesting in terms of the way in which the city itself is being generated. I thought that the work that was going on with the massive developments and the mass transit systems was really interesting, because it allowed us to imagine, for instance, the way in which a traditional art gallery might engage in redeveloping a neighbourhood; it allowed us to imagine a time when the urban environment was a product of long-term</text>

But it’s also about people not existing in a certain way, not existing in a certain way, and how this affects them. The act of going to school or going to work or going to a certain club or going to a certain restaurant is a certain kind of experience, and so is the experience of being in a certain kind of community. 	I’m not saying that those are the only kinds of experiences people need, nor that they’d all be possible, nor that they couldn’t all be created equally – and I do feel that there is a tension there between the specificity of what’s happening now and the kind of abstract space and abstract thought that people have assumed was there all along. For example, I know that at the end of the day, when people talk about the way in which the Occupy movement is articulated, and how it’s</text>

We have aspirations that are bigger than ourselves, and so one of the things that I do is saying to myself all the time, and to all of us: ‘You have to think about what that future might hold.’ I’m quite optimistic about that. I don’t know if it’s something that we actually envisage, but I do know that we have to actively seek it out. Because if we don’t, we’ll never achieve that future that we want to create.Download this article as PDFSue Bell YankSue Bell Yank is a writer and artist.

There are so many different ways of structuring infrastructure that can be developed, and so many different models of how infrastructure is produced and delivered that it’s hard to imagine what the future could be like if all the learning that’s happening now wasn’t happening. The A40 is a great starting point, but there are so many other ways of organising things that need to be developed, and I don’t think that the city is the only area of the country with this kind of infrastructure. There are so many other localities with their own unique mix of local needs and priorities that need to be addressed. Liverpool has a huge cultural and sporting identity that comes from the shipbuilding industry: there’s a reason why the city is so important. It’s because of the shipbuilding industry: if it wasn’t for the shipbuilding, there would be no Liverpool. There are so many other aspects to it: the fact that it�</text>

It’s not so much the places that are being made safe, but the question that is being asked: what is the role of the arts organisation in this context? What are the parameters? How are art institutions expected to deliver in this context? This is what art schools are for. This is what urban artists are for. This is what young artists are for. This is what community artists are for. This is what local communities are for. This is what urbanists are for. And of course it’s community artists who have always been there, doing their thing, asking questions and coming up with interesting ways of engaging people. But it’s art schools now, and urban practitioners now, doing more than asking those questions, creating their own realities and acting out their own ambitions.This is part of my work, delivering solutions to</text>

I also think that there is an understanding that this is not just about Liverpool or the city, and that there is a level of systemic change that has to happen. I think that there has to be a sense of collective action, and so the way that the show is being organised is really important. I got a real sense of that in the meetings that we’re having now about what to do next. The way that the show is organising itself is really important.  The other thing is that there is an understanding that this is a collective action that has to happen, and that there is a certain amount of trust-building that needs to happen: that there is a mutual understanding between participants, that there is a level of skill-sharing, and that there</text>

However, the city did have many tools with which to combat what it perceived as an invasion of privacy. For example, it could have installed CCTV cameras in every school, mandated that students attend school on a certain day, or outlawed private attendance altogether. All of these measures were taken by the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) in Scotland in the wake of the first world war, and many Scottish towns and cities subsequently adopted similar policies. 	But the most effective tool available to an administrator to combat what it perceived as an invasion of privacy was clearly identified as the ‘right to education’.6  This was exemplified by Margaret Thatcher's proposed ‘education manifesto’ in 1979, which set out the specific aims of the National Education Policy Commission, which were further developed by her government.7  The</text>

Perhaps it is this ongoing process of recognition that is more enjoyed by those who have had access to a wider range of cultural tools.7  For example, the Kendalbeek Arts Centre reopened in 2012 and has hosted performances by major artists, including Sally Tallant,8  and the suddenly renamed Keeper Theatre company,9  joined by theatre students from Cornish College of Arts, University of Glasgow,8  and others.10  It is perhaps this ongoing process of recognition that is more welcomed by the local people who now control the building, and who presumably feel more empowered by this presence.

The question that remained was what to do next. The short answer is that the only way to protect the city from becoming overrun by corporations like Chase Manhattan was for the people to form a Citizens’ Assembly and petition for a secondhand school licence. While this sounds like a pipe dream in an area where businesses are already heavily lobbied, it appears to be the case that the people who live there and work in the city are the only ones able to influence what happens in the borough. Even though the petition was unsuccessful, the decision to close the schools remains firmly in the hands of the city council.6  This behaviour of passive resistance is not unique to Rosslyn Park or Kendalbeek, as is often alleged.

Local people’s representatives, the High Court heard, had sought to close the schools – and thus deprive the district of its educational resources – although this was clearly not supported by the legal authorities. Therefore, the local people’s representatives had standing to bring such a lawsuit. But the Court of Appeal went further and held that the High Court had exceeded its jurisdiction, and that the district had standing to challenge the decision to close the schools. Clearly, the Court of Appeal believed that the schools were unconstitutional and should be returned to Rosslyn Park. However, this was not at all certain; as the Court of Appeal learned, the High Court had recently been replaced and a new President had taken</text>

However, the High Court of Justice did not stop there and instead chose to go even further and declare that ‘all the children and young people in the vicinity … are, by virtue of living there and being born and raised there, part of a community of society, and have a right to take part in community activities’.6  And so the community, including the schoolchildren, is incorporated into the school, the streets are cordoned off and paramilitary police are called in. Meanwhile, the schools are shut, the Canteen is beefed up and the town is consumed by violence. Meanwhile, as the streets are cleared out, community members are dispatched to work in the factories or as labourers in retail centres. Meanwhile, as the police</text>

However, in a landmark decision in 1971, the High Court of Justice ruled that the school was to be recognised as a ‘public institution’ and that its role was one of 'participation’ in a political process.6  So while the High Court had already declared that the school was unconstitutional, the Court of Appeal went further and ruled that the school was to be recognised as a quasi-public body with a quasi-religious function and that its role was one of adjudication on legislation providing for the enforcement of ‘public rights’.7  So the role of the city council is to legislate and the court is to adjudicate. But what happens when the courts do not agree? 	In 1985, the High Court of Justice ruled that the city could recognise schools as quasi-public entities and thus schools could again return to Rosslyn Park.8  This</text>

The ruling effectively ended the dispute, allowing the shuttered schools to close without any opposition from residents or the community. This came as a surprise to residents and many took advantage of the ruling to call for the reopening of the schools, which was eventually done. While this did not eradicate the pollution that the neighbourhoods had to deal with every day, at least the reopened schools offered a solution and allowed the community to participate in that solution. 	Even though the High Court had already ruled that the schools were unconstitutional, the decision to close them again only fuelled the residents’ anger, since the decision to close again meant that they would have to become charter schools again, which would mean having to undergo the same kind of approval process as any other school, which residents</text>

The focus shifted to the local community in the form of Homebaked and its offshoot organisation, Leaping Roots.

The inclusion of artists from non-community settings in the development of alternative arts and culture was an intriguing experiment, and much as with local people, diverse forms of learning styles and expertise were sought.  In 1990 the Arts Council established the Arts and Heritage Select Committee, which had primary responsibility for the provision of arts and heritage services to communities in England and Wales.6  The committee met monthly and publicly announced new projects in April 1991. Its remit expanded in 1991 to include research and evaluation of arts and heritage provision in allocating funding. The main goals of the committee were: 1. To identify and select culturally responsive local arts and heritage provisioning agencies; 2. To develop a Community Arts/Resourceful Local arts/recreation;</text>

The card was a great way to bring together a broad range of people from a range of backgrounds to work alongside a young person or young person in a different part of the community.  In the 1980s and 1990s the card programme was a great way to get arts and community resources to work with young people and young-adult literacy projects. With the launch of the Arts Council Press in 1993, the political overtone of the Youth Card was removed and replaced with an explicit political purpose of supporting and encouraging ‘a generation of artists and creative people’.6 The outreach now known as 'The Homework Game' invited artists and organisations to create engaging, socially responsive work that would be suitable for the game, which was developed by the Arts Council and produced in collaboration with the National Theatre.

One of the most successful projects undertaken with the card was the Young People’s Arts and Social Inclusion project, which instigated a chain reaction among artists, community artists, youth and youth arts organisations around the country, resulting in the formation of several national arts commissions and the establishment of international arts networks.  The European perception of art as inherently political has been reinforced by the Max Planck Society’s (later AB) series of exhibitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which sought to reconcile the political and the social through a combination of art and social activities.6 The Bluecoat Arts Club was established in Liverpool in 1972, and during this time it hosted several exhibitions including a series</text>

The card was an easy way to get involved in arts-related activities outside the home and provided an easy platform to expand cultural identities and narratives.The card was a great way to get involved in arts-related activities outside the home and provided an easy platform to expand cultural identities and narratives.The challenge for the artist in the 1980s and early 1990s was to create an artistic project that would be culturally relevant and would cross over into the mainstream media without being seen as a response to current political and social concerns. The media was key because it could generate coverage and resonate with audiences. With the help of a media mogul, an artist could establish a following of enthusiastic and engaged fans who would flock to his or her work regardless of where it was produced or performed.

It is a reminder of the power of art and culture to affect change, and of the need for autonomous arts and arts agencies and artists’ collectives to articulate cultural</text>

With their values, interests and place in the community, young people imagined themselves artists, builders or designers with the power to change their place in the world. Some had never worked in the arts before and were completely new to the game. They created engaging websites, produced engaging art projects and staged socially engaged work. The sites were produced in a town hall style office, basement studio or by the community itself. These were viewed as viable options if the Arts Council were to fund a place as culturally responsive as the town hall or basement studio.  The challenge was to revitalise a community ‘through locally-rooted ‘recruitment and retention mechanisms’6 and to ‘empower local stakeholders through a culture of renewal’7 (Curtis Cable, The Art of Not Being Governed, 1983).
