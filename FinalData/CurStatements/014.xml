It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the nature of the art museum, and the biennial is no exception. The art was once seen as an object of contemplation, now it is a consumable commodity. The biennial is no longer a curatorial proposal, it is a distributive enterprise that produces tangible and far-reaching changes through its operations, and through its collections. The curatorial, educational and institutional work of the biennial is now something that it is possible to do with both hands, as a producer and a consumer. It is possible to engage in both the production and consumption of the art form, and yet not to be engaged in either. This brings us to the art fair. The biennial has moved from the museum to the fairground, and now produces its own changes in the form and content of the biennial. The fairground has moved from the museum to the street, and now supports a completely different operation of the biennial that is ecologically sustainable and socially beneficial. The biennial has moved from the</text>

It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the work of many people: curators, artists, researchers, journalists, artists' associations, historians, archivists, material collectors, art dealers, collectors, collectors' groups, artists' unions, architects, urbanists, journalists, urbanists, philosophers, anthropologists, political scientists, artist-organisations, journalist-folk, artists, writers – to name only some of the diverse types of people with whom we have in common. We do this work because we want to, because it is important to our work, because it engages with our values and because it is interesting and because it makes us laugh. It is partly because we do it because we believe in it, partly because we believe we owe it to it, and mostly because we believe it is the right thing to do.This is the biennial in its current form: it is a multi-year project that engages with themes of the past and seeks to produce new ones. In the past, biennials have tended to</text>

It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the curatorial approach of making, and it is this interconnection between art and community that has been a hallmark of the Biennial since its beginnings in 2003. In that time, the curatorial office has often been a place of encounter, where art is experienced as an experience and social interaction, not as a commodity or a commodity with a standardized value. The curatorial approach to the biennial has often been a place of resistance, where the mission of the biennial is often confused with the mission of the local arts organization or the museum. I would argue that the biennial as an art-historical-cultural formation is often confused with the kind of museum that would actively foster and facilitate those encounters between art and communities it represents. The kind of museum that would actively foster and facilitate such encounters would be a museum, but that is very rare. The kind of museum that would actively foster and facilitate those encounters between art and communities it does not represent would be a community arts organization, but that is</text>

It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the work of making, and making it regularly engages with and produces the meaning of the event through symbolic, archival and documentary means. We do this through what the Biennial Commission calls a ‘story-based' programme, taking the form of interactive multimedia works that tell a ‘larger story’ than the art exhibits or the website might suggest. These interactive narratives are not stand-alone works of art, but rather draw upon the strengths of different media to tell a ‘larger picture’. The stories told are not necessarily stories told by a specific community, but rather samples from a wider ‘community of stories’. We do this through storytelling traditions ranging from folk tales to memoirs to non-fiction books to non-fiction podcasts to interactive online narrative programmes to non-fiction journals to non-fiction television programmes to non-fiction radio dramas to non-fiction films to non-fiction stage productions to non-fiction video works to non-fiction stage productions and</text>

It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the way in which biennials should engage with their social and political context – and perhaps this is the only way in which they can. There is no one true way to engage with and produce meaning through art, and the reason why biennial collections – which are so prominent in the US and Europe today – appear to be in a constant state of flux, constantly on the cusp of crisis and regeneration, and prone to periodic relaunches – is due to the fact that art today is a social commodity, and so its value necessarily derives from its social production, its social effects and its historical condition. Consequently, art today is neither completely nor entirely social. It produces its own meaning and function, and so it is difficult to pinpoint a concrete or ideal form of art today that all artists should adopt and that all artists can be proud of.Art today increasingly dominates all other types of cultural consumption. It is a social commodity, and so is everywhere signified with a capital A or B, whether</text>

It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the broader meaning of the term ‘biennial’. It denotes a particular kind of temporality – a particular kind of local temporality – that is distinct from, but connected to, but different from, contemporaneous cultural contemporaneity. It conveys both a given and an ongoing relationship to, or an infinite regress of possibilities or futures. It is a kind of ‘present’ in the temporal order. When the biennial is no longer an institution, but a dynamic happening that is divorced from and beyond the institutional forms, but allows for the creation of new forms, it is a kind of event that is no longer ‘in’ or ‘out’ of the chronological order, but can instead be described as ‘in’ or ‘out’ of the present. It is a kind of event that is no longer grounded in a particular historical or cultural context, but is instead capable of existing in any temporal order. It is a kind of</text>

We have all been invited to be part of a jury, which will decide on the next stage of the event. The event will be named in honor of a city, after all. There is a $50,000 cash prize for the most innovative design in the exhibition, and the full design will be on display for two years. The show will be curatorial, educational and cultural in nature. The names of the artists chosen for the next instalment will be announced in a public survey that will be conducted in 2017-18. The survey will include over 1,000 local residents and art professionals. The top five designs will be used as examples for three new works of art, one of which will be a new design of an existing building. The design will have a new purpose and be a response to the question, ‘what could a contemporary building possibly be made out of?�</text>

It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the curatorial approach to the biennial. It is not a new concept, but it is the way we are approaching it, in an effort to produce meaning through what is usually described as ‘representational journalism’. This is a form of journalism that is increasingly common in the United States, and it involves gathering information from diverse sources, often in a neighborhood, in order to present that neighborhood to audiences outside of the neighborhood. In other words, the reportage of the neighborhood.  The event entails a curatorial approach to the event that is grounded in the traditions of the museum, but also relies on new media and communications technologies. It is an event that is mediated through symbolic actions and narratives, and it is a prototypicon of what the local community may aspire to be.  The biennial may be defined as a ‘recurrent pattern of cultural exchange between nations or local groups, especially those with histories of resistance, that often happens in the pages of a book, magazine or</text>

It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the biennial we are creating, and it is a work in progress. We will continue to add stories, learn more about the communities who make up the city and discover more about the neighbourhoods that are part of the biennial. We will also expand the event to take into consideration the needs and dreams of the local artists who will be participating in the biennial, offering them greater access to the curatorial and artistic resources of the city. Art and artists will participate in building a better future for the people of Liverpool, and this is a global art project.Biennials are art projects that arise out of the curatorial (or curatorial) thinking of a city or a region. They are not curatorial interventions, but rather curatorial actions that happen to be happening in that city or region, and in this case, are the direct outcome of the thinking of, and actions of, the artist(s) who are part of the curatorial team. The idea of art as a social action</text>

It is a place to be a face of the local artworld, and ultimately a place to offer the biennial a future.This is the work of making, and it is as such the work of many hands in many different places. The art is made visible in different ways, and the stories told are numerous and rich, but they are made visible through different means. The fact that all these different means were put together in the same space – made visible through art, textiles, logos, street art – made the encounter between artist and curatorial user – which was, in turn, made visible through the fact that all the different artists and curatorial users happened to be in the same room. And this was true for any number of biennials, but the manner in which they were produced, the kinds of stories they made and the kinds of images they produced were in fact often radically opposed to the ways in which the artworld or the curatorial might engage with and produce art. Evidence of this can be seen in the art fairs that occurred in the years immediately following the biennial, as well as in the overt promotion</text>

The themes and schemes of the programme may be combined to form a ‘suspect subject matter’. This is one of the many ways in which biennials are both proto-institutes and indicators of the changes to come.L.A. Biennial is the first art institution to be established in Culver City, and the first to offer regular programming in the arts, culture, and heritage of Los Angeles. The Biennial form has been around for some time in Culver City, but is now widely observed in other parts of the city. It is a ‘culture industry’ organisation, with an annual budget of ‘$500,000 CAD and a mandate to lead the ‘cultural regeneration’ of the city. The department heads of the biennial organisations in other parts of the country have different priorities and bodies of expertise, but generally follow the same priorities and have the same bodies of expertise.

The themes will be derived from and developed through the historical works and curatorial strategies of the Biennial, their development and reception today; and the art &amp; the city project, which seeks to develop a shared understanding between the artists and art administrators of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The artists and art administrators will be led by the architects and principal figures from the programme, including the trustees of the LA Biennial, whose appointment has been withdrawn.

    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is set to open with a public programme of installations, public ensembles and performances. The programme is being jointly curated by L.A. Biennial, Cultural Capital L.A. and H.E.R.S.S.A., the biennial organisation jointly run by and for the Arts Council of the United Kingdom, and commissioned by H.E.R.S.S.A. and L.A. Biennial. The main programme of musical acts and ensembles is being developed by L.A. Biennial in collaboration with H.E.R.S.S.A. and Cultural Capital L.A. The main objective of the programme is to celebrate the strengths and achievements of L.A. Biennial, drawing on its rich tradition, contemporary art and rich curatorial heritage.The programme will be based on three main themes: the city of Los Angeles, its history and its present; the Biennial form and its discontents; and biennial as a mode of cultural circulation and cultural production. Each theme will have a number of episodes, each of which will be a ‘cornerstone’ of the overall ‘curatorial strategy’ of the overall ‘L.A. Biennial’. The episodes will be selected according to their global relevance and historical importance. Here, they will be placed into three broad categories: the biennial as a curatorial strategy, the biennial as a form of cultural circulation and cultural production, and the biennial as an event that produces and depends on circulation. The categories will be mutually exclusive and subject to modification. The only objective of the programme will be to place the arts and culture in their historical and contemporary context.This may mean, for example, organising the episodes according to a theme from the ‘New Cultural Theory’ journal, or organising them according to a single artist’s particular cultural and historical turn. The idea of flow might be helpful</text>

The themes and elements of the programme may be combined or segregated according to their relevance to the city or their separate situations. The programme may be produced according to an artistic director’s creative vision for the year, or according to an artistic director’s current creative sense. The elements of the programme may be grouped or independently arranged according to their relevance to the city. The aim of this initiative is to create an environment in which the creative thought of each artist and each biennial can be expressed in an accessible and meaningful way.For this to happen, the Biennial needs to be able to effectively coordinate its activities across different sites in and around the world. It is essential that the organisation maximises the exchange of ideas and expertise across different locations, and that it maintains a continuous flow of new ideas and expertise throughout the world. The exchange of ideas and expertise is facilitated by the exchange of different kinds of people – ideas, observations, suggestions, arguments – which can</text>

As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention takes place in ‘the gallery’, where artists and art institutions gather to exchange ideas and exchange different perspectives on art’s contemporary situation. It is a place where artists can ‘present their work and get it considered’; it is a ‘place to build relationships’; it is a place to exchange ideas and build mutual understanding. It is a city-wide event, and as such it operates on a similar logic to the New York Museum of Art’s, although this time the gallery is the site of a ‘curatorial’ programme that is driven by a commission-winning curator. Here, the gallery-world intermingles with the city-space, and as such it operates at a distance, often interacting with the city in an informal but powerful way. There is an awareness of the city's cultural resources, which is also evident in the curatorial approach. The Aga Khan Gallery is a site for the exchange of</text>

It could also be seen as a collective action on the part of a city-wide art school and the gallery, in that each participant occupies a unique place in the city. As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention is also taking place in the Art Basel, but with a contemporary curatorial approach. The assumption, of course, is that the participants will be able to find places to live and work in the city again, and that the art school will be able to continue to provide them with the kind of support it needs to continue to work. In the context of this kind of curatorial intervention, the participants are not here to find permanent solutions but to figure out how to live creatively again, and to be creative in the ways in which that is now possible for them to be creative again.In both the case of the city-wide curatorial intervention and the more ‘humanistic’ aspects of its work, the kind of ‘art’ that is being worked in the city is always going to be a long way removed from where it is in the country, and so even though the language of art is different, the underlying dynamics of the relationship between language and art are</text>

It could also be seen as a collective action on the part of a city-wide art school and the gallery, in that each participant occupies a unique place in the city. As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention is local, taking place locally. The role of the gallery and the city in this context shifts from being a static space (the museum) to one in which materials and methods are dynamically embedded in social formations and processes. The Aga Khan Gallery was able to expand its activities through the art of its participants, providing them with resources and organising their activities around this materiality. A small cadre of artists and art professionals then stepped in to take over the curatorial role as a co-operative, whereby individual participants established collective rights through the Aga Khan Collective. This was seen by some as an influence of the new media and social media, which encouraged ‘institutional creators’ to create alternative contexts and to seek wider audiences. Nevertheless, this kind of curatorial intervention is fundamentally different from that of a museum or a large institution, because it is discretionary, reducing the focus to the artist(s) and their work, and it is not based on a formal programme or specified</text>

It could also be seen as a collective action on the part of a city-wide art school and the gallery, in that each participant occupies a unique place in the city. As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention occurs at the same time as a whole series of exhibitions, symposia and other exhibitionary forms are being developed and altered in the city. During this kind of process, the very nature of the curatorial intervention is contested and altered – an intervention that is neither here nor there. Rather, the very act of intervention is contested and interpreted. And this kind of intervention is always – in an attempt to some extent – opposed by the very people who are invited to take part in it.  This kind of curatorial intervention could not only be seen as a counterintuitive and potentially destabilising development, but it could also be seen as a blessing. It declared who was truly in charge of the city, claiming sole responsibility and supreme authority, while simultaneously placing artists in a situation where they could exert influence over the very social, political and cultural destinies of the city in a way that they did not previously. This is a ‘big-picture’ kind of curatorial intervention</text>

As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention is taken as a given in contemporary art, and it is also the case that in the contemporary art world, this kind of curatorial intervention is taken for granted. But the fact that art schools and galleries are setting up in the city at an increasingly rapid pace in an attempt to respond to this kind of urban curatorial intervention raises the possibility that, for the first time in history, this kind of curatorial intervention may become a defining feature of the contemporary art experience – a quality that is now considered both a result and an asset of the contemporary urban condition.

As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention is also taken place at the Aga Khan Gallery, but the curatorial intervention here is more extensive and protracted. The main objective of this kind of curatorial intervention is to produce a curatorial effect through a particular artwork or a specific exhibition, whereas the kind of artistic production here is much more diffuse and eventful. Nevertheless, in the context of the curatorial process, the artist is still actively engaged in her or his work, and this is another way of putting it. It is very real.Although the relation between the artist and the gallery in the way that the artist engages with the viewer is very direct and visible, there is another crucial difference between the two: the artist has the last word, and no one else has any rights. This is why the Aga Khan Gallery decided to leave the city and to open an independent gallery in the mountains nearby. It is also why the Aga Khan Foundation withdrew its invitation to the artist to create a new art space in Istanbul.</text>

As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention is curatorial in nature, and in that sense is being driven by the artist, his group, and the gallery as a whole. The central question that emerges is – what is the relationship between the artist, his gallery, and the community? In other words, what is the potential impact of this kind of curatorial intervention on the ground rules and institutional frameworks of the city?  Knowing and Talking About Community Art Question 2: How Can an Individual or a Group of Artists Be Involved in a Project? 	The first project I started was a year and a half ago in November 2012 at the Aga Khan Gallery in Toronto. The purpose of the project was to bring together a group of artists from around the world to work in parallel with each other, using 3D modelling and printing to bring together disparate community members to work together towards a common goal.

It could also be seen as a collective action on the part of a city-wide art school and the gallery, in that each participant occupies a unique place in the city. As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention is global in nature; it is not local in character. The reason for this is that the introduction of new technologies and innovations invariably bring with them changes in the way in which art is produced and consumed, and these changes render old art into new art forms. New social media and online media paradigms are a prime example of this kind of curatorial intervention, which is global in character but tends to obscure or negate old media forms – which is one reason why art students are in high demand. New media do not produce new art, but they can act as agents of cultural consumption, which is one way in which the gallery is a crucial node in the curatorial forest. In this sense, the gallery and its curatorial workflows are a direct descendant of their historical conditions. This is why the introduction of new media and social networking sites in art’s early history was a critical event in the history of the art form. It generated a new form of art production that was</text>

As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention is curatorial in nature and is not located in a museum or gallery building. It is a kind of ‘curation of time’, like nature herself, but much more powerful. The biennial as a curatorial intervention is often underestimated and under-studied, perhaps because it is so ubiquitous. It is the curatorial version of a TED talk, and the curatorial version of a community gathering. It is a kind of interlocutor, intervening between people and objects, gathering information and ideas, and making known what another might wish to conceal or erase. It is an object of cultural exchange between cultures, objects, and worlds, and it is an object of desire, possession, and control. But it is also a kind of mediation and constraining mechanism, constantly reminding us that it is also a kind of community of citizens, bound together by shared experiences and desires. It is a kind of cultural capital, and in the age of the biennial, that is</text>

As the name suggests, this kind of curatorial intervention is collective, and thus the installation is a ‘placeholder’ – a building that can be ‘reclaimed’ by others. In other words, its use merely repeats an existing artworld hierarchy of access, but with a city-wide curatorial intervention. The intention is to generate new political and social interactions between the city and its artists and the city and its infrastructure, in the hope that this can lead to new forms of urban mobility and collective creativity. In my opinion, this kind of ‘in-the-round’ factor is essential for such initiatives to have real, transformative effects. Otherwise, the art school and the gallery become mere objects of exchange, and the biennale becomes merely another iteration of the museum. In my opinion, the introduction of art schools and the gallery into the urban context was a mistake, and part of the broader issue with cities at the time is that they contain powerful incentives for cultural insularity.

It is the oldest and most prestigious organisation of its kind in Portugal, and it is run by a board of directors elected by the board. It has a unique statutory charter that gives it exclusive legislative, social and cultural powers. It is a not-for-profit organisation, incorporated in Portugal's National Archive (2004), and its board of directors is elected every five years. It is a public organisation, with a mission to foster a shared understanding between artists and the communities they work with. It promotes dialogue with stakeholders through projects and programmes, and provides opportunities for artists to engage with stakeholders through activities such as exhibitions and residencies. It is an essential part of the institutionalisation of visual culture in Portugal. 	[i] David Hanc</text>

In that case, the rise of the biennial would mean little in the way of major institutional change, except that the many individuals who compose the institution would become many or none at all. That is, the many discrete acts of art produced by such organisations would become part of a much broader whole. Such a change would hardly address a need, but would instead signify a new kind of understanding and new mode of engagement. Such is the  	logic of the biennial.

In the age of the biennial, perhaps it is even more important that institutions of art and visual culture should be responsive to the collective needs and collective behaviours of society.  	The biennial has always been a recognisable set of distinctive artist’s names and images, and has been so even during the 1980s and 1990s when the art market was in its infancy, creating a level of visibility and value that had to be countered by a strong market force and the military junta. The biennial, even if it has become something of a museum, is still an organisation that produces and distributes art. It remains a producer of art, and art is still art (unless art is produced in a socially destructive way, as in the case of genocide or apartheid, and art is then generally recognised as socially destructive when it occurs outside of a socially destructive context).  	The ADDA launched a campaign to have the Associa de Visual Artes renamed to honour the victims of the Museo do Museo do Lisbon, a neo-classical Portuguese art museum that was destroyed in 1991, in an attempt to reclaim the name and image of the institution. The decision was controversial,</text>

In the age of the biennial, perhaps it is even more important that institutions of art and visual culture should be responsive to the collective needs and collective behaviours of society.  	The biennial has always been a recognisable set of distinctive artist’s names and images. It was always an institution that draws its institutional resources from a particular location and time – predominantly its home city and its regional museums – though it has also featured nationally and even internationally. The name comes from the first convention of the American artist convention, in San Francisco, in 1854. There were five of these in New York, but after the first came to a close in Chicago, the second ended – with the city hosting the second – and the other three came to a close in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Society has tended to define the biennial as a response to this particular set of resources, but the biennial has also tended to define the society that it seeks to serve. Its resources, clearly, are not in the city, but in the suburbs, the rural centres and the smaller towns that it builds around itself. And these are the resources that create the biennial. The biennial, then, seeks to serve these resources</text>

In the age of the biennial, perhaps it is even more important that institutions of art and visual culture should be responsive to the collective needs and collective behaviours of society.  	The biennial has always been a recognisable subset of the museum, and the museum has always been a recognisable subset of the urban. It’s a ‘broader set of museums’ that are in turn ‘ficto-mural’ and ‘mural-like’ and are interested in the ways in which art is produced in and through the urban environment. It’s not obvious in many museums, and certainly not in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which concentrates on the city as an object of art. It’s not obvious in most biennials either, but it is on this one: the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Venice have generally curatorial approaches to art and visual culture that are much more interested in the preservation of images than the presentation of them.  	When the Venice Biennale was initially proposed in 1996, the idea that images should be able to communicate meaning through their structure and their images seemed absurd to</text>

It’s this division that the artist Terry Smith describes as the ‘absence of space’.[26] The biennial, as a curatorial gesture, exhibits a great deal of knowledge about itself, but little of the other, more proximate kinds of cultural activity that it exhibits. Curators have a way of identifying the latter, more proximate forms of cultural activity that actually do take place. This is why biennials tend to exhibit a very particular kind of cultural tourism, whereby art is brought into being through the medium of art – specifically, art that is not identified with the institution or the city in which it is exhibited. This kind of ‘cultural tourism’ is the kind that takes place in countries with a highly visible art market, such as the USA and the UK, but also in countries without a strong, significant art market, such as Russia and</text>

In the age of the biennial, perhaps it is even more important that institutions of art and visual culture should be responsive to the collective needs and collective behaviours of society.  	The biennial has always been a recognisable set of distinctive artist’s names and images, but it seems to me that the ‘biennial’ of the twenty-first century ought to be distinguished from the ‘biennial of any previous century’ and ought to be a ‘global phenomenon’.  	In the twentieth century, the ‘biennial’ was a ‘unique cultural phenomenon’ that transcended national boundaries and cultures, and so one could say that the biennial of the twenty-first century is a ‘genuine’ event, and so on.  	But maybe what we  	need are ‘global phenomenologies’ that map onto local and regional forms and that can be understood as worlds in their own right. That would make them  	different from the biennial of any previous century, and would make them art over the long term.  	I don’t think that has been done yet,</text>

In the age of the biennial, perhaps it is even more important that institutions of art and visual culture should be responsive to the collective needs and collective behaviours of society.  	The biennial has always been a recognisable set of distinctive artist’s names and images, but it is the emergence of a body of work from the artist’s studio and its contribution to a biennial that has become mandatory.  	It is no longer sufficient for the institution to produce and institutionalise an artist’s work; it is vital that the work find an audience, and that the work find ways of engaging with and in, and contributing to, society.  	In the 1980s and 1990s, the biennial produced work that was relevant in its own right, and in that of other artists in the art world.  	However, it is now an institution that is largely self-sufficient, and its output is increasingly random and variable, rather than systematically produced and recognisable. Its mission statement, adopted in 1991, is no longer a statement of priorities, but rather a formula for a biennial to be produced – and perhaps for the form to change (the formula remains</text>

In the age of the biennial, perhaps it is even more important that institutions of art and visual culture should be responsive to the collective needs and collective behaviours of society.  	The biennial has always been a recognisable set of distinctive artist’s names and images. It is an identifier of a specific art form that has been developed in relation to and through society – a set of distinctive practices, a set of distinctive aesthetics, and a set of distinctive aesthetics combined. It is a kind of container (or commodity) that holds and conceals something else, but which nevertheless provides and conceals access to a certain kind of experience. Biennials are, today, often more like exhibitions than like institutions: they are large and visible and engage with issues of identity, fame and fortune; art as commerce (or rather, the moral and political value of being able to access the goods and resources of society in a fairly unrestricted way); art as art (or rather, the economic value of not being counted among the homeless of society); art as political theatre; art as performance; art as social interchange; and art as a kind of performance-art.  	But these are only the visible manifestations of</text>

To some extent, the biennial is the inevitable outgrowth of a society that institutionalises and produces images, and reproduces images across forms of media; that creates, produces and consumes images. It exists because images are images, and images are images because they are forms of communication. But increasingly, the forms of communication we produce and consume demand that images also exist; that images convey meaning and identity in complex, multi-media ways; that images be valued as socially valuable commodities.More and more of what we produce and consume is mediated through images. Image macros, viral images, Instagram feeds and Facebook boards are the platforms of the social media era, and they are where images first find expression and first social worth. But the value of an image today</text>

Anyway, around this time last year, I started The Resident, which is a kind of hybrid magazine or newspaper or radio form.

I think it’s a kind of a hybrid. I think it has its own kind of rhythm, its own way of reporting on the world. It’s very evocative, and I love the way that art is often presented as an object of inquiry: as a question that needs answering, a problem to be solved, a problem to be tackled. And I do think there’s a tension there: the fact that it’s being done by an artist who is also an art historian, and art critics, critics and artists’ friends and fans, means that there’s a tension there. But I also think over the years that the project has sort of fallen victim to its own momentum, and that there’s this sense of inevitability that’s built into the project: that somehow this is all going to happen. There’s this sense of ‘this is what we’re all going to be made into’ or ‘this is what we’re all going to become’ or ‘this is what our friends and family are</text>

I think it’s a kind of a hybrid. I think it has its own kind of rhythm, its own way of reporting on the world, and that’s interesting, because it is the one place where we don’t often talk about the way in which we live, and that is: living in the moment, constantly scanning the news, looking at data, constantly looking at trends and what’s happening in the world. But it’s interesting that our sense of what makes us unique and special and unique in the world is what comes out of nothing more than the things that we are taught to identify with. The fact that we are not born with that sense of what makes us unique and special and unique is what I like to think of as the mark of a precariat. 	I think that conceptually speaking, to look at trends and data is to understand that something is different now than it was five years ago, and so one could even say that there’s a change of pace going on. I do think that there’s a difference between what we, as</text>

It’s a hybrid form that’s useful in its own right. The question is whether this journal can find the time to sustain that kind of form, and whether it can find the time to consider and compose works that reflect the particular requirements of the city it lives in. I think it can.To me, the answer to both those questions is a resounding yes! The question becomes whether the time and place are right for that journal to inhabit. I think it’s important for the publication of the journal to reside in a city, to exist in a particular cultural context, to be present in a particular temporal zone, and to be responsive to local needs and desires. I don’t think it’s right for the journal to be a repository of ideas from many different viewpoints, or to propagate various ideologies simultaneously. I think it�</text>

I think it’s a kind of a hybrid. I think it has its own kind of rhythm, its own way of reporting on the world. But it also has a kind of a fractured rhythm, with sections that are written by the readers and sections that are edited by the curator or other curators. And so there is this sense of reflection, this sense of episodic ‘reflection’ that runs through the publication, and it’s this episodic sense of time that runs through the pages. It’s a kind of a hybrid that carries over into the exhibition business, because the essays and the chapter and the digest are the same for both biennials and for museums.  At the same time, the essays and the chapter and the digest are made up of several different people from different places, and so they’re a kind of a living document of a city or a region, with different voices from different times. But they’re also made up of various ideas, and so they’re a kind of a living document of a city or a region, with</text>

I think it’s a kind of a hybrid. I think it has its own kind of rhythm, its own way of reporting on things, its own way of constituting, of staging, of inhabiting, of engaging with. And I’m interested in the hybrid aspect because, in a way, this is what I look for in a work: a way of doing that work that challenges my limits, that seeks to be imagined as art but also as a kind of documentation of the world we live in. What I mean by that is, how do we as artists inhabit the very real things that happen to us and in so doing, makes us vulnerable in ways that are difficult to quantify or conceive of? 	The way that the biennial is structurally constituted, and the way in which each institution that supports the biennial is organised, is this: the biennial is a ‘magazine’ with a number of overlapping and overlapping series of issues that range in subject matter from the personal to the social to the natural and take place over a long period of time. Each issue of the journal is</text>

I think it’s a kind of a hybrid. I think it has its own kind of rhythm, its own way of reporting on the world. 	So there I was, a year into The Resident, and we were having a conference in Liverpool about the place of cultural capitals, and the ways in which a cultural capital is made. And we were thinking about how to connect the place of a cultural capital to its people. I was wondering what the word ‘causality’ meant in relation to what we were doing. Because I’m not convinced that we had taken the concept of causality very literally. I don’t think that the place of a cultural capital is made up of coincidences or randomness or random happenstance. The place of a cultural capital is made up of people. And when we started to think about how we connect the people to the place, and to the processes of making the place, we realised that what made the place make sense in relation to what we were doing in Liverpool was that we were both living in the same city. We’d both</text>

I think it’s a kind of a hybrid. I think it has its own kind of rhythm, its own way of reporting on the world, and so it is a kind of reflection of the world as it is happening. And yet it is also a kind of a recipe for disaster, because, as we all know, disaster is inevitable if we don’t take urgent measures to alter the underlying dynamic of the planet. So we have this cycle of catastrophe, and every time we have to start all over again, which brings on this cycle of catastrophes. Now, there are ways of transforming this ticking disaster into something more aesthetically pleasing and perhaps even informative, such as by redesigning infrastructure or creating new cities, but in the end it is the ticking that is the problem. We can make it less threatening by creating new energy resources or even better, by simply not existing at all. But there is no way of stopping, or even understanding, the inexorable nature of capitalism. And so for all of these reasons, and more, I started The Resident, which is not a news or commentary form,</text>

I think it’s a kind of a hybrid. I think it has its own kind of rhythm, its own way of reporting on life. It’s very difficult to define, but I think ‘we, the audience, are what define the episode.’ Which is interesting, I’m interested in this notion that the audience is what defines the ‘episode’, and the audience is the point where the work becomes political. I don’t see it that way. I think the audience is interesting in that it has a construction that it imposes, and it imposes that construction at various levels. The political dimension is imposed by a specific context and agenda, and the audience is that organ of the complex that carries the weight of the society, and so it’s a ‘huge, broad group of people’ who decide what is politically possible and what is not. And so there is an interesting point where the audience, having been put off by the political aspect of the situation, finds a way to get at the much more intimate (but also much more malle</text>

I think it’s a kind of a hybrid. I think it has its own kind of rhythm, its own way of reporting on the world. And the thing is, the more time that passes, the more things that can’t be on the page or in print or in-depth, the more time that’s spent on reflection – this is a very abstract but vital point – and the more we spend reflecting on our lives, the more we lose our ways of seeing the world. So reflection is a kind of a luxury that we don’t really have. We spend quite a bit of time doing things in our heads, wishing we could just slumber away and forget about the world. But when we do that, we also lose sight of the things that really matter – the things that bring us joy, bring us meaning and meaning in life – and so we need to be actively engaged in regaining that abstract quality and making it meaningful again, even if that’s what this journal is about. 	Now, reflecting back to when I first started working at the Daily Mirror, I</text>

There’s a kind of a implied commission process that happens between the artefact and the visitor, and the visitor and the artefact. And there’s a kind of a cultural negotiation that takes place between the visitor and the Traveller. And I get emails from people like: ‘This is a great idea!’ And they’re like: ‘This is a cultural negotiation?’ And they’re like: ‘This is fantastic and all, but what did you expect?’  So there’s that kind of cultural negotiation. And there’s the point where the visitor arrives and the artefact and the visitor’s presence is felt, and the artefact doesn’t get stuffed in with everything else. The important thing is that the visitor experiences the visit in a way that</text>

The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit its globalisation opportunities, and its important institutional roles, but which also needs to draw on its strengths and develop alliances with cities at large. It needs to have a cultural dimension to its activities, and it needs to take root in their cultural landscapes and histories. The biennial format has its limits and its complex set of forces, but it is the final set of conditions that determine the trajectory of art's future. The biennial format is here to stay. It is the ultimate exhibition format, and it is here to stay.

City forms emerged early in the ‘episodic’ structure of biennials. They became structural elements in the social and cultural life of the city, but their realisation as elements of the city was a work in progress. The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit, and in that process it creates a new class of art patrons, who are wealthier and more powerful than the artists who compose it. The biennial today exploits the infrastructure of the city, and in that process exploits an ever larger and more diverse audiences, who come to see what it means to be urban. Although the biennial may claim to be a curator-led art form, it is also true that the biennial has become a site of displacement. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the biennial could be a place of refuge for city dwellers in crisis. It occurred to me that the key to the biennial’s current success is in part a political one. The biennial is an art form that thrives on the political, and the political play is through the art form itself. Biennials have an undeniable commercial orientation, and their commercialism is defined in large measure by the ability to connect with a large and diverse audience. But that commercialism is also a</text>

City forms emerged early in the ‘episodic’ structure of biennials. They became structural elements in the social and cultural life of the city, but their realisation as elements of the city was a work in progress. The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit its art-historical and archival resources, and that seeks to use the art as a political tool in the service of the social. In doing so, it often engages with the boundaries between art and the social. In these ways, biennials can be seen to play multiple roles. They can be forms of cultural exchange between different social groups, or they can be the social systems that enable certain social groups to inhabit other classes of space. In either case, they are forms of cultural exchange between different social groups. So, it is a question of who is in and who is out. The form that the biennial takes today is a &quot;street level’ venue, where people show their socialness, and so it is often said. ‘My space is a biennial. I’m at the top of the hill.’' As the story goes, the story of the hill. There is a simple yet powerful way to understand this kind of socialising through</text>

The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit, and the art form that has obligations to those that are drawn to it. It is a ‘platform’ that offers a public platform on which artists can publicly and unapologetically present the politics of displacement, displacement-masquerading, and the politics of destruction that characterise contemporary urban life. It is a ‘toolkit’ that enables the artist to analyse and critique contemporary urbanity, but it is also a ‘game-changer’ in the design and production of infrastructure, rendering the city both inhabitable and non-existent without providing any kind of intrinsic value or meaning to that particular form. It is to be expected that the biennial will experience some kind of ‘profit squeeze’ in the future, as new biennials are drawn inwards, and that, as biennials themselves become more institutionalised, there will inevitably be some conflict as to who is entitled to what.

The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit its institutional and artistic resources, and which can therefore be counted on to use those same resources constructively. It is an art form that exploits the biennial for commercial ends, and which must use those same resources judiciously. It is an art form that demands a certain amount of critical thought, and which, as we all know, many artists do not share.It was not always thus. As we know, the start of the biennial was the publication of the winners of the Foot, Butler &amp; Stoler awards, given out by the Liverpool Biennial to celebrate excellence in its chosen branch.2 The biennial was initially presented as a one-off, an occasional occurrence, and the scholarship winners were selected through a shortlist that included works for exhibition in the main exhibition venue (Granby Four Streets, previously known as the ‘Granby Five Streets’ exhibition venue). The selection process for the next iteration of the biennial was also based on the winners of</text>

City forms emerged early in the ‘episodic’ structure of biennials. They became structural elements in the social and cultural life of the city, but their realisation as elements of the city was a work in progress. The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit, and has the full range of cultural uses (cultural tourism, cultural assimilation, cultural recycling, cultural diversion, cultural diasporangement, cultural absorption, cultural dissimilation, and so on). It is a form of cultural capitalism at its most pervasive, but it is also a form of cultural imperialism that seeks to impose its dialectical relationship to the city on all of us, everywhere, forever. If we do not begin to think about the city as a site of cultural production, and urbanization as a site of cultural consumption, we will always find ourselves caught in the web of cultural consumption, whether we like it or not. The biennial is a form of cultural capitalism at its most pervasive, but also a form of cultural imperialism that endures. The question then becomes which of these two modes of cultural consumption (commercial and ‘social’) will survive in the city? This is a difficult question to answer, partly because there is no one true definition of what constitutes</text>

The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit its institutionalised position, but its organic and structurally mediated roots are deeply embedded in the city’s socio-political and economic life. Biennials today seek to exploit the institutionalised form of art in all its aspects, but they are art forms that are also formative, influential and prescient in their understanding and articulation of the present and future possibilities of urban and localisation. The biennial is a ‘systemic issue’ that is intimately interwoven with the city’s socio-economic development and political systems, but it is also a ‘tendential feature’ of the city that is difficult to define, recognisable and to be able to affect. I begin to sketch the various forms and multiple theories of the city in my tentative and at times flawed opinion, but overall ‘strong sense of place’ emerges through these disparate and co-dependent processes. The biennial remains an essential entry point for artists and art-world visitors</text>

The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit its opportunity, and has the capacity to shape and reshape its mode of artistic production in ways that ripple through the city and the wider region. But it is also an art form that has a social purpose and that is constantly seeking to reconceive its mode of artistic production in ways that maximise social outcomes. The biennial today is a production that is almost sociopolitical in its own way. It is a production that achieves its ends through the interaction of many different kinds of people, places and things – folk performers, journalists, artists, governments, collectors, researchers, politicians, scholars, activists, tourists and everyone in between. It depends on many kinds of people and places, of course. And it is a very particular kind of spectacle. It derives its name from the fact that the archaeological diggers first started digging in earnest in 1993, just as the first ever dugs started in earnest in the nearby city of Basel. The diggers, who were employed by the local town and regional</text>

The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit a specific episodic and ‘episodic’ structuring of the city, and its subsequent commercial, institutional and social activities. It demands a professional art conservator, who is responsible for the art’s long-term sustainability. The biennial as art form is now expanding internationally, but conservatorship is a profession that demands a radically different set of skills and approaches. It is a demanding job, with its own set of values, aims and principles. I will discuss some of these in greater detail in a moment, but first I will refer you to my 2015 book City of Ruins: Corruption, Complexity and the Fight for Public Space in an Urban Crisis, in which I argue that the political and economic entanglements that characterise the city today render its future increasingly uncertain. Following that, I will discuss the role of the conservator in a future post-materialist urbanism. The key conservator is likely to be a researcher, historian, journalist or artist</text>

The biennial today is an art form that has arisen to exploit its institutionalised economic and political power, but it is a ‘constructive citizen science’ that has to address its social impact as a social form. It is a form of art that emerges, articulately or weakly, from the contradictions of a city, but it has to address a city in the same way it addresses a public – a public that is shaped by, but is independent of, the city’s dynamics. Compassionate biennials today seek to understand ‘why’, rather than in order to render a ‘meaningful contribution’ to a city’s future. They are artists, but also policymakers, journalists, activists, and city enforcers – people with a capacity to make a difference. Toward that end, they are often engaged with the politics of gentrification, which is closely related to the politics of displacement, but which is becoming increasingly elusive as a city plays host to more and more refugees, migrants,</text>

    reimagines the curation of a biennial in a way that is attentive to the specificity of the biennial, but also to its complex and growing relationship with cities. We attempt to conceive of the biennial in terms more analogous to museum curating, but also to the museum administrator, who is the point person for the biennial in the UK. I think that the aim of the biennial should be to bring together, as closely as possible, the past, the present and future of a given place and time. In order to achieve this, the biennial has to be able to reckon with its urban and cultural history, which is likely to play a part in its future ‘sculptures’. This is perhaps what the biennial is attempting to achieve, although the problem with its urban and urban-conceptual frameworks is that they tend to separate us from the places where our present and past ‘sculptures’ can reside.

For example, the biennial that I co-curated in San Francisco in 2016 was confronted with the challenge of imagining a future for its future city, which is now a mess of gentrification and run-down housing. While it was attempting this, we – the public, the arts community, the local residents, artists, community organisers and planners – collectively provided the art and organisation that was ultimately successful in unravelling this mess. Art was produced in a city that was – by some estimates – as much a part of the colonial infrastructure as the USA was during the antebellum period. Yet despite this overwhelming historical weight, the art was produced in a city that was also subject to the logic of neoliberalism – which is to say, the excess capacity of the system to absorb and process the enormous amount of cultural output generated by the art market in the age to come. The challenge for the next generation of artists and arts administrators is to learn how to engage with this materiality and to recognise that the art is produced in a particular city and that the art is</text>

For example, the biennial that I co-curated in San Francisco in 2015, while trying to reconcile its urban and urban-conceptual roots, was strained between its urban and ‘modern’ dimensions. Its attempt to reconcile the contradictory resulted in a sculpture that was neither contemporary with its time nor the present, but rather, that is still standing today. In order to reconcile itself to the contemporary urban landscape, the biennial needs to be able to perceive that it is capable of creating new urban formations. In doing so, it must also be able to absorb these into its conceptual framework. In doing so, it can create new ways of inhabiting the city and breaking away from its current condition. All biennials aim to achieve this last condition, and in doing so, they become more like the historical museums that they claim to be: museums that tell the stories of cities. This is why biennials claim to be able to tell ‘the untold’ urban and urban-history stories of the world, and do so in a way that</text>

For example, the biennial that I co-curated in San Francisco in 2015 was split into two parts, the ‘present’ part taking up what had become known as the ‘episodic’ – the time since the artist(s) created the work of art that one instantiates – and the ‘future’ part taking up what is sometimes called ‘postindustrialisation’. While the postindustrial place is certainly a future to which we aspire, it is also possible that the future will be very different from the one we inhabit. Perhaps the best example of this can be found in the form of a city, which is often referred to as ‘the machine’: in the era of the biennial, cities play a large role in generating, but also in managing, what is sometimes referred to as ‘the squeeze’. This is because, while they are ‘living appendages’ of the biennial, but also of other artworks being made elsewhere in the world, they are also</text>

For example, the biennial that I co-curated in San Francisco in 2016, while it had a place, a chronicle of art, a cultural history and an influence as a biennial, was also a place, a place of commerce, a city, a park and a plaza, but none of these are considered essential to the success of the biennial in the UK or in any other country. Moreover, in the US, the biennial is an entity that has its own cultural history and a distinctive set of distinctive characteristics, and while these may be valuable for the purposes of the biennial today, they are of little value in the long run, since the cultural history and distinctive characteristics of the biennial will have created and are continuing to create new ways of living, new ways of interacting and new ways of organising things. In this sense, the biennial is like any other museum, and like any other museum it must be managed in a certain way, but unlike other museums it is not governed by the same kinds of authority today. It is subject</text>

For example, the biennial that I co-curated in San Francisco in 2015 was forced to make a decision about where its exhibition space would be located because, due to a lack of public funds, it could not find a site in San Francisco. The lack of a downtown and the city’s relentless pace of development forced the biennial to make a decision about where its sculpture should be located. It decided to locate its sculpture in an area of San Francisco called the Near East Bay, an area that has recently seen a major influx of development, but which also happens to be a core location for the Aventura Biennale, the world’s largest and most visible of the biennales. The decision to relocate the sculpture meant that it had to be produced on a large scale, and so it did. The sculpture that we mounted on our dome in San Francisco was actually much smaller than it would have been in its current form, so as to be able to be displayed on a city map. Nevertheless, this decision effectively places the public in</text>

For example, the biennial that I co-curated in San Francisco in 2015 was also co-curated in an old warren of converted rundown houses in the city, but in a different part of the city. In San Francisco, the Biennale is essentially a ‘collection of photos’ of the city, taking place in a different world from the one we inhabit. In the old days of the Biennale, the collection was organized around a series of photographs, but as the number of photographs in the exhibition increased, the size of the show became problematic. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the collection was photographed in its entirety, but in 2015, the collection was photographed in a particular order: firstly, as a sequence of photos of the hotel rooms, then the streets surrounding the Biennale, then the buildings housing the Biennale itself. The order in which the photos were taken determines how the photos are arranged in the exhibition. As a result, the order in which the photos are taken in the biennial is</text>

For example, the biennial that I co-curated in San Francisco in 2015 and the one in Liverpool in 2016 simultaneously address the historical importance of the Financial District and the importance of its financial sector in generating and sustaining the biennial experience. In an ideal world, the financial districts would fully engage with the importance of their present and future ‘sculptures’; they would not separate us from the places where our present and past ‘sculptures’ can reside. The challenge for the biennial is to simultaneously ‘present’ the present, but also to ‘reanimate’ and transform the place and time of its visit. In doing so, it can maintain a measure of urbanity, while simultaneously demanding and disclosing what it presents. A biennial with a particular interest in the urban should also strive to expose its inhabitants to as many different forms of urban life as possible, so as to produce a diversity of experiences in and through the place.

For example, the biennial that I co-curated in San Francisco in 2014 was attempting to ‘reanimate’ and merge the various parts of the city into a single whole. In doing so, it was also burying its human aspects underneath the guise of architectural and urban beauty, which is part of its urban-imaginary underpinning. The problem with these ideologies and their buried aspects is that they tend to separate us from the places where our present and future ‘sculptures’ can live, grow and be created. While the contemporary urban and urban-ideological may work to create a new ‘urban terrain’ for the biennial, this does not make it a good or a particularly interesting place to live or to develop knowledge or artistic practice. The issue is one of access and politics, especially in the UK and US. In the UK, the biennial had difficulty obtaining funding because of its urban focus, but now that it has both an arts and a social purpose, funding is increasingly available and political tensions between the biennial</text>

Insofar as settlement and urbanisation create and/or prolong contemporaneity, they are likely to generate questions about the limits of power, creativity and ingenuity in the city. As a curatorial proposition, the question that is raised and the answer to is often ‘yes, yes, yes’. In the case of San Francisco, the ‘yes, yes, yes’ is often ‘yes’. What is at Stake in the City and Its Archetypes?  Every biennial needs an infrastructure and set of relationships with other artworlds and other cultural sectors, and with other economic sectors (including the private sector, which</text>

Its policy of the ‘present’ was clearly perceived as having some kind of pre-temporal character, and the ‘future’ was perceived as something that is inherently ‘different’ in nature.4  This separation and its ongoing impact is one of the tasks of the biennial. It is also one of the aims of this project. The aim of the biennial is to be seen as relevant in the present, both in its conception and in its actuality. In contemporary terms, this means that it has to be present in a form that is both present in the present as a subject (its own ‘present’), and present in</text>

The festival began as a ‘legacy’ of the Second World War (in which the Biennial was triggered), and expanded into a ‘futurist’ enterprise in its own right. It was centred around a series of ‘future cities’ – New York, London and Bucharest – which sought to reconcile the historical and the virtual in the context of a socially and environmentally conscious urban development. The fad of nano-sized molds, pastel-coloured bricks and powderboards that characterized much of the early biennial design looked positively retro. Curators and artists’ colleagues saw an opportunity to intervene in this retro retrograde aesthetic by creating ‘future cities�</text>

It records the ‘moments’ that are captured and archived, and enables the user to scroll through the images. It records the conversations that take place during these moments. The app is not a memory, but a fable: its memory is a fable. These pedagogical models act as inculcators of the present to a specific set of historical moments, while simultaneously allowing the user to progress through time. While the physical and virtual remains of the past are continually subject to change, the constant movement of the biennial as a ‘legacy’ ensures that the representations of the past that emerge from the biennial are always open to interpretation and modification. Although not intended to replace the importance placed on a historically accurate and contextual understanding of Liverpool, the virtual remains of the past are inevitably built upon the temporal remains of the modern world.

The app recorded the movement of people as they visited different parts of the city, in real-time. When used with the pedagogical models in Place3D, the new augmented reality software, visitors could ‘move through time’ using spatial and temporal markers. In this case, the markers were laid out graphically, using digitised images of buildings and public spaces. The spatial and temporal markers were constructed using 3D modelling and printing. The markers could be traced to a single event in the history of the city: the postcard machine was invented in Liverpool and its creator, Andy Warhol, is buried in the city’s Centenary Plaza.⁠ 	The ‘future’ is a time of change, and the chronology of events that can be traced to the event is an event that can nevertheless be changed. In other words, the future has a place in the present, but it doesn’t have the place or the time of the past.</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial took place in September. It was not a major event in terms of both the place and the time of the exhibition, but its status as a ‘legacy’ of the past is a legacy worth preserving. What happened in Liverpool during the Biennial’s first year, and in its second year, is a holding action, in which the legacy of the former world is actively engaged. What can also be done to support the engaging of future visitors is a holding action, in which the city is a site of active recollection. This is done by creating pedagogical models that capture the essence of what was happening in the city at the time. For example, the pedagogical models used for the Liverpool Biennial 2 earlier this year were created around the concept of memory, and the relationship between the physical and virtual. They were called ‘futures’ and were exhibited in a new ensemble of media, including an interactive map application on mobile. The app ‘mournsatoiiseslaam’ (mourns, today) allows you to ‘reanimate’ objects, animals, buildings and more. It records every step of the way, capturing the emotions, sounds and smells of the area as you recreate them. The process ‘re-creation’ is deeply engrained in the biennial’s DNA. It is a feature and a bug of the museum, but also a wild card, a purposeful creation of the visitor. The biennial must address the cultural practices of the city in order to be able to sustain the significant financial commitments it takes to establish itself. Therefore, the museum is the place where the art is, and the artefacts are made permanent. But how do the cultural institutions work together to create and facilitate the feeling of presence needed for permanent change? This is a crucial interconnection point for the biennial to understand. The biennial must be able to engage with and participate</text>

The app allows users to create ‘futures’ by placing images of places along a conceptual trajectory. Images can be placed anywhere along the visual track, and the location of an image can be determined using GPS. These images are then processed by the software and stored in the cloud. From the perspective of the biennial’s operating budget, these images were a small part of an annual agenda that often placed a great deal of emphasis on research and development, and on the potential of new media to bridge the digital divide. At the time, this was often attributed to the ‘institutional memory’ of the museum, which could process the images and generate the understanding of place and movement across a network of streets and cities. But this memory is increasingly being challenged by the constant movement of data and the constant need for connectivity. Digital memory is being revolutionised by the inescapable nature of the information society produces and the inescapable nature of the biennial. In the biennial</text>

The app allowed visitors to ‘pin’ their futures to a wall or post in an urban setting, and ‘snap’ their memories to a wall or post in a rural setting. The format of the exhibition was also digitally-mediated. That is, the artifacts from the exhibition were placed in digital artifactsues, and the digital modes of archiving and memory emerged as an alternative to the traditional media of archiving and memory.In the case of the biennale itself, the relevance of this dynamic is further demonstrated by the fact that the biennale itself declared its intention to re-present a sequence of works from the first year, ‘a snapshot of a snapshot’.[5] If this is a static form of memory, then there is no alternative to the biennale itself, which continuously adds to and extends its snapshot. As biennials become more and more autonomous, and as new generations of visitors arrive, the historical interest that the biennial had in the</text>

This is similar to the pedagogical models used in the former Envision Project, created in 2006, which recorded the movement of people and objects in New York during the 1990s, and in the 2011 New Media Museum’s ‘Performer’ project, which records the movement of people and objects in San Francisco during the 2011–12 academic year. Future and past coincide with each other in time and space, which is to say, they are present in contemporaneity with each other at a given moment in time.‘Present’ is not the same as contemporary, and it is not synonymous with present, but it is one that is constantly in motion.‘Future and past are not static, but they can be understood as having a dynamic relationship.

This imagined ‘back-up’ mechanism allowed the presence of the city in the form of futures to be communicated across the social networks, where it was possible to ‘pin’ yourself to a building, object, public space, or building in the city.’3  This sounds like something straight out of a science fiction novel, but it is becoming increasingly possible that not only will the city be a ‘futures’ in the future, but also that ‘future’ will be a ‘futures’ in the city. That is, the physical and virtual will converge in the future to form what can be termed a city in the making. This is the kind of anticipatory, ‘</text>

These ‘past particulates’ act as stand-ins for objects of interest in the exhibition, and create a vaulted-up, holographic experience. This is in sharp contrast to the more typical, and much more human-scale, ‘present particulates’ found in museums, in which the museum is often portrayed in a reductive or exclusionary way. The ‘future particulates’ in ‘Museums Act 1900’, and later ‘Local Government’ and ‘Partnerships’ formed part of the rationale for the construction of new museums and archives, including in the National Gallery, where the biennale became an entity distinct from the collection of the museum. The early biennales also sought to meet new people – to engage with audiences outside the museum, and to foster connections with local communities. With the</text>

Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, cultural critic. This is an important distinction from contemporary art practices, where the emphasis is on the interaction between artist and audience. Contemporary art requires the engagement and participation of artists in order to produce meaningful cultural impact. However, in the context of urbanisation and development, the interest in the natural or ‘artificial’ cultural comes at a price. The real struggle for the biennial to produce meaningful cultural impact is articulated by Jeffrey Chester, a local resident and artist whose work often utilises the constructed and imaginary political ‘designer’ persona as an instrument to intervene directly in the political system and social fabric of the city. In  	Design Districts, he argues that the biennial form represents a clash between contemporary art practices and the values of contemporary urbanism. Art biennials are expected to produce cultural impacts that are both immediate and long-term. This implies that biennials must produce transformative cultural impacts in the social and political contexts in</text>

The new machine learning programmes were used to analyse large amounts of data, allowing artists and designers to better understand and manipulate the city’s built environment. For example, in the new ‘green wall’ programme developed by the Biennale, materials and building materials are collected from the façades of buildings throughout the city, including from the rooftops of high-rises, to be incorporated into innovative wall systems. 	The role of art institutions in this process is also emphasised. As is the case with many biennials, the emphasis is placed on the interaction between artists, curators, artists’ design firms and artisans rather than institutions such as governments, commercial real estate firms or other dominant power brokers. This is emphasised in the programme’s content, which is often simply described as ‘art’. 	Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, cultural centre. A number of biennials have explicitly stated that they see their real focus as ensuring that ‘human creativity and culture … is actively brought to bear in the production of new social realities … [through the] incorporation of knowledge into cultural mechanisms] … [T]he realisation of this potential is the real [purpose of] the art gallery … [and] the discovery of ways to bring cultural energies into the production of other forms of social goods] … [T]he realisation of this potential will enable the biennale to achieve its stated end, namely the establishment of new cultural zones] … [and] the creation of new social practices] … [W]hen cultural interlocutors, artists, curators, students and artisans gather at the Biennale site, they are encouraged to articulate their cultural identity in relation to the place and time of the exhibition.

Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, cultural organ. In the case of the Biennale, this has often been used to mean the natural environments around Paris, and the in situ cultural practices of the city. 	[1] British Museum, 2017.

Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, cultural or physical benefit of the biennale. From the beginning of its development in the 1970s, the Biennale has emphasized the idea that the only way to truly understand and benefit from the experience is to be present in Barcelona, and participate in the exhibition as an artist or curatorial collaborator. In a few cases, the actual biennale itself could be considered an intervention into the city’s spatial dynamics through the use of its architectural and urban surveyor Assemblage, but these have tended to be programmes designed by, for and in collaboration with the Biennale board. Art is often placed at the centre of the exhibition, but its primary function is to render aural or image resources, and to this end, it is frequently placed in the middle of the visual landscape. The Biennale has traditionally been interested in the city’s architectural and urban fabric, and its varied physical forms, and its role has been to insert a</text>

This is emphasised in the programme’s content, which is often simply described as ‘art’. 	Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, being drawn from the city. This is often applied to the urban environment, but it is also often used in relation to the urban environment, which is often described as being in crisis. The term ‘artesian crisis’ is often used in relation to the urban environment, but little attention is given to the role of the artist, the curatorial administrator, the cultural curator, the planner and the urban politician in this context. The notion of the city is frequently cited as the single most important constraint in the creation of new urban environments. If left unchecked, this constraint can lead to a downfall of urban culture, as in the case of Johannesburg, which was recently described by UNESCO as being on the verge of being destroyed by a combination of its overbuilding and rampant urban sprawl.[8] 	Art is often used as a political tool. In 2008, for example, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Roberta Jacobson, used the US Congress</text>

This is emphasised in the programme’s content, which is often simply described as ‘art’. 	Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, being drawn through the systems they design and develop. Such language is often employed to describe the benefits of ‘natural disasters’ being caused by human activity such as floods, droughts, floods, storms and so forth. 	Artists, including those new to the field, are encouraged to experiment with the idea of disaster as a metaphor. One example given in the programme is the work of Scottish artist Noel Burch, who for many years employed the services of a company called Assemble’s Scottish Heritage Fund (SHF). The aim of this company was to restore and maintain heritage buildings to ensure that the buildings met the codes of engineering practice that dictated that they were of historical aesthetic quality. Burch’s interest in these codes was motivated by a desire to see how such landmarks could be assembled. 	In the programme, artisans and artisans alone are rarely given full involvement. 	There is considerable emphasis on the role of artists</text>

This is emphasised in the programme’s content, which is often simply described as ‘art’. 	Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, cultural site and to map the area around the Biennale site onto maps, infographics, or online real-time infrastructures. This would include ‘natural geographical features’ such as rivers, mountains, seas, and hotspots. The programme also includes a host of interactive ‘mock-ups’ created by the participants and visitors – ‘postcards’ and ‘libraries’ ‘of everything from building material to building interiors to street lights to transport routes and more. The emphasis of the project is shifted from material to immaterial, material to insular and so on. 	Ultimately, the programme is all about the sites, sites, sites of the future city, those regions where computer generated imagery not only maps of the present but also mathematical models of the future urbanisation of urban environments and phenomena. It is a city in the making, but it is also a ‘cloud’ that</text>

This is emphasised in the programme’s content, which is often simply described as ‘art’. 	Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, backflow, in the public realm. This is seen as a way to consider alternative ways of working in relation to the bureaucratic and institutional structures that constantly re-frame and restrict the practices of life in the city. Art is not inherently wrong in its application of formal and terminological criteria, but its inherent illegality, in relation to the institutionalised forms of production and consumption, makes its use in this context problematic. The fictional character Sherlock Holmes is often criticised for his inability to detect subtle forms of fraud and injustice, as well as the institutionalised forms of power that enable and foster such fraud and injustice. However, the use of historical cases and figures as agents of change, in an attempt to imagine a different kind of urbanity, is often based on a misunderstanding or a perversion of the real life and often contradictory real-life choices and actions of many people. 	In the case of the Biennale of Sydney, which is also widely considered to be</text>

This is emphasised in the programme’s content, which is often simply described as ‘art’. 	Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, historical, or mythical origin of a place, or, in the case of a city, its history. This is also true of places that have recently been visited, such as the Cayman Islands. Art is often cited as a mediator between the people who inhabit a place and the places they find familiar. However, it is often difficult to tell the difference between the art expressed in a place and the art implied by an artist’s or designer’s work, or between an artist’s intention and the intended effect. 	Finally, the Biennale has recognised a need to expand its programming. At least since its inception in 1987, the Biennale has been asking its partner organisations to put on different shows each year. These requests have evolved over time, to take into consideration the needs of the different regions around the world. In the case of the 2014 edition, over 1,000 artists, designers, writers and curators from 80</text>

This is emphasised in the programme’s content, which is often simply described as ‘art’. 	Artists are encouraged to experiment with the idea of the artesian, or natural, or �artificial’, or ‘human-made’ building. This is generally understood to mean those materials and technical know-how that can be used to create ‘real’ art, but can also include a range of more conceptual work that seeks to understand how culture impacts on ‘real’ life. While the emphasis in the programme is generally placed on the work of artists and their productions, there is some indication that the curatorial hand is also often on the line between artistically‐oriented and socially engaged work. In the context of the Biennale, the antagonism between the curatorial and the socially engaged works produced after the curatorial intervention is often exploited by the latter to justify a curatorial intervention. This is particularly true of urban and regional curatorial programmes that set out to explain or simulate the socio-cultural phenomena experienced in the city, but which are often implemented without public debate or analysis. Such programmes often act as a filter for or as a rep</text>

    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial will be the world’s largest cultural exchange, but what will become of the artefacts? In a future city, what will be left behind? The Cultural Trajectory 2018 conference, chaired by Gareth Roberts, took place in October 2018 in Liverpool. It was organised by Liverpool Biennial and the Herbert A. Simon Museum, with the support of Historic England and the Turner Prize. The main speaker for this conference was Professor Ambasz, who has been curator of the Turner Prize-certified series The Cultural Trajectory for the Museum of Modern Art, Liverpool.

And so this was going to be the meeting where the image that was being sought was decided, and the decision could either be positive or negative.I think it was going to be a mix of the two. The new biennalisation of the city is the creation of a few fabulously wealthy people, and so there was a sense that the art that was being commissioned was of a lower standard, and that the biennale was going to commission works that were more accessible to people below the poverty line. There was a sense of where the biennale was coming from, and how it was creating its image through the juxtaposition of art and commerce. And so I think that the biennial that we looked at partook in a creative process, and I think that at the time we were celebrating the fact that the biennale was coming to San Diego, and that it was</text>

So there was a very different picture that was being attempted than was intended.And this was the original idea of the Venice Biennale itself: that we would take part in a public act of remembering, and the biennale would be a platform on which to do this. The challenge would be to create something that is both deep and colourful and speaks to a specific time and place, while also meeting the needs and desires of the local community. This was the original idea, and it remains the case to this day.It was always going to be a multi-year process of planning and research, and there was going to be a kind of convergence of different research programmes. I was invited because of my work with the Silk Road project, which was looking at the role of archives in the contemporary economy. So the Biennale was being commissioned by a consortium of companies,</text>

It brought together a cross-section of the community, and it brought together a cross-section of the community’s perspective on the current situation. The fact that it was a community exercise brought a certain amount of resistance, but the trustees’ decision to invite the artists to develop a work around the biennial was a decision that was made with considerable thought and consideration. The decision to invite the artists to engage with the image of the Biennial as a process of survival for the community was also a decision that was made with considerable thought and consideration. I think that the biennial has to be seen as a historically complex project, and the fact that it’s a public figure who comes to inhabit it, who becomes a figure of the community, speaks to the complexity of the project. I think that the fact that it came to be seen as a public figure, who became a figure of the community and the film, speaks to the inevitable complexity of</text>

The artists who had been invited to participate in the Venice Biennale but hadn’t yet been there were invited back, and so on.The meeting that brought about the Biennale opening was going to be very different from the meeting that produced the Biennale itself. The artists who had been invited back to participate in the Biennale were going to be working alongside the new curatorial team led by Paolo Baratta, who was also the Director of the Venezia Biennale. The artists who hadn’t been invited back weren’t going to be able to participate in the new work yet, but they would be able to participate in the art development that would come out of it, while also being part of the curatorial team. This was going to be a one-to-one relationship, because the artists would be developing their own projects independently</text>

The idea was to create a new kind of biennial, one that was both visionary and calculated to fail. This would mean preserving both the art and the social function of the biennial while creating an image of the city that was both timeless and completely false. This was the approach taken by the New Museum in Brooklyn, and the Templeton Fine Arts, who were invited to participate in the Venice Biennale but who chose to remain underground. Their project ‘Lost City’ imagines a future with a huge, open and fascinating archaeological diggings, but also a subterranean society based on subterranean cities and underground economies. It’s a society based on common values, but also on the forced cooperation of a political and legal system that creates a virtual feudalism around the city’s architecture and eminent domain. In other words, it’</text>

The group that emerged was going to be very different from the group that formed the present Board of Governors, and the biennial as an institution is going to continue to evolve, and there are going to be different ways of getting there, and different needs and desires going on. The meeting that took place a year before the Biennial opened was going to be a turning point in that process, because it brought together the artists who had been involved in the project from the beginning, and it brought together some of the more established artists with an entirely new perspective, and that is going to be a biennale tradition.I also remember that the Biennale as a concept was going to be around for a while, and that the first version of the concept was going to be a one-stop shop. It’s the same with curating, although in this case the curating was going to be done</text>

For example, some of the artists who had worked with the Biennale before felt that the new approach was not collaborative enough, and had some resentment about the way the Biennale was being organised.But the meeting that brought the artists together was also going to establish a distinction between the older generation of artists who were involved in the Biennale before, and those new artists who were coming in through the door at the time. This distinction would establish a formal boundary for the new artists to work within, and would allow the establishment of a relationship between the Biennial and the artist(s) who were coming through the door.

And this idea was always going to be controversial, because there are different ways of thinking about art and institutions. But the fact that the biennale was always going to be controversial meant that there was always an open line of communication with the biennial administration, and that there was always a space between the Biennial and the established art scene in the city, because the biennale couldn’t impose its will on the city. It had to negotiate the art scene, and it had to negotiate the city. So the meeting that took place a year before the Biennial opened wasn’t going to be a negotiation between the Biennial and the art scene, but rather was going to be a negotiation between the Biennial and the growing community of artists, curators</text>

They asked what the significance of this was, and what the institutional interest was in supporting these artists in their projects. The Biennale had been set up as a way to connect to the city, and the public realm, in a way that the biennial would be able to sustain. But it was also set up as a way to ground the Biennial in concrete, so that the biennial could resume its role as a museum.In the end, the group that emerged was not going to be able to undo the damage done by the Biennale, but they did decide, as far as possible, that the support they had been given at the time would be available to them in the event that they wanted to revisit their art. So the Biennale had another purpose: it became a way to ground the Biennial in concrete, and the Biennial in the public realm. In the case</text>

A year before, a group of artists had been invited to participate in the 20th Biennale of Sydney. A year before that, a group of artists had been invited to take part in the 25th Oxford Biennale. And a year before that, a group of artists had been invited to participate in the 29th Gareth Lane Arts Biennale.And so it continues.The controversy that emerged in 2003 surrounding the 2000 Venice Biennale was explosive, and the Board of Governors had to convene a special meeting to discuss it. There was a consensus that the biennale should be held again in 2020, but the decision was quashed by the Italian government, and the Venice Biennale went ahead again in 2017. The question that has reigned for some years now is whether the Venice Biennale is an art institution, or whether it's an</text>

You can either do what is expected of you as an artist, which is to be an object of pride for a cultural body, or you can question why that is the case and to question how an artist can be involved in something as seemingly ‘object-based’ as art.

I think that is a difficult question to answer, because I don’t think that the art world has a clear sense of what it wants and needs yet. There’s a sense that the art world is fragmenting, like a large country but without a common language, but I think that is a false sense of things. The art world needs a common language, but it also needs cultural organisations dedicated to supporting and encouraging language learning amongst artists and artists. I don’t think that there’s a way of organising everything that would be appropriate for the art world, but there are ways of organising things that are not.I don’t think that the art world has the capacity or the will to tackle the language barrier, for sure. But the parallel to be drawn is that the arts are also culturally subjective – a fact that many artists and arts organisations still try to ignore or trivialise. There are many different ways of looking at the same thing, and there’s a way for many different people to take part in the same thing. It’s just that the thing itself is segregated by a different set of barriers. I think that there’s</text>

I think that is a difficult question to answer, because I don’t think that the art world has a clear sense of what it wants and needs yet. There’s a sense that the art world needs to be creative in ways that are unexpected and unexpected in a way that are unexpected and unexpected in a way that is both predictable and unsatisfying in the end. Sometimes the art world just doesn’t seem to understand that it has a democratic government that is making decisions that are in profound and unpredictable ways.This is a difficult conversation to have because it’s not binary. There are many artists who are deeply dissatisfied with the way in which our current political and economic systems are organising ourselves. They see a future in which there are fewer state-sanctioned forms of art and that there’s a way to break free of them. In many ways, I would say that they are right. I don’t know if I would call myself an artist, but I’ve certainly never claimed to be an artistic producer. I’ve simply stated that there are ways to be innovative and creative in new and different ways. I don’t know</text>

I think that is a difficult question to answer, because I don’t think that the art world has a clear sense of what it wants and needs yet. There’s a sense that the art world could use more artists, and that there’s a disconnect between the art world and the practice. There’s also a sense of the art world not being capable of supporting its artists. I remember one woman saying how she wished the art world would hire migrant artists instead of hiring artists from the academy, because the latter were responsible for teaching artists how to do their pieces. I thought that was an interesting point of view, one that was gaining ground among artists. She was arguing that we don’t need more artists, that we need to hire more academics and that the former would do a much better job of supporting artists than artists in the latter.I thought the same thing about the arts and social practices: we need more artists, and the arts should be a function of the social. I think that is a difficult question to answer, because the social dimension is so central to the cultural practices we have today: it’s part of what makes us human. But</text>

I think that is a difficult question to answer, because I don’t think that the art world has a clear sense of what it wants and needs yet. There’s a sense that the art world should do lots of good, but there’s also a sense of self-righteousness about the world that says ‘I’m more important than you’d think I am.’ This sense of entitlement is very appealing to people, but it’s also very difficult to reconcile with people who have a clear sense of what they want and need.I remember one time, a friend of mine was asked what he thought the art world should do. He said, almost ruefully, that he didn’t know, and that people needed to be educated. I said, don’t you feel that way to your own people? That person asked another question, and I told him again and again that the art world shouldn’t be involved in making people ‘decent’. He finally said, ‘That’s what I believed then.

There’s a sense that the art world might be a little unstable, and that the art world might be a little unstable in its own way. But I do think that there is a sense of convergence of many different kinds of art and culture; there’s a kind of convergence that I think is needed.The other thing that has to be balanced is the amount of work that goes into it. The breadth of what goes into it, the identity of the artists, the time and effort that go into it, and the social functions that come with it – all of that is really evident when you go to the big art fairs or when you go to a major biennale. But the art world doesn’t do enough to connect with what is happening on a local level. That’s where local, regional, and even national art institutions are making a difference. Local institutions like the Museum of Modern Art in New York are becoming increasingly regional in their exhibitionary forms; they are showing work from around the</text>

In many ways, I feel that the 1990s and 2000s were similar to the 1980s and 1990s in that there was a lot of open question that still needs to be resolved. I think that the open question that emerged during the 1980s and 1990s was what is art in a broader sense? I think that there was a focus on the role of artists and the role of the art world in a specific period, but I also believe that there were questions that still needed to be asked and answers.

There’s a sense that the art world could certainly do with an intellectual anchor, and I get the sense that in an ideal world, the art world would act more like a university, more like a think tank, more like a think tank, much more like a museum. It’s not that the art world doesn’t have the resources or that the arts world doesn’t have the resources – I think the resources do exist and they certainly do. But the question is: what kind of social context would that be? I don’t think that there’s a clear answer to that. I think that the art world has to find a way to connect to what the humanities and social sciences can offer, because otherwise it’s impossible for the art world to achieve what it desires.I was recently asked what my main contribution to the field has been. My main contribution has always been: what can the art world do to help create a better world for people? I think that my main</text>

I don’t think I would have done well as an artist in that environment.I think that as an artist you are often faced with difficult choices. You can either do what is expected of you as an artist, which is to be an object of pride for a cultural body, or you can question why that is the case and to question how an artist can be involved in something as seemingly ‘object-based’ as art. As an artist, you have to be able to imagine alternative uses for an artist’s work. In the 1980s and 1990s, I was regularly asked what I thought the art world could and should do. I think that is a difficult question to answer, because I don’t think that the art world has a clear sense of what it wants and needs yet. There’s a sense that the art world needs to be creative and innovative and intervene early in order to change things, but I don’t think that has a place in a social and institutional context. The art world in its current form – which is to say, what we imagine it to be – is much more easily arrived at through the mediation of organisations and individuals. In this situation, you can have a transformative effect through what is widely perceived as an art-school model, but if you ask me what the art-school model is, I would say that I don’t know. I’m not from the art world, and I don’t know what the art-school model is. Do you?Because I don’t know! I don’t belong to either the art or the social world. I belong to the continuum of human experience. I belong to the realm of the artist-student. And to an extent that is still valid for this world, this social world</text>

There’s a sense that the art world needs to be creative and imaginative and experimental and experimental and dynamic and unpredictable, but I don’t think that is necessarily what the art world needs. The art world needs a sense of predictability, and if that sounds trivial or trivial, it’s not to me. I’m interested in the kind of predictability that would be appropriate for a young person to have. I think that for a young person to be able to create their own adventure, to explore a new place, to connect to a familiar place, and to feel like they’re part of a cultural community – that’s an interesting concept to me. I think that would make a young person open to new ideas and ideas. For a young person to be able to take ideas from others and to apply them to their own projects – that’s a really interesting concept to me.

There’s a sense that the art world could use more artists, that there’s a lack of resources for the arts education in this country, and that there’s a disconnect between the arts and education. I remember thinking to myself: ‘The art world needs more artists.’ But I also felt that the need was distorting. There was a sense of cultural elitism that I felt was very damaging to the nation as a whole. There was an element of fear in how the arts were perceived in the UK. There was a sense that the art world might turn away from what it considered to be the true art-world: the cultural economy. In the 1990s, I felt that the art world needed to be more politically aware. There were political and cultural tides in the art world at the time, and I think that there was a disconnect between the art world and the politics that it was managing.

As the San Francisco Examiner noted, the golf course was a popular tourist attraction, with ‘the masquerade of the ruined buildings appearing to be a modern invention’, ‘a fancy name for bas-relief, painting and engraving was done in frescoes and prints, and printed designs ‘were painted on the walls and ceilings’.4  One of the artists staging a ‘golf course’ in the empty MAB was a young man named John Lennon, who would go on to form the Beatles, and become one of the most successful artists of his generation. His partner in crime was another young woman named Janis Joplin, who would become one of the most successful artists of her generation, and become one of the most controversial. John Lennon’s partner in crime was also a young woman named Georgina Johnson, who would go on to form the African-American feminist punk band the Ramones.</text>

The dangers of muzzling were becoming apparent. A series of erstwhile curators were staging a ‘golf course’ in the empty MAB, which was hosting the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. In an attempt to reduce the appearance of corruption in the art institution, a new administration was developing policies designed to encourage the sustainable production of art as a by-product of the museum complex. These included the promotion of ‘museum cards’ and the ‘museum as a home for artists’ residency, both offered free to visitors.4  These ‘enduring Forms’ exhibit a nostalgic recollection of a bygone era in which art was more readily associated with a specific location and a specific community of admirers. Art is expected to be produced in a community setting, so it is not surprising that the display of contemporary art would be organised in a ‘staging area’ within the museum, with works displayed in small groups, often selected from a register of popular and contemporary art.

The dangers of muzzling were becoming apparent. A series of erstwhile curators were staging a ‘golf course’ in the empty MAB, which was hosting the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Anglophiles lined the course, eager to show off their national trophies and exotic imports. Curators from around the world assembled in Winnipeg to witness the spectacle, which seemed an ideal excuse to open a museum in the city – a place where art, aesthetics and carnival ­– as well as commerce and travel could coexist. 	The opening of the MAB was a major event in the city. It was also a major event in the city’s financial and social development. The MAB established the city as a centre for the transnational movement of goods and people, and for the international movement of people and goods.4 The museum became a hub for this transnational movement, attracting artists, traders, migrants, colonial administrators and many others who sought refuge or work in Winnipeg. The MAB’s programming included art and exhibition from around the world, as well as introductions to key concepts and polities relevant to the city. The museum�</text>

At the same time, a new administrative system was being developed in ‘Curtis Kerr’s department, which would later be called ‘Museum’.3  Kerr was a leading curator of decorative arts and a pioneer of the career of a ‘muralist’ as a visual artist. In the early twentieth century, he established the practice of  	muralists, who would paint public buildings, public spaces, landscapes and furniture in a range of styles and colours. A few years after opening, a vandal’s attempt to deface the MAB with mud and bright stripes was partially successful, but its broadside was too late: the museum was closed for repairs. 	The dangers of muzzling were becoming apparent. A series of erstwhile curators were staging a ‘golf course’ in the empty MAB, which was hosting the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. 	A ball was being shot across the street when a group of community members showed up with clubs and clubships. Local artists, photographers and sculptors formed a ‘craft club’ to play the part of artists, while a group of local residents formed a ‘muralist’ group called the ‘Pine-a-Lingue’.4  The MAB board of trustees eventually relented and the golf course relocated to a site on the outskirts of Winnipeg, where it remained until 1961. At that time, a group of artists started a ‘mural’s ‘roadshow’ across the street from the MAB, where the Winnipeg Art Biennale would appear. This was the beginning of a long-term partnership between the MAB board and the Winnipeg Art Museum, which would later become the Museum and the Biennale.5  During this time, another biennial – the Florida</text>

The dangers of muzzling were becoming apparent. A series of erstwhile curators were staging a ‘golf course’ in the empty MAB, which was hosting the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, when a marauding lynx appeared to be stalking the club’s course. In an attempt to keep the lynx out, a team of volunteers led by a young man named Jack Stewart Lawrence formed into a vigilante mob, slaughtering ‘thousands’ of birds and smashing windows in an attempt to protect the museum from the birds’ carcasses.4 The mob was supported by a host of local businessmen and artists, including Walter Lamb, John Lennon, Paul McCarthy, Frank Sinatra, Frank Sinatra Jr, Jack London, Jack London II and Jimmy Choo. The names and addresses of the individuals involved in the creation of the MAB are in the archive of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, where the members of the Board of Trustees maintained a register of those who had been admitted or had been expelled.

The dangers of muzzling were becoming apparent. A series of erstwhile curators were staging a ‘golf course’ in the empty MAB, which was hosting the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. In a panic, the museum turned to law to shut down the area. Curator Johann Weiger launched an unsuccessful court challenge, claiming the right to ‘selectively and permanently close the museum in his or her will’; a claim that the state of California would never abandon.4  Weiler argued that Kerr’s claim was procedurally barred by the ‘American ‎First ‎—a statute that provides for the establishment and clearance of mausoleums’—a most sweeping power granted to the president by the US constitution.5  Weiler went on to form an ambitious and principled coalition of prominent lawyers, artists, historians and journalists, including John Lennon, Peter Kampmann, Norman Mailer, Ted Hughes, Ted Turner, Red Robin, Debbie Harry, Margaret Fuller and Robbie Rossiter, who would later form the Coalition to Defend Mabra.6 Weiler’s coalition won the legal challenge, which</text>

The dangers of muzzling were becoming apparent. A series of erstwhile curators were staging a ‘golf course’ in the empty MAB, which was hosting the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.4 Over the years that followed, the MAB hosted other art institutions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Rhode Island School of Design. At the beginning of this century, it hosted the Venice Biennale, but its permanent home was in doubt. In 2014, a new owner bought the MAB and consolidated its activities with the New Museum, the museum being relocated to Lower Manhattan. With the transition to the Lower Manhattan MIB, the MAB was forced to close its showrooms and studios, and artists and art collectors were diverted to other venues. 	The new museum building, which opened in November, 2017, seems to offer a potential resolution to the persistent disenchantment with the MAB. Its open plan plan and energetic intervention makes it possible to walk through the museum, its collection of objects and its curatorial effects. As an alternative to the museum building, this change of venue can be found in the Bluecoat building, a</text>

The dangers of muzzling were becoming apparent. A series of erstwhile curators were staging a ‘golf course’ in the empty MAB, which was hosting the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Curator Frederick W. Palmer was similarly circumspect in his criticism of the Exposition as a ‘monstrous waste of good land and money’.4 In his memoirs, Palmer recalled the day the doors to the MAB were locked, and the artist Gregory H. Tipton described how the police appeared before the building’s architect and had demanded to know what kind of plans the Tiptons had for the building. Palmer demanded a copy of the ‘plan’, and ‘anyone else present’ had to produce a plan of their own.5 The tension between the artist and the museum grew manifest in the form of debates over what became known as the ‘Tipton Plan’. In the end, the plan managed to be drawn up and sent to the city council, which passed a resolution officially recognising the architectural style as ‘Palm Invasion’ and formally transferring ownership of</text>

Gorbalsky spearheaded the project with his partner Clara Boden (1825–1920), who was his secretary. Their persistence paid off in 1914, when a temporary exhibition hall was built for the exposition in the former Standard Oil building on the grounds of the MAB. Gorbalsky presented the exhibition in a ‘golf course’ on the grounds of the new ‘Museum’, which opened its grounds to the public that year. The new museum was a refuge from the oppressive logic of the megastructure, which was trying to impose its own institutional pattern on an already fragmented and disjointed site. Art was allowed to thrive in a space that recognized its own institutional pattern. Art was put into a space that its setting couldn’t impose. The new museum became a rarefied world, where art’s natural habitat was allowed to prosper unchecked. In other words, the museum, once a physical space of</text>
