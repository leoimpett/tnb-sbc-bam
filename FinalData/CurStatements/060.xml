The idea that the public can identify with the brand – and that a certain amount of brand identity is appropriate – is something that was actively sought after by the military, and Blake was a prime example of a man who was well-placed, well-connected and well-placed at the right time. Blake was commissioned by the Admiralty to design a series of dazzle ships for the capital ship, the Type 23, and he did so in response to the need to disguise the identity of the shipbuilder when constructing the new ship, the Type 50. The idea was to make the Type 23 look like a Type 50, with the two vessels running parallel to each other. However, the fact that Blake was a British artist and a designer rather than an architect or a marine engineer meant that he had a set of ideas that were acceptable to the military, rather than an understanding of the different types of ship and the roles that they would play. So while the public might identify with the idea that a ship is a certain way, the actual form of the ship and the role that it plays are fundamentally different. Blake was therefore faced with a dilemma: either adopt the military’s set of ideas and create a dazzle ship, or break the mould and make something</text>

These are not isolated incidents. In fact, in the years that followed the war, more and more archives and artefacts were sent home to be deciphered. This is part of what scholars refer to as the ‘metainterface’ – the process of archiving and documentation that took place after the fact, and so it is relevant to this event. But the narrative of that event is one that is being actively shaped by a very specific set of people.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art is holding a month-long series of public events – The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s First Year, July – October ‘1917’ – to mark the centenary of the First World War.

It seems a little strange to me that a museum set in its present location in the heart of the First World War would now be holding a public concert about the war, but the point of this public concert is to mark the end of the war as a point of convergence for artists and the very public at large, so it makes sense here. The Met, as we shall see, has a role to play in the very long run, not just in repurposing the building, but in maintaining its distinctive character.  	The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds regular, bi-annual exhibitions of new art, and these have recently begun to exhibit work that was made into small works for the occasion, such as sculptures by Jan Montefiore and Elmgreen Bahadur.

But the public wasn’t the only one who needed to be convinced. A number of organisations were actively involved in the propaganda war – the British Council, the Royal Academy, The Telegraph, The Illustrated London News, The Illustrated Paris News – and as far back as the First World War was concerned, there were artists, writers and sculptors who contributed their work directly to the conflict effort. The fact that Blake was a leading British artist and a regular visitor to the Royal Academy shows how much his work was needed and appreciated. He provided a range of expressive tools that allowed other artists to explore themes of loss and loss and loss of meaning and the interconnectedness of all forms of cultural exchange, culture as a political actor, and culture as a potential outlet for rage and frustration.

In the middle is a collection of photographs, each of which was taken by a different photographer. The collection is divided into three sections: the Photographer of the Millennium, the Man of the Year (1917), and the Icon (1917–1925).[10] The collection is a ‘window on the past’, opening onto forgotten moments of history. Members of the public are invited to take part in a ‘window washing’ operation that purifies the recesses of the museum of their military history.

Blake was a commercial artist first, and he had a particularised interest in logos and commercial identity. In 1915 he co-opted the naming of a ship after himself: ‘Peter Blake to the Chopper’. The name stuck. The brand would be the very image of British imperialism.The Official History of the Dazzle Ships, 1914–1918, Royal Academy of Arts, London, 1915. Photo courtesy Royal Academy of Arts. 	However, the roots of Blake’s involvement in the war effort actually lie much further back. He was one of the first British artists to be recruited by the US Army, and his wartime activities are documented in numerous documents. Among them is a letter he wrote to his friend, the art critic Lord Byron: ‘I have just finished drawing up a list of the things I shall and shall not draw – things not to please the Americans, and things to please Great Britain’s Army.</text>

Blake was commissioned by the Admiralty to create a series of four-and-half-page spreads for the official Illustrated London News on 1 October 1917, and the next day, 1 October 1917, a set of four-and-half-pages for the Daily Graphic and the Graphic London News. The first two were for the Daily Graphic and the Graphic London News, while the last two were for the Daily Graphic and the Graphic London News &amp; Express. These spreads ran in the two newspapers on the same day, with a total of four different versions of the same image. All of the images were of ships in the Thames Estuary, but the ‘dazzle images’ of which there were four kinds (from the very first letter of the word to the very last) were for the Daily Graphic and the Graphic London News &amp; Express. The reason for this is that the Admiralty wanted to make sure that the public could recognise the image as one from</text>

The idea that the public can identify with the brand – and that a certain amount of brand identity is appropriate – is something that was actively sought after by the military, and Blake was a prime example of a man who was well-placed, well-connected and well-versed in the art of creating visual disruption. Blake was given the code name ‘Creative Sergeant’ and soon after began to develop a number of innovative ways of breaking open previously‑protected artistic materials. One of these broke down the parameters of the War Office’s plans and sought to use stencils and watercolours as paint in places where battlements had been installed. Other approaches broke apart the materials and sought to utilise hidden mechanisms and subterranean passageways as well as new technology. Blake was absolutely clear about the tools he used and the end products he sought: despite initial experimentation with watercolour, he knew where the limits lay and that was that. Blake was a military painter and his ideas were fully embraced by the art establishment. He was a military photographer and his constant references to the battlefield and its places and ways were part of a calculated PR campaign designed to hawk the achievements of the nascent science and engineering communities. This was part of a broader artistic shift</text>

Blake was commissioned by the Admiralty in 1917, and his designs were widely considered to be the pinnacle of British design – brilliant and handsome, with a strong military context. He was given the code name ‘Prince Of Spades’ and given the task of decoding the complicated designs that the Admiralty was pouring through Britain’s wartime register. Blake was not an artist, nor a designer, but he had the contacts, the connections and the places to draw men and women together in an organisation that was both powerful and completely opaque, at once powerful and completely opaque. He came up with some really badass names for the things that the Admiralty was pouring through Britain’s wartime register, and he did some really badass things as an artist. But the real kicker was when he went underground and did some really badass things as a biographer and journalist. He came out with a book called The Prince, and the Spades, and everything in between,</text>

The idea that the public can identify with art and design and the combined might enable a military to carry out a wide range of operations is something that was not universally embraced by the public, but was certainly embraced by those in high places. The reason that the public is drawn to these kinds of operational endeavours, and not to more conventional art, is that the latter tends to obscure the latter. In the Second World War, for example, the British military commissioned a number of artists to produce commemorative paintings that combined graphic designs with prints that reflected the technological innovations of the day. These were done mainly for the war memorials in the war memorials were the scale of the work appropriate and the mood was celebratory. These commemorative paintings are works in progress, and the artists who produced them in 1917 are still active in the art world today. The public responds to the juxtaposition of something new and something old by something new and by nothing at all. The brilliance of Blake�</text>

This scholarship is often presented as though it were the work of a single scholar, but it is actually quite the opposite. It is a group of artists, writers and critics coming together over the course of several years to produce what may be described as a ‘collective voice’. As I discovered while researching the MFA, the way in which art is produced today is almost entirely by machines, and many of the artists, writers and critics who I have come across in my research do not see their work as art but rather ‘tools’ for accomplishing ‘real-life’ tasks. As a result, the curatorial gift that artists, critics, artists's groups and other social actors give to one another is often seen as</text>

(Mass Movement Archives) while researching for my MFA thesis, Towards a Politics of Mass Communication (with Irina Glukhova), for an exhibition that would exhibit the scholarly work of a new generation of artists, among others. Through a combination of archival research and online platform research, I found myself researching the archival work of the organization, trying to piece together a timeline of its activities during the 1990s and 2000s. I found myself wanting to know more, so I put together a book that would document the movement’s history, but also its poetry and its paradoxes. The result is published as a poetry collection called Stages that was edited and revised several times between 2009 and 2015.Through the poetry collection, I came across an interesting and timely project that was published in the New York Times in 2017: the work of curators Emily Herman and Manolis Papastergiadis, who were commissioned by the New Museum to curate the exhibition The Limits to Capital, the second volume of its Documenta 13 series.

I became deeply involved in the project, which was co-founded by a group of artists, including Tracey Emin, John Cameron Mitchell, Sharon Hayes, Roisin Douglo, Lisa Legend, Christine MacLachlan and Sarah Nuttall. I was particularly interested in how the movement was contextualised within the context of the biennial industry, and how the political, economic and environmental destinies of the city were conflated in the term ‘biennial’. It is a convention in itself to note the environmental impact of artworks, but the importance of this in the context of the MFA thesis and the curatorial roll is that the biennial must define the genre of art – or it is excluded. The artists in the project were not trying to do an irrelevance to the biennial, nor were they trying to establish an entirely separate biennial, but rather to add</text>

In the 1970s and 1980s the social ecology of mass media and popular culture was developing rapidly in Chile, and a new kind of curatorial form was emerging: the curatorial. The new form would not only document the changes in society during the 1970s and 1980s, but would also chart the politics of the archival, critical and archival aspects of the phenomenon. By the 1990s, there was a biennial based on the New York and Venice biennials, and the curatorial’s official position was that it should be a ‘seasonal arena’, with a political orientation towards the forms of mass culture that were produced during that decade.

The group, who also included Michael Birchall, had been formed in 1981 and involved artists, writers and historians. The designation of 1988 as a ‘Year of Documenta 13’ seemed to imply a new kind of biennial that would be distinctive and accessible to a broader audience. Curators Joasia Krysa and Maria Lind made a proposal for the exhibition to the Arts Council, which was accepted without objection. The proposal was that the artists and curators should be able to define the kind of art journey they wanted to undertake and the kind of art they wanted to expose. The artists and curators should be able to identify other artists who have made similar journeys. The curators should be able to select artists they want to work with.

And the artists should be able to select other artists they want to work with.  The proposal was that the art should be presented as a story, rather than as a collection of images arranged chronologically from the past to present. This would make the art more accessible to audiences who might want to engage with the story of the intersection of art and culture, but don’t have a strong background in either art, history or contemporary art. While this may sound trivial in the context of a museum, it has profound historical and social implications. If we extract the story from the images, we run the risk of distorting or rejecting the images, which can break down cultural barriers. And artists and curators who extract the stories from the images could also be accused of objectifying women or racialised people, which is strictly unacceptable in a museum.  The proposal was that the art should be presented as a series of images, rather than as a collection of texts arranged chronologically from the past to the future. And the accession to this approach was made possible by the introduction of new media: videos, images, podcasts,</text>

And the artists should be able to select other artists they want to work with.  The proposal was that the art should be presented as a journey through time, rather than as a collection of images depicting an artist’s current or historic place of work. This latter position was popular with the arts community, and the Arts Council funded the artists’ travels as part of their commissioning process. The Arts Council had commissioned a number of artists to produce artistic works around the travel narrative. But the Commission for Cultural Infrastructure (AC) in partnership with the Arts Council International (ACCI) carried out an extensive internal enquiry into the curators’ roles. The results showed that the two body had agreed that the curators should lead a group of artists and art historians to explore the history of an art space through narratives in which the community members involved in creating the narrative would all take part. And so it was that the stories of the past, present and future of the arts were woven together to form a continuous narrative that explored the relationship between the Arts Council and community groups. This was seen by many in the community as</text>

And the artists should be able to select other artists they want to work with.  The proposal was that the art should be presented in such a way as to provoke an awareness of the social, economic and political conditions on which the city is built. It should be able to do this through such methods as the use of literature, photography, street art, street  	moving art exhibitions, film and even documentaries. It should also be able to engage with current events and issues through such media as radio and television.  The Arts Council took up the proposals and, in its 1989 programme of activities, made them part of its regular programme of exhibitions and activities.  The Arts Council made the proposals public in 1987 and again in 1993, and the Arts Council members responded with their reflections in the annual report.12  In 2015, a ‘Year Without a Festival’ was proposed in New York. This was partly to coincide with the 20th Biennial Congress, which would see the organisation recognised as a fully sovereign body, with full legislative and executive powers, in the form of a federation of art collectors,</text>

And the artists should be able to select other artists they want to work with.  The proposal was that the art should be presented as it happened, in chronological order from the artist’s point of view. This would create an interesting contrast with the biennial format, in which the chronological order dominates the content and narrative of the exhibition.  The artists and curators who made the proposal were Maria Lind, Joasia Krysa, Olof Palmgren, Ingvar Kamprad, Gunnar Myrden, Morten Kyng, Eva Castringius, Anders Perkison, Torbjörn Svein, Anne Kübler-Ross, Henrik Lund, Eva Finck and Åke Steedman. The reader is invited to browse through the proposals in the book, or watch the videos and photographs of the exhibitions. The book is divided into four parts. Part One deals with the vision of the artist in the exhibition. The first part shows the vision of the viewer in the form of a journey through time and creates a scenario in which the viewer can exert agency over how the art</text>

The proposal was that the art should be presented in an accessible way that would allow the viewer to connect with the art in meaningful ways. The exhibition should be accessible through objects and media that are intentionally designed to be understood by experts and the very few who actually are art experts. I suggested that the curators put their money where their ‘people’ are – with real people who are artists, writers, critics and others who make up the art world and have a real say in what is made, whether that be painting, sculpture, installation or even a show in a museum. This would mean engaging with the issues and figures of our time through engaging with the people who actually create those things rather than through the art world’s typical modes of engagement.

The proposal was that the art should be presented as a story, rather than the other way around: as a collection of anecdotes or facts, rather than as a collection of objects or artists' works. The curators and artists had to agree on a way of approaching the art, so that the art could emerge through a process of negotiation. Negotiations took place in a semi-regular series of meetings. The artists and curators decided to work with the historian and make her a character in the exhibition. She would tell the story of the art from start to finish in a kind of prologue. Then the rest of the piece would fall back into place. So the art would be a narration of events that occur in the exhibition as a whole, rather than a set of anecdotes or facts about specific artists, exhibitions, or the art world. She would tell the story in fragments, but the exhibition would be an episode in a larger narrative.  Her proposal came with the understanding that the other half of the equation – the curators,</text>

And the artists should be able to select other artists they want to work with.  The proposal was that the art should be presented as a sequence of connected actions rather than as individual works. This may seem simple to understand, but it is much more difficult to execute. The art had to be intrinsically connected to the journey in order to be exhibited. The curators had to be able to separate the artist from the art, to create a different kind of art festival. The idea of art as a journey was a part of the curatorial thinking – not a destination or an end in itself. As the artist Terry Smith said: ‘Art has an ethical, political and social dimension.’  The intention had to be to show the art in ways that would provoke thought and make people question assumptions and preconceived ideas. This could not be seen as a place where sexual politics were part of the programme. In the 1980s and 1990s, the art world wasn’t very open to questioning ideas. But now that we’re in a place like Venice, where ideas are put on display, and social</text>

And the artists should be able to select other artists they want to work with.  The proposal was that the art should be presented in a way that creates connection with other artworks, whereas the aim should be to analyse and expose the art as a whole. In other words, the arts should be creative in what they present, whereas the intention should be to engage with the art as a whole.  The suggestion was that the art should be present in a set of relations that were mutually exclusive, yet also that the artist or curator should be able to choose whether those relations are from being in the public domain, in which case they are not art, or in the other category, in which case they are art.  The Arts Council took up the proposal and, in its report of 1988, stated that it was satisfied with the way in which the proposal was worded. It said that it could not find a definition of ‘the public domain’ that satisfied both the artist and the public. It was satisfied that the public had a right to know what was in the public domain, and that the right to</text>

And the artists should be able to select other artists they want to work with.  The proposal was that the art should be presented in such a way as to be accessible to the broad range of audiences who would find it meaningful, yet also provocative and interesting. In other words, the way in which art is made today politicises and commodifies art in a way that is unprecedented in modern history. The curators were invited to select a group of artists they felt could make a contribution to this new kind of art and then to work with them in this context. But the curators had other ideas. The Arts Council had a policy of listening to and accepting art wherever it may be based. And so the artists and curators in the exhibition were invited to create works that reflected the values of the Arts Council, while the other half was invited to engage in what the Arts Council felt was a more appropriate way of thinking about art and art history. The curators had to think independently as to how to engage with what was happening in their area. And so the discussions moved from the values of the Arts Council to the specific needs</text>

This would make it possible to understand the original intentions of the artists and curators who were going to exhibit the art but also to understand the motivation for their interventions. For example, the Arts Council might have wanted to show something from the early 1900s because that was when the Biennale was founded and because that was when the Biennale was being staged in a particular city. It would make sense to show something from the 1900s in a city that is experiencing an event that is very much connected to the event but has never really been visited by art? This is what happened in Venice, as part of the Biennale’s historical narrative. The Biennale was even shown in the US as part of its ‘2016 Global Curators Challenge’, funded by the Arts Council and US National Endowment for the Arts.  In other words, the idea that art events should be taking</text>

For instance, the history of inter-group violence and conflict in ethnically diverse communities is intimately tied to the idea that the past is unforgiving and therefore victim-blaming is often used by government to justify action. For the powerful notion of identity is constructed through the idea that the past is black and white, so it is imperative that we all inhabit the past and identify with what is perceived as ‘the true tradition’. This is often called the ‘great unfinished’ project of Canadian identity. In places like Hamilton, Ont., where I live, the past is a significant barrier to the present. Many residents of my neighbourhood, which is approximately 30 kilometres south of the Canadian border, still refer to the 1950s and 60s as ‘the golden era’ of Canadian identity. Despite this historical weight, the ongoing nature of the crisis of poverty and homelessness, which many residents feel is directly attributable to the history of poverty and homelessness in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, makes many residents question the notion that the constant redefinition of the past is in any way an option.

For instance, the history of inter-group violence and conflict in ethnically diverse communities is intimately tied to the idea that the past is unforgiving and therefore victim-blaming is often employed to deflect responsibility from the perpetrators. It is this idea of the inherent inevitability of conflict that fuels the myth of victimhood in the public sphere, and it is this underlying notion of inevitability that fuels the militancy of victim-blaming. 	With this in mind, it’s worth noting that the term  	New Right was coined in Canada by the late 1970s. In the United States, the term was coined in the mid-1980s by the emergence of the post-war counterculture. In both cases, the movement was seen as a possible end point, a possible starting point, from which new possibilities opened up. 	Today, the term seems antiquated, but its usage is widespread enough that it has its own Wikipedia article. It is also common enough that these possibilities will be met with a rejection, or worse, a determined hostility.

The tendency is to see the other as inherently culpable, even though there is little evidence to support such an assumption. 	It is no exaggeration to say that the prominence of violence in early modern art is due to the influence of the slave trade. Founded in 1845, the Royal Academy was Canada’s first historically black institution, established to showcase works in the academy that had a particularly ‘black cultural’ value. As early as the late eighteenth century, the academy’s goals were to support artists operating outside the academy through grants, commissions and other types of support. As early as the mid-nineteenth century, the academy established a separate wing, the Musee Royale, dedicated to the protection and exhibition of art from aboriginal cultures. In the twentieth century, the academy and its artists found new audiences when they painted poignantly historical portraits of First Nations activists, such as Che Guevin and Max Ernst, and radical social activists such as</text>

In places where power is concentrated, such as in Indigenous communities, people are often seen as inherently ‘white’ and therefore not to be blamed. In fact, it can’t be the other way around: power must be spread across the groups to ensure that everyone is equally represented. 	In examining how artists can and cannot mix can be seen as an important part of this historical narrative. There are many different kinds of artists, and there are many different kinds of histories, but the kind of experience an artist has when working with individuals whose identities are constructed according to racialised, colonialised or racialised (X) or under-exploited (Y) categories is fundamentally different from the kind of experience an artist has when working with people whose identities are constructed according to other categories.

As a result, historically disenfranchised communities often experience resistance to change their government because of perceived damage to the collective sense of belonging. Similarly, the history of residential schools is intimately tied to the idea that the past is a fertile ground for political change. The emergence of self-governing Aboriginal governments in British Columbia and Alberta coincided with an increased use of political, legal and economic power to integrate residential schools into mainstream Canadian society. These developments are often characterised by a dramatic increase in the number of schools, the quality of teachers, facilities and curriculum, as well as in terms of academic outcomes for students. The historical record shows that political, economic and residential schools reforms were frequently accompanied by violent insurgencies by radical Indigenous activist groups. The recent actions of the RCMP in British Columbia’s Far North and Alberta​s Athabasca have all been characterised by a crackdown on radical Indigenous activism, arrests and removal of key Indigenous leaders,</text>

It is this perceived darker past that helps to explain why certain groups are more susceptible to the politics of victimhood than others. For instance, the history of inter-group violence and conflict in ethnically diverse communities is intimately tied to the idea that the past is unforgiving and therefore victim-blaming is often used to justify behaviour that is otherwise considered ‘justified’. Of course, this ‘justification’ isn’t always justified, and while some might claim to want to see their actions rectified, the fact of power suggests that such action is sometimes more appropriate than attempting to understand how an impactful action could be taken in a meaningful way.

For instance, the history of inter-group violence and conflict in ethnically diverse communities is intimately tied to the idea that the past is unforgiving and therefore victim-blaming is often used to absolve perpetrators. In places where power is concentrated, people are encouraged to believe that their place in society is secure because of their race, ethnicity or place of origin. In places where power is dispersed, people are encouraged to believe that their place in society is untouchable because of their identity. In both the past and the present, power brokers have often relied on the notion that their work was legitimate because it was done in a particular community, based on notions of collective identity. Today, this notion of ‘community’ is often used by those in power to delegitimize and subjugate communities of colour, particularly in the wake of perceived transgressions – both internal and external. However, in the past, this notion of ‘community’ was often abused by those in power to establish their own power brokers. To some extent, this is still true of art today. But in the past, artists were frequently cast as conniving or nefarious non-white men intent</text>

For instance, the history of inter-group violence and conflict in ethnically diverse communities is intimately tied to the idea that the past is unforgiving and therefore victim-blaming is often used as a political tool. As a result, policy-makers and others with whom we disagree is often inculcated with the idea that the future is rosier, so we should embrace the perceived inevitability of the past as a way to allay our fears. 	But there’s a problem with that logic. As ethnographer Marilyn Gladstone points out, prejudice and discrimination are often based on misconceptions and prejudices.1 In the past, groups who experience disadvantageous social or economic conditions are often blamed on outsiders, outsiders who arrived earlier or came across more successfully than the traditional wayside groups. So while it might make sense to promote policies and programmes that will help marginalized populations cope with the challenges presented by technological change, such as expanding access to clean water and sanitation,2 it is critically important to question why these same technologies also enable groups to establish an unfair advantage over others. In other words, is technological progress good or is it evil? In an upcoming book2</text>

For instance, the history of inter-group violence and conflict in ethnically diverse communities is intimately tied to the idea that the past is unforgiving and therefore victim-blaming is often used by practitioners of that history to justify or rationalize institutional violence. But while this historical narrative of exclusion and conflict is often cited as a justification for certain social practices, its practitioners rarely question or question the institutionalised violence and oppression they inflict on their communities. In fact, it is often claimed that the past is a better place to live in than the present.1 	For instance, many communities who have been active in the fight for marriage equality are actively engaged in erasing or denying their history of oppression. Many are questioning whether their involvement in the political process or inclusion in mainstream culture is a positive or even a catalyst for greater social change. Often times, these questions are framed as questions of equality between the sexes, but I think of this more as a social construction that needs to be challenged. Questioning inequality and social hierarchies is particularly pertinent for communities of colour, whose voices are often silenced or misrepresented in the histories of whiteness.

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the space and engage with it in ways that the gallery could not. The power of the art display was so potent that it catalyzed a number of artists to participate in projects that would otherwise have gone unrewarded, such as those that would have taken place in the empty lot outside the gallery without a permanent art display. The power of the art display, moreover, was a significant factor in inspiring and enabling a number of artists to expand their creative horizons and take risks that were previously unimagined. The power of the art display, then, was both immediate and enormously transformational. And although the gallery space was ultimately closed and closed again, the transformation that it gave to the city (and sometimes to the art world) was profound and enduring. There were artistic and curatorial interventions that tried to rein in the gallery space, but eventually artists were free to exert their artistic agency and create what they saw as necessary in the public interest.This is the way in which art is inherently political</text>

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the city and engage with its issues and political situations. The power of the art display is a kind of a catalyst that can generate further creative activity and imagination.I love the way in which the artist Jeanne van Heeswijk describes the art display as ‘a provocation’ – a provocation to action that must be taken seriously or else there is a good chance that something will go wrong. She is blunt: there is no way to respond to a provocation like the one that came from the Biennale. Heeswijk is blunt: ‘Art is not a powerful weapon. It is not a public venue capable of defending the city from attack’.[15] Her response is instructive. She says:I took the art display down because I didn’t want to be part of the conspiracy theory machine that wanted to destroy the Biennale. I didn’t want to be part of a narrative that would have blamed the artists or the curators</text>

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the city and the city set in the social turn of the twentieth century. The power of the art display (in and on the street) is aural and visual. It is a provocation to be reckoned with, and a way to think about the world through the vantage point of an art display. The power of the art display, then, is both visual and auditory. It is a kind of urban silence that draws people together, mobilises them, and allows them to act collectively and imaginatively collectively. It is a vehicle that enables that link between the real and the imagined that is, for better and for worse, vital for the future of our urban environment.Art is the urban equivalent of an earthquake. It destroys what is real and thus works in vain to make way for what is invented and imagined to be possible. But imagine that art were as malleable and malleable as the rest of the world is made to be: malleable enough to be broken into many different</text>

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the city and enter into collaborations with local authorities, cultural institutions and other stakeholders in the local area. It was a trigger that could not be easily brushed aside or forgotten. This is perhaps what happens when you give the impression of overwhelming power to an organisation like the arts gallery. It creates a provocation that other organisations will follow. The art display that emerged later in the project, and which is still a part of the biennial today, speaks to a different kind of power, one that is diffuse and which is difficult to define and therefore difficult to understand. The art display that emerged after the project was put down in the 1990s coincided with a new cultural landscape that was developing in the city, one in which art was often used as a crutch to mask economic ills (although the biennial certainly wasn’t immune to this burden). Art as a crutch is a strange beast, and the art display that emerged after the project was put down in the 1990s was no exception.</text>

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the same kind of space and engage with similar kinds of audiences. A provocation that many artists eventually wanted to put out there, but which was much harder to pull off because of the intensity of the public relations machine that was working on the gallery side. The Off Beat piece was a great provocation, but it was a really good piece of the puzzle because it was so immediate, and because it was provocative. But that first piece … The One – which was the beginning of the gallery as we knew it today – was a great starting point, but the rest today is much harder to come by. The Off Beat piece was a starting point, but contemporary art today is made up almost entirely of social engagements, events, participatory practices and social celebrations. Most of the artists who come out of the Biennial biennale centre, or through the doors that they knock down, are there to make exhibitions, events or just to be around.

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the very different contexts and social worlds that artists normally inhabit, and to enter into a dialogue with the city.When the Biennial started, the gallery space was empty. A few artists, including myself, moved in, and began working in the gallery space full-time. The space that was once occupied by artists a.k.a. artists' schools started to get redeveloped, and a lot of artists were brought in from other fields of art, including architecture and graphic design. These artists found themselves engaged in a very different conversation with the city than the artists who were brought in as temporary temporary temporary workers. They started to create collaborative, artist-centered experiences, incorporating the arts into the design of buildings, public spaces and in particular, the very fabric of the city. The gallery space was also empty, but the art was always going to be there. The new gallery format encouraged an exchange between artist and audience, which in turn encouraged an exchange between the audience and the artists. The gallery</text>

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the gallery space and engage with the art collection in a way that the art that was displayed in the gallery space wasn’t able to. This provocation was a kind of black box that allowed the gallery and the artist to work together constructively. The gallery space was seen as a limiting situation, whereas the new piece of the art display – the displayed work – emerged as something that is inherently insular and individualised. The new piece of the art display was seen as a kind of intruder into the gallery space, and the artist was forced to reckon with the fact that he/she was simultaneously inviting a large audience to a private gallery party and a gallery party in a neighbourhood without any formal criteria for the audience to belong. Art was invited to be contextualised within the city in a way that serves the city’s cultural role and, equally important, the artist’s sensibilities.

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the arts and creative professions, and because it triggered a conversation that opened up possibilities for the city that were not necessarily available to those already in charge. The power of the art display was itself a provocation, because the exhibition was a place to start a conversation and a place to expand it. Art was used not only as a text that was read aloud by the public, but also because it was a political statement. After the first Venice Biennale, Francis Ford Coon published an essay in which he used the word ‘frivolous’ a number of times to describe the cultural practices of the 1960s and 1970s, and he argued that, since there was no alternative, the very notion of art as a legitimate sphere of social existence was itself subject to cultural commodification.[15] The essay was published in the New York Times on April 27, 1974, just as the suicide of Italian artist Armand de la Roche in Paris.

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the space and take a crack at it, to try and put their stamp on something that was already there. And so the chance of that larger piece of the art display coming from the off-campus gallery space was enhanced, since many artists felt that they could try and put their stamp on that piece of artwork.The new art display also brought about a change in the curatorial agenda, since the main curatorial task had shifted from making art to making money; and so the gallery space was no longer the primary site of exhibitionism. Art was now more often placed in brief, ephemeral encounters with other art forms, such as architecture or nature, which offered greater opportunity for contemplation. Thus the proliferation of art objects and the increasing proliferation of art spaces also stimulated a competition for space between artists who could best exploit the ephemeral and the permanent in such a way as to maximize the cumulative impact of their artworks. And so the competition for space between artists who could best exploit the ephemer</text>

But the power of the art display had a much more lasting impact, because it created a provocation for other artists to explore the space and engage with it in ways that would otherwise be unreachable. The power of the art display, then, resides in the knowledge that it has created a provocation for other artists to explore the city and engage with it in ways that would otherwise be impossible. Getting the art display to engage with the city in ways that are impossible to achieve otherwise is a relatively new phenomenon in the US. Art displays have always been a particular problem for artists to crack. The reason is that the art administrators in New York, London and elsewhere would rather have their work displayed somewhere else, often displaying an older, more established artist, then engage with the art in the city in new and interesting ways. So the art administrators in the cities would rather display an artist’s work than actively engage with it. The genius of the art display as a cultural tool is that it can engage with and even revolutionize cultural spaces and time in ways that other cultural tools cannot. And so the art show itself continues</text>

Recent publications include the New Media Reader (2014), New Media Criticism (2015) and Art and Communication (2016) from which the curatorial direction and content of the exhibition will be derived. The exhibition will also feature original works from the curatorial team, from the production of the exhibition to the curatorial interview. These will be presented alongside works from the exhibition programme, selected from the curatorial stack, and annotated by the two journalists present. The curatorial approach to curatorial succession in the 21st century is one of the most important developments in modern curatorial work, and a topic that Chandler Tipton looks back</text>

So, in the pre-digital media age, when artists have to grapple with the impact of government policies and legislation, it’s interesting to me that the art is already being made with an eye on the future. I guess I was just made for the social media age: the hard-hitting reporting on corruption, malfeasance, oppression and other social </text>

They’re foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign, and  so on. But while some of these fantastical urban structures might herald some kind of emerging utopia, there’s no escaping the fact that we’re stuck in this cycle of inevitable urban growth and urban decline, and urban churn. How can we all just get out of this vicious, destructive spiral? A growing body of research suggests that a disinterested participation from a public in cultural activities can significantly reduce the negative effects of excess, generate new ways of organising our city, and perhaps even pave the way for the very improvement that inattention to the city seeks to achieve.For instance, a growing body of research suggests that physically active young people are more likely to become engaged following a culturally</text>

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices is only possible because the former is understood as a metaphor for the latter. That’s to say, the rise of connectedness is only possible because humans have made the leap from the domain of the nomadic to the connected. But if the connection is not made today, or does not materialise in the future, or does not happen in a given city, then history will not record it, and humanity will remain trapped within its present. The task today is to create networks of connectedness that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also enable new kinds of social interaction. This may involve making objects that help to bridge the gap between people who use the same objects, but also objects that help to bridge the gap between people who use different kinds of objects.The notion of aesthetics today is deeply influenced by the service economy, which is closely tied to the rise of connectedness in the service industry. As a service industry, aesthetics has a particular set of connotations. It is understood as</text>

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices like smartphones and tablets is seen as essential in maintaining the site-specific understanding of labour and power that’s conducive to the maintenance of social and ecological sustainability, but also essential in constructing and maintaining the social relations that’re opened up by these technologies. But this kind of economising on the site-specific labour of human labour – which is made possible by the emergence of computing and connectivity – is only possible within the context of capitalism today. The datacenter is made possible by the rise of multidisciplinary research centres and universities – in part, because of the proliferation of academic publishing, which allows the sharing and exchange of ideas and knowledge across disciplines, even across university campuses. These institutions of higher learning are often led by religious or civic organisations, and their missions often revolve around the promotion of shared understanding and identity – particularly among their members. But they also often have a cultural-functionalist bent, and have agendas that pertain to their own possible future growth – whether</text>

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices is not a result of ‘workstation computing’ – the workstation is being replaced by a kind of connected device (or social media) – but of a kind of ‘connectivity’ that results from the new digital technologies. And here, then, we have a kind of ‘how to think about the workstation’ that is not reductive or limiting in its own way, but seeks to respond to the new technologies that are reshaping the workplace in profound ways.The answer to Watson’s question, which is still relevant in 2017, is: what does it mean to be ‘in the present&quot;? What does it mean to be ‘in the present’ as a living thing, capable of ever more transformations and multiples of what we imagine possible? In other words, what does it mean to be ‘in the present’ as a relational form, capable of ever more transfiguration? This ‘intersectionality</text>

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices is only possible because of the rise of surrogates – organisations, individuals, groups – that can be instantiated anywhere and do things with data. In other words, the internet is only possible within the frameworks of the social and connected economy. Social networking and connected devices are only possible because of the rise of Facebook users and journalists, and their constant stream of updates, photos and videos. All these behaviours – the sharing, the browsing, the social networking – are only possible because of the proliferation of data gathering and exchange that takes place on these networks. These new ‘device-apps’ that constantly stream across the internet and collect and process data are only possible because of the expansion of networks that host these ‘data-collecting’ human curiosities. All these new kinds of ‘workstations’ that constantly scan the web and communicate with each other are only possible because of the proliferation of internet-enabled devices.

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices is only possible because of the advent of reliable information technologies that allow for rapid access to data, and thus the site-specific understandsings of labour and production. But this rise is only possible because of the advent of sensors and computing that constantly monitor and transmit data to and within the system, and thereby constantly ask: where is this happening? What does the system know and when does it happen? How does the system know what to do? These are questions that travel back and forth in the system, constantly relaying and constructing the dynamics of the labour and production of life in the world. And yet – and this is perhaps the point – the very act of asking such questions of the system is itself a historically specific and geo-politically diverse process that emerges out of the need to be able to access and digest the latest data and technological innovations.

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices is only possible because of the increased access to data and knowledge mechanisms that come with it. The rise of connectedness is only possible because of the expanded capacity of data to hold and exchange these things (and hence, to talk to each other). The notion of the job-site seems increasingly dubious, and cities are often cited as an example of a city achieving a techno-utopian future through the reduction of bureaucratic infrastructures.1 But here’s the thing: reduction is only ever a first resort. We’ve got to get rid of the jobs that keep coming our way. We’ve got to work through fundamental changes in how we envision the social usefulness of places, and ‘we’ve got to do it again and again and again, until there’s just no turning back.’2 Workplaces need to be transformed, but this only happens when ‘a broad range of stakeholders, local authorities, businesses, activists,</text>

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices such as smart phones and tablets is primarily related to the rise of social media – the ‘device’ – and not just with the explosion of copies of apps that are downloaded and installed on them. This is true not just for software applications, but also for monitoring, surveillance and management software that is bundled with devices today. In this sense, the digital transformation is not just about the technology underlying the devices, but also about the software – the way in which the apps are designed to be used and the degree to which the users are empowered by the software. In other words, the digital footprint of the devices is a significant factor in their decision-making and contemporary behaviour.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleThis article is an edited version of a longer article that appeared in the September 2016 print edition of The New Inquiry.

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices like smartphones and tablets is primarily driven by the needs of big data collators and data-storage providers, which in turn cater to the needs of big data curators and data-collection technologists. Big data – raw, unedited and immediately available – is a data feed, and science fiction writers of yore imagined it so. Yet in the age of connected devices and raw data, a different kind of domination is being challenged: that of the user.As users of connected devices and data-collecting apparatuses, we’re subject to the vagaries of economic, political and social life – the economy is made up of many kinds of actors, and many actors interact continuously across many kinds of worlds – yet we also possess certain inherent rights and freedoms that entitle us to certain kinds of interaction and interactionism is what has come to define the digital divide. In other words, the economy is the site of struggles and conflicts, but it also creates certain entitlements that make it</text>

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices is only ever understood in terms of the job-site of use (or site of production, if you prefer). And this is only the case for those within the techno-utopian capitalist ecosystem – those who hail from cities and the surrounding area and have migrated to the coastal areas around the globe. The ‘North American landscape has largely shifted to the ‘Internet-of-Things’ – where information and data are gathered and exchanged in real-time via the Internet – so the true scene of cyberspace struggles to reclaim the lost meaning of the word ‘place’. The online world is only ever conceived in terms of a site or node in the Internet backbone, and nowhere else. But this is only a ‘node’ – a point in the Internet backbone where data is exchanged between nodes, and not in relation to any particular site or node.

Thus the rise of social media and connected devices such as smartphones and tablets is not due to any revolutionary understanding of the workplace, but is instead due to a proliferation of data-collecting devices and software that can be controlled via a smartphone or tablet. It is to a large extent a device for self-expression and the spread of creativity, but now creativity is understood as a commodity that has to be maximised. In this context, the spread of connected devices such as smart phones and tablets is understood as a production for a capitalist logic that can only be realised in the context of a globally connected economy. Such is the ‘shift in framing’ that social media and connected devices are experiencing in the contemporary world, and this phenomenon is not going to go away anytime soon. The question that remains is whether the new ‘complexity of life’ is produced through the very fact of living in connectedness, or whether it is the other way around: the more interconnected and mobile an object is, the more opportunities it has to</text>

I’ve been called ‘postcolonialist’ by people who know me and see what I’ve become. It’s a question of who can define the postcolonial condition?  And what does it mean to make an analysis?  I’ve been asked this by people who think their place is at the foot of the food chain, who are consumers of food from across the world and who happen to be non-white. They’re saying, ‘I got here via a map and now I see this beautiful landscape and it takes almost no imagination to figure out where I am’. And I’m thinking, ‘But what does it mean for a landscape to be beautiful?’ And the other person is saying, ‘Well, it’s a map. You’ve seen the trouble that race and inequality cause?’ So, the spatial relationship between maps and the social is one where the social is the locus of suffering and the map conveys that to us.

So, ‘postcolonial’ means different things to different people. For me, it’s an area of experience and analysis rather than a fixed position. I’ve been called ‘postcolonialist’ by people who know me and see what I’ve become. It’s a question of who can define the postcolonial condition?  And what does it mean to make an analysis?  I’ve been asked this by people who think their place is at the foot of a tree, where analysis, if it’s correct, will make some sense. But, in the end, it’s the work of the imagination. Imagination is powerful. A memory can’t be bought, nor does it make any sense.  At least, it can’t by itself. I’m thinking about this in relation to the Liverpool Biennial 2018. I’m working with a creative team of artists, writers and community organisers to bring a range of performances and events into the city, taking place in phases over three years. The aim is to create a public realm that is as unpredictable and unpredictable as possible, so as to be both accessible and aspirational. Here, the imagination plays a part that can be measured and understood. With or without analysis, imagination makes things happen. If we want to live in a postcolonial society, then we’ll all have to start working towards an analysis of what the imagination can</text>

So, ‘postcolonial’ means different things to different people. For me, it’s an area of experience and analysis rather than a fixed position. I’ve been called ‘postcolonialist’ by people who know me and see what I’ve become. It’s a question of who can define the postcolonial condition?  And what does it mean to make an analysis?  I’ve been asked this by people who think their place is at the foot of the food chain, in a hierarchy of meanings that derives from their place of birth, migration and social standing in the UK and beyond. It’s a common misreading of the question. The postcolonial condition is one where those at the top of the hierarchy have a clear advantage and where those at the bottom have to struggle. It’s an area of struggle.And there’s another question: what does it mean to make a postcolonial condition? I was asked this by people who think their place is at the foot of the food chain, that is, social, economic and political systems that are influenced by the history and culture of colonialism in different parts of the world. It’s an area of struggle too.I was also asked this by people who work in the area of postcoloniality and identity: what does it mean to make an area ‘postindustrial’?’ The postindustrial economy is one in which the resources of a city</text>

I’ve been asked this by people who think their place is at the foot of the tree, or at least on the outside. They’re either on the outside looking in, or they’re perceiving things through a different set of eyes. And so their sense of the world is constantly shifting and developing. And so there’s a sense of something shifting and unpredictable and open to change. And so there’s a tension. There’s also a sense of betrayal. And so there’s an uncertainty about how the world is actually constructed, and so people have different expectations and frames of reference. And so what you often hear people saying is: ‘I thought you’d never call me colonialist, and I didn’t realize how politically incorrect that was’. And you’d never hear someone say: ‘that was made in China’. Because those are both made in a different frame of reference. Whereas colonialist or neocolonialist thinking in a globalised society is</text>

I’ve been asked this by people who think their place is at the foot of the home, and this is an area when language and cultural exchange are very much on the menu.  The other thing that people have in common is that they’re all still living in the same environment. So there’s a question of who can define the postcolonial condition?  I think people get frustrated when they get similar questions, because they have to struggle with the same question over and over again, and they’re stuck in this dilemma of: ‘what does it mean to be ‘post’?  I see this in the questions people have when they’re young and questioning notions of identity, migration and so on, but I also see it in questions like, ‘what does it mean to be ‘global’? And so on. I’d argue that the postcolonial condition is a very particular set of relations. It’s defined by what it excludes, what it confers, and what it</text>

I’ve been asked this by people who think their place is at the foot of the English language, and who can then, in turn, define what an analysis is?   A few years ago, I made a film about the geography of intersectionality, the intersections of race, class and gender. I used the term ‘intersectionality’ to describe the way in which our society (including the police) constructs and rewards difference, and the fact that in the film, the characters don’t have enough power to change the world. The film was about power and domination, but also about the possibility of change through resistance. It was a powerful tool for the resistance, because it allowed the audience to imagine themselves part of the change, to participate in the change, and to feel empowered in a fundamental way. A few years later, when I made the documentary Backpack, a collective, multi-award-winning body of Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander artists were invited to create a work of art around the location of the film.

We’ve all become complicit in the formation of what’s become.’ I say: ‘Absolutely not.’ I’ve been reading some of the great texts by, for example, Sheila Straughan, whose work on writer’s prisons – her name sounds familiar. She’s writing now about the conditions in which female prisoners are housed. ‘It’s simply not true.’ I’m reading it backwards. It’s 2012.  And I’m being followed on Twitter by people saying things like ‘Postcolonial theory is dead.’  Because it’s being actively contested and changed and it’s not being seen as a place where you can really be embedded, where you can really be embedded in terms of who you</text>

I’ve been asked this by people who think their place is at the foot of the tree, a position from which they can emerge and emerge again with relative ease. For them, the postcolonial condition is a spatial condition that they can define and inhabit. But that’s just spatial. Geographies are made up of relations and interactions of different kinds, and postcolonialism, for me, is about a spatialisation of those relations and interactions. It’s about the ways in which geography reproduces and is shaped by capitalism. It’s about the construction of new kinds of cities and the society that’s built on them.

It’s not like you can walk into a bookstore and find a recipe and it’s not like you can Google ‘enjoyment’ and find out how to have a cake and eat it too. It’s not like that.  You have to ask, what does it take to sustain a culture?  The postcolonial condition, I suppose, is a question that has a kind of finality to it. The question is, who becomes a part of it? The answer is:   You either become a part of it or you don’t. There’s no escape from it</text>

But what kind of human being is this person who desires to consume flesh and blood and to engage in violence against women and children and to destroy the planet in the pursuit of a fix? Who is this person, and what kind of agency does she or he have? If such agencies exist, we can only imagine them as the work of artists who happen to possess the tools required to carry them out. Such visions are not artists' visions, and they certainly are not the agents of artistic productivity that we aspire to.John Nash is a British novelist and essayist. His most recent work, The End of Art was published in 2014.In his book Not What It Seems, Nash describes the impulse behind the aestheticisation of technology and the practicalities of war. In the wake of 9/11, the US military became acutely aware of the extent to which technological innovation was displacing the old forms of government control, and of how the technological enhancements that it enabled were displacing the needs of traditional government security and policy. Drawing heavily on his own experiences in the armed forces, he narrates the disillusionment of soldiers who found themselves sucked into an information</text>

But what kind of human being is this person who desires to consume flesh and blood and to engage in violence against women and children and to destroy the planet in the name of economic growth?As an exhibition format and audience, the Biennale has a particular way of bringing together the interests of many different kinds of people into a shared discourse. This is particularly true of transnational exhibitions, but also of biennials and the like. The issue of who is a human being and who is not is frequently used as a barometer of social conditions. There is a reason why the Human Rights Campaign is able to campaign for and against the Biennale with such power. It is that it is able to define who is a human being and who is not. The question is frequently framed as one of difference and who is not. But what kind of difference is that? What kind of difference is made when people are made to feel that they are subject to a particular social contract? What kind of difference is made when people are made to feel that they are victims of a particular regime?In answering this question, we might notice a common feature that runs</text>

But what kind of human being is this person who desires to consume flesh and blood and to engage in violence against women and children and to destroy the planet? What kind of human being would embark on such a project? Nash did not identify the kind of person such a person would be, but the audience certainly knew what kind of person she or he was.And yet how to discern what kind of person such a person is? How to identify what kind of power she or he wields in the marketplace? For Nash, the problem with capitalism is not so much about abstract concepts such as freedom and justice – concepts that individuals can identify with – but about the actual ways in which people acquire and use those concepts. For example, the ability to consume flesh and blood – to produce bodies and organs for medical research and consumption – is a far cry from the ability to identify one's own flesh and blood as a product of human labour. Freedom and justice are abstractions, but the capacity to consume flesh and blood is a capacity that exerts significant political and economic influence. Freedom and justice are objects of consumption, but abstracting from their significance the capacity to</text>

But what kind of human being is this person who desires to consume flesh and blood and to engage in violence against women and children and to destroy the planet in the name of economic growth? I would argue that the kind of human being who forms the basis for an object of art is something entirely different.Nash’s answer to the question 'what is the human being that creates the worlds we inhabit?' is simple. He asks, instead, ‘what kind of humanity is that which endures through the sustained repetition of the same set of relations?’[5] And so we can identify the kind of humanity that produces objects in the gallery: the kind that creates landscapes, that produces architecture and that produces art. The kind of humanity that produces narratives in the media is something entirely different. Narrative is the organizing principle of the media, and the kind of humanity that produces them is something completely different.In his famous essay ‘Transcendental Meditation’, philosopher Peter Singer distinguishes two kinds of humanity: the kind that produces narratives and poetry, which he defines as follows: ‘really understand the language of experience;</text>

What kind of human being would advocate such actions? Nash himself was an anarchist.Art and art historians have generally viewed the anti-authoritarian, anti-authoritarian tradition as one in which resistance to authority is maximized. But there are those among us who believe that we must learn how to identify those who work for and with the state in order to build resistance against their violence and repression. As a first step, we might begin by asking: what is at stake in this struggle between those who have a moral obligation and those who do not?In this regard, the resistance to police violence and oppression is personal. I came to understand the necessity of becoming activists not as individuals, but as a collective. I later joined a network of artists, writers, artists' collective members and artists' unions in order to become politically engaged and engaged, and eventually to become an administrator of an arts collective. My principal task was to oversee the activities</text>

And what kind of human being is this person who engages in these things in the name of a political party? Nash’s reference to ‘a popular revolution’ is a perfect echo of our time.The final section of the book documents the work of artists and their struggles to engage with the politics of their subject matter and to create creative alternatives.[5] It is fascinating to me that the academy, which ostensibly wants to educate itself about art and art history, is now so intent on excluding and demonizing its practitioners that it fails to see the forest for the trees, the city for the city, and the public commons for the public commons – the very social fabric of the city – while it attempts to build a Public Realm around the exchange of commodities. The failure to see the forest for the trees, the city for the city and the public commons for the public commons constitutes a form of political culture that seeks to subvert and negate the very notion of a public realm, while</text>

But what kind of human being is this person who desires to consume flesh and blood and to engage in violence against women and children and to destroy the planet in the name of economic growth? How is this account consistent with the broader socio-political context of contemporary capitalism? Nash might have responded that the contemporary public gallery would do well to bear in mind that its patron was not a politician but a philosopher – a philosopher who was better placed than any of us to judge contemporary art. Modern philosophy might reconsider the kinds of thinking that produce contemporary art and the discourses that shape it. But it would also do well to bear in mind that its patron was neither a philosopher nor a politician but a merchant marine lord and a lawyer who wanted to expand his client base and maximise his profits through legal means? It might help to recall how, during the 1930s, Baldwin’s client was a coalition of landlords and business leaders determined to keep out of the rental market, while artists, critics and others who bought and shared the building were locked out. The fight for access to housing and the legal profession was pitched as ‘Land to which do we dedicate</text>

If there is such a thing as a ‘public gallery’ then surely there is a ‘public gallery’ for the purposes of its ownership?If there is, then perhaps, an answer to Nash’s question: which of his paintings could be considered a public contribution to the welfare of future generations? Perhaps, if the future generations are to inherit the paintings, they might well ask which of the following four heads of state was delivered by the hand of each other? Perhaps, since this is the case, we could say that each of the four portraits on the tapestry was delivered by a different artist, and that the public gallery would be the site of exchange between the different contributers. Perhaps, in this scenario, the public gallery could be a kind of participatory museum, inviting and exhibiting the contributions of all artists who happen to reside or work in the neighbourhood.The proposal that the public gallery should be a kind of ‘museum of exchange’</text>

People might have their origins in slavery, indentured servitude or the sex trade. People might come from all walks of life and come to the same place in the same time. But what they don’t know or don’t understand about where they come from, or why they’re here, is what happens next. These are questions that artists, writers and artists’organisations around the world have long since solved. They just don’t know what to do with the information. This is the world we live in now. But what if the question were not, as it currently stands, about where we come from but rather – what kind of world can we make together? What if the question were, instead, about where we can</text>

A historical example is John Lennon’s participation in the Dublin Bus Éireann fair in January 1970, where he sold out of a 30-strong entourage of Lennon-fuelled fans in order to take part in a publicity stunt. As Brian Hayes observes, ‘[T]he incident highlights a larger trend: musicians, dance groups and poets of the time were among the most visible users of social media’.[6]Hayes is referring to the fact that ‘prior to the 1970s, social media was a scarce commodity, limited by access and control’.[7] And</text>

In particular, the micro-infrastructure sector (which includes the development and promotion of physical and social infrastructure, including roads, bridges, tunnels, ports, water supplies and urban environments) is frequently cited as a source of vulnerability for communities and is often conceptualized as if it were a black hole with no visible outlet.1  In this writing, I seek to suggest several candidates for future research or publication in the micro-infrastructure sector, based on my experiences in the field as a journalist, educator or researcher and reflecting on my own thinking and process around race and inclusion in Indigenous communities. I also seek to suggest ways in which the field can be improved through collaborations with Indigenous communities and other interested parties, in order to create a more inclusive and productive environment for future researchers and others to come. 1  Research in Development Economics, Vol. 21, No. 2, 2002, p.335. 2  Informal meetings with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders, Indigenous Affairs Victoria, 1995–98. 3  </text>

In particular, the micro-infrastructure sector (which includes the development and funding of social infrastructure including health, education, housing and parks) is frequently cited as a source of racialized/national disparities.2  While research on the ‘real-life’ (i.e.  	not in a laboratory) needs to be based in communities, recent research suggests that many other factors are also at work in the context of daily life. For instance, in a study of over 2,000 commuters in London, researchers at Goldsmiths College and University of London found that drivers were significantly more likely to hit pedestrians or cyclists (or both) when behind the wheel.3  In a study of more than 9,000 commuters in San Francisco, researchers found that drivers were significantly more likely to hit pedestrians or cyclists when overtaking and passing cyclists or walking speeders, even though the risk to hit a pedestrian or cyclist increases with vehicle speed.4  In a 2009 study of over 11,000 commuters in San Francisco, psychologist</text>

In particular, the micro-infrastructure sector (which includes the development and funding of infrastructure, including roads, ports, housing, schools, hospitals, law and justice) is often cited as an example of an infrastructure that is 'infrastructure-specificised' and is therefore prone to corruption and often inefficient. This is often attributed to the ‘infrastructure-minimising' role of political, economic and socio-cultural elites in the ‘design and ‘funding of infrastructure’. However, a growing body of research suggests that the infrastructural industry does not need to impose its will on developing regions or society in order to operate efficiently and effectively. In fact, research has shown that political, economic and social variables play a much greater role in infrastructure development (McGowan and Whitehead, 2015). For instance, infrastructure development in the 1980s and 1990s was heavily influenced by the interests of the multilateral oil corporations (Big Six) and their regional patrons (Latin America, Australia, Norway and Kuwait).

In particular, the micro-infrastructure sector (which includes the development and funding of housing, infrastructure, community and education infrastructure) is frequently cited as a place of engagement and a motivator of ‘zero tolerance’ towards racialised/national disparities, especially in relation to issues of race and ethnicity in housing development and policy. In this report, we examine three distinct types of vulnerability to racialized/national disparities: economic (economic factors such as displacement and poverty), political and legal (such as racialised/nationalised borders and territories), and social (such as racialised/national poverty and disadvantage). We focus particularly on the economic in this context because it is the site of the largest proportion of racialized/national disparities and is therefore likely to be the most readily available to researchers and artists interested in exploring racialized/national disparities. The economic is the most readily quantifiable place to live in terms of both price and quantity, and thus offers the most readily identifiable and representable set of vectors towards racialized/nationalized marginalised and exploited populations.

The negative portrayal of Indigenous/aboriginal people as inherently unintelligent, submissive or (potentially) resourceful has been facilitated by the media when depicting Indigenous/aboriginal people as inherently resourceful or creative.

In particular, the micro-infrastructure sector (which includes the development and promotion of infrastructure, including roads, ports, levees, tunnels, bridges, railroads and wastewater treatment plants) is often cited as a source of racialized/nationalized variation within and between communities. In this writing, I employ the term ‘infrastructure’ to refer to the socio-political systems that support and are dependent upon racialized/nationalized groups, and ‘infrastructures’ to refer to the physical infrastructure (including land, buildings, tracks, pipes, wires, cement, unreinforced metal and more) supporting such groups.  Infrastructures are primarily located in urban centres and provide essential services to such populations. However, they are also highly politicized, infrastructuralist in nature and dependent on geopolitical events such as resource scarcity and geopolitical instability. The modern infrastructural is a complex system that depends on geopolitical events such as the end of the Cold War, the proliferation of state-sponsored terrorism, the expansion of military</text>

In particular, the micro-infrastructure sector (which includes the development and funding of infrastructure, including roads, ports, telecommunications, roads and rail systems) is often cited as a vector whereby economic development and racialized/national disparities can and do occur, often contributing to the development of conditions conducive to the emergence of socially and politically aware minorities. However, despite the clear and growing literature and studies on the role of infrastructure in generating and supporting socio-politically aware communities, increasing numbers of Australians are discovering that the provision of infrastructure is not always what is desired. For instance, projects funded by the federal and state governments with clear links to key policy makers, including the transport infrastructure, often see their primary purpose as the promotion of political and economic power structures. In this view, citizens have little or no say in the provision of infrastructure, which is instead either white or predominately constructed.  A growing number of voices, including urban planners, urbanists, engineers and architects are coming together to challenge this de-anarchistic view and institutional bias.  A voice that</text>

In particular, the micro-infrastructure sector (which includes the development and funding of infrastructure, including roads, ports, rail and water) has long been a focus of research and discourse. In this context, looking back at the history of infrastructure funding and the displacement of people and the planet alike opens up new perspectives and paradigms.  One example of this in the 1990s is the Castlemilk Dam Nuclear Generating Station, which was intended to provide electricity for northern Australia but was ultimately geared towards producing hydrocarbon energy for export at a later date. In a review of the dam and its impact on the local environment and Indigenous people’s ability to control such resources, a range of academics, including myself, draw parallels with the history of infrastructure projects in Australia and the United States. It is important to note that this was not a case of an isolated or isolated set of infrastructural failures, but instead presents a situation where politics, economics and politics of access are constantly intermingled in an attempt to meet government targets and achieve certain</text>

In particular, the micro-infrastructure sector (which includes the development and growth of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, ports, levees, levees, tunnels, ports of trade and infrastructure management) is often considered to be an environmentally beneficial investment for communities and economies.1 It is often argued that development projects such as the harbourfront redevelopment project in Melbourne, which is predominantly white-owned and predominantly located in the city, are in fact responses to the challenge posed by the urban sprawl that has overtaken much of the country.2  This has led to the promotion of ‘white-owned’ minority-owned businesses such as those in the micro-finance sector, which is often characterised by heterogeneous ownership structures.3  Micro-infrastructure has often been seen as a uniquely valuable asset for communities and has even been recognised as a potential solution for some forms of infrastructure deficiency in Australia, such as in remote Indigenous communities.4  As a point of departure, it is useful to recall that the micro-finance</text>

The symposium will allow each of</text>
    <text>counterpoint of automata might offer alien perspectives on the same world. The question is whether such parallel worlds are possible, or whether they are the product of human imagination, or whether something more fundamental is at work. This is the subject of a forthcoming project, ‘Interstate symposium: parallel dimensions of the self’, led by Professors Lilia Moritz Schwarc and Peer Gyu Lim at the University of California, San Diego. The symposium is the result of a year-long joint research project between UCSD and Los Alamos National Laboratory, in the US, during the latter’s Erasmus Center for the Philosophy of Life, where the theoretical and computational frameworks of computational biology and artificial intelligence are discussed. The symposium will focus on two parallel but related tracks: how individuals can (and cannot) perceive the world through representational media, and how (syn)aesthetics can (and should) influence the perception and apprehension of the real. The symposium will be open to the media and public, and will witness firsthand the converging of different cultures, different times, and different places. It will be a place where questions of identity, belonging, race, language, place, and history collide. It will be a place of feelings, and perhaps a place of understanding. The symposium is a chance for participants to emerge, demonstrate, and present their own perspectives, take on a position, and present the latest in computer and algorithmic programming, science, and technology. It is a chance to ask questions and to create a scene. It is a chance to ask and to receive answers. Some people call it ‘episodic ‘. The symposium will be shown in reverse chronological order, and the participants will have the opportunity to change or cancel it at any time. This presents the opportunity to ‘spot the change’ and ‘stack the change’, as the participant selection criteria may change at any time. For more information, please visit: https</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the people who visit the museums and the galleries; the people who make art and design; the people who are made culturally creative; the people who come to the shows and engage with the cultural practices; and the people who actually use the buildings and make the buildings work. All of these people and all of those people’s contributions are important, but they are not what makes a museum a museum. What makes a museum a museum is the people who visit it. When we talk about the contribution of an individual to a cultural practice, we tend to neglect the fact that person’s actual contribution can be as important as that person’s idea or skill. What we tend to do instead is value that person’s idea and skill more highly than we do our own. And so we construct these abstract concepts and concepts that capture people’s imaginations and thoughts. We do this in part by treating individuals as though they are pieces in a vast puzzle, and in part by</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the struggles and triumphs and social consequences of individual acts – in order to focus on the specific. But the museum is a site of social action and production, and its true form is direct action. It is direct action through the museum, but in a much more complex and subtle way. The museum is a powerful cultural tool, but it is only powerful in the way that it is exploited and perverted by those with a political and economic agenda. At the same time, the museum must be scrutinised and modified in order to effectively engage and produce at a grassroots level in the present and future development of society. To me, the museum is the epicentre of political and economic change, and its continued structural structural dependence on capitalist culture is a project of the status quo, but it is made increasingly difficult and unequal by the museum’s role. The museum is a site of power and control, yet it is made increasingly visible through its collections and exhibitions. The result is a continuous shifting of</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the stories and the politics that play out in those buildings every day. The museum is a site of production, a place where labour is performed, a marketplace where ideas are exchanged, and finally, a place where those ideas are repeated and interpreted – that is, of production and of stories. I mentioned earlier that the mission of the museum is to display, display, display. I think this is still the case, but the mission of the museum as a whole is shifting, and I see a shift occurring at the molecular level. I believe that what we mean when we talk about the mission of the museum is actually the mission of the museum as a whole.I think that the biennial is a museum that exhibits the real history of a place – a place that is constantly changing and constantly developing, constantly on the point of being transformed – and this is really what we mean when we talk about the place as a museum. We store the real history of a place in concrete, glass, metal, wood</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the people who use the building, the people who work there, the struggles and triumphs and achievements that create and revolve around it – and this is why institutions can be so powerful generators of social change. They are able to provide a site of exchange and social action – a place where people gather, exchange, network and think freely. But this is not all they do. The museum is a site of power, and as we have seen, the museum is dependent on the public for its continued viability. Therefore, if the museum is to survive and thrive in this increasingly complex world of social media, it is critical that the social become embedded in the museum’s processes and that ‘the other’ come to the museum in order to be taken 'inside the museum’. This is why biennials often find themselves struggling with the problem of cultural tourism, or what Erving Moravec (one of the curators on this current Liverpool Biennial) recently described as</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the struggles, achievements and politics of our times – and focus on the individual museums that we are privileged to be a part of. But what a museum can do is create an experience that is very much its own thing. It is true that the primary function of the museum is to hold things in stock, display them in a particular way, and present them effectively, and this is all very much what the biennial has done throughout its history. But what museums can do is expand and deepen their mission, and this is why the biennial has had to be such a radical shift in its mission and became so influential in its cities. It is not enough to simply teach a story; a museum has to engage people in a meaningful way in order to produce a lasting cultural impact. The institution had to go beyond this to produce a lasting change in how people engage with their time and culture. This was a much greater challenge for the biennial that I think of as occurring during the 1990s and early 2000</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the humanity, the complexity, the humanity of the world we live in, the interconnectedness of our lives – and we forget that human beings are made up of things we call ‘bodies’. The body is a made up of parts, is a living unit, but it is only a made up part of the whole. We tend to think of the body as relatively static and unremarkable, but the body that we inhabit is subject to change and change and to decay. Every living thing on this planet is subject to the biennial, and thus the museum becomes an ever more significant site of presence and persistence. It is true that the biennial has had to become more transnational and international in order to achieve the institutionalised form required by the art museum, but this has happened largely because of the proliferation of museums and their collections, which were able to absorb the mass of visitors and visitors into their collections. The sheer volume of the museum-going public has become an issue, and</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the humanity, the complexity, the infrastructures – that make up the museum. The museum is a site of production, a site of exchange, a site of domination, but it is also a site of domination. That is, the museum as such seems to be the site of the highest levels of exploitation, where the working-class man makes himself fully visible, where class struggle is actively experienced, where power is exerted over space and time, where creativity and knowledge are actively suppressed. To some extent, this is true for museum visitors. But, to an extent, the museum is an artifact of a particular historical moment in which working-class men and women made a particular contribution. The significance of this in the present context, in relation to what is considered to be the museum's &quot;great&quot; exhibitionality, can be seen in the exhibition I curated from the 1960s: the New Museum (1964), which is divided into three parts: the Working Class Mother (1960), the tomb of</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the subtleties and nuances of people becoming people – because we tend to value the abstract picture more. But the museum is a powerful site for a number of reasons. It provides a physical and mental backdrop to talk about, and a forum for development discussions, debates and interpretations. It is a site of exchange between people of various sorts, and it enables us to imagine the possibilities of different worlds. By tracing the development of ideas and concepts in this or that way, or through reflection, and then tracing those ideas back to the origins of things, the museum becomes a site of power and possibility. And here is where the biennial comes in. It is a site of exchange between different forms of artistic production, a site of creativity in its many forms, a site of exchange between cultures, a site of meeting places and networks, and a scene of interaction between people. It is a place of relationship, and it is a site of relationships between people. The question here is not which museum is better</text>

When we think about what a museum is today, we tend to think of large buildings and abstract concepts. We tend to ignore the bigger picture – the dynamic interconnection between people, places, and things – because we tend to value the abstract over the specific. When we think about community art or grassroots initiatives, we tend to neglect the details and focus on the bigger picture when it comes to initiatives that are rooted in people. When it comes to art institution-building or community engagement, we tend to neglect the details and cultivate the situation through what is often called a ‘big data’ or analytics approach. In the context of art institution-building or community engagement, a museum or gallery might be considered a resource that can be utilised to move things forward – that is, able to contribute something to the larger culture of the art world that is not confined within its walls. There is a danger, however, in overemphasising the museum as a site of cultural production and in the tendency to confine cultural production to the museum. The museum is a site of production for certain kinds of art, and it is possible to produce art</text>

In the city, we can look to find the beginning of an act, where ideas and acts of making come together. In the case of the Liverpool Biennial, the beginning of an act is right around the corner from where I live.I started by asking people to imagine a different kind of city – one in which people started early and stayed late, and where there was a sense of community. I then asked them to draw a few specific city scenes from their imaginations, and proposed a few more still. After that, we developed a framework around the various city scenes that they could draw, and imagined doing a street scene out of them. Then we asked them to explain each one to a stranger. Some suggested using landmarks, while others asked us to find a way to identify the places based on their names. Some suggested using data, while others asked</text>

I think that the technological innovations of the past few decades could be put down to the fact that there is now more than ever a need for a scientific and scholarly consensus on a given subject, something like the time when there was a dearth of scholarly consensus on the role of the Metric System in the measurement of mass. The advent of satellite imagery and the expansion of digital imaging has profoundly changed how we measure and communicate; we can no longer rely on conceptions of mass as something immovable and tangible and identifiable by a single unit of measure. We can now quantify and communicate the extent to which something is present, and to what extent; we can also quantify and communicate the amount of energy being used in producing that substance. I think that is really at the core of what is happening, and that is really one that cannot be underestimated.What is happening now is that what used to be called the Common Core State Standards has become something called Partnership State Standards</text>

These are the kinds of questions that need to be asked and developed, and they are the kinds of questions that can initiate and direct a project like that described in the text.The space of the biennale needs to be global in scope and organised across time and places. It is not enough to consider the past; one also needs to think future. The biennale needs to be able to interpret and address particular cultural and historical contexts, and it is not enough to simply pick and choose from those who come to it. The question of where, when and with whom to be encountered in one's own culture is a different kind of question, and one that demands a different kind of interpretation. The biennale needs to be visited by a global audience, and that means being met by people from all over the world. So the question becomes, where can we meet, and what kind of venue can we meet?

If the city were a living organism, the resources and educational opportunities available to residents today would be limited only by the imagination of those residents who chose to adopt the language and culture of the city. But because the city is so sedentary and unconscious, residents of the city have an even greater access to knowledge and culture during the peak hours and in the most profound moments of the city, as opposed to other places. Consequently, the resources available to an artist in the city during the peak hours of the city, as opposed to other places, can be quite a bit more potent. For instance, if an artist adopts the language of the neighbourhood and adopts the cultural practices of the neighbourhood, and the resources</text>

It is a hybrid document, with elements from the present and elements from the past. It is a set of goals and objectives that can be mutually exclusive, and which identify certain behaviours that are compatible with and incompatible with the prevailing order of things. It is a proposal that seeks to create a ‘city with a future’ through research and ideas that it has collected over the past two decades, but also through interventions that it has staged in the city’s development over the past two decades, to become a kind of prototype for future cities to emulate and learn from. And it is a proposal that seeks to incorporate the city’s cultural and heritage assets into a new kind of urban being, one that is responsive to the needs of people</text>

I think that Dergue is asking us to imagine a city in which the inhabitants can choose to reside or to emigrate; a city in which the cultural sector can flourish or it can wither; a city in which there is no fixed address and can be anywhere in the world; and finally a city in which there is no fixed point of entry or exit but can, with the right to do so, change its location and scheme of operations.These are not trivial conceptions for a city to contemplate and negotiate, or even to inhabit in general, but they are matters of fact of which the city is conscious, and to which the inhabitants are ultimately responsible. The question, then, shifts from what is the correct mode of urbanization for a city to that of residence itself, and this negotiation of location and mode involves more than the negotiation of space itself. It involves negotiations over what is meant by ‘resident’ and the place where</text>

For the city to inhabit and function effectively, it needs to be cosmopolitan; it needs to attract businesses and financial institutions, and it needs to have a basic infrastructure capable of supporting a city in its day-to-day life, but capable of supporting a city in its dreams, too.In an ideal world, the core competencies for a city ‘wouldn’ – if we could call them that – include but are not limited to: public realm (public space), public realm (the urban environment), and public realm (the social realm). The city would function much like the international institutions that it is: capable of sustaining itself through commerce and the provision of services to meet the needs of citizens, but also capable of dreaming and having wild and fantastic and unpredictable and sometimes wonderful dreams, too. The core competencies of an urban institution would be what MMM once called ‘transcendent local powers’; powers that would affect all aspects of the city, but distinguish between local and national, and of course between citizens and other citizens, and between human and nonhuman social forms.

The key is urban; it is an essential ingredient of any city’s success. The city has a role to play in the transformation of the city, but it is much more effective and long-lasting in this way, and the city is the site of the future’s potential wealth and power.  	The city is the site of the future’s potential wealth and power because it is a ‘site of employment, education, exchange and politics’.2 This is a crucial point. Today’s economy does not allow for the sustained employment of millions of workers; large parts of the economy are still run by large corporations and their boards of directors. The city is the site of the potential future wealth of a billion people, but that is not enough to fuel the growth of a global megacity; a billion people are not enough to feed the world’s growing population.

The city today is a complex system of control, but it is also a city of possibilities. The city has the potential to become a place where artists can exist in a more authentic way, where people can come and live and work and play freely, and to enter into collective and collective forms of knowledge. Creative forms of urbanization and development are possible only if the city is able to foster and support such aspirations, and it is up to local authorities to take such a city in their stride.But the city today is also a city of control; it controls everything that passes through it, and yet it lacks the power to do anything about it. That is, the city lacks the capacity to enact change on its own, without the support of a strong political and legal system, and yet it also lacks the institutional capacity to implement such change. That is, the city needs skilled labourers and urban planners and policymakers equipped with the knowledge and the skills</text>

The city has to be able to support life’s activities, including the activities of culture and the creative acts that seem necessary in a capitalist city.Doubtless, the city also needs the culture of the city, and the culture of culture, but it also needs the culture of war, drama, poetry, criticality and so forth. The biennale has to offer something that is both aesthetically pleasing to the eye (since no city is an island), and psychologically challenging to the psyche. It’s a real challenge to conceive of the city in terms of cultural islands, since the activities on those islands are often quite different from the activities on an island, and so the functions of the biennale have to be able to accommodate all of these cultural practices. The challenge in my mind is two-fold: First, to what extent are cultural islands generated by and available to certain cultural practices? Second,</text>

These tend to be led by people with a clear set of priorities: whether it’s the pursuit of commercial jet stream expansion or the enhancement of military spy satellites, the kinds of missions these firms typically do require a great deal of autonomy.

These workers don’t own the worlds they inhabit; they’re constructed. Nevertheless, the terraforming they do entail inevitably produces rights that are derivative of the ownership of these worlds, and these rights, I argue, are entwined with the narratives that we tell ourselves about ourselves as workers in the logic of capitalist planet-construction.

These workers don’t yet know that their labour is becoming socially and politically transformed through the use of biopolitics – that is, the production of identities – and so they’re caught unawares as the planet is cordoned off and mapped. 	So, we can say that the adoption of new technologies and the social organisation of large-scale social change are made possible by the production of identities. And yet, these social means aren’t given to all people equally.

These workers may have rights as workers in low-wage service industries, but they also have rights when they're dispatched to do dangerous jobs in colonized worlds. The reason why so many in the tech industry rallied around the idea of  	Deep Space when it came up in the aftermath of 9/11 is that they saw it as a prelude to more expansive uses of the technology. The ability to map the planet, to capture its biodiversity, to analyse its geography – these were all technologies that gave rise to a new mode of social organisation and political power. These workers may not have been envisioning their futures as workers in low-wage service industries, but they certainly had access to the resources of a robust feminist movement. The ability to readjust – to recount past behaviours and exert agency in the future – was a central concept to the ecological logic of the tech industry.

The reason for this shift in perspective is that the technologies that give us shape and identity also produce terraforming and industrial flows that shape the planet in ways that are largely determined by the interests of the multinational corporations that employ hundreds of thousands of people in what are essentially complex social and spatial relations. So while the decisions that shape the shape of the planet today largely derive from the interests of the multinational corporations that created them, the decisions we as individuals and species make as individuals and species make up the bulk of the change. Deep Space Industries (2004),  	Deep Space Industries, p.1.  5  	 	The notion of the ‘colony’ seems to have gained a presence and prominence in the popular imagination during the 1980s and 1990s, first in science-fiction and then in films such as Blade Runner and Terminator. It’s an idea with clear, perhaps even decisive, consequences for the future of our species.  Whether the ‘colony’ is defined narrowly as the collective of all people descended from the same ancestral stock (as is often the case) or more expansively as the species itself, retains some ambiguity in our thinking. For example, the notion of the �</text>

If we take the project of  	Deep Space Industries (2004), for example, we see that it’s not the colonizers who develop the worlds in which we live, but rather those who colonize us when we grow up. The reason for this shift in perspective is that the technologies that give us shape and identity also produce terraforming and industrial flows that shape the planet in ways that are largely determined by the interests of the multinational corporations that employ hundreds of thousands of people in the production of commodities and by the financial institutions that control the economy. These flows of information and ideas ultimately determine what kind of future societies we can build – whether we can call them ‘colonies’ or ‘founding units’ or ‘outposts’ or ‘regimes’ – but they also determine what kinds of institutions and social structures can build those societies. In short, the future is determined by how the past shapes what kinds of future possibilities are available.  In the case of planetary colonization, the interests of large corporations and their dynasties are ultimately determined by the interests of multinational dynasties – that is, by the needs of the capitalist economy as a whole. And the future that emerges from that crisis of global capitalism is likely to be dominated by the interests of the multinational corporate empire.

The reason for this shift in perspective is that the technologies that give us shape and identity also produce terraforming and industrial flows that shape the planet in ways that are largely determined by the interests of the multinational corporations that employ hundreds of thousands of people in what I would call ‘black-hole’like environments across the world. These black-hole environments exist because of the magic of the multiverse – the very laws of physics that allow giant, interconnected universes to be formed – but they also exist because of the organizing ambition of the multinationals who employ hundreds of thousands of people in what I would call ‘knowledge economy’ – i.e.  	Information Superhighway 1. These theories of emergent meaning and technological singularities are what give rise to the spectacle and spectacle produces movements. The invention of the automobile in 1916 ushered in a new era of mass-produced cars that could be assembled in factories across the world and shipped to markets around the globe. The need for massive port facilities, massive freight networks, and massive transshipment points to account for the attraction of these new forms of industrial production. But these factors of production are only meant to support the infrastructure that creates the spectacle. The larger, more diverse</text>

The reason for this shift in perspective is that the technologies that give us shape and identity also produce terraforming and industrial flows that shape the planet in ways that are largely determined by the interests of the multinational corporations that employ hundreds of thousands of people in socially destructive ‘commercial’ activities.The shift from the abstract to the specific comes about as a consequence of a phenomenon known as ‘infrastructure’ – the physical and virtual paraphernalia that make up what is sometimes called the ‘postindustrial zone’. Infrastructures are often conceptualized as if they’re invisible, but in fact they employ a great deal of visible media – television sets, billboards, post offices, street lights, telephones, building heating and air conditioning systems, garbage collection points and so forth. The adoption of new technologies invariably entails new modes of socio-political organization and they employ vast amounts of labour to monitor and control them, making them what sociologist Helga Nowotny calls ‘systems obsessions’. This is why new technologies require massive amounts of monitoring and control over their users’ behaviour, making them what sociologist Michele Kelemen would call ‘systemic obsessions’. </text>

So while the interests of the global capitalist machine might sometimes conflict with the rights of indigenous people, in the end the interests of the multinationals are always aligned with those of the global capitalist system. The only way to stop this happening is for society to organise in progressive and liberating ways. This is why so many in the social-democracy camp in the 1970s and 80s embraced participatory methods of organising society, and why, decades later, anarchists would return to reclaiming the practice from the state. It was a rejection of bureaucratic and neo-liberal authority, not its empowerment, that made the participation possible. 	And although the visionary practices of the participatory artist such as  	Assembly Line, New Labour and Shop Of course, had some redeeming qualities, as noted by Peter Brook in his review of the 1980 Brighton Biennial: ‘The biennale as a curatorial practice had begun to give up on imposing its distinctive visual</text>

These multinational corporations then employ the techniques that the indigenous people have developed in response to these worlds’ use as raw materials for biofuels and other technologies that put pressure on indigenous people’s bodies and psyches. These indigenous responses vary widely in type and quality – from the placeless to the activist to the revolutionary – but all of them ultimately involve violence or other forms of oppression against Indigenous people. The technologies that give shape to these oppressive systems ultimately end up serving the interests of a settler colonialist power structure.  And here we can move from considering the world as an object (space and people) to considering it as an object (species).

Others are trying to create and pilot fully functional artificial neural networks in their own right, but these have to go through rigorous scientific and legal vetting before being put into widespread deployment.

As Margaret Atwood, in her book Something Wicked This Way Comes Along, reminds us, humans are the point of the machine’s focus.2In essence, then, upcycling of concepts is a way to reorient concepts in response to change. It is a way to imagine new ways of organizing things, new worlds where things don’t align, in opposition to the old order. And yet, as Atwood reminds us, such imaginative potentialities are precluded by the larger machinations of the social. For one thing, the social cannot be imagined without the machine, which is constantly evolving and constantly evolving’s own social dynamics dictate what is expected of it, which necessarily entails giving in to natural tendencies towards normality. Moreover, the social is not imagined in terms of immutable immutable facts; social structures are constantly evolving, and as new data becomes available, old data becomes more valuable, which in turn generates ever more creative ways of organizing</text>

Indeed, the voice is the decisive factor in whether a situation is positive or negative, and whether an object is aesthetically pleasing or not. If the voice is drowned out, or completely unavailable, then the situation is likely to be one in which the individual is left with a ‘language barrier’ – a fact that is often emphasized in advertising copy regarding beauty treatments.2  The upshot of this double sense of upcycling is that products that are aesthetically pleasing to one extreme will also likely be aesthetically appealing to the other.  Such is the upshot of an upcycling of concepts: positive and negative, present and future, present and past. The critical notion here is that products that are aesthetically pleasing to one extreme will also likely be aesthetically appealing to the other, and that upcycling occurs precisely because concepts are so ubiquitously represented within the human language.Thus, upcycling allows us to collectively imagine things through a single point of view</text>

As Margaret Atwood so poignantly put it, when subjected to the monstrosity of advanced artificial intelligence, a person becomes something like a ‘living computer chip’.2  This sounds so trivial now, but imagine if artificial intelligence offered a platform to debate and design future policies and socialities? Could ‘programmings’ be renegotiated to address specific concerns and desires of the public? Could ‘curated’ events be curated to suit specific interests? Could programming become a mode of public participation? Could programming offer a mode of creative resistance? If so, then perhaps we could create peer-to-peer ­apps that not only map existing events to user-created ‘eventbrings’ but also harness the power of programming to revolutionize how we live our futures. Eventbrings are software programs that aid in the creation of ‘place­­–altered’ futures by ­indulging in the magic of deter</text>
    <text>counterpoint of automata might offer alien perspectives on the human condition, in which humans are but machines perpetually aspire to a future of total automation. The upshot of this upcycling of ‘big picture’ concepts is a conceptually transparent negation of the intrusion of individual taste buds into the sphere of the machine, a conceptually opaque negation of taste that could equally be applied to the phenomenon of taste itself.  If, however, the upcycling of concepts is an art project, then the final product will always contain traces of the taint of relativism.

In this account, the character of Eve is such that she or he somehow manages to find meaning in the cacophony of noises surrounding them. In the novel, this is accomplished by turning ‘human speech’ into a science, turning language into code, and then using that code to do things such as deciphering ancient texts, or deciphering gibberish, or, as in the case of HAL, deciphering nonsensical signals sent by HAL in response to his or her ‘not knowing what it meant to be human’.2  Such claims, and the projects that were or are claimed to be based on them, are frequently presented as if they derive from a vacuum or take place in fantastical underground monoliths or alien brains. But in truth, most such claims spring directly from the ivory towers or within the prevailing ideologies of the major artworlds or mainstream cultural establishments. And while it is true that artistic endeavours have often been driven by white artists</text>

As Margaret Atwood so elegantly put it, in relation to the Ainu song ‘Tsumari no Uta’, ‘Machines sing louder than words, and the human gets caught up in the noise’.2At the end of the nineteenth century, linguists started to realise that certain syntactic rules that existed in Proto-Indo-European could be applied to non-European languages, including Hindustani and Aramaic, as well as to Greek and Latin. These rules, collectively titled Lex Neuwirth– Proto-Indo-European Lex, later given the name घSprachgefühlsis’, emerged as a result of the power of unification underlying the prevailing European idea of progress. In other words, not only are words political, but linguistic change-agents, agents that shape cultural evolution and reality, even if the human voice remains the primary locus of political action. This idea, which was gaining</text>

As Nina Edgell Puleo, a leader in the upcycling of cultural values, once said, ‘There is no such thing as a free lunch.’2 This observation by Edgell Puleo marks an important point in the history of social theory. As early as the 1920s, in an effort to make the social more accessible and individualistic, in response to the rise of mass media and the marketplace of ideas, social theorists began to theorize the capacity of social media to pave the way for collective action. Social theorist Edward Burtyns once wrote that the genesis of modern industry lay in the discovery and theorization of how to use social media.3 In the wake of the popularity of mass media, social theorists began to look back to the past and speculate about the possibilities for the future through figures such as Thomas Allsen, whose ideas gained currency during the Great Depression. Allsen argued that the critical forces driving technological innovation were the direct outcome of a massive</text>

As Elizabeth Grosz shows in her research on the voice of the Minimalist movement, individuals ‘who have found their voice’ often function as monitors of sorts, recording and recording-equating processes within the organisation of labour.2  For example, the miniatures that characterise the artefacts of the movement ‘stylised by the Automattic (among many others) and utilised by various media outlets, as well as the characters on screen, are carefully curated collections of words – chosen because they suit the purpose of the organisation that creates them – chosen in part because of their frequency within the organisational system, and because they are the most readily available. If a particular artefact is appropriated and disseminated, then the organisational system that produces them is undermined. If, on the other hand, the artefact itself is original, and can stand on its own merits, then the dissemination and manipulation of them is possible. In</text>

As Elizabeth Grosz explains, ‘the machine could not or would not listen to a human voice’.2This ability to negate the machine within the machine––in other words, to humanize the very nature of the system, but rather to render it unintelligible––is what Lefebvre was attempting to accomplish with his concept of the ‘total social voice’.3But the social voice that he attempted to construct is no longer the property of the state or the dominant cultural genre of the twentieth century. Increasingly, it is being conducted by individuals with varying degrees of formal and artistic training, as well as communities of artists and thinkers engaged in critical practices within the art world––think, for example, of the ‘art’ documentary.4Nowadays, the dominant form of cultural transmission is the collaborative ­procession, but the social impact of voice is much more pervasive and deeply embedded in the cultural fabric of the contemporary world.

As Margaret Atwood, in her book The Handmaid's Tale, ominously intones, ‘Machines are not innocent, but wiser than most people are given the task of believing.’2This observation by Margaret Atwood makes a powerful case for an apocalyptic vision of what Atwood calls ‘Machiavellian despotism’, in which the machine becomes more and more like an object within a system: subject to the whims of its users and culture, while simultaneously betraying its true nature through its own contradictions.3In recent years, as artificial intelligence has become increasingly sophisticated and human-like, and robotics increasingly important in manufacturing operations, it is easy to understand the desire on the part of users to negate the need for humans in critical systems. In the case of critical systems, the voice of the user is no longer the voice of the human, but that of a programmable computer that constantly reifies the human into useful</text>
