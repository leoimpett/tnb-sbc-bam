For a while, at least, the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to do.And then, of course, came the crash of the economy in 2008, which completely disrupted everything that was considered ‘real life’ in major cities all over the world. And now we’re seeing the effects of that crisis all around us – the housing market in particular. We’re seeing people who’ve put in long careers trying to find places to live, to eat, to take care of their houses, and suddenly there’s a crisis of homelessness unfolding all around them. And it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find a place to live in many cities.When I lived in San Francisco, I had the chance to visit several former Third World cities that are becoming very cosmopolitan. I visited Potrero Hill in San Francisco, which is a couple of blocks from the International Monetary Fund headquarters. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to access Potrero Hill, which is becoming increasingly difficult to visit, due to a large influx of tourists.</text>

For a while, at least, the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to do.But as we all know, that was then, and this is now – architecture is a much more complicated concept than it is for instance in the city, and especially so when it comes to the suburbs where the machines dwell. And the fact that the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to do in the city, but now we’re past that point, and things are a bit more complicated still. Maybe what the Machine needed was a while longer to catch up with the Urban Revolution, and in that case the challenge would have been even harder. The answer would have been to adopt what Bloch called ‘technological rifts’, to catch up with the new industrial infrastructure that was emerging all around the world at the time, and to try to figure out how to use that infrastructure in new ways. Perhaps the challenge would have been even harder had the Blitz not happened, because the pace of change during that period was so incredible, and the human scale of change so tremendous</text>

For a while, at least, the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to do.But then the city started to get rebuilt, and suddenly all those things that once made the city radiate with life are now considered nuisances. The whole retrofit mentality is in play, and whilst the Blitz is remembered fondly, there’s growing concern about what that might do to the city’s character. And the city seems to be drifting ever deeper into debt. The city is a complex system, and as a result its capacity to rumble is constrained. Architecture is a great capacity-extender, but as we all know, that’s also the point. And so we’re seeing increasingly visible in-progress, delayed and distorted versions of the architecture that started it all. And this is happening all over Europe, and it’s happening in North America as well. The problem is that although we might want to think of architecture as a kind of space, it’s actually quite simple to become deeply entwined in</text>

For a while, at least, the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to do.  One could even say that the Blitz was a little bit of a ‘race’, in that the city was turned into something new and unexpected. (And to some extent, that is part of the logic of the Blitz: the city grows larger as a result of the proliferation of buildings, which means that more people need to live in it, which means that more needs to be demolished.)  And yet there are also deep-seated cultural and urban  transformations that need to be undertaken, and these need to be accompanied by a massive cultural push – a ‘race’ as well as a ‘brain drain’ (which is to say, of people leaving the city because they can’t afford to) – and this is why the Frankfurt School was necessary: so that cultural production could compete with its massive, modern industrial system on an equal footing. This is why, for example, the massive, modern art installations of the early 2000s,</text>

And we’re not talking about that retrofitting aspect of the architecture that the Blitz did, but about the new kind of regeneration that we’re witnessing in areas around the metropolis, which is taking place despite the fact that, for one, most of the area never got redeveloped (because, as we all know, nothing can be built), and two, as we all know, the metropolis cannot absorb the new development. So, when the city is hurtling towards bankruptcy, it’s time to repair what’s being built in the city, and when the metropolis is about to be hurtling towards insolvency, it’s time to ask, what kind of city can we build on the ruins of the Blitz? And so, as the Blitz recedes into memory, we move from</text>

For a while, at least, the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to do.In any event, the question that inevitably comes to mind when we think about gentrification and machine is this: what does it profit from? And the answer to that is: everything. Machine makes money, of course, but gentrification also makes a profit: it creates jobs, it buys buildings, it provides transport – a kind of infrastructure that supports the machine’s own growth. And the interesting thing is that the gentrification of the city that the machine desires inevitably ends up being guided by the infrastructure that was built on the backs of the poor and the ill – the ill-to-be-afflicted, in the case of the Blitz. And as a kind of a by-product of that, some of the richer parts of the city grow richer, more inclusive parts of town, while others don’t. In other words, the better-off sections of the city are gentrified, while the poorer sections are left to muddle through.That was the</text>

For a while, at least, the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to do in London. But now that’s all over. The city is too busy trying to construct itself out of detritus, leaving its history behind it. And the reconfiguration of the city, which is part of what the Blitz was about, is part of what we mean by the word ‘delegated’ in the context of urbanism.The way that the contemporary urbanisation agenda is unfolding, and is likely to continue to unfold – thanks to the activities of global urbanisation projects – is that there will be multiple urban forms operating simultaneously in the same location. And what this means in practice is that different forms of government, localities, and even corporations will be actively involved in organising, co-creation and managing of the city in various ways. And this will be a situation in which the interests of a particular dominant form of urbanisation will be determined by a plurality of competing urban histories and cultures. And what this might mean in the future is that there</text>

For a while, at least, the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to do.One final example that came to mind was what the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava did with the Portofino neighborhood in San Francisco. He deconsecrated the architectural style of the 1950s and 1960s, when the Nineties were all about the mega projects, so as not to upset the balance of the housing market between what he called the ‘periphery’ and the ‘center’. So the Nineties were all about the periphery, the periphery of the city, the new middle class. And Calatrava used that to call into question the very foundations of the city’s construction and urban renewal policies that had brought the city such tremendous wealth in the first place. He was staging what he called a ‘public space defense’, or, more precisely, a ‘public space defense’ that diverted scarce building space from the periphery to the center, which in turn divided and sometimes destroyed what was left of the city between</text>

For a while, at least, the Blitz was a pretty cool thing to be doing.Things are different now. We’re stuck in present-day New York, surrounded by data-mining apparatuses that tell us everything from how well we're sleeping to which television shows are most likely to be shown on which channel. And what’s more, thanks to the proliferation of smartphones and other gadgets, these multiple vantage points are regularly directed at us via streams of data – meaning that what’s happening in the city is happening increasingly closely, which is to say, at an almost alarming rate. It’s as if the Blitz were all around us at all times, and we were constantly reminded of just how much of the city was being destroyed around us. But it’s not just the Blitz that causes us to lose focus. There’s also the fact that the infrastructure of the city is decaying. And this is a problem that seems to be getting worse all around us. The more media images we see of the city,</text>

And the other thing that the Blitz did is it gave birth to what came to be known as the Global Architecture Initiative (GiA), an ambitious but ultimately fruitless scheme that sought to map out an entire planet in a single building. For years, the GiA looked like it might one day become a kind of Rome, New York or Hong Kong – a kind of metropolis – but in the intervening years, it has largely stalled, its members mutating into something more like Podolia or China’s Taipei. At the height of the Rome thing, in fact, the GiA’s members looked as if they were entering into a ‘Tartan age’ – into the circular, golden age that Rome itself eventually gave up on trying to build.Follow the money Follow the money Follow the money Follow the money Don’t Know Don’t Know Don’t</text>

Socially engaged and politically aware practitioners, biennials have come to represent the triumph of a particular ideology over a particular kind of place and time. Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the historical materialist museum, city, or rural archive. The biennial is a recurring exhibitionary form, and like most collections it is increasingly the collection of a particular museum, with a long-term commitment to research and documentation. It now represents a form of capital in which most of us do not belong, but which nevertheless continues to exert a hugely influential effect on how we think about the city and the city-world. To some extent, this influence is social, as museums and galleries became places of gathering and exchange for people from all over the city, and artists, curators and art writers became cultural ambassadors for the city. But the biennial is by its very nature a collection – its collection as a whole, and its collection as a particular city – and its power (its' power) derives from its position in the city. In that sense, it is both a collector and a keeper of the very place it is trying to save. The collection must act through its collection as a</text>

Socially engaged and politically aware practitioners, biennials have come to represent the triumph of a particular ideology over a particular kind of place and time. Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the arts biennale, the largest and most prestigious of which is the Venice Biennale. The Venice Biennale is the most internationally visible of the major biennials, and it is a particular asset for a city when it is one of the major art biennials. It has become an object of cultural re-appropriation as a result of its global reach, and a locus of political, economic and social change as a result. It is the official institution of the City of Venetian cities, and extends into outer space. The Venice Biennale is the main promoter of the ideology that the biennial is a ‘once in a lifetime’ experience, and the biennial as a ‘gift from the gods’. It promises a ‘once in a lifetime’ experience in perpetuity. In this ideological formulation, the Biennale itself is a divine manifestation of the Museu Obscura, and the entire ‘epis</text>

Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the city. The decline of the Romanov family house, the arts’ favourite pastime, was chronicled in art and architectural journals from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. Art and biennial collections from the nineteenth century are the exception to the rule – the art of Greek and Roman antiquity is predominant in the biennial edition of the journal, but the biennial is populated almost entirely by African and Asian art from the twentieth century. But this domination by the aesthetic has changed. The biennial has become a social event. The number of biennials has quadrupled during the past twenty years, and ten of the first twenty have been dedicated to the social. New forms of institutionalised sociality are emerging in the wake of the biennial as the event of the century. This new kind of institutionalised sociality is the outcome of numerous dedicated social tomes. Its social composition today largely determines its place in the biennial, with significant segments of the art world responding to their social needs</text>

Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the museum, the public sector or the arts institution. Their popularity derives from their potential as a way to detect subtle trends shaping the city, and then act upon these in order to influence and even to create them. Biennials are politically aware practitioners, and their particular brand of cultural activism is a response to a particular kind of economic neglect, urban sprawl and commodification that is fuelling the capitalist tide. However, their political motivation is only ever nominal. Their real strength is their realisation, and the firmamental unity that they contain within themselves. If anything is left undone, or rendered uninteresting, or non-useful, it is this unity that allows the biennial to sustain itself. And this unity is what the biennial has today, despite the manifold conflicts and difficulties that it faces today, because its real strength is its unity as an institution. If it were merely a museum of artefacts and collections, it would be a museum of use by now, but its real</text>

Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the hands of a local art community. The biennial has become, without doubt, the primary means of articulating the city’s cultural significance in globalised capitalist economies. It is a globalised form that is visible from many locations, and it is a community effort.A biennial is a particular kind of cultural production. It is a ritualised event, perhaps more so than any other kind of cultural production that involves the consumption of ritualised material objects. It is an occasion on which practices live on in altered forms, changing over time as different cultural groups strive to reproduce and extend the rituals’ lifespans. The principal task of the art administrator in the biennial is to produce a ritualised event that extends the life of art forms in a particular city. In doing so, he or she produces a particular kind of art form or sub-artform that is culturally responsive to the specificity of the city, but also to the city’s own ongoing economic, urban</text>

Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the city itself – in museums, in the arts organisations, in the local community. The reason is that the ideology that created them – capitalism – itself requires a biennale to justify its existence, and the biennial has to be an artefact of the capitalist mode of production in order to be believed by institutional investors and tourists. So although biennials are periodic, they are – like every other art form – instrumental in the capitalist mode of production. Their status as a museum-type art form entitles them to be maximally productive, and to accumulate vast amounts of money in the process. They are, in this sense, ‘living collections’. Art museums, by contrast, operate with the capacity to collect, display and learn, to continuously reshape themselves according to changing conditions, in relation to the changing needs of the city. Their status as a type of cultural organisation is the preserve of a particular set of institutional interests, and so it is only natural for biennials</text>

Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the United Kingdom and internationally. They are a set of relations: a city produces a set of institutions and organisations that function in its city in an ongoing way. Biennials began as itineraries, in the form of a book or a catalogue, and have evolved into networks of exchange between cities and regions, organised as exchanges of knowledge. They are a form of cultural tourism agency, providing a range of cultural experiences to visitors to places where the city’s history is written, but also facilitating the exchange of culture between cities and regions, between peoples of different cultures and languages.Biennials provide the city with a rich set of written documents that record the life of a particular form of cultural activity. They are a record of a place and a time, writing and constituting an archive that narrates the history of a particular set of people, places and things. But they are also the site of a particular kind of cultural activity – a kind of cultural colonialism – that produces social and political changes</text>

Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the city. The ethos of the biennial has shifted from the dominance of a particular ideology to the domination of a particular set of people – a city as a cultural unit, and especially of its diasporic inhabitants. The biennial is a cornerstone of any city’s cultural identity, but as the city acquires ever more diverse kinds of cultural identities, the biennial is itself increasingly defined as transient, transient, and transient. In other words, it looks like it might be on one hand giving substance to the logic of capitalism, but on the other hand, it is giving substance to the culture of the cities. With this in mind, it makes sense to capture the biennial in narratives that are sensitive to the city’s multiple forms of signification, but also to its varied and variable registers of signification. For Venice itself, the biennial has come to represent the city’s cultural capital and its significant cultural institutions, which are the objects of constant revision and</text>

Socially engaged and politically aware practitioners, biennials have come to represent the triumph of a particular ideology over a particular kind of place and time. Biennials are, as ever, occasional expressions of a city’s cultural diversity, but their principal place of expression is now in the cultural heart of the city. The biennial is the one that tells another cultural story, and so, so often, does it meet other art forms meet at the same time. This is the current situation in many cities, but it is also a fact of life in many biennials. We live, we travel, we visit. We buy art. We talk. We make art. Sometimes we make art together. We do all of these things, and yet we are still art. We are still here and still making art. This is what biennials are for. To some extent, this is the predicament of cities in an era of massive globalisation: the globalised biennale circuit is a large part of the economy, and so is heavily reliant on the artist and his or her ability to multiply commercial appearances around the world. This is not the case for other art forms, which have their distinctive distinctive place in the cultural life of a city, such as museums and concert</text>

They are a money maker for art institutions, an important element of curatorial capital, and a venue for a specific strand of identity politics. In this ideological landscape, the 20th Biennale of Sydney is a kind of anti-biennial. It is an ideological assault on the biennial as an institution, while the exhibitionary format is seen as constituting an obstacle to progress. The exhibitionary biennial has its distinctive form because it is the only way to study and represent a city for a global audience; globally, of course. And, of course, it is the only way to engage with, or return to, a city. The biennial format is globalised, but it is the particular biennial that constitutes what are in effect globalised pockets of city life. In other words, the biennial is not just the sum total of a city’s cultural resources, but also an elite form of cultural consumption</text>

The public will play a central role in this process of cultural reproduction, and cultural resources will play a central role in the production of cultural meaning.Artists will form collaborative collaborative working groups to explore different aspects of AI and symbiosis. Their scope of inquiry will include topics as diverse as architecture, biology, media, and even languages. The goal of the first such working group was to explore how AI might enhance artistic productivity through the enhancement of narrative structure and the construction of new artistic models. The second group, formed in October 2017, included representatives from Intel and IBM to explore how AI might affect artistic productivity through the reinforcement of aesthetic values via the reinforcement of linguistic and cultural elements. The third group, formed in April 2018, explored how AI might affect productivity through the construction of new artistic models that incorporate elements of art and aesthetics.Learn more about:  	Artificial Intelligence</text>

The curatorial mission will evolve to include work that is both autonomous and beholden to industry. The role of the artist will evolve from artist to administrator, and the latter will employ various cultural tools including but not limited to, PR, PR campaigns, festivals, literatures, assessment, and education to engage with the culture of the future. The curatorial mission will be able to intervene where necessary to alter technological developments that may affect the roles, bodies and vocations of artists and the cultural resources they work with, and to influence those who work with them.

These will include not only artists but also curators, journalists, social critics and others with expertise in art, architecture, heritage, urban development and culture.

The aim will be to build artificial intelligence into the architecture of cultural institutions, from the ground up.The scope and nature of the new role will be determined by the priorities and objectives set forth in the manifest document ‘Art as Service’. This document represents the political, economic and social landscape of artificial intelligence today, and its potential impacts on art and the cultural sector.

The expectations and biases of the art market will have a major impact on cultural production and the curatorial role. The tendency towards the production of media that are reliable, private and transient will increase, while the institutional production of artistic achievement will decrease. The curatorial rhetoric and focus will shift towards art as a product that can be assembled into narratives, and not necessarily the other way around. Curatorial narratives will include artists’ own specific productions of the world as a product, and the organisational strategies and biases of the art world as a producer of visual media. As a consequence, the curatorial rhetoric will be influenced by the technologies of production and distribution available to it. The curatorial mission will be defined by the state, and the state will exert its most persuasive influence on creative infrastructural actions through its economic and social weight.

The AI-driven art will likely be produced with materials that are as good as ever in terms of their mechanical accessibility and environmental performance, but will also likely exhibit new forms of social and ecological complexity.Artists will play a critical role in this transition, exhibiting their work across platforms, platforms, and platforms, showing that work that is culturally significant and influential.

The art will be constructed on the fly, and the curatorial call-out system will be able to dynamically adapt to the needs and preferences of the media ecosystem. The curatorial call-out will exist in both conscious and subconscious forms, constantly reminding the viewer and the art collector of the dynamic range of values, aims and histories that exist within the art world. The artificial intelligence will be able to detect when the art is at risk of being degraded in any way, and will actively seek to enhance the image of the art in such a way as to make it more recognisable and more likely to be found in art collections. It will do this by understanding cultural norms and history, and exploiting cultural gaps and inequities, both historical and contemporary. It will do this through the attribution of meanings to objects and behaviours, categorisation and management of narratives,</text>

In a future where art is routinely reproduced in commercial media thanks to new media technologies, it is imperative that artistic and curatorial independence be ensured. It is also imperative that artists and groups be able to address and work through the complexities of the intersection of race, class, gender and sexuality in a politically-engaged society. It is also imperative that art be reproduced at an affordable price. The curatorial shift towards reproducing art at a cultural cost has been underway for some years now. The recent biennials and major exhibitions of art being mounted in major cities across the world will attest to the fact that the costs of artistic production are dropping.

However, this does not mean that art should be passively indulgent to the expectations of technology. Art has a critical role to play in resisting the tendency toward AI. Art has the potential to detect and counter the negative aspects of new developments, but it must exert influence through its own means. It is this final element of artistic vocation that I seek to elevate through its example and through engaging with contemporary art’s tendency toward artificial intelligence.Art has a critical role to play in resisting the tendency toward AI. The art of curating must be a two-fold manoeuvre. The first part is the creation of desirable media for the purposes of AI enhancement. The second part is the maintenance of art’s original moral character through the exertion of an artist’s agency. The former part of the first manoeuvre assumes that the curatorial gesture will be understood by audiences that are not trained in the art of art and art</text>

The avant garde has always been at odds with the measured, controlled, controlled, and socially mediated curatorial gesture, and its practitioners will continue to find new and unexpected ways to engage with art. But the call should not be underestimated either. The future of art is predicted by social media, and the revolution in communication technologies that will result from them is going to make art more widely available and accessible, as all media will be conduits of some form of social function. The curatorial gesture will play a part in this, too. The curatorial call, and the art world in which it takes place, will become a transient event.

This will include but is not limited to: aesthetics; social impact; and development. The responsibilities for the aestheticization of new media will pass from the artist to the audience, while the curatorial role will be played by technologists. The discourse of aesthetics will be enhanced through the discovery and application of new media, while the role of the metainterface will be further enhanced through the discovery and application of algorithms.Artists will be encouraged to experiment with new media and algorithms, and to see what opportunities exist for enhancing the visual experience through the technical means available to it.

According to Merleau-Ponty historian Christine McBride, however, ‘[T]he term ‘cultured’ has been around since Colonial times and will probably always be a part of the wider term ‘culture’. From this, she derives ‘the idea that there is a continuum from infancy to adulthood’, from pre-modern times to the modern period, from pre-minimalism to postmodernism. From this, she also derives ‘the idea that art has a social purpose, or at least that it is relational with other social purposes’, including the social purposes of art as social activity.

(accessed October 2018). 9. White, op. cit., p.78. 10. Cultural Capital, a term first coined by the sociologist Max Horkheimer, was one of several key concepts that would characterize the new social and economic thinking of the late twentieth century. In the twentieth century, Horkheimer emphasised the importance of cultural production as a way to address the problems of growing up – the problems of consumer culture, urban crisis, cultural perforations, cultural revolutions, and modern urban destruction – and in the twenty-first century, the problems of postindustrial cities. Cultural production today, by its very name, evokes the perforations of social media, viral networking and other technologies of modernity. It is a mode of cultural consumption that is global in character and, as the name implies, inevitable in the age of the biennale. However, cultural production and its products are only partial solutions to the problems of our times. In their broader social and spatial forms, they play into the hands of cultural nepotism and oligarchy. The art world is a prime site for such dynamics, where the economic and political systems that produce, foster and</text>

(accessed October 2018). 9. White, op. cit., p.78. 10. Cultural Capital, a term first coined by the sociologist Max Horkheimer, was one of several proposals by artists and art critics to describe the new ‘transient cultural phenomena’ created by the new media of culture. The term’s early use in relation to postmodernism is also misleading. Cultural Capital was not a term widely applied in the early twentieth century, and its application to contemporary art practice is problematic. However, as explained by Max Horkheimer in his classic The Culture Industry (1936), the main reason for the surge in cultural products during the first half of the century was the revolutionary potential of new media such as photography and the postcard. Thus the potential for culture to intervene in economic and social systems was there, albeit in the form of cultural products rather than as a cultural enterprise. Moreover, the power to prescribe and regulate comes from above, through policies and institutions such as the state. State power is not a culture; it is an institution. Therefore, as explained by sociologist Carol Tavris in her book The Rise and Fall of U.</text>

(accessed October 2018). 9. White, op. cit., p.78. 10. Cultural Capital, a term first coined by the sociologist Max Horkheimer, was one of the first to emerge in the wake of postmodernism. It captures the latent, though complex one (which is yet to be fully exploited) that lies at the root of contemporary change, both material and moral. It is a term that has survived in part because it is easy to understand: cultural capital is understood as the set of skills, capacities, and bodies of individuals who are culturally responsive (i.e., have common understandings of what it means to be culturally responsive). Thus, cultural capital is understood as a set of related resources sharing in a shared set of values and norms. Cultural capital is understood as both located at home (i.e., in the social totality) and transnational.*** 	Cultural capital, then, may be seen as a living material that emerges from the social totality and is realized through the social. It is both a resource (i.e., cultural assets) and a trauma (i.e., collective psychological wounds). It is both a</text>

In the twentieth century, cultural capital consisted primarily of the cultural products of the modern world – texts, music, films, icons – and constituted the basis of contemporary social change. It was understood that the primary purpose of the social is to produce and endorse cultural products, and the collective is therefore expected to play a critical role in the social production of culture. 11. See, for example, Mark Miodownik and Michael Ames, eds., The New Cultural Marxism: Relating Postmodernism and Critique, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1987, and Mark Miodownik and Michael Ames, eds., Issues in Cultural Studies, John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1993.

(accessed October 2018). 9. White, op. cit., p.78. 10. Cultural Capital, a term first coined by the sociologist Max Horkheimer, was one of several topics of conversation during the conference. As White suggests, this usage reflects how cultural capital – the social value of a cultural artifact – accrues not from the social return on the social reproduction of cultural exchange but rather through the social reproduction of cumulative social change. Cultural capital is understood as ‘the social production of meaning through the repetition of a word or phrase, or the social reproduction of a set of actions’, including, in turn, the social production of words and phrases that others can use to get meaning out of, and through which they can change, cultural spaces. As White suggests, this is why the social production of money precedes, or supports, the social production of meaning. If a specific artefact (such as a cultural artifact) has a social use, or cultural value, then it is understood as having a social function, even if its social production remains elusive.

The other two manuscripts were submitted by the sociologist Peter Singer. Although Cultural Capital shared many of its texts with The Culture of Critique, Singer maintained that his version of the story was richer and more encompassing than that of White or White’s Culture. He argued that his version depicted a &quot;world‐picture&quot; that encompassed the multifaceted histories and multiple modes of cultural expression that White and his co-authors failed to capture. 11. Theodore Cook, ‘The Cultural Logic of Early Modernity’, in Cook, ed., Institutions and Trends: Critical Essays on a Global Scale, Marcel Dekker, Norman Wilkinson, Henry Harpaz, Ronald Keefe, Paul Domela, and many others, Routledge, London, 1988, p.146.

In 1980, Hugh Murphy suggested that the cultural form that emerged after the end of the war in Europe would be better understood as an ‘intersectionality’ – that is, two-up-two-or-more worlds fused together. In 1984, David Harvey proposed that the new economic form would be the ‘culturally relativist’ one, in which individuals and groups imbued with a shared, but not shared, set of values would seek to impose those values on others. In the current cultural discourse, culture is understood as an intermingling of different cultural worlds, across which individuals can freely engage in ‘culturally relevant’ cultural practices. In the 1980s, Harvey and others argued that cultural production was a power that could be applied across borders, and that a cultural geography was a constellation of practices that</text>

In the article, Duarte identifies her work as ‘anomalous’ and her use of  	postmodernism’ as a political-ideological term. He describes her relationship to  	postmodernism as a ‘time when forms of cultural production were thought through, but also when those who employed such practices were thought to be at war with each other.’ His description covers a period from the early 1970s in New York and LA, during which time she acted as a co-founder of the collective Comités Internacional de Trastornos y Arboles (Comintern: International Artists Association). In an in-depth essay in the October 2014 issue of Radical Cultural Studies, Eva Castringius draws on her time in the Comintern to articulate her ambivalent feelings about the influence of postmodernism on contemporary art’s cultural legacies.

In the profile, Duarte imagines a future where information and culture merge, where people ‘live their truths in ever more complete forms’ and where the centrality of the present becomes a thing of the past. The story begins in 1967, when Los Angeles County Sheriff Clarke Farrag arrested Lopéz de la Torre for ten days in response to a string of anti-authoritarian activist sit-ins at the jail. Despite their claims of having a right to be there, the activists were dispersed by the authorities, and their claims were repeated elsewhere in the United States and Mexico. Though initially incarcerated for ten days, the charges were later reduced to misdemeanor trespassing and deactivating a building, and Lopéz de la Torre spent three years in solitary confinement before being released on bond.

As a result, she decided to shut down the production of the film; the workers in the film were then suspended the film by the New York State Commission on Human Rights, who then took up the cause in federal courts. In a move that would not be out of character for Duarte, the US Supreme Court affirmed the right of the workers to film the episode in question, a decision that has never been questioned in Mexico or in America. [ii] Frank J.

In the article, Duarte reflects on the shifting image of Mexico and the United States due to the drug war, which he defines as ‘a political line that has shifted the balance of global cultural power in the last twenty years’. As the drug war intensified in the 1980s and 1990s, and continued to a large extent in the present, Lopéz de la Torre became part of that shift. Duarte relates how as a young artist, he contributed to a 1984 Mexico City biennale that placed him in a position to question the roles of the artist, the state and the commodity through the production of ‘muralas divisible by race and gender’. He also reveals how as an artist, he was exposed to the work of the Granby Four a creative writing workshop led by Wendy Chun</text>

In the image, the Mexican man is depicted as a violent criminal with a penchant for violence. In the article, the photographer Ernesto Enriquez is depicted as a reporter who covers the drug war from the other side of the border. His ambivalent and often questioning reporting draws a contrast with the steady militarisation of the border that characterises the media version of the story.

In other words, the planners cannot just hand infrastructure development to human beings engaged in labour, but must design infrastructure so as to ensure that its use in perpetuity is contingent on past labour. This is why bioengineering today is so crucial in constructing sustainable infrastructure. It is not enough to fabricate renewable energy from renewable resources; planners must engineer the infrastructures that will support a future reliant on labour rather than on fossil fuels. 	The infrastructural turn around urban space requires planners to envision a future where people live and work in infrastructures that are no longer dependent on natural resources. This is not trivial, since we already live amongst such systems, and so the new socio-political turn around urban space will need to address the fact that many of the surfaces we</text>

A machine is a noun that has a set function, and the  	machine that emerged from the collaboration of architects, engineers, industrialists and others to create a new kind of urban environment. The  	machine was both and probably  	more  	than just an interface: it incorporated social, economic and cultural components. Nevertheless, the primary function of the machine is to provide access to information to humans engaged in performing work on it. Architecture is designed to respond to the needs of the city, yet because of the inherent inhumanity of the human condition – including but not limited to the need to feed, clothing and house humans engaged in manual labour – the architecture of the metropolis has to be ecologically managed. The task of urban planners is to deliver infrastructure to places where people live and work, yet because of the inherent inhumanity of the process of infrastructure, planners often deliver infrastructure that is neither physically nor socially sustainable. For instance, in the metropolis, the highway system provides access to goods and services, but because of the inherent inhumanity of the labour involved in constructing such infrastructure, labourers often have to work long hours in dangerous conditions in exchange for a small wage increase. A public works programme is an exchange between public and private businesses engaged in different spheres of the society: here, the state provides the infrastructure and the business thrives on the feedback loop of new infrastructure being built.

A similar dynamic is unfolding for water and energy, with the environmental sector expected to contribute close to 3 per cent of GDP to the nation’s economic output in 2050. 	So, there is a growing convergence of interests between artists and the urban poor,</text>

The task of urban planners is to deliver infrastructure to places where people live and work, yet because of the inherent inhumanity of the circumstances – including but not limited to the need to educate and provide for humans engaged in manual labour – planners also have to consider more fundamental issues of social purpose and human ecology. Forster’s enclosure in Liverpool existed in part to address these deeper needs of the metropolis. The aim of the enclosure was to allow developers a way to develop vacant land around the museum, while encouraging socially managed ‘creative reuse’ in the form of ‘recreational’ activities such as landscape painting or creating ‘backyards’ where businesses can ‘take advantage of the vacant land and generate new business opportunities’.2 The aim of the Centre for Cities researcher’s programme at the University of Toronto was to provide a space for research-based creative practices to flourish within a framework of controlled conditions. As such, the curatorial direction of the programme shifted from the traditional urban setting to the more natural</text>

The task of urban planners is to deliver infrastructure to places where people live and work, yet because of the inherent inhumanity of the city, planners also have to ensure that the infrastructure isn’t used for fighting fires, ploughing the landscape or anything else that relies on humans for energy.  	The  	machine thus has two distinct but related functions: the human need to perform tasks and the machine sounds good, in part to ensure that the humans perform their jobs. 	So while the interface is a synthesis of many different disciplines and professions, the machine is primarily a product of a particular set of jobs – architects, engineers, accountants, accountants – that developed in tandem over the course of the twentieth century. The kinds of automation that developed during the 1980s and 1990s remained poorly understood, hindered by bureaucratic red tape and the fetishisation of paperwork over actualisation. The advent of computerisation didn’t assign any particular value to human life, as such; rather, it signaled the</text>

Forster and his team clearly see connections between the need to design infrastructure and the need to live in it, but they also see the inherent inhumanity of the situation. Forster had two questions: (1) What should be in a name for the new machine economy? (2) What kind of separation between man and machine should exist between physical and virtual space? 	The answer to question (1) creates a situation in which planners have complete access to information, yet also great concern about the impact on urban environments?s ability to sustain human life. Forster and his team’s decision (as well as other architectural tendencies) is a logical extension of previous research findings and philosophical discourses on the relation between architecture and the natural world.

The task of urban planners is to deliver infrastructure to places where people live and work, yet because of the inherent inhumanity of the human condition – including but not limited to the need to feed, clothe and house humans engaged in manual labour –the planners also have to manage the ecological imbalances that emerge from the built environment. 	The role of the urban planners, however, has largely shifted in the last decades, and much of what is being proposed for urban development in the context of the Anthropocene is woefully inadequate. The role of the urban planner has become an end in itself, detached from any particular function or function within the city. Planning is being heavily delegated to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), citizen groups and community boards, which can be either visionary or bureaucratic, citizen or activist. The latter are the agencies that collect and represent information, but increasingly they are also engaged in policing and serving orders and mandates from the city. 	Meanwhile, the number of inhabitants in the metropolis continues to grow, fuelled by economic speculation</text>

The task of urban planners is to deliver infrastructure to places where people live and work, yet because of the inherent inhumanity of the city – including but not limited to the need to build parks, streets and playgrounds for people to play in – planners also have to manage its ecology.  	In planning a city, planners have to take into account the ecology of the city in order to deliver infrastructure or set of infrastructure that will enable a community to live and work freely in the city. But because of a number of factors – factors that may or may not be good for you – not all planners are equally capable of delivering infrastructure that meets the needs of a city. For example, not all developers are involved in the creation of parks or the promotion of walking and cycling infrastructure, and not all local authorities are involved in creating walking and cycling paths. Local authorities have skills and resources, but they rely on citizens to turn a profit in order to provide services to the city. Cities rely on volunteers and institutions, such as museums and libraries, to become financially self-sufficient. Therefore, while the ecology of</text>

The task of urban planners is to deliver infrastructure to places where people live and work, yet because of the inherent inhumanity of the city, planning must also address the needs of its inhabitants. It is this complexity that makes the metropolis possible, yet it is also what makes it  impossible to manage effectively. From the 1960s until the 1970s the environmental movement was interested in the role of the urban as a site of potential resistance, but as the right to the city has been increasingly secured, a different kind of ecological crisis has emerged.  The urban environment is increasingly dependent on the exchange of information, and the more information conveyed, the more resources can be used. If the city lacks in certain critical or useful qualities, the machine may be able to compensate by producing replacements that are more likely to meet the needs of the city’s inhabitants. This is why in an ever-expanding metropolis, dense and poorly-maintained neighbourhoods are likely to outlive the city’s built environment, although this is still not always the case.</text>

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as a creator – in the sense of the Renaissance or the birth of modernism – is the end result of a social and political system that relies on the labour of people to deliver goods and services to others. The notion of the artist as a creator as we understand it today is the result of a political and economic system that relies on the labour of people to deliver goods and services to others. So while it may be true that in the distant future we will all be able to look at art and think, that will never happen for a reason that can be grasped. I’m fascinated by the notion that there is a universal humanist way of thinking about art and how it might be produced in a particular context. I also find the notion of the artist as a creator absurd. The Renaissance art of the time was all about artists being made by artists, and the art world as a whole being artists themselves. The explosion of publishing during the Renaissance period immediately politicised the field, allowing artists to</text>

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as an inherently visionary being who can ‘change’ the world is being increasingly questioned, especially as cultural forms and media become more ‘mediated’ by globalised networks of control. It is a fact of contemporary life to have access to information and ideas; it is only the status of being ‘thought leaders’ in that regard that matters. But with the growing gap between the haves and have nots, and the diminishing role of the artist as a transformative force, we are increasingly witnessing the fragmentation of artistic initiatives. Even the great curators of the twentieth century were confronted with the task of finding new ways to incorporate new information and ideas into art programmes, as programmes become ever more global in their content and scope. In my opinion, the battle cry of the artworld today is more ‘about ideas’ than it is about individuals or specific artists. Indeed, the real battle cry of the twenty-first century is between those who control the information and ideas and those</text>

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as a political actor is crucial to understanding how contemporary art is produced and distributed.

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as a political actor is no longer confined to the art institutions and their curators. Artists are now routinely brought into power-led organisations, ostensibly to make things happen but also to make money from the opportunities that art brings to the global economy. These organizations are often very successful at their stated goals, but their real power is derived from the willingness and the ability to invest in the future of the art world. And while these investments may be valuable for the future of the art world, they are also valuable to corporations and the rich and powerful today. As biennials or biennials of various kinds acquire more globalised forms, their function as institutions of exchange will also evolve. And as biennials or biennials of any kind become ever more international in their forms and contents, a mode of analysis that begins to emerge that seeks to trace the infrastructural bases underlying contemporary art will also evolve. The question of jurisdiction, whether national, international or municipal, becomes crucial.In this</text>

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as a creator is enshrined in our legal and constitutional frameworks, but in the twenty-first century we are witnessing the advent of new technologies that render it practically impossible to be sued by an artist for plagiarism. The rise of social media and the connected consumption of artefacts is a constant, and more and more of it is artefacts of no value whatsoever. The disappearance of the need for authorship may be considered a technological revolution, but in its current form it is still a part of the social and governance infrastructure that creates and secures the social contract. There is a reason why contemporary artists are often drawn to places that are part of transformative social transformations: because, unlike in the past, the stakes are now mobilised around the digital consumption of culture, and the post-production, storage and retrieval of it.The story of how the social became the cultural may be found in Thomas Allsen’s book The Social Life of Britain, published in 1971. It is an iconic tale,</text>

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as a political actor is deeply embedded in our histories, but it is also deeply suspect in the age of the internet and social media. Today, it is common for an artist to be recruited by a government agency, military or political party to undertake political campaigning, but as recently demonstrated, there is also a long history of politically-motivated censorship on the grounds that they have a ‘culture agenda’. In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January 2015, it was reported that the Israeli security services actively sought to downplay the role that Islam is playing in the terrorist attack. It was claimed that the satirical weekly was targeted because it was perceived as promoting ‘Western values’ around the world. The question here is not whether artists are being recruited by political actors; the answer is a resounding no. The notion that an artist might be inspired by a political party is a myth.

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as a producer and promoter of culture has played a decisive role in the evolution of our ideas of culture and art. But just as important has been the creation of what art can and cannot be – a notion that goes far beyond the academy. The twentieth century marks the birth of a multibillion-dollar global art market; and just as important has been the multistep process of global culturalisation that began in earnest in the 1990s. Twenty-first century art needs to be globally conscious, aware and responsive to the changing circumstances of our times, but it also needs to be culturally responsive, aware and responsive to the changes that are taking place all around it. And while it may seem counterintuitive, the aim of this multi-tiered art market, which is nothing but the repetition of the same pattern of globalisation, is deeply influenced by the desires of globalised capitalist cultures.

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as a creator is fundamentally different from the notion of the consumer in that the former is shared and hence accessible; the latter is the product of an exclusive club. Hence the name ‘creator-class’, which has come to describe those who produce, advocates of an ideal society in its production of knowledge. It is patently false to think that the creators of the digital images that comprise our world would aspire to be the patrons of a museum or a gallery. And while the individual artists involved in the production of images may have an individualised conception of their place in the social world, they would do much more good by contributing to the common good by donating their images to worthy causes. I know a man who designs street murals and one of his projects is donating his artworks to the Red Cross. This is a remarkable act of generosity coming from someone engaged in an important public service. But it is also a radical departure from the economic logic of the art world. The Red Cross is developing</text>

And while the institutions that created the modernist avant garde as we know it may no longer exist, they do play a significant role in keeping our modernist dreams alive.The notion of the artist as a creator seems to have gained a definitive meaning in the context of the modern, i.e. critical, modernist revolution. And while it may be true that today we value criticality above all else, there is increasing evidence that the state actively attempts to repurpose artistic and curatorial talent in repressive contexts. For example, a recent wave of Egyptian artists are challenging the authority of their artistic visions by staging ‘painting by the mob’ alongside the regime’s infamous military of 19 th century modernism. While the authorities claim this is to combat terrorism, a deeper context reveals a deliberate dismantling of the social life-supporting potential of art’s emancipatory potential. The historical situation in Egypt today is such that mass incarceration represents a significant proportion of the work of these artists, who are often tortured into submission with alcohol and tortured in detention facilities. And while these repressive practices may be part of a policy, the increasing political and economic dependence on oil makes a</text>

The rise of biennials around the world coincided with the beginning of the cultural petroculture revolution, which demanded a huge increase in animal protein (bigger and better for the consumer), which in turn consumed ever more of the planet. The impact of this enormous increase in animal protein consumption is still felt in the landscape (and among the inhabitants of the cities that are built on its ruins). But as art, the image of the artist has always been a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has a ‘real life’ component that is constantly questioned and questioned by the public. On the other, it has the character of a mythological figure who can ‘change’ at will. In this sense, the image of the artist as a creator is itself a mythological construct.The biennial has a different kind of mythological aspect in that it is specific to the location and time</text>

Its increasing influence, globalisation and fluid exchange require more scrutiny and public funding than ever before. The biennial must play a greater role in this process of criticality and legitimacy, and it must do so in proximity to the art fair, which is the primary medium through which the transient common good is represented and valued. Biennials provide the perfect vehicle through which to do this today, and they’re the dominant form of contemporary cultural exchange. Biennials represent a new form of the permanent gallery, occupying a position of prominence and global ubiquity, while art fairs and their derivatives are rarefaction and often fragmented collections, often representing a narrow artistic or curatorial interest.

My interest in culture and its impact on social change comes from a broad range of disciplines, and my work is no exception.

Thus far, the major power brokers and their arts of influence have assumed that contemporary art will follow the same script as contemporary capitalism, and that artists will follow the same curatorial styles and creative managers. In my view, this is a mistake of historic proportions, and it is fuelling today’s rampant narcissism, which is ushering in a new mode of international artistic production that will render art into commodity and capital alike. 	Art is a powerful mediator, and its power is being misused. Many artists are being trained by the arts organisations themselves, and many are being forced to enter the market by their own institutions, leading to a situation where social, political and even cultural marginalisation is rife. This is a huge risk for the art world as a whole, and a sign of things to come, but it is also a sign of things</text>

Consequently, powerful cultural institutions, such as museums and galleries, are often the first places where ideas, ideologies, or even mere snippets of cultural artefacts are disseminated, legitimised and enshrined. In this sense, they are the locus of ideas, ideologies and even bare bones artefacts. Privilege, then, is shared by both the privileged and the excluded.  	However, privileges and estates exist in a particular historical and contemporary context, and changes in the relative worth of different forms of cultural production inevitably generate or exacerbate existing inequalities. As a result, it is vitally needed for us to be able to recognise and address injustices and oppression in our own society, and to generate viable alternatives for our own social and ecological development.

The biennale as a site-specific art project has its distinctive selling point, but its potential is realised only when it is strategically executed. The biennale as a ‘transnational phenomenon’ is a contemporary phenomenon, and the site-specific media industries that produce and align natural resources with behaviours and aesthetics that align with their business models are a contemporary phenomenon too. 	Art today is produced on a massive scale on a commercial scale, and the biennale as a ‘site-specificity artist’ is no exception. But the biennale mustn’t become a site-specificity artist. The legacy of the biennale as a cultural practice is going to have to survive at least as strong as the art produced there. The biennale mustn’t become a site-specificity artist. The bienn</text>

Critical race theory and its modules are deeply embedded in contemporary UK and globalist cultural anthropology and biennials, but their formalisation and institutionalisation in these repertoires is very recent, and places them in the social context of a post-Fordist economy. The internet and social media profoundly affects how we perceive and engage with art and visual culture, but the significant role that art and visual culture may play in the future is going to be determined by how much social and ecological change is necessary. 	In this new economic and media environment, the potential future of art and visual culture is bright and ambiguous. Its current and potential institutional places may be found in a range of policy and capital-intensive, high-impact, collaborative and collective projects, but the important task will be to find viable sites with lasting social and ecological benefits that can be shared across different stakeholders and work with artists, curators, artists’ organisations and communities</text>

The potential of art today is many things – a tool, a genius, a trick – but its primary role in challenging existing power structures is as a media spectacle. The power of art today is much more likely to be exercised through symbolic acts, ​​produced by curators, and conveyed by the media, than it is through actual acts of power. The recent explosion of social media and non-profit organisations is likely to yield many more mediums of exchange than the traditional publishing industry, and will likely see many more organisations emerging – many of which will be created and staffed with volunteers – than there are currently being employed by the artworld. 	Art must play a role in this overwhelming proliferation of creative non-profit cultural enterprises, and its increasing ability to assume new forms through partnerships and collaborations.

The power of art today is distributed across a complex of social, economic and cultural assets, some of which are quite fragile. Globalisation and technological change is reshaping the global commons, and cultures are the new capital. 	Art has many valuable roles to play in social change, but its primary place today is in relation to those social change actors that are most vulnerable to art’s subversive influence. The power of culture today resides in the balance of cultural capital, and critical mass is rapidly approaching. 	Critical mass is the critical mass of people who witness or become aware of a particular cultural practice or set of practices, and are willing to become members of that community. More and more people are becoming artists and curators, and many of those people are themselves artists.

As such, it is subject to the whims of geopolitical rivals, powerful national ideologies and economic incentives, as well as the relentless march of technology. 	Art is a powerful tool, capable of influencing publics, mobilising people, and creating new strategies, but it is also a fundamentally flawed way of doing things. The primary reason for this is that technology makes it easier and more convenient to consume media, and in turn more difficult and disempowered to not consume media. 	Art has the potential to change all of this, perhaps irrevocably. That is, of course, if its content is distributed and made widely accessible, and if cultural producers and their audiences follow its instructions and adopt its tactics. But given the ubiquity of advertising and the way that it is embedded in our cultural systems, the potential of cultural production is significantly limited compared to other forms of social practice.

In doing so, it plays a pivotal role in our contemporary cultural ecology, and in creating new ways of structuring our future societies.  	Art has its own set of concomitant values and practices, and these have been around for a very long time. By and large, they are the values of a community of artists, curators, writers and community organisers who happen to be custodians of what is sometimes referred to as the cultural commons. They are artists’ custodians, and their work is a kind of cultural stewardship. It is a system that is deeply embedded in our practices and has a very real effect on how we live our everyday lives.

The power of cultural organising is realized through the medium of visual culture, and the agency of artists and institutions to amplify and shape that cultural power. The agency of the arts is enhanced through the work of many artists whose work is sometimes enormously popular, but whose work is rarely ever reproduced or reprinted; for example, Silence Is Golden, by the Provincials, 2012, is the only known painting to have been painted on a residential street in Victoria, British Columbia. 	Artists need to be able to negotiate the complex social relations and global cultural systems that shape and empower contemporary art today, and to be able to imagine alternatives. That's why it is so exciting and so powerful when an artist chooses to transform an existing space or a community of people with existing identities into a creative new form or to destine a new form after the fact. 	However, the power that visual artists wield extends far</text>

For instance, if a manufacturer’s algorithm predicts that a particular product should be assembled in a particular sequence of steps, it can be programmed to do that. The implication is that the system—rather than the individual components—should perform the work, rather than the other way around.This kind of thinking is at the root of new business models for infrastructure, from genalas to containerised shipping containers.

In an ideal world, every possible use case for AI would have at least one implementation that exploits its capabilities. This would mean that every possible use case for AI would address a problem that can be solved by engineers and scientists. Unfortunately, as the usage of AI increases, the problems that AI might one day be able to solve also increase. The demand for more engineers and scientists grows, and the supply of engineers and scientists shrinks. This inevitably causes supply to fluctuate, which can cause supply to run into problem areas. The AI that emerges in this scenario could very well become sentient and rule human-dominated sectors of the global infrastructure industry.Every now and then, a group of researchers or engineers shows some interest in exploiting the capabilities of AI.

But researchers and engineers are expected to begin to fabricate AI systems that understand the difference between good and bad ideas, and between ideal and impractical configurations, and how to harness the power of crowds to make projects happen in unexpected ways. This kind of thinking is happening at MIT right now through the DARING project, which creates synthetic intelligence through algorithms, and MIT Media Lab is building platforms that will allow crowds to assemble and engage in collaborative projects.The strength of these kinds of thinking is in their ability to detect patterns, draw inferences and to react to contingencies. But given the speed of change and the massive scale of change now engulfing humanity, it is easy to be swept away by the patterns that emerge. And it is easy to lose your place, to be replaced by something better. That is, if the task is anything like recognizing</text>

Such workflows might one day be called natural language understanding (NLE), or better yet, human language augmentation.The ability to detect more subtle patterns in traffic could also lead to new kinds of public transit and taxi cabs, in which the human operators don’t need to be human but instead employ machine learning and big data analytics to detect patterns among passengers, routes, schedules, languages and cultures, and to act on those patterns further down the line. For instance, cab companies could detect when a large number of passengers arrive in the same direction, and offer trips based on that number, rather than on skill or talent, as is currently the case. The possibilities are endless. The question remains, however, what does it cost at the level of a technology to employ this kind of monitoring? In the context of a dense metropolis, an NLE like this might be able to detect and address problems of overcrowding, under-utilization and pollution, but in the city it might also be able to offer solutions to gentrification</text>

And as AI becomes more natural-language-based, the capacity to monitor, detect and intervene will increase. That is, the more AI is enabled, the more human intervention is reduced. That is, the less AI is used, the capacities that humans once had to detect and intervene will be exhausted. At the same time, the more AI is used, the less human intervention is encouraged. That is, the less AI is employed, the capacities that humans once had to engage in creative action will be greatly augmented.At the same time, the more AI is improved, the less human intervention is encouraged.

That kind of sensitivity is the domain of science fiction, but the ability to detect when traffic is valuable, and to value it in ways that are mutually exclusive—that is, not to be counted among the traffic—is just as real as it is in the real world. So one might imagine the early stages of autonomous vehicle development, with systems that monitor traffic, build and manage databases, and even teach themselves—or more abstractly, the ability to figure out how to build and manage roads and bridges, and to do other kinds of infrastructure work. Such systems might one day be called naysayers, but they certainly wouldn’t wish to be counted among the ranks of humanity.   In the coming years, however, researchers and engineers will likely want to know how to build and manage more concrete forms of infrastructure</text>

Such workflows might one day be called natural language understanding (NLE) tools, and they are being developed at a rapid clip at both the research and engineering levels. One example is the work of ALDO (Automated Logic OEMs), a Los Angeles–based company that makes natural-language processing software for critical infrastructure, including oil refineries, that detect when components are faulty and act to repair them. By understanding the underlying principles that underlie such systems, this software can detect potential energy leaks earlier than would otherwise be possible. The technology could one day make it easier to detect leaks than a human operator would be able to detect leaks, while also providing increased transparency and accountability in the form of reduced dependence on human operators.Here, we take a closer look at the technology that enables such systems to detect when components are faulty and act to repair them. The concepts discussed here are the intellectual property of their respective companies, and the methods described below are based on research into critical infrastructure and large-scale data sets. While most of the technology</text>

Such workflows might one day be called natural language understanding.In an ideal world, traffic analysis would identify the human factors that cause accidents, and then help prevent them from recurring. But due to the nature of the infrastructure that humans build, detection is only part of the equation. Engineered systems have to be programmed with critical paths that don’t exist, and that leads to better systems that detect more subtle patterns in traffic. At this point, AI still dominates in most cases, but researchers and engineers are starting to understand that human error is also part of the equation. One could argue that in the coming years, critical paths will be identified through natural language understanding, and AI will play a bigger role than previously thought.As an example of how to think about the infrastructure industry in the coming years, consider the following scenario: In the coming years, infrastructure will be largely automated, but humans still play a role in determining what kinds of infrastructure will be built and how that infrastructure will be built. In addition to predicting the kinds of infrastructure that</text>

Such workflows might one day be called natural language understanding, or NI.As AI becomes more sophisticated and data-driven, its potential becomes more apparent. One might speculate that as traffic volumes and speeds increase, so will the number of vehicles required to run the infrastructure, which in turn will grow. AI will also likely make it easier to monitor traffic, and thus will begin to transform the infrastructure as well. But as AI becomes more pervasive and data-intensive, the resulting productivity losses will become increasingly apparent. A growing body of research supports the notion that even relatively simple algorithms can be repurposed to benefit humanity.Thus, while we might initially think of AI as a technophobic phenomenon, its potential benefits are actually for the common good. The convergence of AI and big data will undoubtedly make it easier for terrorists to recruit, and will undoubtedly make it easier for media companies to control viewers, listeners and readers.

In fact, as the proliferation of AI applications becomes more apparent, it is expected that researchers and engineers will begin to employ algorithms to detect more subtle patterns in human language, and NLP will become even more critical in its role.Already, major datasets and commercial applications are turning up in research and design processes that monitor and analyse the environment, and it is anticipated that the number of jobs in infrastructure will double within five years. And as the popularity of data feeds and apps grows, so does the need for more data feeds and apps. The question is: what kinds of relationships will datasets and algorithms be able to detect? If traffic analysis becomes as routine as the app it is written to monitor, then the kinds of human biases and exploitation inherent to it will become more obvious.How will datasets and algorithms engage with one another in a shared and dynamic environment</text>

Such workflows might one day be called natural language understanding (NLE) systems, and they will come to understand more about the world than ever before.At the same time, researchers and engineers are also expected to begin to create more subtle yet potentially valuable third party applications that integrate data from the infrastructure and traffic analysis, and create new frameworks for collaboration and interaction. For instance, trucking companies will increasingly use algorithms to screen drivers and passengers, and data from the systems to identify those with potential health risks, and then to recommend medical attention and treatment accordingly. Researchers and engineers will be able to create more interesting and valuable applications of NLE.These kinds of thinking are being driven by three converging factors: the biennial, the festival and the startup. In the coming years, researchers and engineers will likely continue to use art as a tool to understand more about the world than ever before, and artists and their artworks will continue to be used within the festival itself. But now and in the foreseeable future, festivalgoers and visitors will be the</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to create the social conditions that will allow artists to flourish in those societies. This is the only sustainable model for the future development of a biennale, since the interests of the art producing countries cannot be allowed to dominate those of the art consuming nations.Art and culture are undoubtedly important in the modern world, but their apparent ubiquity, their inclusion in numerous categories of subject, of cultural, political and economic value, and their possible aggregation with other social values across diverse social and economic levels is largely due to the historical and institutionalised spread of those values throughout the modern world in the wake of colonialism and subsequent economic and spatial colonialism. The biennial has a particularly crucial but uneven distribution in the world, with its overwhelmingly globalised forms dominating many smaller regional and localised versions, and with artists and curators generally retaining their distinctive perspective on art and culture in the modern world.  In the Americas, the biennale is a relatively recent phenomenon: the first biennales started in the late</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to create cultural legacies that will last beyond the confines of these countries.While the biennale may be the most visible form of contemporary art in developing countries, its reproduction is almost total in the United States. This is partly due to the generosity of benefactors, many of whom donate large sums of money to the art institution ‘while the biennale’ via foundations, tax-deductible organizations or individual donations. The institutions that adopt the biennale as a function become, in effect, more accessible and more political in their giving. And this political giving often aligns with the interests of the artist, whose political giving often aligns with those of the institution. With the exception of a few rare exceptions, this alignment is ideological. The biennale is, by and large, a progressive and progressive-leaning art form. It is not always clear which of the many policy directions this ideological giving takes, but in general the biennale has tended to</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to become a counter to the powerful tide of tourism and capitalism. The task is not to conceal the art from tourists, but to expose art to the politics that shape its making and its consumption. The biennale needs to confront its capitalism and become something other than art's convenient spectacle.Transforming the Biennale into a Participatory PlatformElliott Blond has developed a participatory theory of the biennale that is both simple and powerful. It begins by asking: what would be a biennale that isn’t exploitative? In other words, what other uses do biennales serve? If the answer is tourism, then the question is what else can the biennale serve besides the interests of its curators, artists, collectors and patrons. Participatory levels of culture are those where the public can ‘participate’ in the production of art, and this can happen either as an observer, as an artist, or as a patron.  The</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to generate any credibility at all.Of particular interest is what might be called ‘the art’ constituency, or the art collectors and collectors who fund large parts of the biennale. These people form a large part of the biennale market, and are almost always referred to as the ‘Arts Council’ by the media, although they actually constitute a minority. They are important for the biennale because they buy and access art; they form the core audience of the biennale, and they form the basis of future curatorial thinking and practice. The fact that they are largely unaware of, or refuse to engage with, art in the broader cultural context of their own countries, and of other art forms outside of their own cultural contexts, is another factor influencing their practices and thinking. In their book Art as Capital, the Rotondo-Fiddlers describe the 1987 Biennale of Belgium as the most progressive in terms of its cultural and economic contribution to the</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to create the conditions for a future art sector that is not dominated by a few mega-empires.To be successful, such a project will have to address the significant other (the artworld) in a complex series of interactions that render the interests of art producing countries quite unintelligible. The biennale needs to address the value of art and culture in a manner that is both accessible and manipulable. The first step is recognisable: the biennale needs to draw audiences to places and events that they can understand. The art world will understand the value of art and culture in different ways. In Japan, for example, the biennale has traditionally been a time when the government declares war on something or other, and artists and curators are particularly prone to engage in public displays of war fever. The 2013 Totowa Art Biennale, which followed the 2014 Kobe Art Biennale in Scotland, showed off an impressive array of artworks in a city that was character</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to become more than a collection of buildings and artefacts.Art is the contemporary incarnation of ceremonies, and the biennale has been steadily moving away from its original place. Between 1990 and 2005 the number of art museums in North America quadrupled, while the number of art galleries in the UK quadrupled. In 1990 the US designed its first biennale after the US Department of State, and since then has contributed many other years to our own pleasure, invention, and greed. The UK has produced thirty-six biennales, with a constant stream of artists, curators, collectors and writers coming to Liverpool to explore the city and its environs, and to do their part in the lucrative trade in fake tan or antler. During this same time we have produced eleven major museums, many of which have been designed with a British art background. The Liverpool Biennial is a rare exception to this general rule. It was initially conceived as a counterweight to the overwhelming weight of global</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to be able to invest in future growth. It is this latter end that biennials can serve. But to do so it will need to deliver something to the communities they inhabit and purvey to tourists, and often different communities of tourists, in exchange for this. That something will have to be more than tourism, and it will have to be something else entirely. Art and culture are not simply commodities on a commercial market; they are complex investments that require a great deal of self-sufficiency and self-awareness, and the art institution will only see so-called tourism as demand for accommodation, sports grounds, and cultural attractions has to be met in other ways. Art biennials will have to become more than art institutions, or just art institutions. They will also have to become something else, offering something different from what is offered by the museums and zoos of today. That something different will have to be creative and progressive, something to be reckoned with in the museum and zoos</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to keep artists, curators, collectors and spectators coming back.The challenge then becomes changing the rules and regulations of the game. Rules can be changed, but they need to be changed constantly in order to adapt to the changing needs of the society around them. And this is precisely what biennales do best, by giving form to a society that is constantly changing its game. As biennales become more institutionalised and nationalised, the art world struggles to find the humanity in the disinterest in art and culture that was once widespread in the US and western Europe, and to a lesser extent in Asia. The Japanese art market is no different from the rest of the world's, and while its size, the quality of its art and the quantity and diversity of its curatorial output may all be superior to those of the US or western Europe, there is no doubt that the volume and variety of curatorial output in Japan is second to none. Japanese curators are not everywhere brilliant, cutting</text>

The biennale needs to be reprogrammed and re-imagined in ways that will cater to the interests of the art producing countries in order to survive, and to create new forms of understanding and relations between people and place.Art is the frontline of this new imperialism. It is used to fight back, to reclaim lost practices and identities, to assert new networks of exchange and sensation. But it must also be produced in a way that becomes recognisable internationally and transfers that recognisable form into art forms that are more globally accessible and universal. The challenge for the biennale today is much more global and globalising. It is time to consider the new forms of production necessary to support a cultural infrastructure of the future to come.Download this article as PDFJennifer MackenzieJenny Holzer is Associate Professor in the Department of Communication Studies and the Management Interface at the Winchester School of Art, University of London.

My letter was taken from the final version of the Biennale proposal sent to students, faculty, and community stakeholders on October 17. My concerns about the institutionalization of radical pedagogy, the promotion of anachronistic and oppressive ideas, and the legitimization of a single form of art over diverse artistic practices were as follows:Sophie Hope, who is the Chief Curator for the 2014 Biennale, has decided to promote a single form of art over diverse creative activities on the campus.

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was how to deal with the art being placed in the public realm, and not the future. So it was putting a plan together around the artist and the biennial. I started work on the plan in 2002, and it has been an important part of the project ever since.The art world’s reaction to the emergence of self-organising abstract space seems to have been driven by the artist’s increasing self-expression as a function of time spent in the public galleries, as opposed to the other way around: abstract expression as a function of social organisations. This is perhaps why, while the Biennale has produced some great art, it has also produced some great pop art, and some great documentaries. The Biennale certainly needs to be a place where artists can be invited and where the artist’s audience can come to be entertained, to be moved, to participate in a shared and potentially influential way. If the aim is to produce great art, the audience has</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was with how to allocate funds. It was always the case that the Biennial would have to raise enough money to cover its operating costs and to pay artists, so there was a great gulf between the priorities of the artists and the priorities of the board. I made it clear to the Biennial Board that my project was not on their radars. It was a one-in-one-with-one-to-one relationship: the art was there, but the funding was elsewhere. The Biennial Board members then began to feel less like artists and more like patrons. They started to understand the importance of putting in the time and effort to understand the system that was being designed around them.This is the narrative that the biennial has to present to the public and artworld. It is the only narrative that matters. The public is invited to participate in creating the future of art. The biennial is the only narrative that matters. The artist is the only narrative that matters. But how the</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was how to best allocate art resources. I suggested that the biennial might want to establish a Collaborative Relationship with an artist, or a group of artists, to explore how art might work together in that context. The Board of Directors were none other than the members of the artist’s previous institution, the Tate Modern, who had intervened in the Biennale to push it to a later date, in order to maximise the value of their investment. So there was that conflict of interest.My interest in the Biennale started when it was running late, so as not to interrupt the work of the art department, so that the artworks would be there when the biennale was called off. I did the bidding of the biennale, which was done by the biennaleeers, and the Tate Modern, which was run by the biennaleeers. The fact that the biennaleeers had a contract to run the biennale meant that the art department</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was where the art was located. They did not see themselves as curators, but as artists, and so they placed great emphasis on where the art was located, what it was that they could do with the art, and how it might connect to the times. A place of conflict, threat and noise, where the artists were not at ease or uncomfortable. In the 1970s and 1980s there was a sense of artistic innocence in some of the places that were given over to computers, the arts and the metropolis. But as the biennale calendar has become ever more complex and variable – the number of sites and the speeds with which they are evolving – the biennial has had to find a way to find its way around the art-world perturbations. The question is, where is the art? And how does the art locate in the social totality?This is the dilemma that artists now confront, and it is a complex but potentially instructive set of problems to which contemporary art has</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was what to do with the art. I suggested that they place it somewhere else, somewhere private and secure, since it was a ‘gigantic distraction’ from the work that they were doing in the real world. They said, ‘No, that is too far.’I resigned from the Biennial Board in 2004, but I kept on working. I’ve never been able to put my finger on why. Maybe the board members just couldn’t see the big picture. Maybe I was too idealistic: ‘We have an art world now, and it’s the size of the football pitch outside the ground.’But in the end, I never got the chance to ask the right questions. The questions that mattered were, ‘What should the art be?’, and ‘What can the public do with art?’Where are the art and the art be?’When I started work on the Bi</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was with logistics – how to deal with the infrastructures that the biennial was placing in front of them. Art was often placed in predicaments where it did not belong, such as when healthcare was placed in front of transport, or social welfare was placed in front of architecture. But the real obstacle to architecture being designed in accordance to the needs of the city was the perception of inevitability. In an ideal world, the board would announce, in advance, that they were building a hospital, or a school or a playground or a mosque or a sports ground – and to make it permanent, or upgrade it with a helipad or something – and the artists would construct whatever utopian configuration they felt was appropriate, although of course, this inevitably entails making compromises along the way. But this was never supposed to happen in the UK, nor anywhere. The Biennial Board is a mix of social planners, maverick councillors and professional artists; it is made up of people who either have business</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was where the art was or could be placed. They didn’t see art as an immediate end in itself, but as a means to an exciting future in which art’s role is one of many possible roles.Artists and artists’ agencies used to be able to develop strategies around the various levels of government and the ‘big six’ companies. But as the public sector has become more institutionalised and the biennale has become more like every other branch of the museum, the artists have had to find other sources of income. The biennale has always been a rare exception to this rule, and its power to shape cultural behaviour stems from its numbers, which suggest a strong cultural appetite for what is being shown, even if this is not universally recognised. The number one biennial of all time is a reference to the number of people who visit the Venice Biennale each year, but it is also the number one cultural occasion for a country’s most</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was where the art was or could be placed. I argued that the Art Council had a much greater concern for the future of the art form than I did. The Biennial Board seems to have relished the opportunity to place new artworks immediately in front of existing artworks. They have no qualms about making things happen immediately and replacing old art with something new, whether that’s a restaurant, a nursery, a café or a cinema. The biennale has become, in other words, a replacement branch of the Tate Modern or the Royal College of Art.The question of what is meant by ‘artificial intelligence’ has also been a source of friction. The debate over whether to call technologies ‘artificial’ or ‘systems’ is a good-tempered one that gets wrapped up in knots, and it seems as if the computer scientists in charge of ‘deep learning’ were happy to throw out old ‘art’ notions</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was to address the security situation. They didn’t see much point in engaging with the community beyond that. I’m not so sure that today. The biennial has an agenda that includes a community of artists and a public that can value and be inspired by what it presents. That is, of course, until it encounters resistance from somewhere else in the organisation. In the 1960s and 1970s, when biennials began to develop distinctiveness from their exhibitions, through their 'micro-institutionalism', they began to receive significant funding from the Arts Council and National Museums Liverpool, as well as Arts Council funding from the UK and US. So the biennial in its current form, no matter how much it pretends to care about or understand the community it is patronising, is deeply indebted to the artist-organisation that it serves. Not only that, but its mission statement also includes the endorsement of that important artist-organisation.  	Artists who</text>

I remember, when I started work on the Biennale in 2001, the Biennial Board’s first concern was where the art was or could be placed. I wanted to do a project in the city, but I was told ‘Don’t put art in the city.’So I put the Biennale at a time when, as the city grows larger and more burdened with its pollution, it is less and less accessible for artists to operate freely in the city. The board members and artists I have worked with over the years have all said the same thing: It’s important to them that the art be placed where it will be felt most personally by the people who live and work in their neighbourhoods. If the art is placed in places where it’s not wanted, or doesn’t make sense, then those people will always be unhappy. Sometimes the problems with the art are so serious that a biennale can become a crisis. When the Biennale was put on hold in 2011, the sense of irony was incredible.

However, this has come at a cost, as funding has been tight, and art institutions have felt that their investments have been undervalued, or that their investment is under-valued. In the case of a community land trust, the loss of funding can lead to substantial reductions in services, such as housing, healthcare and education, which can further crimp resources and/or reduce tax revenues.

However, this is not enough to address the problem, as a Community Land Trust needs the skill and knowledge to operate an organisation like RPS. 	Instead of continuing to rely on Community Land Trusts to address a growing problem of under-funding, why don’t artists have the skills and knowledge to become concerned stakeholders in an organisation like RPS? Why don’t they have the knowledge and skills to become managers, or lead organisations, or form partnerships, or even just be simply interested in what happens in RPS? Why don’t they have the knowledge and skills to form organisations that can contribute to a more sustainable future for their locality? Why don’t they have the knowledge and skills to become involved in long-term projects, or to be part of smaller, more institutionalised projects that add value to the city and the region? These are the kinds of questions that an artist’s perspective can help answer. 	What do you value most in life? What do you strive to create? How do you</text>

However, this is not enough to address the problem, as a Community Land Trust Board would have to be empowered to create a Land Trust Board, and legislation to create a Land Trust Board would have to be passed by the State Parliament. So far, the focus has been on the ‘Community Art World Championships’ taking place in April 2018 in Melbourne, and on plans to create a similar ‘Community Land Trust World Championships’ in November 2018 in Sydney. All three events would operate independently, although the 2019 Sydney event would be commissioned by the Australian Centre for Urban Research and Art and the Australian National Exhibition Organiser. 	The other players in the market are SpaceX, which is developing a private space launch system, and Google, which is developing self-sustaining cities in its massive massive Big Data approach to analytics.

So the City Council has resorted to creating a Community Land Trust Board, which in turn, have appointed an organisation called ‘Co-operative Development Reserve Board’ which in turn, have authority to set aside land for community use. Co-operative Development Reserve Boards act like local authorities, but operate according to a set of cooperative principles that differ from state law. 	These two models of cooperative government create two fundamentally different worlds. On the one hand, the power to set aside land and resources flows to citizens, and is distributed equally. On the other, the responsibility for maintaining the resources – buildings, parks, roads, etc – flows to large bureaucracies. It is true that in the RPS area, the responsibility for maintaining the resources passed from the trust to the local authority. However, the local authority retains the exclusive right to build schools, playgrounds, parks and</text>

A Community Land Trust Board, or CLT, would then be empowered to make decisions about such things as land use, but this is where the problem lies. Currently, the CLT is largely autonomous, and grants and contracts are rarely given preference over creative ideas and projects. Therefore, it is difficult for an artist to take such a proposal and carry it out, although the CLT may wish to reconsider this in the future if new funding becomes available. 	The CLT may also wish to consider creating an organisation, not an individual, but a hybrid organisation – an association of organisations with a collective purpose and powers over resources. Such an organisation would have the same rights and responsibilities as an individual organisation, but would recognise its unique perspective and powers, and act in concert with other stakeholders, including stakeholders outside the CLT.

Thus, the view of the City of Sydney Council has been that it’s better to have a Community Land Trust Board, empowered by the Mayor to make contracts with Indigenous and local stakeholders, than a Community Land Trust Board, empowered by the City to directly employ Indigenous or delegate management of a site to a non-Indigenous person.

    <text>Should Be Curated by an Artist in Collaboration with a Community Land Trust. 	This is not just an artistic quibble, as is often claimed. It is an engineering problem, and the City of Sydney has been attempting to tackle this problem through the use of its RPS funding, which is distributed equally between art institutions and the city. However, this has come at a cost, as funding has been tight, and art institutions have felt that their investments have been undervalued, or that their investment is under-valued. In the case of a community land trust, the loss of funding can lead to substantial reductions in services, such as housing, healthcare and education, which can further crimp resources and/or reduce tax revenues. So far, the response from the City of Sydney Council has been to seek legislation to create a Community Land Trust Board, which would in turn, appoint an artists' board, who in turn, appoint a land trust board. However, this is not enough to address the problem, as a growing number of artists and their organisations have expressed an interest in collaborating with the City on a more permanent basis, and in conducting cooperative and ‘community-based’ projects outside the context of the RPS, such as through ‘Zoo’ or similar venues. 	So, the question remains whether the interests of the artist, the community and the City are aligned. Is it the case that the interests of the community and the artist are not aligned, and if the City Council does not have the power to align the interests of the artist and the community, then what options do artists have? 	In this context, an artist’s audience is an appropriate representative of the community: it is an identifiable and manageable constituency, whose representatives can be relied upon to take part in what is perceived as ‘the art’, even if this is not always the case. But it could also be argued that the audience is more readily identifiable, and that the means chosen</text>

However, this is not enough to address the problem, as a Community Land Trust Board would have to be empowered and to override any veto by the City Council. A Better Policy Recommendation   	The Community Land Trust Board recommendations are as follows: ‘Create a Community Land Trust Board, comprising at least five trustees, to approve the creation of Community Land Trusts.’ Recommendation #2 adopts the form of a recommendation, and ‘Ensure that at least one of the trustees be an artist.’ 	[i] Langley School of Art’s partnership with the City of Sydney gained approval from the council in 2013, and the Sydney Artsapée has continued to provide artist-initiated work in the city despite the loss of funding.

A similar board could be created through legislation, but this is beyond the scope of this article. 	Instead, the options discussed in this article are those of an artist-in-residence, teaching alongside a Land Trustee or an independent contractor in a collaborative manner, and having full access to funds and resources, while allowing for the autonomy of the individual. These are alternative career paths for artists to explore, and while they may be less glamorous than working as an artist in the traditional way, they are attainable for artists who are creative and resourceful. 	Artists interested in pursuing such a path should take into account the institutional biases and injustices discussed in this article, as well as the power structures that exist in their local area (eg, lack of urban planning and education in the city) and consider how their work could be carried out in a more effective, equitable and socially conscious</text>

A Community Land Trust Board could also delegate this right to the local community, which would empower them to take matters into their own hands and create their own Community Land Trusts. 	Where is the most need for such boards? It seems obvious that a community land trust would have a greater need than a property or building trust, but this is often not the case. For instance, a community land trust may own a building and a building may be useful, but a building and a building are two very different things. A building and a building are biological objects, attached to each other through mutualistic relations. 	So far, so normal. However, over time, the social structures attached to the building and the ground have eroded away, leaving behind barren lands and buildings, as the social interaction between people has been moved out of the building and into the ground. The result is a landscape that is dotted with</text>

A Community Land Trust Board would then be required to amend the Local Government Arts Code to allow for the promotion and maintenance of socially engaged and culturally responsive art environments, as well as the creation of local art online via the CBT. 	The creation of a Community Land Trust Board would also require legislation to empower it to legislate on its own behalf and to implement the decisions of the Council. However, this is not the case for every project, and it is not clear that this is the case for every culturally responsive art project. For example, granting the power to create a Community Land Trust Board to legislate would not create a Community Land Trust Board; it would instead call for the creation of a new Board of Trustees, which would in turn call for the creation of a new Board. Similarly, the powers to call for the creation of a Board of Trustees</text>

The result was an entirely new kind of urbanism that sought to reconcile the conflicting needs of the machine and the people.  A Thousand Plateaus is a monument to both the machine and the people: a shiny building with an incredible mix of human and technological layers, capable of housing and fulfilling the promise of a city, but also a place, where the people live by their own devices – able to shut off the machines but not capable of doing so itself.  A new kind of architecture was born.  A rendering of A Thousand Plateaus made possible by the DARPA Future Soldier contest.  This architecture was neither military, administrative nor technological in nature, but rather a response to the need for infrastructure following the machine’s ravages. It was a kind of architectural fugue, in the making of which the participants had no part.</text>

The two teams created an entirely new kind of architecture – one that was neither military, administrative, nor urban – one that emerged as a response to the need for infrastructure in the wake of a desert onslaught, and one that is both culturally significant and ethically questionable.  The project was presented as a book, but it quickly became evident that the architecture was more like a gallery, with sections dedicated to individual artists, each dedicated to a specific project. Within the context of a desert oasis, each section offered a unique take on the city’s infrastructure or landscape. This kind of branching architecture invites parallel construction, and the artists involved in the project were able to react to the changes in their respective sections of the city. The kind of cultural tourism that occurs within the context of such projects allows us to understand how the structures that comprise our cities were designed in the first place. The kind of cultural tourism that is generated by autonomous cultural units is something that the city can no longer ignore. The city is complicit in the construction of its infrastructure, and as a result, must actively participate in the ongoing dialogue that is generated through the architecture and social dynamics of the area. The city is responsible not only for the infrastructure</text>

A Thousand Platesaus is the architectural essay of two artists whose projects address the city as both source and symptom of the desertification crisis. The works – both commissioned by the American firm Sterling Homes and produced by the firm with Sterling Homes – address the effects of climate change on the North and South, but also the effects on the Mediterranean and North Africa that are contributing to an increase in evaporation and desertification. The architectsʙ responses are entirely political, taking the form of individualized proposals that address both the physical and symbolic loss associated with desertification. In  A Thousand Platesaus, the residents of a Chinese city develop arable land on the periphery of a massive municipal redevelopment project, setting in motion a system of shared management of the local water and air that will alter the character of the city forever. The project is resolved when the citizens collectively decide to return the city to the desert. The return to the river</text>

A Thousand Plateaus was exhibited in New York and won the Venice and ARCHAEologie en Ageynie, among other trophies. Shalom Katz worked with ARCHAEologie en Ageynie curator Asher Levin to develop a new kind of archaeological narrative for the plateaus, one that was both urban and cultural in character. It was a new approach to the materiality of the artefacts, which for centuries had been reduced to representing the geography of ancient empires.

The two teams created an entirely new kind of architecture – one that was neither military, administrative, nor urban – one that emerged as a response to the need for infrastructure in the wake of a desert onslaught, and one that was entirely fabricated. The result was a kind of architectural paradox: the appearance of architectural realignments in the desert, but no office or building whatsoever in the city.  A Thousand Plateaus was also exhibited at the Venice Biennale, but in a different exhibition format. The authorship of this book remains a controversial one, with claims regularly floating around the web regarding the true authorship of Infrastructures: From Oil to Building Materials, in which the work of the authors has been used to illustrate a range of products, from building materials to building insulation to building dust to building building building board stock. The book does not claim ownership of the work, only the responsibility, and the authorities often assert rights over intellectual property. In an attempt to address this, Katz and Kazan establish a company  Infrastructures International (2012), which develops 'smart materials and building products from sustainable energy resources into everyday products and services.

The project was entitled  	Tidewater Towers and ‘retired’ structures. It was a ‘new kind of urban development project that sought to address the concerns of the local people of the Valley’s Tob River Reservation, as well as those of the surrounding area. The structures formed a new ‘temporary exhibition space for the people of the Valley as a whole’ and a new kind of gathering place for artists, historians, artists and other interested parties to come together and explore the place.

A Thousand Platesaus was exhibited in New York and included in the collections of both the Musée d'Orsay and the Herzur Kazan Museum. Shalom Katz’s work emerged as part of a curatorial team for the Venice Biennale. Kazan was a member of the curatorial team for the Tate Modern and the Arlington National Exhibition. A prototype was created and tested, and the two artists then worked collaboratively with the other artists and designers to develop a larger concept for the exhibition. This ultimately led to the development of the Biennale’s current programme of visits, which has recently begun a new phase with the new curatorial team – a new exhibition structure, a new team of artists, a new team of visitors and so on.

Their project was entitled  	A Valley Without Walls 	 and came to be known as ‘Virtual Walls’. The artist Shalom Katz described the project as ‘an extraordinary act of radical precarity’. Her project incorporated traditional building materials and engineering practices, but incorporated the innovative movements of 3D modelling and texturing. The result was a new kind of passive ‘construction’ that could be carried out entirely online. This new kind of architecture did two things: it stimulated new development and it defied all odds and authorities alike. It became known as ‘ultra-low-impact’ and quickly gained a following of online ‘friends’ on Facebook.  A Valley Without Walls was built in response to the threat posed by sandstorms, and its creation coincided with a growing sense of citizen activism spurred by the ecological disaster that was threatening the environment – a crisis that</text>

The idea that a community could somehow reclaim some of the architecture that it had destroyed seemed preposterous at the time, but today, almost twenty years after the project, we learn that project’s destruction may have inadvertently enabled the construction of a new kind of coastal infrastructure.  A thousand plates arranged in concentric circles around a central core, the structures were meant to be self-sustaining, with the outer shells salvaged from nearby buildings and converted into low-cost housing. The idea that such low-density development could be supported by the activity of a few cities that were intent on throwing up every possible brick in the sense of the circular economy seemed preposterous, but the converse has been equally true: if not dealt with, the infrastructures that are the product of the ‘Ring Road’ may well follow the Ring Road somewhere else.

The cars’ human-driven compartments – which feed data back into the car – can’t keep up with the amount of information flowing through them. As a result, damage to the environment is minimized. Cars drive themselves to avoid accidents; if a collision does happen, the brakes are deployed and the car tries to avoid it by accelerating to a safe stop. The advances in artificial intelligence that are being made in the auto industry are so advanced that they are beginning to understand when to brake and to do things to avoid a collision.  The idea that cars could ever think for themselves is a big step forward for humanity, and it is inspiring to think that a car could foresee the future and act accordingly.

It is a turning point because it occurred in such a pre-eminent art space, and because, twenty years later, people still care about what art has to say about climate change. The possibilities are endless. The problem is, the art world hasn't yet learned how to use those potential assets. It is still struggling to figure out how to pronounce something as politically incorrect as Puerto Rico’s vernal equinox.In the coming years, climate change is likely to become more of a theme of cultural consumption, with artists, curators, collectors and art collectors all mobilising to tackle the new vernal equinoxes as a way of signalling the impending destruction of the planet as we know it. It is a desperate market, and the market is a traumatic place for people.

How we perceive the world is a storytelling device, and so we humans need to invent a way to read it as narratives we actually want to be part of? We need to find other species whose stories can be told.

We need to find other species whose stories can be told. Signal: 2017 was a turning point in the history of art and climate change, and it could have a lasting impact. But there are limits to how far we can push this story, and how much of it is fabricated. Artists have a unique vantage point when it comes to writing about climate change, and they have a shared experience of displacement and anxiety. Who we are as artists is also a storytelling device, and so the story that we want to tell isn’t just the story of the planet, but also of our true place on it. This could happen through the creation of new species, or it could involve the continued evolution of existing ones.In any case, the art that we produce and the stories we tell are still products of our cultural environment. We produce it in ways that shape what kinds of artists we are and how we perceive the world. And even though our own work is often deeply influenced by the cultural narratives we grow up with, there is still a real relationship between the two.

It is a year in which artists came together as a disciplinary unit, digging into their collections to collect and store cultural artefacts from the period, and coming up with creative ways to use them as narrative markers or narrative tellers. They traded tales, re-told forgotten history, constructed worlds and engaged with the larger cultural question that still defined the contemporary art of the late twentieth century.But there were also times when the art and culture of the year before was defined more by what it symbolised than what it actually was. This is a crucial distinction, and it shows in the work carried by artists and artists in the year to come. The icon of the oil leak and the coal block in which it was discovered, for instance, will forever be associated with the word climate change. The cultural historian Peter Briggs, in his book Cultures of Global Postcolonialism, traces cultural collapse in the decades immediately following the oil crisis to the mid-1990s. However</text>

However, we were a few short months away from witnessing the thawing of the Arctic Ocean, and it was too soon to declare a global environmental emergency. The challenge now shifts to learning from the mistakes of the past few years, and adapting to the new scenarios that will be faced by humans in the coming decades. If we are going to inhabit the worlds that are around us, we need to create adaptive tools that can tell us when and where to live. Art has many shapes but it is always been about a certain kind of life: the life of the community, the collective life. We need to find another kind of tool: a storytelling tool. Art has many faces but it is always going to be about one person: the artist, the community, the place, the community as one. We need to find a way to identify with the face of art and design, and that person could be the art historian we spoke with in</text>

It will always be a contemporaneous reading for art and cultural production, but it will become increasingly difficult to access in the interests of research-based art practice due to the increasing distance between the artist and the intended audience, and the changing composition of museums and the arts professionalisation agenda. Art will have to find other modes of participation, or it will cease to be an art form.Download this article as PDFJoasia KrysaJoasia Krysa is Professor in the department of Communication, Culture and Society at the University of Alberta, and holds the Canada Research Chair in Cultural Geography.

The art was there all the time, in the exhibition, in the talks, in the publications, and it continued to be made into objects of aesthetic impact. But the art was also commissioned by the likes of Shell, Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical, and others with a clear political agenda, and their messages were often crafted in opposition to the work found in the museums and public galleries where the art was typically not displayed. How do you engage with the political context of art and climate change? Chloe Mills: Climate change is one of the most intractable issues of our time. It’s undeniable that our planetary climate is changing, that we’ve all been impacted by it in some way. But to truly comprehend the scale of the problem, we need to know the full dynamics at work. There are over 1,000 publicly-listed companies involved in the business of climate change denial, and many more that we do not know about. We need to know</text>

Signal: 2017 was a turning point in the history of art and climate change, and it could have a lasting impact.Insigne: 2017 was a turning point in visual art in the sense that it opened new vistas and perspectives, and that it fleetingly attempted to chart a course for art and culture through a social-science analysis. It is true that the artist Olivia Di Giacomo lost her place as a director in the Barbican after the initial Bologna re-enactment, but she is clearly now a global icon and a spokesperson for many. She is a catalyst for change and her work remains evergreen in the public imagination.
