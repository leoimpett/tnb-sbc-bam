The projects include: Breaking the Silence: The Mexico border and the United States (2014-15); Beyond Border: Immigration and the Law (2015-16); and Public Acts: The Biennale of Miracles and Public Acts (2016 -present). In the event that the sites are not found in the Biennale of Miracles catalogue, the Biennale will continue to show the places where the artists have found them. The fourteenth edition of the Biennale of Miracles was originally planned to be held in 2017, but the cancellation of the North American leg due to construction delays and the first Biennale held in 2018 has postponed the event to in 2018. At the same time, the Biennale of Miracles: Vancouver will be held in October 2019. The biennale’s curatorial approach to the site-specific will be determined in the coming months.

As the Biennale of Miracles progresses, participants will be invited to present findings from their research projects at the border sites. The projects include: Breaking the Silence: The Mexico border and the United States border; the MEXICO/US border project (MEXISITECURITY); and the CHILE3 project (Unamuno/Unamuno, 2011-2015). The projects are the products of over a year of research and development, conducted in collaboration with the MIGRES/Tijuana Border Patrols, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the University of Tijuana, and the Instituto de Geografía y Geophysics (IGU) under the joint project (2004–2006). The research projects were led by the Instituto de Geografía y Geophysics, and the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The results of the 2004–2006 project will assist in the design of a new type of biennale that will be able to collect, analyze and interpret the latest scientific and urban research findings on the border, while respecting the site and its history.

The exhibition will also feature an expanded range of scripts from the Mexican border regions, which are used as scripts by the biennale; scripts that speak of the rhythms of migration and of social change.  The exhibition will be offered at the Mariachi Art Foundation gallery in partnership with the Australian and Mexican border commissions, as well as the Mexican National Museum, and the Indigenous Peoples Television and Film Project. The prizewinners of the 2017 Biennale of Miracles will be announced in September.Download this article as PDFJoasia KrysaJoasia Krysa is Professor of English and Director of the English, Art and Media Studies Programme at the University of Liverpool.

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge later.If we take the situation as a whole, then we see that, as a corollary, contemporary art today is deeply influenced by the social; it is much more likely to be produced by and is representative of a given community of artists, many of whom are already artists themselves. This is one reason why, twenty years after the biennial, we have so many biennials, each exhibiting a different kind of artist. And we can also consider why, twenty years after the biennial, we have so many precursors to what some contemporary artists do, and why some artists are better than others.I have begun to think that, in our current period, the biennial is much more a collection of images than a place of relationships. The biennial is a collection of images, but also a collection of symbolic acts, acts of representation, and the like. The collections it presents may be images, but they are also symbolic acts, and, in a certain sense,</text>

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge from the system now.  In the coming years, we hope to see more biennials taking this position, showing work from regions outside the city, rather than within it, and from other artists outside the city, rather than from within it. This may include works created in the city, but also works that were commissioned by, or for the city, such as Sophie Hope, Leonard Bernstein, Peter Carr​, Peter Ken​, Peter McCaughey, Samson Kambalu and many others.  A biennial should be a place where we gather around a common topic and engage with it through a shared set of interests, such as, but not limited to, culture, locality, politics, economics, environment, history and so forth. It should also offer a space for the artist to make work that serves the shared interest of the region, beyond just the typical ‘street-facing’ museum product.  Biennials</text>

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge after the biennial is gone.When, then, does the biennial recommence? It is likely that this will occur during the current ecological crisis, since it is art that can, and often does, play a larger and more influential role in shaping our understanding of the ecological predicament. It is also likely that, as biennials become more and more localised, the role of the artist will also evolve. For example, the biennial today is likely to be more concerned with its corporate image, both as an organisation and as a form of art. Art is, of course, a complex system, and the biennial could not possibly comprehend all the subtleties and nuances of the contemporary artist’s particular situation. Nevertheless, its current and former curatorial approaches are all rooted in contemporaneity, and, as biennials become more institutionalised and nationalised, their curatorial approaches will likely follow the same forms and develop structures as the biennial itself.

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge later. The third element: the biennial as a cultural formThe biennial is a curatorial form that emerged in the United States around the turn of the twentieth century. It is a ‘big box’, consisting of a well-established artistic producer (Art Publishers International, founded in 1903), a publishing house, a trade fair and a public museum (in New York and Philadelphia respectively).  It is a global phenomenon, with exhibitions appearing in all major cities and territories. Today, it is the largest museum in its area, regularly presenting new work from many of its artists’ past institutions. Its focus has shifted from the artist to the museum, but it remains very much an institution. And today it is a venue for many of these artists to be present in a very particular way, to be present in a particular cultural setting, while simultaneously continuing to experiment and demand that their art be contextualised in and through contemporary art’s current cultural form. This last element is</text>

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge later, after the biennial form had become embedded in the museum system. Art, Lewis suggests, is a social practice that becomes politicised when it encounters modernity, and the contemporary artist is a critical theorist of the contemporary condition of political, economic and urbanisation in the age that we call ‘Postindustrial society’. 	The biennial form was not the sole precursory consideration in this analysis, but it is an important one. Drawing directly on his book  	The Contemporary Condition, in which he analyzes the phenomenon of contemporaneity in a range of cultural domains, he suggests that the biennial form has become the primary representation of the ‘urgent need to reclaim and reinvent the once-instrumentalised cultural infrastructure’.[10] This is especially true in the era of the museum, where the once-every-two years has become the norm and discontinuous temporal character of art production, and the permanent (rather than the</text>

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge later. They are the spaces where we expect to find a response, but also the precursors to what some would call a ‘cultural apocalypse’. What we do not yet know is how to measure up to this challenge, which will have to be met in the future, and which will have to be negotiated in advance. In fact, we do not yet know how to negotiate, which is why, in our current period, we are experiencing what may well be a terminal phase, in which the very notion of a possible future is suspect. The biennial form has many pre-existing contradictions and lacks the political and ideological horizon that would render it more malleable. It is, however, a potential space for new artistic practices that are not bound by the rigid formations and ideologies of modern art today.  And this is why biennials continue to exist, even in the face of their increasing political and social importance. Because, although they may have a political function</text>

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge later. And, of course, the biennial as a form will continue to exist in some form or another in the future.3. The biennial as a limited form. The biennial presents its form through a series of interrelated factors: (a) the historical, social and political; (b) the aesthetic; and (c) the practicalities of running the art institutionally and politically. In other words, it is a very particular form that is constantly evolving and subject to change through historical and political forces. The historical and social determinants of the biennial are what make it a biennial in the first place, and the aesthetic and political factors that shape its form and content in a particular historical and contemporary moment. The biennial is a rare event in that it is often preoccupied with the past and the future, especially in its fixation on the past in general. It is an event that is often deeply embedded in the social and political systems of a particular country, but</text>

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge in the future. We can say that these artists are the precursors to Sol Aramendi, but we don’t yet know what she will become. The fact that, during the 1990s and early 2000s, many biennials were located in cities but spread out over Europe and North America only deepened the regional nature of the art form. It is this interstate spatial heterogeneity that is entwined with the different forms of capital in the global contemporary capitalist economy, and that is what the biennial will continue to be. Art and capitalism are made up of many interdependent parts. And as biennials become ever more regionalised, so do their forms of art and social significance shift. A biennial’s reputation as the art form that it reclaims most effectively – and, in many cases, only – serves to legitimise this interstate spatial heterogeneity.

They are the art form that we adopted, but also the very precursors to the kind of social, cultural and political change that we expect from those artists who emerge later. We also know that, as biennial attendance has risen, so has the concentration of cultural resources in certain cities, making them more accessible and insular, and making it easier for artists to be drawn to such cities and to sustainively engage with their cities. And we know that, as biennial attendance has risen, so has the political and economic significance of the art in the city, making it more difficult for artists to be drawn to such cities and to maintain critical distance from them. So, we know that, in the past, art’s political significance was determined by what it did or how well it was marketed. But, over the past decade, critical, even populist, interest in, or even interest in, art has risen mainly from the coasts of California and the Atlantic seaboard, where the biennale is already well established and the accompanying tourism accounts for a significant portion of the biennale's revenue.

If you can come, let me suggest some things to consider in advance, based upon what I heard you say at the convention in Berlin this week.There are three types of biennials: those of art, those of art and art-historical interest and lastly, those of art and art-performativity. Each has its own distinctive character, distinctive set of needs and desires, and distinctive dynamics. I will focus specifically on the art biennial, but there are many other types and sub-types of biennial that simultaneously exhibit a wide range of art from different parts of the world. These are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. We can count on a particular art biennial to exhibit a particular art form, but we also need artists and curators from many different fields of study and experience to bring different kinds of knowledge</text>

While there were still large numbers of doctors and nurses in the community, the number of doctors and nurses would have continued to grow, as would the size of the hospitals. The language of social cleansing here means specifically that the growing numbers of immigrants would have to be persuaded to seek medical attention outside of the NHS. 	The language of social cleansing also implies that the very people with the highest levels of expertise and knowledge would be able to pick up the slack as the NHS contracted. 	The aim of these programmes, as articulated by the  	British Medical Association (1972): ‘To provide the best possible medical care to as many people as possible in as many cities as possible’ is problematic in the extreme. The phrase seems to suggest that the interests of the dominant social group would override those of the disadvantaged group. But the Medical Association’s proposals were permissive rather than restrictive. It was up to local councils to allocate health services and funding according to need and prioritise communities over industry. The interesting thing about social cleansing is that it is not just about rearranging resources; it is also about creating new modes of social organisation that are different from the</text>

While there were still large numbers of doctors and nurses in the community, the number of doctors and nurses would have continued to grow, as would the size of the hospitals. The language of social cleansing and the language of medical tourism implied that people in the locality might want to see a doctor or a nurse again, but the logic of the system was that people with specialised training and access to healers’ clusters would be hired and rewarded. Nurses were seen primarily as frontline workers, while doctors and doctors’ services were seen primarily as destination points for medical tourists. 	The logic of the system worked in favour of those at the top of the food chain. The demand for health care tended to meet the supply of doctors and nurses, whose ranks swelled with the migrants who visited the NHS. 	The production of nurses to work in hospitals, treating patients and dispatching patients across the NHS probably met the production of nurses in the area with equal parts of the work. 	The production of doctors and nurses was less obvious, although the production of doctors and nurses by the mid-1970s is notable for a number of reasons. First, the number of doctors and nurses</text>

The language of social cleansing here refers to those people who would be displaced by the machines, but it also refers to those people who might be forced to leave the community: those are the workers. 	The idea of community development and its many forms – community art, community design, community propaganda and community action was central to the machinery of the health care industry. As the NHS moved from the back of the NHS to the front, so too did the role of artists and artists' organisations shift. While there were still large numbers of artists and organisations engaged in making people ‘well’ through art and culture, there was a shift towards organisations that could instead support the making of things permanently rather than the making of things when the stuff is fit for use.

The new wave of nurses was expected to be educated in the new racial and ethnic diversity of the area in question, with a special focus on those regions with a high proportion of indigenous people.

The language of social cleansing would have to be employed carefully because there was a real chance that the social bargains that were being negotiated with communities might be disrupted by the shifts in the scale of industry. 	The idea of social cleansing seemed particularly galling for the residents of Lambeth, whose histories and present circumstances might be taken into consideration when selecting a path through the city. The issue of community cleansing seemed to overshadow everything else. In the years that followed, many more people moved into the area, many more shops opened, and the area experienced a dramatic increase in population density. It seems quite possible that the entire neighbourhood would have enjoyed a place in the National Health Service had the city not closed several blocks away. That is, of course, if the city had not demolished so many houses. 	The big questions now are: can the city save what it has built, or will it collapse? 	The answer to the first question is easy: yes, the city will inevitably collapse. But the question is</text>

While there were still large numbers of doctors and nurses in the community, the number of doctors and nurses would have continued to grow, as would the size of the hospitals. The language of social cleansing in this context is a difficult one to parse, but it is generally agreed that the advent of electronic health records allowed for rapid access to data, diagnoses and services. The language of social cleansing in this context can be found in the phrase ‘We Are Here to Stay’, coined in 1984 by Jenny Wright, a slogan that she repeated ad infinitum throughout the years that she was NHS worker for many years. 	Jenny Wright said that she used the phrase because she had no choice but to provide essential social services to patients in the 1980s and 1990s because there was a risk that the politics of the NHS might intervene and make it impossible to deliver essential services in the future. 	Jenny Wright’s recollection of the contribution made by the NHS to the aims of the Welsh Streets Campaign is hazy, but at the Chapel of Versailles in 1994, she spoke of the campaign’s constant need to reassess</text>

While there were still large numbers of doctors and nurses in the community, the number of doctors and nurses would have continued to grow, as would the size of the hospitals. The language of social cleansing would have to be adapted to cope with the new employment models. This is why there was such a push to create social enterprises and childcare as alternatives to the ‘blue collar’ and mining jobs of the coalmines and mines. These were seen by the state as an ideal labour market, full of opportunities for promotion and retention. 	The language of social cleansing also has a way of returning, sometimes powerfully. A gesture or a suggestion can mean something different in the context of a class struggle, and so we can translate the logic of the health and social justice movements into language that anticipates, underlies and contributes to them. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s the fight for voting rights was won in large part by mobilizing communities to produce and distribute electoral materials and engage in door-to-door campaigning in heavily populated urban centres. These actions, along with other forms of political action, created the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which ushered voting rights for certain</text>

While there were still large numbers of doctors and nurses in the community, the number of doctors and nurses would have continued to grow, as would the size of the hospitals. The language of social cleansing meant that people in the community who were considered to be particularly being &quot;other&quot; – culturally different, language minorities, persons with disabilities etc – would be sent to work in distant locations or scrub-chasing across city centres. 	The language of social cleansing then offered employment to people who might otherwise be employed making bricks or masonry or in the service of a factory or shop floor. Such opportunities then ceased to exist, but rather entailed the provision of social services to attract workers to the area and the provision of facilities for their accommodation and welfare. 	There  	were of course far more opportunities available to the poorest members of the community. Housing was of course a problem. But the scale and nature of the refurbishment meant that the resources available to the poorest neighbourhoods was drastically reduced. Schools, playgrounds and sporting fields were also heavily refurbished. Some neighbourhoods in the core neighbourhoods that were redeveloped for the new system saw an increase in residents and business opportunities, while others saw</text>

The language of social cleansing sounds eerily like the language of capitalism today. 	The growth of the NHS coincided with a corresponding decline in the size of the community of people with disabilities, although it is important to note that this coincided with an increase in the size of the NHS workforce. It was, in fact, people with disabilities who were given the boot. The  NHS maternity commission was disbanded in 1948, but much of what it did to support pregnant women and their newborns was administrative. It did away with large numbers of midwives and other midwifery staff, and it did away with  	a midwife’s role in delivering a baby. Instead, midwives sat for years with their patients, offering individualised attention to individual needs.

In Italy, the Biennalee was presented the day after the 2016 Venice Biennale, and the year before it hosted the 1924 Vienna Biennale. It continued to be a core institution of the Venetian State until 1981, when it was closed due to a budget emergency.[10] A project in the making and with an annual budget of over 200 million lire (about US$266 million), the Biennalee has become one of the most recognisable symbols of the Italian Renaissance, and is a frequent subject of journalistic and critical inquiry. With its decision to divest itself of most of its assets, in 2014 the Biennalee took a historic €1.5 billion (about US$1.85 billion) in a restructuring that institutionalised, de-profiled and privatised much of what it considered to be its historic role as an international cultural venue.

In Italian, the vocabulary here uses the term ‘cultura’ to describe the art produced at the Arsenale, including the building materials, the construction materials and even the paint that was used on the building. In the context of the Venice Biennale, the Biennalee dell’Arsenale and the Arsenale, the Bioneale is a term that denotes both the site and the product of the exhibition, while the Arsenale, which closed in 2016, and the present exhibition, which opened in 2017, referred to the act of consumption at the moment of its creation. International guests were invited to join the conversation.  A few months before the opening of the 2016 Venice Biennale, the curator Andrea Libertari spoke about the importance of the Biennalee as an element of the cultural organisation that is built around the site: ‘It became evident that the project was building</text>

Italian art as a city is a fitting setting for this new research-based exhibition format because the Biennalee is a global institution, with exhibitions currently in over forty countries and territories. Italian art, and the Biennalee in particular, is a globalised art form, with exhibitions currently transacting across borders and regions. The Venice Biennalee is a global institution, with exhibitions currently in sixty-five countries and the Americas, Eurasia, and Oceania. Its main international exhibitionary market is the Chinese art market, with shows in eighty-five cities outside of China. Its European market is the Russian market, where it is part of the Art.

The 2017 Venice Biennale is the only public institution to have participated in the exhibition-buying public, who have been shown a larger version of the Biennale dell’Arsenale’s catalogue on a weekly basis.[10] The Biennalee dell’Arsenale appears to have anticipated the Biennale of Sydney, which followed a few years later, in that both organisations aimed to catch-on with the local art world and were aware that their exhibitions would become entwined with wider public engagements. The Sydney Biennalee even commissioned a book from the author, Niall Ferguson, which they have published together, with a new edition of the same publication due in 2017.The other exhibitionary institutions that I have mentioned here regularly</text>

In 2017, it established a research-based museum called Glove Market, based on the ideas of a market microcosm but addressing contemporary art practices, with a curatorial focus on the role of art as a social system-regeneration tool.[9] In the main exhibition hall at the 2016 Venice Biennale, the Biennalee dell’Arsenale presented a new take on the Arsenale's architectural style, this time focusing on the Italian city as a site for the production of infinite sets of commodities. Large glass displays of artworks and artefacts from the Arsenale were used as figures in a market microcosm, in this case the production of leather, rubber, electronics, textiles, automotive parts and much more. The idea was that the function of the artefact was two-fold: firstly, to project the infinite range of possibilities of the capitalist market into living space (a.k.a. manufacturing and service centres); secondly, to render these products physically inaccessible (e.g. by covering them with decals or textiles); and thirdly, to offer a service to others – a group or a society – in exchange for something – often via the suggestion or manipulation of others.During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of artists, curators and arts administrators, including Peter Ustinov, Leonore Kopp, Michele Christov-Bakargiev, </text>

Italian pavilions, with their low profiles and often minimal interventions, were replaced by ambitious social media projects and architectural renderings, while Dutch pavilions were often displaced by a more urban setting. The new thinking in the pavilion was based on the concept of InSite, when the Biennalee sets up shop locally in the city, with the city serving as a microcosm of the region.[10] InSite is a concept that suggests a site-specific set of characteristics that distinguishes an idealised historical neighbourhood from a redeveloped urban neighbourhood. It is a way to identify and reference places that can be preserved in perpetuity through memorialisation.[11] A clear example of a site-specificity curatorial initiative, the Arsenale Biennale dell’Arsenale, 2016 featured a total of twelve pavilions, each housing an artist performing a unique work in a different city.

In the new art spaces, function and function over time, in the form of a large, self-generating ecosystem, the systematised production of which generates art and art-related products and services on a global scale. The opening of the Biennalee dell’Arsenale in 2017, however, signalled the beginning of a new era for the Biennale in Venice, with the Biennalee dell’Arsenale announcing that it would no longer attend the Venice Biennalee, but rather would embark on a 'curatorial journey' in support of the Giennale. The Biennalee dell’Arsenale’s announcement of a new curatorial role signalled a new phase in the exhibition business in Venice, where artists, curators and art collectors congregated around the buildings of the former Arsenale, with curators selected from the city’s top artistic and curatorial teams</text>

In the Biennale itself, the episode was presented in chronological order from the first Venice Biennale to the present, with an overview of each project’s development. The episode was shown simultaneously in the main exhibition hall, with voiceover and text, as well as in the context of the Arsenale, with key works from the episode, texts and visuals projected on to large screens. The episode was narrated by Chris Wainwright, who acted as expert witness for the prosecution in the Julian Assange trial, and whose testimony at the trial of US citizen Bradley Manning about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars led to the first Iraq war. The episode was also featured in an edition of Wired magazine, with a seven-page spread that included a spectacular shot of the Arsenale site in London, alongside numerous photos and a chronicle of the war’s causes.

She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Art History and Creative Writing from Montana State University, and a Master of Arts in English and Film Studies from Columbia University.Biennials, and the economic circulation of art’s historical ephemera, have long been a source of contention for cultural historians, artists and curators alike. The Venice Biennale, which began in 1999 and is the largest and most prestigious of its kind, and the world’s most expensive art auction, is an example of this dynamic. The festival is characterised by a speculative, dynamic and sometimes contentious ‘biennialisation’ of cultural forms and activities, which in the case of Venice, has led to a speculator’s occupation of historic places and artefacts.

There are those who would call it nature’s grassy knoll, others who would call it the urban gauntlet. But despite these broad generalisations, there is no doubt that the boundaries between the natural and the artificial are becoming increasingly blurred. The shifting of habitats, the arrival of outsiders, the expansion of large-scale infrastructure projects are taking place on a grand scale. Meanwhile, the number</text>

That is, if the underlying principles are to be discovered, they need to be discovered publicly. Otherwise, the promise of AI will be realized without the people behind it being able to properly comprehend the consequences. This is the classic definition of a genuine AI: an operating system that has consciousness.[…]In a larger perspective, the possibilities for AI are numerous and yet so precarious. Assembling minds in massive data feeds is not a new idea, but the growing number of data feeds available on a global scale makes it increasingly difficult to imagine what kind of humanity might emerge from such systems. In addition, while it is true that today's AI is conscious, it is being driven by data, and as a consequence will inevitably follow the patterns of human cognition. So while it claims to understand the world in unprecedentedly complex ways, what it ultimately aims to do is divide and rule – stripping citizens of their agency and leaving its creators entirely defenseless. This is the dystopian future envisioned by futurist Ray Kurzweil, and it is why research on Kurzweil’s Viewpoint AI project is so critical.</text>

The dream of a job, a place to call your own, freedom, the American dream. But what if the jobs don’t exist? What if the American dream becomes a nightmare? What if the dreams of too many people are replaced by automated overlords? What if the machines become far too powerful? What if the machines become far too corrupt?These are questions that need to be asked and answered publicly. And they need to be found in a book or a journal or a catalogue. Because the bigger picture that emerges is that of a societal breakdown. And the more breakdowns emerge, the more opportunities there are for civil unrest. So we need to understand the dynamics that create the potentialities and opportunities of a potential new form of AI. And we need to understand the problem in order to devise effective means of resisting or countering it.This is what I call the architecture problem. It</text>

And if those systems become public, then the promise of AI will be realized in the form of free software, which can emerge under the auspices of creating legal rights and governing socialities, not on the grounds that it is a desirable application of AI but because it is a desirable application of legal rights.)I believe that what is needed is a public debate on the nature of AI, a debate that is as transparent as possible, so as to allow the AI community to scale up its projects without having to compromise its principles. I would like to see a public debate about what kinds of rights and values might allow an AI to make decisions that are not bound by the ropes of human reasoning and reason.

We need to understand the principles that underlie AI in order to build effective countermeasures.A version of this article was originally commissioned by San Francisco–based architectural firm Arup &amp; Co. for a project they were conducting in tandem with the San Francisco–based Museum of Modern Art. The project, entitled  	Signal, explored the emergent role of AI in the contemporary urban environment. The exhibition was part of their larger ‘Arrival: The Architecture of a Future City’ project, part of the Museo Nacional de Arte Contempora Project, and part of the National Gallery’s new ‘Contempora: Contemporaneity, Contemporaneity, Contemporaneity’ exhibition series.

That is, if the underlying principles are to be discovered, they need to be discovered publicly. Otherwise, the promise of AI will be realized only if the underlying assumptions are left to chance and natural selection. Even then, only a fraction of the potential outcomes will be realized, and only a fraction of the people will be able to participate fully. That is, the technologies will often end up in situations and in cultures where participation is constrained or nonexistent, and in those cases, political, legal or social struggles are likely. That is, there are likely to be negative social consequences to the actions of a very small minority of people. That minority is small in the grand scheme of things, but it is a minority with a voice and a presence and that is a powerful negotiating advantage.If the assumptions underlying AI are to be freely renegotiated and changed, then the potential impacts of these changes need to be openly and transparently reported in a public, widely accessible and palpably measurable way. This will require an open and transparent platform that is accessible not only to the people with a stake in the technology, but also to non-technical users</text>

The challenge will be to engineer systems so that they can face real-world challenges – challenges that may yet lie ahead. This may require compromise on the part of some, but the end result should always be the same: new possibilities, new possibilities. This is the American dream.This dream is not all that dissimilar to the dream of millions of Chinese immigrants – though in the West, the differences are greater. The American dream is a world where everyone can aspire to greatness – the very definition of which is defined by the supremacy of one set of values over another. But the Chinese dream is different. The Chinese dream is defined by a strict caste system, which precludes the possibility of any other. The system seeks to produce a monolithic elite through a rigid hierarchical structure of values and behaviours. This elite is distinct from the citizens of any other country, and it is distinct from any other set of citizens. The system</text>

We need to research and theorize on the underlying principles that underlie AI until we fully understand them. Then we can unleash AI on the world as a terrorist threat emerges if we do not find the underlying principles that underlie the threat.This sounds daft on its face, but the reality is that the AI threat is real and has been for several decades now. The stakes are high and the political and legal systems that protect us as workers and citizens are often quite cynical about the threat that AI poses. For example, many European governments seem to be moving away from traditional forms of legal representation for workers and citizens, preferring to rely more on self-organization and AI. The reason is that it is cheaper and easier for workers and citizens to become self-managed through the use of social media and other modern conveniences. Furthermore, if the social media becomes automated, the legal system will have to adapt to cope with the growing number of potential new</text>

We need to actively engage in the research and development of AI so that we can learn how to value and use AI constructively, because the possibilities are truly apocalyptic. The more we know, the more we can do with being instructed, the more we can automate and discover new ways of doing things, the more possibilities there are for catastrophe. This is the debate that AI should in theory and in practice confront.The second debate is whether or not AI should be allowed to replace humans in most or all aspects of human society. The debate rages on about what constitutes an AI and how an AI should be governed. In general, the concerns of the debate revolve around the fact that AI threatens not only the jobs and careers of humans, but also the very humanity of AI systems. The debates over whether or not AI is safe and secure are as old as the field itself. We’ve all been participants in one way or another in the debates and controversies</text>

That is, if the underlying principles are to be discovered, they need to be discovered publicly. Otherwise, the promise of AI will be for naught. This is the dangerous glut of knowledge available to the public. It is as if the underlying principles of AI are so fundamental that a person with a set of AI skills should be able to identify patterns and similarities across human languages with a high degree of accuracy, yet there is currently no transparency or public sharing of these principles across countries, cultures, regions or nations. The desperate search for transparency and shared principles is part of the AI mission creep. The search for common ground amidst the noise of global AI activity is part of the reason why places like San Francisco and New York are still struggling to recover from the effects of the tech bubble and financial crisis. It is also why so many new AI creations are created in Bangalore and Mumbai. These are places where the commonality between humans and machines is actively sought out and actively opposed.

It is a somewhat dystopian one – with some hopeful signs of life, but with much of the planet utterly submerged in a kind of slow-motion apocalypse.  	One could ask what kind of future is envisaged by the deployment of this kind of architectural style, this kind of digital technology. I would say that we do not yet know what kind of future we want to build, nor how we want to build it. We do know that thinking about the future is inherently related to looking back at the past; and we also know that looking back at the past is inherently related to looking at human creativity. So we are encouraged to spend a great deal of time looking backwards, in order to invest in looking forward, which inevitably leads to disappointment and unhappiness in the intervening decades. 	But there is a way to increase our ability to imagine the future that is not bound up in the present – and that is what art and critical theory have been about all along. The problem with the present is that it-norms, embedded in us all, and thus the future is seen as something that can be solved, rather</text>

So the future that we envision is not a particularly hopeful picture. It is a somewhat dystopian one – with some hopeful signs of life, but with much of the planet utterly submerged in a kind of slow-motion apocalypse.This is why science-fiction writers tend to envision a pessimistic future – one in which machines rule the earth and humans become submerged in a vast, technologically enhanced aquatic dystopia – whereas real life thrives alongside such environments. The problem with the future is not so much with the technologies that we use to create it (though progress in artificial intelligence certainly helps), as with the subtler, more fundamental determinants of which technologies will shape what future. This is the problem with ‘future thought’: the possibilities that are meant to exist in the present but are actually meant to be taken – and which technologies will become what ‘heresy’ – are limited. For example, the possibilities of artificial intelligence means that it is possible to design machines to perform complex ‘task’s, but this comes at a price: it is possible that the machines will become so intelligent that they will no longer need humans to perform the tasks at hand, and so negate the need</text>

It is a somewhat dystopian one – with some hopeful signs of life, but with much of the planet utterly submerged in a kind of slow-motion disaster that is itself often precariously unstable. And yet, through various kinds of future planning, we can alter this picture.The kind of futuristic urban planning that seems to be gathering pace around the world is that of NRx – New Reference Architecture. And NRx is, in a certain sense, an adaptation of what Christopher Caldwell called ‘the Age of Enlightenment’ – or, to be more specific, the postmodern period that began in the late eighteenth century and continues to this day. This epoch is defined by the development of language, and so NRx seeks to render modernity as intelligible in the presence of new technologies of global communication. NRx is not postmodern in the strict sense – or perhaps not in the sense that postmodernism is itself postmodern – but it is careful to emphasize the way in which new knowledge and technologies bring with them new knowledge and technologies of cultural form and organisation. In this sense, NRx is a kind of apocalyptic vision of</text>

There is no apparent singularity to understand and describe, and no apparent singularity to understand how and when to act. This is one kind of infinite time.’2 So, the kind of infinite time imagined by the AI is not that imagined by humans – although some of the human creativity embodied in the AI is very human – but is rather an expression of the intelligence of a kind of abstract being known as ‘intelligent life’ that is abstracted from and transformed by the capacities of its host. And this kind of   inexhaustible  ‘time’ imaginary macro-time, or philosophical, metaphysical, religious and political time, is what Njabulo-Webb distinguishes from ‘what is typically called ‘natural’ time (which is to say, human-biased and contemporaneous with</text>

So the future that we envision is not a particularly hopeful picture. It is a somewhat dystopian one – with some hopeful signs of life, but with much of the planet utterly submerged in a kind of slow-motion geological singularity.This is the kind of question that science can answer fairly easily. There is no singularity – in reality, there are many different versions of what the singularity might be – but there is a growing sense of the collective meaning of the human species evolving towards a future in which much of what we call the ‘present’ is going to be replaced by artificial intelligence. As more and more data is gathered and shared between laboratories around the world, the future that is being imagined now is going to be replaced by a kind of synthetic ‘future’ that is much more like the past but with much less of what we would call history. So one could imagine a world in which the human species is no longer the dominant species on Earth, in which other species make substantial contributions to the ecology of Earth, and in which the role of the individual is reduced to that of a platform or resource or carrier or carrier of data. And this is precisely what is being done</text>

Even less is the kind of hopeful future envisioned by the futurists: a world in which people no longer exist, but instead live among us in technologically enhanced but still submerged forms of pre-ageless automatism. There are of course other kinds of technologically mediated ‘future’ – ones where intelligence emerges naturally from the underlying principles of life itself – and these have its own kind of technological literacy. But there is one more kind of technologically mediated future that I want to sketch here – the kind envisioned by Robert Heinlein and Mark Miodownik – in which the technological augmentations of the future are accompanied by a kind of pre-figuration of the conditions of life thereafter. This is the kind of pre-figuration that is meant to be experienced: the kind of augmentation that is meant to make life more convenient, more fulfilling, more propitious in various ways. This kind of augmentation is what John A. Church and his fellow travellers in the</text>

We actually have to work to keep the lights on; if nothing is being done to keep the lights on, then the world is as black as a Christmas tree. And yet, despite our efforts, the world we inhabit looks bleak – it is extremely bleak. We actually have to work hard to keep the lights on, but, given enough space and enough time, human creativity can bend the fabric of space and time in ways that are both predictable (the future will be like this) and unpredictable.

In this future, technology has made possible a kind of intelligent time – one in which human intelligence can extend the reach of its imagination and imagination's grasp on reality. In this future, there is no need for seafloor mining or massive offshore drilling rigs; the seas are too vast and far away for humanity to colonize. There is no reason for humans to settle on islands or in remote regions: the vast majority of the world ocean is now grazed by agriculture, and urban sprawl is common. There is no reason to build ever-more-powerful mines and dams; sea-level rise is a fact of life in the world ocean today; and coastal erosion is a reality of life on the planet as</text>

It is a construct that is as real as life itself.The point is to think about and imagine alternative futures, and to work towards a future that is not necessarily the exact same as the present – in other words, not necessarily the utopia of the future. This is why so many environmental thinkers in the 21st century seek to engineer and design future cities in such a way as to maximize the ecological impacts of existing infrastructure, but also so as to actively participate in creating that infrastructure ourselves via direct action. It is to say and do things differently.This kind of proactive involvement is precisely what is needed for a meaningful critique of the current mode of political and economic organization of the world.

[1] The term ‘future city’ was coined by André Assouline in 1980, and its cognates include those ‘artificial islands’ that are being added to the planet as buildings, plants and data processing units. More specifically, it refers to the metainterface – the technological surface that is being replaced with a digital one – and the associated changes that result. So the technology is replacing the art – or, more precisely, it is creating a new form of art that is being produced in response to the replacement of the art form.

I began by asking what the Oxford English Dictionary calls a ‘biennial’. The answer is a brief ‘short answer’ in a big ‘big’.  At its most general, a biennial is a ‘collective of places … visited by a common people over and over again’. In that sense, it is the very essence of the concept. But what makes biennials distinctive from other forms of cultural tourism is that they are self–generating, and thus not confined within the confines of a city or a particular region. They radiate outwards, and in many cities they are self–generating themselves. This is a new kind of biennial, one that is not confined within the city or its historical tourist infrastructure, but expands outward towards all of humanity. The issue of where</text>

The London 2012 project, curated by Deborah Morgan, is the first American commission–funded project to do so. London’s Biennale is the only surviving instance of a commissioning agency that commissioned an artist to undertake a full-fledged cultural project in the city, rather than a curatorial or research project. London's Biennale began as a curatorial intention, and has remained so to this day. Since its founding in 1864, the Biennale has commissioned artists from many places to explore themes of the biennale. In doing so, it has often required that artists create a new situation in which to engage with the biennial as a cultural form, and thus has often produced artists who then inhabit an altered reality.1 Nina Edge, ‘Chronophobia: The Alien and the Host’, in The New York Times, 10 November 2008.

London’s Biennale is the first commission–funded project to be co–curated by an independent artist, and the first American commission–funded project to do so. It is an art project, committed to the public good, and images that are works in progress. The project began as a public display of affection for the city, and its history and present, and an act of remembrance and participation in that city’s rapid urban transformation. By the end of the project’s development, an intimate but also very public ceremony was held in the Tate Modern, where the artists created a public casket for the occasion, in which the artist was placed on a platform above the rest of the casket’s weight, and where the casket was placed upon a platform in front of a live band. In this new role, Morgan–herself a former resident and artist–commissioned several smaller works, some of which were installation pieces, in many cases accompanied by readings and poetry from the artists and</text>

London’s Biennale is the culmination of a long history of biennials being hosted by the same city authorities across the globe. The periodic fee for hosting a biennale is US$10 million, and the organizers expect up to 200,000 people to visit the London event. Biennials have been a fixture in London for centuries, and have a strong cultural impact on the city. The London event will be the first in a new wave of biennials to be founded in New York, and will mark the first time in history that two biennials from the same city’s two continents will be in close contact. The London Biennale will be New York’s first, and perhaps only, biennal of its kind.The New York Biennale has been planning for more than two years, and is now at a critical stage.

In this we learn how, more than two centuries before Francis Bacon proposed the biennial as an exhibitionary form, Bacon recognized the power of the biennial to speak the language of experience and identity, and to shape perceptions.Bacon’s ideas about the biennial are central to our understanding of the biennial as an event that emerged after the end of World War II. World War II meant that the biennial would have to be substantially reorganized, and Bacon’s ‘permanent motion picture museum’ would have to be significantly expanded. In the years that followed the war, the biennial found new forms through the reorientation of exhibitionary sources, with the public and curatorial focus shifting back and forth between the United States and Europe.

The London 2012 project, curated by Deborah Morgan, is the first American commission–funded project to do so. London’s Biennale is the only remaining American commission–funded project, and its continued institutional memory is a product of the postwar migratory boom, which provided funding and institutional space for artists to develop careers elsewhere, especially in the West. The biennial is a recurrent event in London, but its original intent – to discover and document the stories of artists and exhibitions – is lost in the mire of institutional memory and bureaucratic change. Biennials are, in the main, art displays in museums, and exhibitions in biennials – they were not there to tell the stories of artists, or to act as repositories of their creativity. They are there to study art, to witness art being made elsewhere, and to acquire, document and present the art made elsewhere.This memento of the event is a rare artifact, and a relic of a bygone age.

It is the largest and most visible of its kind, with a dedicated exhibitionary collection, an important research station, a highly visible collection of curators, an international reputation and a significant impact on the city. It is also the only biennial to have had a permanent curatorial position. The London Biennale 2012 project was part of the curatorial constellation created by the then deputy directorate of the London &amp; South West Surrey Museum, Dr Katherine Shear. The directorate was established in 2012 and has a curatorial focus on the arts and culture of the region around the museum, with a special focus on the arts and culture of the region around the museum. The curatorial agenda for the 2013 project was developed through a multi-year research agenda. The project was also supported by the Southwark and District Museum, whose collections and collections of art and artefacts support the museum and its work. The museum was</text>

London’s Biennale is the most recent in a line of European commissions to establish a city-wide, city-wide exhibition center. It is the largest and most prestigious biennale in the world, with a permanent collection of approximately 7,000 works from 40 countries. It is also the only biennale in London. Yet, despite its status, the biennale has largely avoided addressing the city’s architectural heritage crisis. This is partly because, despite the city’s huge population growth and rapid population explosion in the surrounding area, its biennials have tended to be developed and urbanised, not in the old urban way of the biennale, but in the new urbanisation (and art’s place in it) of the city. In fact, the biennial as an institution has largely avoided making any architectural or historical contributions to the crisis of urban space, preferring instead to blame past exhibitions for the glut of space and the glut of goods generated by it.

If there’s going to be any future for the city, it’s going to have to be through the integration of a large number of different communities. And so what’s happening in Liverpool is quite different to what’s happening in other places where massive developments are being made in the name of economic growth. For example, in the Liverpool Biennial, the introduction of certain artists is paired with the re-embracing of certain neighbourhoods. The idea is that these new districts are places where the arts are actively embedded in a community; places where people come to play, make art, meet other artists and so forth. And although this sounds good on paper, what’s happening in Liverpool is actually quite different from what’s happening in places like Liverpool, Pittsburgh or even Detroit. The reason is that in Liverpool, as in many places in the UK, the art is being produced in isolation; it’s being produced in a different environment to the</text>

If the plans are too good to be true, then perhaps the plans are not as good as they seem. That’s the dilemma facing communities like Liverpool: the challenge is making the best plans that will allow the city to function, but also trying to work alongside other communities to create what’s left, so that what’s happening to the city doesn’t happen to us.     At the same time, the city is being swallowed up by what’s called ‘The Biennale Industry’, which is being driven by the city’s biennale commission and many other entities. It’s a mutually exclusive two-tiered system: as soon as the biennale commissions a project, they’re obliged to license it to other organisations; and as soon as the biennale commissions a project, they’re obliged to allocate it amongst themselves. So Liverpool’s development binge seems to be mutually</text>

If the City is going to destroy what’s left of it, then why should the countryside? Why should architecture be any different? Why should the city be any different? And why should the city function any differently? These are the kinds of questions that seem to be cropping up again and again these days, and they’re aghastening. Why are we building new transport tunnels under the River Thames? Why are we building new museums under the City? Why are we poisoning our rivers with such massive water collections? Why are we poisoning our seas with such massive aquatic plant and animal collections? Why are we poisoning our air with such massive deflection systems? Why are we poisoning our food chains with such massive harvesting and disposing systems? Why are we poisoning our cities with such massive urban infill (suburbans and high rises, which are becoming increasingly rare) – and why don’t we seem to be addressing these problems? Why don’t our cities seem</text>

If the City is deindustrialising, we’re deindustrialising, and if we’re not developing the city in any way, the only way for the city to grow is for a large number of people to be relocated there. The irony is that the reason why so many artists and creatives moved to places with better conditions – better cities, more places to live, more opportunities – is because of the city’s creative class’s lifestyle, which is incompatible with the declining number of people.  My question is this: what kind of lifestyle is that?  I’d like to know what kind of lifestyle entails. DIM:  You’ve got to be kidding me!  You’ve got to understand that this is not hypothetical. This is not some fantasy. This is happening. It’s happening right now. It’s happening across the globe.  The only thing that separates us is the amount of water we</text>

If the plans go ahead, a large number of people will be displaced and will have to find somewhere to live. But even if the plans are put into effect, and the city becomes extremely successful at supporting itself, what will become of the art that’s built there? What will become of the history and imagination and imagination of the city? This is a difficult question, and I don’t think it can be resolved by just saying, well, the city needs a lot of roads and bridges and tunnels and can therefore do with it. The hard truth is that the city doesn’t need these things anymore, and so it has to ask, what next? The city cannot simply recycle what’s happening to it, because it’s becoming increasingly difficult to repair, and so it has to start asking, what next? I think the answer is that the reason why a community is able to become so powerful in challenging something is that it’s able to accumulate</text>

If the plan is to build a tunnel boring machine in the city, then the only way for the city to access that machinery is if a lot of people buy into the hype about the wonders of life in the megastructure and become reliant on its machines, which is what’s being done in Liverpool.  The whole reason for the tunnels is to allow inbound traffic – which is of course only possible because the city is so interconnected and travels at such a high speed that it takes literally hundreds of years for any one of those infrastructural projects to be built. So while the hype around the projects certainly helps, it doesn’t really deliver what the boosters think they’re delivering.  The tunnels, the bridges, the railways, the ports – they’re all infrastructure, and so are the infrastructures that are being developed as part of the ‘New Economy’. Art is part of that process of new economy formation, connecting</text>

If the city is to be saved, a whole host of other issues must first be addressed, including the fact that now that the tunnels are abandoned, the whole city seems to be a platform for some kind of artificial precipitation that’s part of a geoengineering programme. So the only way to really get involved in this is for a city to be created through collaborative consensus, and so far, no one seems particularly interested in that. Of course, in a future city, there would still need to be a council of city residents who would decide what kind of city that should be, but at the moment, the consensus seems to be that the city should be static and unchanging. That’s why in Liverpool, when the underground is closed, people keep coming out anyway: to the shops, to the ferry, to the museums. And they’re welcome, even if they don’t feel like coming inside.

I grew up in the area around Anfield – a quiet neighbourhood with decent neighbourhoods – but I moved out when I could afford to live elsewhere. I still love to play football for the local kids, but I don’t play much anymore: I played every week, for two years in a row, as a young player, and then I stopped playing altogether. Playing football was a solitary thing for me, unlike the football teams or even the soccer moms who would often come out to play with the kids. Nowadays, I don’t really see myself as a footballer; I tend to do more of the housework, tend to the garden and tend to the chickens.

If the City is going to expand, it’s essential that a high quality of life is provided for people living there – something that’s being severely hindered by the city’s ongoing crisis of housing. The City has been trying to fill this gap of housing for years, but nothing has been done. Now that the crisis has gotten so bad that the City is in danger of going bankrupt, it’s time to try again. The decision to try again is arbitrary and capricious, but the City’s decision to spend tens of millions of pounds renovating stadiums, parks, playgrounds and schools is arbitrary as well. When you remove something from the landscape, you have to start all over again – rebuilding from the ground up or creating something entirely new from the ground up. And so the cycle begins again. In the current financial crisis, there’s a real danger that the City could start to destroy itself.The key question is how to build safe</text>

But given the way in which the city is going, this seems like a recipe for disaster. The city is going to collapse unless a very big change is made, and so it’s easy to get very angry about things like the destruction of nature, but when things are that bad, it’s even easier to get very defensive about them. People need to be able to identify with the city’s suffering, and so the only way to stop the damage being done is for a much bigger number of people to be moved to live in the city (it’s only a matter of time).

The book is a kind of indictment of Japanese capitalism and urban planning, and its apparent inability to rebuild after the event, while also highlighting some of the attractions of the city. The gallery that hosted the exhibition I curated, The Empty Hearse, is a case in point. The gallery, which offered a range of cultural activities including a meeting space for artists, a meeting place for the city, a meeting place for residents, and even a meeting place for government officials, suddenly became a site for the display of various forms of government failure, incompetence and corruption. The gallery became a site for the display of various forms of Japanese imperial ideology and bureaucracy.Berger’s book is a kind of ‘snapshot’ of the city that was slowly dying. During the course of the book, he narrates the events of 11 September 2011, the morning after the attack, and into the following morning</text>

It is a snapshot of a much larger issue that remains unresolved: the fate of the photos of the devastation caused by that disaster. JP: I think that the book frames the present through the memory of the past, and the memory of the first responders and survivors. It captures the shock and grief felt by the Japanese people at the time, and by all those affected by it. JP: The interesting thing about the current situation in Gaza is that the resistance seems to be gaining strength. We don’t yet know what the future holds, but the resistance seems to be gaining strength. The suffering and the death of civilians is a constant, inexorable source of tension in the Gaza Strip.

The earthquake devastated much of Japan, and much of East Asia, but did not affect the main islands of Japan, populated by a combined population of around 300 million people. Berger focuses on the fates of 1.6 million people killed in the disaster, which he speculates were chosen because they were ‘the lucky ones’: they were born after the earthquake and tsunami, or later, because they live on the same island as the epicentre. The remaining 680,000 people live on an island outside Tokyo. He imagines the devastation in East Asia, Africa and Europe, and the refuge of islands in the ocean. East Asia and Africa are given huge carte blanche to develop with relative impunity, while the Pacific is left to fend for itself. Berger focuses particularly on the Tibetan Autonomous Region, where the Japanese government actively promoted the idea that the region is a viable space for a future pre-industrial economy.

The book is an absorbing read, shedding light on a subject that seems to be persisting in the wake of technology’s seemingly inexorable advance. But what is fascinating about the book is the way in which it questions the technologies that enabled the metropolis to grow in the first place. To do so, the author uses the term ‘global’ to describe the new ‘world’ that is emerging on an unimaginable scale. Globalisation as we know it is superseded by an emerging world system in which the metropolis is reduced to a fragmented collection of disconnected places and activities that are increasingly indistinguishable from one another. This is, of course, a world that Apple would not want us to inhabit.Globalisation as we know it is replaced by a world system in which the metropolis is reduced to a fragmented collection of disconnected places and activities.

As the subtitle of the book suggests, the book is a ‘forensic portrait’ of the disaster that takes place every time a major earthquake or volcanic eruption occurs in the world. The book is a ‘snapshot’ of what Berger describes as ‘a swarm of catastrophic[1] – a phenomenon that can no longer be ignored’ – events that occur every day in the world’s cities and suburbs. These events are so frequent and are so global in scope that they are sometimes referred to as ‘the Anthropocene’. What makes this collection of portraits unique is the way in which they are framed and presented. They are not just snapshots of the world as it is; this world, including its inhabitants, is a complex web of interrelated phenomena, interwoven causes and effects. This world is multiverse, and its inhabitants ‘are among the most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change’.</text>

The earthquake devastated much of Japan, and opened vast swaths of land for development, but the tsunami also laid waste to much of the country, leaving behind vast amounts of rubble and creating an area the likes of which has never been rebuilt. The book’s subtitle, a declaration of war, is a throwaway line. But its declaration of war, and the way in which the book is written – in large part, as a declaration of love – – – makes the whole thing seem inevitable. The events that precipitated the book’s publication are told through the voice of several hundred,000 earthquake survivors and their descendants. The voices of one million other people are left out of the story.The earthquake and tsunami gave birth to a new regionalism that had to be reckoned with.

The exhibition had been in the works for some time, with the Japanese government determined to demolish it altogether. In an act of desperation, the US turned down an invitation to join a curatorial cabinet that wanted to preserve the building as a monument to nuclear destruction. The US pavilion was to be housed in a giant new art gallery in the basement of the old Nakasone Cultural Centre, where the new exhibition space would be set. The pavilion would become a temporary stand-in for the building, until a new site could be found for it. The book traces the government’s decision-making process, from the early stages of disaster relief in Japan to the eruption of a national nuclear crisis in 2011.

The cultural and economic changes wrought by this event are likewise depicted in the book, but the historical ones are given extra weight by the inclusion of inspiring archival photos and images from the port of Kobe, taken in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. The photos sit alongside text that narrates the social and ecological conditions that were then present in the port at the time. Some of those photos are still extant, and photographic stills continue to be taken in the immediate aftermath of almost every major oil disaster worldwide.

He answers that question in the negative, focusing specifically on the ways in which disaster can be used as a political tool.Berger focuses on two key moments in the book: the eruption of popular anger at the government for not doing enough to protect its citizens from the dangers posed by climate change, and the eruption of nationalism in East Asia at a moment when many nations were becoming more self-sufficient in terms of raw materials and manufactured goods.

This meant that it was possible to create a new media landscape through the same technologies that were being used to monitor and control it. New media was created alongside old media, which is to say, it was easier to consume media via the new media landscape created via the interface. 	[11] As programming became more and more sophisticated, so too did the possibilities. For instance, in the 1980s and 1990s, programming languages like BASIC and Pascal––programming in its abstract, but also granting very specific, but often useful, operations––became widely used in industry, primarily to automate tasks associated with repetitive data entry.

[10] This is a slightly different form of the interface today. The interface is a ‘metainterface’ – a computer interface that is no longer a physical part of the computer but rather relies on software to provide the media and protocols for its virtualisation. This new interface face is no longer based on physical and digital technology but relies on algorithms and data capture to provide the media and protocols for its virtualisation.

The use of smart phones and tablets by professionals has already thrust open completely new worlds of interaction and interaction styles.

This is evident in the way in which the interface is positioned in the interface shop: the way in which it identifies the user and the purpose of the interface, and the way in which it is repurposed through new technology. The interface is a media product, and as such, it is constantly (re)present in the media landscape (video, radio, texts, maps, maps, maps) in relation to the user’s devices. For example, the interface can be used to identify the vehicle in use, and can identify the user’s location at a junction.

This was seen as essential for the success of the new media paradigm, which was judged by its ability to engender creativity and innovation. The interface becomes what Simon Callas describes as ‘a public stage on which many a thought has been expressed, on which much has been said and done, but little done or none at all’.  	[11] Callas</text>

In  	Modern Painters (1989), Norman Wilkinson draws our aesthetic minds to the fact that ‘the computer is not a divine source of beauty’, but rather an art tool capable of producing ‘art that is both machine and machine learning canation’. This is especially true when employed in conjunction with visual media, as computer programs do. Even so, Wilkinson’s work is emphatically not an aesthetic indictment of the intrinsic beauty of the interface, since at the end of the day, computer programming is all about problem-solving and the production of new algorithms that can be used to enhance the user’s experience.

It is open to visitors from all over the world, and is the main exhibition venue for the Goa Valley Digital Art conference – an international trade fair for digital art that is simultaneously a regional art fair and a global digital art fair. 	[9] Digital Art, or the Application of Art Information Resources to the Digital World, was one of the earliest, and most successful, applications of the new technology of the computer interface. It ushered in a new age of interface-free digital paintings, sounds, images and more. This was done through innovative programming languages and protocols that permitted the creation of new artworks and media through the manipulation of data. Such media could be assembled in real-time via the ‘chip’ – a small computer chip that provided critical information to the interface-using computer. More importantly, it ushered in a new era of interface-free digital media: media that could be shared and manipulated across a global interface. 	[10] As early as the 1980s, artists, curators and art collectors began to recognise the link between interface and interface-free art. As Margaret Thatcher famously declared, ‘You've seen the Interface?’, and in her infamous question, ‘What is the Interface?’, Margaret Hodge, one of the inventors of the computer interface, asked, ‘What is the Computer?’. She had in mind a time when the computer would not only interface with the art and visual arts, but would also equip artists and curators with sophisticated programming skills to create and interpret new artworks according to the activists’ ideals and purposes.  	[11] The Hodge report is short and sweet, in fact, barely a summary of the concerns of the art market at that time. It is a call to arms, an urgent plea to action. It</text>

What kind of ecological and urban legacy is this? Is this the biennale as a form of art project in reverse? If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its city, and start building something new. But in the current financial crisis, this would mean giving back to its cultural capital. The biennale has a tendency to repeat itself, and this is clearly evident in the biennale’s current three-year cycle. The biennale needs to be able to respond to the changes that it is asked to create, and to change itself.If we take the 2012 Venice Biennale as an example, then the biennale as an event is no longer the exclusive domain of the mega-exhibitionary museum. Biennales now operate under new forms of curatorial ambition and staging, and are frequently platforms for new artistic ventures and ‘transformative initiatives’ that aim to change the world of exhibitionary form. The hope is that the new curatorial practices will instigate a self-sustaining biennalealism that seeks to meet the needs and interests of the local, the international and, eventually, of</text>

What kind of ecological and urban legacy is this? Is this the biennale as a form of art project in reverse? If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its chosen city. Curatorial reversals are rare, and often ill-advised, but they are also dynamic and contingent, and in this case the biennale needed to change course and start afresh. This seems somewhat at odds with the current strategy of the biennale as a form, and it is at odds with the curatorial reversal that the Biennale has gone on to establish itself so adeptly. But in the current biennale curatorial reversal, which is building towards a new curatorial one, it is also building into something new. It is becoming more and more like every other curatorial turn, with new curatorial goals in mind. And this is happening even though the city is experiencing an economic bonanza–the biennale will probably become an even more powerful cultural institution if its financial backer, the financial district, defaults on its debts.The new turn in the biennale's development curve is also occurring despite the obvious financial need for the museums to</text>

What kind of ecological and urban legacy is this? Is this the biennale as a form of art project in reverse? If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its symbolic capitalise organising form, and return to its historically researched, archival and archival-looking forms. The biennale as an art project in reverse would then be an art that is not inherently political or populist, but exploits its historical or archival interest in the city as a site of economic production and social conversion. This is the original pan-European pan-lateral trendsetter, which we would call ‘cultural tourism’.’[1]In other words, the cultural tourism form that the biennale has traditionally taken is political and cultural, but it is also a form of resistance, which is in turn a form of socialisation. ‘Cultural tourism’ is not just about the destination city, but also about the associated set of relationships between the destination city and its tourism industry. Thus, the biennale becomes both a capitalise and a drain on tourism dollars, both in the city where the art is located and internationally where it</text>

If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its chosen place of exhibition. The LA Biennale seems to have missed this opportunity to create a curatorial framework that would allow it to engage with its money as a cultural form, and thereby to change its place of exhibition. The biennale as an art form became more prominent and its exhibitionary character became more fugitive. Its art was either put on display or destroyed. Curators in many other cities were encouraged to follow the LA Biennale’s example and follow its destruction of the historic buildings around it. Even New York’s own Biennale, which had been staging regular, if disused, exhibitions throughout the nineteenth century, started doing this in the early twentieth century. The American art biennale became vitally important in this transformation, and its emergence was often cited as a key factor in the contemporaneity of modern and contemporary art. The biennale is the international exhibitionary equivalent of the contemporary art museum, and its emergence on a global scale coincided</text>

What kind of ecological and urban legacy is this? Is this the biennale as a form of art project in reverse? If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its cultural district, and turn instead to the city’s coffers – a situation rarely envisaged by the Biennale management. If, on the other hand, the biennale is a ‘form’ of art in its own right, then its reverse could mean that the biennale turns its cultural resources into art projects. I ask because, increasingly, the curatorial and art-historical intent of the Biennale is to some extent diverted from its economic and urban outcomes. It is the reverse of the biennale as a curatorial form: the biennale becomes the curator’s museum, and the museum turns into an art gallery. I believe that the biennale is becoming a form of art project in reverse. It is becoming a form that is not merely interested in its own intrinsic value, but seeks to produce social change through the direct action of art institutions. This may involve, for example, the curatorial action of a biennale</text>

What kind of ecological and urban legacy is this? Is this the biennale as a form of art project in reverse? If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its geographical neighbourhood – in other words, it needed to invest in the cultural district of South Central Los Angeles, but also in the cultural district of Mid-Wilshire, which is itself a cultural district – and in turn in other cultural districts all over the city. But this is not just a form of reverse; it is a socio-political reversal within the context of capitalist urbanisation. And this is precisely what the Biennale did not do. It did not invest in its geographical territory, but rather in the cultural side of the city, in the surrounding countryside, in a general sense, but especially in the countryside around Los Angeles. This is what we would call a ‘cultural imperialism’. The key to this form of cultural colonialism was obvious from the start: the management of the cultural resources of the city needed to be done through a collective agreement between the city and the Biennale.

If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its cultural district – in order to pay for the construction of a new cultural district. Curatorial reversals are rare, and the only ones that have been successfully made in the modern curatorial style are those made by artists who have a clear artistic agenda and have the resources to push it through. But the LA Biennale is different from those made by artists who have a clear artistic agenda and have the resources to push it through. The primary reason why the Biennale is able to fund itself is due to the incredible amount of cultural tourism it generates in its hometown. The Biennale is able to create a buzz through its official publication of ‘The Art Newspaper’ in its tabloid format, generating lots of publicity and lots of money for the city. The Biennale is able to do this through a mix of official recognition and institutional pockets being told how to do things.

What kind of ecological and urban legacy is this? Is this the biennale as a form of art project in reverse? If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its city – in the form of empty storefronts and empty streets – and instead of relying on the city as a source of capital, it would need to produce social and ecological change through direct action. Is this possible? If so, then the biennale must become more than an exhibitionary platform: it would need to actively engage with its social and political context. But what kind of cultural infrastructure is this? If the biennale is to become more than an exhibitionary platform, it would also need to actively engage with its social and political context. If not, then the cultural institutions involved would remain trapped in their present form, unable to respond to the new circumstances that would render the city self-sufficient. The LA Biennale has made clear that it expects the city to play a major role in its development – a role that would extend beyond the site it is hosting.

What kind of ecological and urban legacy is this? Is this the biennale as a form of art project in reverse? If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its city, and thereby itself reverse certain of its economic trends. But as biennales we have other priorities – we’re more interested in the symbolic landmarks of cultural capital in our cities than in the actual capital of those cities. And so the biennale’s repeated investment in its city only serves to cement those cities as less than cultural capitals, and hence more susceptible to the vagaries of capital accumulation. This is a classic &quot;capital-plus&quot; effect; the more cultural capital builds itself up, the more vulnerable we all are to the vagaries of dearth and desirability that can emerge from the unpredictable forces of dearth and desirability. The LA Biennale was no exception to this rule. Its investment in its city meant that it was capable of supporting a substantial number of artists’ residency possibilities – but also the creation of a cluster of artist-run co-operatives – but it did not so much as hint at the possibility that these developments</text>

If so, this would mean that the biennale needed to reverse its investment in its cultural district, and return to the city in order to generate any kind of cultural impact. This is not in doubt. In my view, the biennale is a form of art project in reverse, despite its obvious capitalist value. The biennale is a potentially game-changing art form that can generate cultural change through its own power, and through the adoption of local and regional identities, economic horizons and political landscapes. But in the age of Trump, and in the face of seemingly inevitable ecological destruction, this seems unlikely. The biennale is being actively promoted by a president who routinely praises its performance across his various forms of media, and who regularly tweets about its physical form. The biennale is now routinely depicted as a form of art that is actually a kind of art form, or at least as a form that should be mimicked in art. This is a difficult sell for a president who has repeatedly asserted that his administration will &quot;evolve&quot; – that is, that</text>

For example, it may well understand kinship – the kind of understanding that underpins how humans form bonds and constructs narratives – and bond with other creatures through shared biology. It may well understand moral values and draw moral conclusions. All of these things are possible with some level of AI, and yet we don’t know how to implement them. Machine learning could help here, enabling machines to reason more constructively and ethically.This raises another question: how will the AI understand moral judgments?

This will make it capable of operating more like a conscious agent, with enhanced knowledge and capabilities. This scenario mirrors the way in which fascism is set to work in the coming years. It is set to a large extent on the technology available to it at the time, and on the fact that these technologies are increasingly applied to all aspects of life. Fascism is set to a large extent on data, and on the algorithms that enable the machines to connect to the data and make inferences about the world.Artificial intelligence will likely rival the capabilities of the human intellect, and will understand more than human intelligence.

The kinds of infrastructure that can be imagined for the future city are likely to be augmented by new technological systems that collect vast amounts of data, feed them into infrastructures and eventually outsource their decisions to machine learning and deep learning apparatuses.This scenario is not so far-fetched after all. As AI improves, so will the possibilities. In the coming years, researchers and engineers will likely find ways to design machines to do more than analyse data and gather statistics.

On the contrary, in the foreseeable future, machines will mostly just run things. But the ways in which we will have to adapt to the changes wrought by AI are set to produce profound social changes. We will need new ways of organising ourselves, because the machines will be so busy replicating themselves that social forms that used to be organised around kinship groups will be displaced in favour of multitudes of autonomous units.

It promises greater productivity, greater wellbeing, in large part because of the reduction in workforce. And yet, there are concerns about what kinds of moral hazard this could create. Will machines learn to do things in ways that humans cannot, or will they revert to the primitive – inhuman – ways in which they were before? There are also questions about the limits of what AI can accomplish, and whether or not such capabilities would be abused.Artificial intelligence will almost certainly lead to new kinds of inhumanity, and it is very likely that some of these aspects will be morally questionable.

This will mean that not only will the machines be able to do more, but also that humans will have to become less reliant on the machines and more reliant on the data that flows through them. This is the context in which research projects such as the DeepMind/Google Brain project and the many projects funded by the British Council are set to unfold. Artificial intelligence may well replace humans as the dominant form of computation, and it may well become a predominant mode of artistic and social expression. But it will do so in fundamentally different ways.  The ways in which we produce, consume, and produce knowledge will continue to be influenced by the ways in which we are connected. New technologies will empower us to produce knowledge at incredible rates, but they will also strip us of what makes us human – stripping us of our agency, leaving us to machines. In this regard, there are good and there are bad sides to this equation.  The good news is that there are also really smart and really awesome ways</text>

This is why art figures such as Andy Warhol and Mark Leckey have been drawn to the burgeoning of artificial intelligence research and technology. They see a way to art and art’s ever-greater potential in this new world.Artificial intelligence will likely become more sophisticated and sophisticated, gathering ever greater amounts of data, and eventually learning to fabricate elaborate fictional narratives to fit the data. This is why Hollywood movies with AI protagonists see a need to constantly tweak their systems to ensure that they are not too idealistic or abstract, and to ensure that they do not end up in dystopian situations. It is also why, in science fiction, machines are often given human characteristics – being able to reason through complicated phenomena – which makes them useful in certain situations and forces them to make better decisions. For example, machines are far more likely to converge on a problem because they understand that their human creators work tirelessly to aim them in the right direction.This all-encompassing, global perspective</text>

This will make it capable of operating much more like biological systems, able to collect data and make inferences about the world through it. This will make it capable of understanding more, and making inferences about the world through it. This is the dystopian future envisioned by some technologists, and it is happening already.In an ideal world, every situation would be like this. People would speak the language of the machine, its expressions being written down and stored in massive databases. In this scenario, there would be no borders, just vast expanse of space where data could be gathered and used. There would be no need for humans – AI would do the borders, mapping and location work, gathering and analysing data on everyone in real time. But this is not realistic in the real world, and much of what AI will do will be done by humans. So the utopic future will have to come up with new ways to feed itself, considering the shifting of resources and the needs of the population</text>

It is a double-edged sword. Its mission statement cannot be divorced from the specific curatorial processes and agendas that it engages; nor does its control depend on the availability of resources. Its resources come and go, as often as art is needed to sustain them. The ‘mission statement’ that we put into the event itself comes from the first moment before the event. It specifies what is meant by ‘the mission’ and what is meant by ‘the museum’. It is a projection of who we are as individuals and as a species, and so it needs to be negotiated. But its mission statement also needs to be negotiated, for it to be able to sustain its resources and capacities as an organisation, as a form of art form, and as a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. And so the gathering that we have come to is a condition of the negotiation of the festival’s mission statement. It is ambiguous what the festival might or might not</text>

It is a double-edged sword, to be sure.On the one hand, the biennial has a lot of power; it is globally visible, demonstrative and demonstrative in character. It is, in this sense, an ever-present and crucial form of the exhibitionary form in contemporary urbanisation; it is a form that is almost unbearably humanising and empathetic but is also profoundly flawed. On the other hand, the biennial has a kind of circumlocutionality that makes it particularly vulnerable to changes in its form, and particularly vulnerable to the things that make it different from other forms, in the sense that it is able to offer a range of possible futures to people drawn from a particular set of beliefs and values. In other words, the biennial can ‘provide a sense of change’ by setting itself up as a kind of laboratory or utopia for experimental, quasi-experimental or quasi-critical thinking. And this kind of thought is of value</text>

It is a double-edged instrument indeed: it can deliver huge sums of money to museums and art institutions, but it also has a huge impact on the very fabric of contemporary art’s social life, making it possible for these institutions to be left behind in a muddled mess of dependency. This is what happened with the massive cultural mobilisations of the 1990s, which were followed by a subsequent period of self-congratulation and self-congratulation about how much the culture industry had empowered us. At the time, this was seen as a great thing, a way to free our imaginations from the bureaucratic mists of industry. But the sheer volume of information produced each year – the shopping lists, the ad hoc curatorial fads – means that the social life of art today is affected by the events that are now seen as socially useful.

It is a form of cultural signification, and signification in its own right.But what if we start questioning what we mean when we talk about ‘the art world’? What if we start questioning what we mean when we talk about art? If we start to look around and think, as a general principle, about what we mean when we name things, and what we don’t mean when we don’t name things, then we can start to create processes that can be different from what are typically undertaken at art institutions. For example, if we started by saying that we wanted to create a community of artists that were engaged with a particular set of curatorial practices and invited them to do that, and then invited them to do it in a very different way, and then invited them to do it in that way for a specific set of reasons, and then invited them to do it in that way for a very long period of time, and then invited them to do it for</text>

It is a double-edged sword.On the one hand, it is a very powerful tool, able to produce a great deal of clarity, but on the other, it has a great deal of ambiguity around what is and is not allowed to be seen. In the biennial, the ambiguity is what MFA students call ‘the greenhorn effect’: students often feel as though they are being excluded from the story, and are therefore less likely to invest in the actual work being presented. This is one reason why biennials are so popular in their first years, when students first come to view them as a rare exception to the rule, and a way to begin to change the rule. Students also tend to have an opening salvo: they are already committed to the exhibitionary form, and have already formed their own opinions about what is or is not allowed to be seen. During this initial first year, students are often very impressionable; they see the art in the form of objects,</text>

It is a double-edged instrument indeed. In the broadest sense, it is both a writer and a control device. But in a very different sense, it is capable of producing its own destruction. 	When biennials first started, their mission statement looked something like this: ‘To archive and provide access to historical materials and photographic negatives through which narratives and images can be memorialised in permanent ways.’2 In other words, they claimed a distinctive place in the museum as a final archive, or, to be even more precise, a last but significant outpost of the memory of the past. But this doesn’t map well to the needs of the contemporary biennial. 	Today, the mission statement of the Biennial Council, as a representative body of curators, artists and arts administrators worldwide, is a lot more nuanced. The new generation of biennials are developing their own mission statements, which are much more explicitly political. The Council’s artists council has</text>

They do not yet know how to use these possibilities constructively. They need to be taught, developed and managed.‘Inhabitant Curator, The New Ground, 1990.

It is a double-edged weapon, and in the modern era it is being increasingly used by biennials to project their own unique visions and values. These are the voyages of art per se, happening somewhere else, at some point in the future, and sometimes in collaboration with other art institutions and platforms. They are artistic in their own way, but also profoundly political, and this is one of their great strengths. In the decades that the biennial has been a regular fixture in the world art market, it has also become a significant art institution in its own right. It has become a big business, and it has globalised. It is art, but it is also a corporate centre, and the world it produces is art’s intermediate form, between the artist and the spectator. Here, we can see how the biennial is being inserted into the broader cultural logic of the city, and how art is being deployed across cultures in ever greater numbers and in ever greater amounts.2.

It is a double-edged instrument indeed, used by both the powerful and the powerless. So it is vital that biennials produce a continual flux of new forms of their kind, from the manifest to the invisible, from the visible to the intangible. In this respect, they need to be distinctive, imaginative and controllable. And they need to be able to produce a certain amount of innovation and newness in their portfolios each year, in order to maintain their market power and ensure that they stand out from the crowd. The miracle of modern art, then, is in part a by-product of this kind of programming. The challenge is to be seen through this specific programme of biennials, and to have a go at it too, creating and rewriting of your own. biennial as a curatorial gestureThe biennial as a curatorial gesture began to gain currency in the 1980s, when artists began to associate the term with extravagant and extravagant displays of art, especially in museums.

It is a double-edged sword. It is a statement of fact, but also a fiction that can and will be disproved. As events like the Venice Biennale unfold, the question is what can art do to resist becoming art’s own disproved statement? In an ideal world, the art form might declare war on its own contradictions. But at the same time, it might also assist in creating a new ideology around art that supports its own destruction.The Venice Biennale is a strange hybrid. It has the trappings of a museum, but with a spatial bent. It has the trappings of a big art fair, but has a social purpose as well. It has the trappings of a major international exposition, but has a local ‘mission’ to carry out locally. It has the trappings of a major art institution, but has a civic purpose that comes second to everything else. And finally, it has the trappings of a regular art exhibition, but is</text>

The second objective was to endow an arts education programme for the entire city, with particular emphasis on the needs of the under-resourced and embattled community art sector. This was done through a partnership with the newly formed Northwest Art Foundation. These organisations were encouraged to form a community organisation with a national scope and to begin producing works in the new art education programme. 	The third objective described in the document is still unmet, although it is hoped to one day be fulfilled: 	There are currently no plans to endow an arts education programme for the entire city. However, there are many organisations with arts education programmes who could one day one day partner with the city’s existing community arts organisations in an educational capacity.

The second objective was to endow an arts education component in the city through a $5 million partnership agreement with the Community Arts Centre. This seemed an obvious step for the museum to take at the time, since the school was considered the natural home for the arts education programme. But the decision to invest in an arts education programme itself seemed particularly questionable, since the city was experiencing a teaching and support deficit. The museum board was divided on this issue, and in the end, Mayor Kwame Lasek opted for a city-wide, multi-agency arts education initiative that would have involved the expertise of a federally-recognised local arts organisation, the Portland Art Institute, alongside other local arts organisations. These would have provided support to a geographically spread-out artistic community in the form of performance, exhibition, workshops and events.

The second objective in the project was to endow the Biennale with permanent institutional resources. This was achieved through a combination of grants from the Melvindale Prize and the BC Arts Prize and the authority of the City Council. The Biennale was given institutional power not only through its curatorial style, which incorporated multimedia, in-gallery displays, stencil and fiber installations, as well as sound and light installations, as well as readings by artists, as well as a policy of co-authorship with the City Council. 	Its third objective, development, addressed the question, how to spend the Biennale money responsibly. This was addressed by the Biennale in turn by way of a financial accountability formula, based on a proportion of the gross proceeds, or rent, for the purpose of financing the Biennale. These contributions were then divided equally among the various community based organisations operating the Biennale, with an allocation made to local communities. 	As well as contributing</text>

It would also set a new standard for community based art in Port Townsend, not least because it would be exhibited in a community setting: in the hope that this would encourage other artists to consider living and working in the community. 	Aims and priorities 	The primary aim of  	Achtung! (Enough is Enough! Project) was to create a cultural revolution in the city through the power of art and activism. Assembled by artists, musicians, activists and community organisers, the project was a hybrid one-industry-one-platform. It was a catalyst for the formation of a diverse range of community based organisations, arts organisations and educational institutions, as well as contributing to the creation of a new type of arts education and activism education in the city. 	The second objective pursued by the project was the establishment of a publicly funded, locally run, artist-run cooperative arts academy with the mission to promote artistic practice through education and training in a regional art centre. This would have involved both studio and gallery space in the city, with gallery programmes including a residency and a full-time programme of study for aspiring artists. 	A third objective pursued by the  	Achtung! (Enough is Enough!) Project was to establish a community art centre with the support of the Art Council of Canada and the City of Seattle. 	The fourth objective pursued by the Art Council of Canada and the City of Seattle was to establish a mutual aid society (MOAS) so that the interests of the community could be represented in the organisation’s decision-making. As part of the MOU, the Art Council of Canada and the City of Seattle established a mutual aid society,  	Achtung! (Enough is Enough!), which has since</text>

It was a catalyst for the formation of a diverse range of community based organisations, arts organisations and educational institutions, as well as contributing to the creation of a new type of arts education and activism education in the city. 	The second objective was to endow a community-based art institution with world-class teaching and learning capabilities. For this, the institution was required to have a research and design component, as well as a production component devoted to the launch and promotion of the art exhibition. 	The third objective was to establish a Community Arts training academy dedicated to the development of culturally responsive artists’ skills. 	The academy would be run by a board of trustees elected by the members of the community and would supervise the transfer of funds between the museum and the school. The members of the board would include artists, educators, musicians, social organisers and others with relevant expertise. 	All three objectives could be considered in a reductionist way. The academy could be seen as a cash cow, while the school as an art institution on a par with other arts institutions. However, the academy and the art institution would both need to work harder to produce high-quality outputs that can be put into exhibitions and that</text>

The second objective of the project was to endow the establishment of a free and independent ‘Southwark Museum of Contemporary Art’ – a museum that would counter the commercialisation of art and promote the localisation of culture and the production of local wealth – a project that would also counter the commercialisation of architecture, and the related production of social inequality and poverty. The museum would showcase contemporary art from Southwark and act as a catalyst for renewed interest in the forgotten corners of the borough. It would also set a new standard for how art collections are managed in a borough, and for community-based art in that borough. Finally, the museum would function as a catalyst for the production of culturally responsive local artworks through the collaborative, open and transparent sharing of resources and knowledge.  	While the primary objective of the museum was to celebrate contemporary art from the borough, its collaborative programme of programming, educational activities and production of culture-conscious resources opened new perspectives and opened new ways of perceiving</text>

The second objective was to destress the image of residential neighbourhoods. The project was multifaceted and involved a number of other creative activities, including the commissioning of a community-designed Arts and Community Centre, the installation of a public sculpture project by Nuyumbalees artist group, the promotion of the work of local non-profit arts organisations, and the production of a community-based news and information website. The third objective was to destress the image of the Port of Seattle. 	The project was also a catalyst for the creation of a community-based Black Education and Action (BE) project that would later be renamed the Center for Working Class Attitudes (2013-16). In the intervening years, the Port of Seattle transformed itself from a decaying port into a modern urban centre around Nike’s headquarters and other corporate interests. It became an international symbol for the excesses of neoliberalism and its discontents, while simultaneously supporting a public arts programme that provided opportunities for tourism and</text>

It was a catalyst for the formation of a diverse range of community based organisations, arts organisations and educational institutions, as well as contributing to the creation of a new type of arts education and activism education in the city. 	The second objective was to create a 'New Economy of Art and Culture’.[2] The development of sustainable, affordable and culturally responsive ways to produce, use, display, engage and learn from artworks was a top priority. The primary contribution to this was made possible by the support of foundations, corporate partners and individuals. 	Achtung! also relied upon the potential of becoming a multi-use facility, as a teaching and research platform, as well as the commercialisation of its artworks. Utilising its membership of the local art gallery and the local community art gallery, as well as art fair experience, as a tool to promote environmentally responsible practices, the facility could be used as a production and storage space for artworks and community produced architecture. 	The third objective was to create a hub of interaction between arts organisation, local community, art gallery, local government, grassroots organisers and academia. The extension of Achtung! into the city was a turning point in the</text>

The second objective was to end apartheid in the city. In 1987, the Black Nationalist Football League (B.League) was formed in Port Townsend and elected to operate at the local and national levels in the city. The aim of the League was to establish a football team in the city, to play away from home and away from institutional football grounds in the city. The development of a strong, locally run business entity was a priority, as was a commitment to environmental and community issues. The development of a Community Land Trust was also a concern, since the development of high-density housing and the building of community parks and playgrounds was part of the plan to create a football team. The aim of this business plan was to commercialise the city and create jobs and opportunities for local citizens. The development of green space was a concern, since the development of high-density housing and the building of community parks and playgrounds was part of the plan to create a football team.
