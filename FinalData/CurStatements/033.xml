Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function in time as cultural institutions. They are cultural in their own right, and so, too, are they cultural in the sense that they preserve cultural characteristics and histories. This latter sense of cultural men (and women) is a global one, and it is particularly relevant in the age of the biennial or, perhaps, the multiple. 	And perhaps this global sense of cultural men and women is what our age needs, today more than ever. We are witness to the contemporaneity of a multitude of different biennials, each with a distinctive character, a distinctive style, a distinctive form, and a distinctive purpose. It would be a mistake to see biennials as monoliths, nor as contemporary art forms confined to a city. There are other socio-political, economic and cultural factors at work in our age, and biennials play a pivotal role in providing us with a snapshot of these other factors. And yet we are also witness to the contemporaneity of a</text>

Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function as cultural hubs within their local communities. They are not just ‘curated’ exhibitions of contemporary art, but also collections of archival art that document the past, present and future of an art form. In this sense, they are cultural touchstones, and thus worthy of the name ‘biennial’. 	[1] See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_collection_of_M.I.A.

Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function as instances of temporal repetition; they are cultural institutions in their own right but in a cultural moment. 	It would be a mistake to constrain the biennial to specific sites or cultural moments because these days it is easier to draw a macrocosm of contemporary art’s encounter with life in cities than it is to consider the complexity of the historical and contemporary situation of art and culture in a particular city. Therefore, biennials can and should reside in and engage with their times. 	However, this does not mean that biennials must identify with any particular art school, especially if this engagement is desired to a large extent by artists and curators who seek to project their particular art style onto the global art market. It is true that the biennial market today is dominated by American art schools, and it is also true that artists who reside in these schools are more likely to be US citizens than artists who originate elsewhere. It is true that the biennial market today is</text>

Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function as repositories for cultural transmission and cultural history. Art biennials have a unique place in this analysis because they are uniquely placed in the canon of art biennials: in the canon of art historical, contemporary, and archival biennials, other art forms, including museum collections, have one or more defining years, when a specific body of art is judged by a specific body of art. 	Art biennials typically contain a set of criteria that specify what is or is not considered art within the cultural frame of the biennale. These criteria are typically developed by and for the art biennial, but can also be developed by and for other art forms and localities. 	Art biennials are the result of a common factor: a need. The major biennials of the twentieth century contained criteria that artists could apply to determine if a given art form was worthy of being repeated, and often times more importantly, repeated in a larger number of other art forms.</text>

Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function as the biennials of a particular form or culture, and because they document the contemporaneity or contemporaneity through which that form or culture operates today. 	Such biennials offer a snapshot of a particular moment in the history of art, and often a snapshot of a particular culture. They record, or narrate indirectly, the action of artists, collectors, critics and others whose work is incorporated into the architecture of a city. Artists, collectors, critics and others regularly participate in the construction of cultural landscapes, and the production of narratives around art, culture, cities. Biennials, on the other hand, are cultural institutions in their own right, and are often required by art collectors, critics and others with a cultural interest in documenting the past to do so. In this sense, they are cultural historians and contemporary art form’s social historians. They record and narrate the past in order to make sense of the present, but more importantly, in the service</text>

Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function as ‘living monuments’ of a given cultural moment or idea. They are cultural institutions in their own right, and cultural localities in their own right. This is why biennials have particular resonance in the cultural zone, where the art biennials of the city were largely abandoned during the 1990s and continue to be underfunded and underrepresented. It is also why biennials have particular resonance in the urban, ‘dead zone’ of the city, since they are the last refuge of the ‘good’ art biennials. 	In addition, biennials have particular resonance in the cultural zone, since they constituted the bulk of the art market in the 1990s, and continue to constitute the bulk of the art market today, mainly owing to their global positioning. As a result of this critical mass of art in the cultural zone, and their global circulation through the art biennale, art’s market share has remained constant at around</text>

Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function as cultural instances in which art can be found and art made; they also tend to be the locus of cultural exchange between nations and peoples, and are thus significant in their own right. Since they are cultural institutions in their own right, their collections, which now number more than four million pieces, constitute a significant part of the global art biennale collection. 	[1] The collection comes from the Malaysian National Museum, whose mandate is to conserve, protect and use natural and cultural resources. The Malaysian National Museum’s current management of the collection calls for the institution to conserve, protect and use it in perpetuity.

Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function both as locus standi for a particular region or sub-region, and also as cultural capitals of the world. They are the sites of a particular kind of cultural revolution.1 	Art biennials have often been interesting sites of art’s own history, especially in the contemporary or archival form because the biennial format tends to produce a kind of static record of art in the world. Art biennials tend to produce a kind of static record of art, although their exact historical origins remain a mystery. This is particularly the case in the United States, where the biennial appears to be operating in parallel to other forms of American cultural power, including the president’s inaugural parade. In both the biennial and the parade, the president makes a distinction between art and artifice. Art is actuated by a creative act, and the artist(s) who carry it out are then said to have artifices. But this kind of act is also deeply</text>

Such biennials, though transient in their own right, are also cultural institutions in their own right, because they function as the biennial equivalent of cultural centers in other cities or nations. They are culturally aware and urban institutions, and so they constantly engage with the societal impact of their local contexts, city life, art’s social functions and more. 	In this way, they are more like biennials than any other museumary form, and thus deserving of our cultural capital. 	[2] In fact, some might even say that biennials have become culturally specific and representational. Art’s contemporary condition in other words. The biennial is, for example, experiencing its own eventualizing, and so it is becoming ever more important to document and universalize this condition. However, the biennial itself is still relatively new, and so new ideas and practices are constantly emerging, including from artworlds and the arts themselves. So it is easy to confuse the art biennial with the art museum, but soon enough the biennial itself is no longer the major museum</text>

Given this dense data and data-intensive interface environment, it is no wonder that contemporary interface designs are often quite heavy on invisible lines or invisible columns or no visible borders. One could even propose that the heavy data-intensive interface today is actually a light media interface between data and society. However, this is not at all what the increasingly ubiquitous internet entails today. What we mean by the term ‘internet’ is that data streams now directly link to one another rather than using the old fashioned way of data linking to nodes in a global interface. In other words, the internet is today not just a datapoint but is a ‘translation point’ between media and society. 	[5] This notion of ‘translation point’ is a global one. The term is often used within the context of architecture, but it is also frequently used in the design world of large infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges. It is used here to refer to points of physical location where data from a variety of sensors can be fed</text>

Given this dense data and data-intensive interface environment, it is no surprise that interface criticism has become more prevalent in the past twenty years than it is today. One might even agree that the interface is a ‘metainterface’ – in the age of big data and interactive interfaces, the interface is a ‘metainterface’. Yet this is only an assumption. Just as important in the rise of the interface is the development of media and public reaction that supports it. Public perception of the interface today is everything but public – there is a heavy focus on the screen and its reduced role in the society. In the public sphere, the interface is seen as a ‘metainterface’, but in the private sphere the opposite is true. When the screen is absent, the interface is seen as a device that provides a small amount of functionality but little else. When the screen is present, the interface becomes both a screen and a platform that supports a user’s choices and behaviours. In other</text>

Given this dense data and data-intensive interface environment, it is no wonder that interface criticism is frequently applied to the smartphone rather than to its users. 	When looking to the future, the interface becomes an important part of our knowledge base. It provides us with information about the embedded computer systems that control the flow of information in and through our society. It records the interactions between nodes in the interface and generates implications and interpretations about the systems that enable the internet of things (to give an example to illustrate the point). More and more, we are entering a world where interface criticism does not just mean analyzing interfaces, but also analysing connected systems and their behavior. This is perhaps part of the reason for the surge in app categories, which aim to understand the connected world via connected services. More and more information is coming down the pipe from the screen onto a device, which is then plugged into an electrical grid or gas distribution grid or any number of other infrastructure nodes.

Given this dense data and data-intensive interface environment, it is no wonder that interface design in recent decades has focused on transparent elements, elements that can be manufactured to meet user requirements but also elements that can be engineered to be tamper-resistant and/or geo-targeted.[5]One could argue that the massive scale of technological innovation in the last decades of the nineteenth century makes it impossible to imagine a time when the interface was not constantly evolving and dynamic – constantly patching and rewriting itself. And this is true – there is no way to know for sure, because the interface today is almost entirely digital. But it is interesting to note that in the early decades of the twentieth century, the interface was primarily made by and for the technocrats, engineers, and corporate managers who had a clear interest in maximising the capacity of the networked interface – in the words of Gregory Ulmer, ‘the twentieth century was a golden age of networked networks’.[6] And this is perhaps to be expected.

Given this dense data and data-intensive interface environment, it is no wonder that interface explorations today often focus on aesthetics rather than implementation details such as usability or performance. Interface explorations today often show results quite apart from the media contents and the human interactions that place them in the media. For instance, the explosion of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook is no longer confined to the campus; much of the media content consumed is US-centric and heavily reliant on the sites ‘native advertising’ and social networking services. 	[5] And this is just the media interface. Media companies today have a responsibility to ensure that their products meet rigorous user needs. And although the web is an interface today, it is not at all like the web in the 1950s and 1960s. The media interface today is interactive and contextual – it may be interactive but it is not at all like the original web pages and images that underpinned the interface. User needs today are multilevel and multi-functional. If the media interface</text>

Today's interface is interconnected, but it is also conscious, and conscious interaction is the interface of the interface. Interface optimisation is a global quest.If we take the example of a single city, such as New York, then the quest for interface optimisation today is a global one: optimisation of the city is the responsibility of the city’s inhabitants, and it is this responsibility that the New York City Council has delegated to the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Mayor.

The data streams involved in the internet and smartphone apps today are far more extensive and extensive than those of the interface in the 1950s, making it much easier to understand what is happening on the other side of the connection. And given all of the embedded sensors and computing devices we use to access and manipulate data, the complexity and interconnectivity of the interface is also evident in many of the same places.

It is no exaggeration to suggest that the smartphone is a ‘metainterface’ – it is a node in a worldwide interface that includes data, audio, video, text, and more. In this technological context, the interface is no longer simply an interface between media and computer – it is an interface between nodes in a global interface that includes data, audio, video, text, and more. Given this dense data and data-intensive interface environment, it is no wonder that contemporary interface designs are also concerned with data capture and exchange, as well as with the maintenance of physical and virtual proximity. And while this is obviously a global interface today, it is also true that the interface in the interface era is no longer confined to the confines of the home or the home computer. The internet interface today is no longer constrained to the confines of China or the West, but extends to all places with which it connects. This raises the question: what kinds of new forms of interface design could conceivably emerge from the shifting of the technological endpoint towards the confines of the home and the home computer? 	One answer to this is to ask what kinds of new forms of interface design could be imagined in the absence of the inutile resolution of the home and the home computer? Another is to ask what kinds of new interface design could be imagined in the absence of the inutile resolution of the internet?] The inutile resolution to which Kurz</text>
    <text>extends the proposition to machines, but it also seeks to understand how the distinction between human and technological systems contributes to our understanding of the world. If, as Kurzweil proposes, the main technologies of the future will be based on self-repairing nodes of virtual proximity, then perhaps a future with its ‘metainterface’ could conceivably incorporate nodes of virtual proximity.

Given this dense data and data-intensive interface environment, the interface is no longer simply a node in a global interface that includes data, but may also contain nodes that store and process data, perform tasks, and provide services. 	[5] And this raises another critical question: what is the interface today? Many technological paradigms today design computers that are embedded deep within the interface itself, or that are deployed surreptitiously. Most people who use computers today have no idea how the interface is actually made – or how it differs from other media forms today. 	[6] This raises another fundamental question: what does it mean to be ‘infrastructuralized’ today? In the 21st century this refers to nodes in a global interface that include data, but it is more commonly understood as a form of infrastructure that supports the internet of things – things that can be plugged into a node and that can connect to other nodes in a global interface network?).

As far as I am aware, no one has ever attempted to collect a collective knowledge of the office from across the globe. So the community has taken the initiative and used this open source knowledge to change the office in unexpected ways. For example, the way in which HTML tables are laid out can cause inconsistencies in the document, which can lead to data corruption. But the way in which the office is laid out has also led to innovations in spreadsheet programs that allow for the efficient construction of complex diagrams. For more on this see my book Office Conflicts: Understanding Collaborative Document Production (Rowan Moore, Intrepid, 2015). The open source office has created a document that is not beholden to strict control mechanisms. This is a good thing, because strict mechanisms are prone to over-emulation and fragmentation, as has been the case with the introduction of new software. But this openness has its downsides too. For one thing, the open source office has allowed for the codification and formalisation of collaborative relationships</text>

As far as I am aware, no organisation has a cultural programme for migrant workers. Despite this diversity of interests, people gravitate towards a few core values, which define the scope of engagement of the organisation. For instance, the Open Office Manifesto promises:  [T]he Open Office believes that collaboration is the order of the day. Not collaboration in the abstract, but actual collaboration in the concrete.’[3] The Open Office culture then becomes evident in the programme of activities, which is characterised by a convergence of different forms of interaction: meetings, sessions, trips, trips to the art galleries and museums, play-play-dates, trips to the seaside yachts, beaches, mountains, golf courses, art galleries, farmers markets, film and video sessions, walks to the river, tour groups, group shows, and even cabana tours.

As far as I am aware, no one has taken the project on as an official project, although there is active discussion about this. I think that the uncertainty and diversity of the project have helped it to evolve into something that is authentic to the people who are part of it – something that is legible, digestible and can be shared between the groups. I think that if there was ever a place for artists to come to explore this aspect of the project they’d find a lot to think about.With the introduction of new software, new platforms and new servers, the number of downloads has also increased. The number of concurrent connections has also increased. This is an indication of the extent to which the hype surrounding the project is justified: if the hype is justified, the reality may differ. I remember the first time I downloaded OpenOffice. I was working as an artist and we were developing a new release of OpenOffice on a laptop. I got a call from the CEO of the company that was developing OpenOffice.</text>

Most of the office staff I have met are passionate about what they do, but I feel like there is a lack of understanding of the work that goes on behind the scenes. I wanted to check in with Kate and talk to her about OpenOffice, but I didn’t want to bring up the subject of OpenOffice in the office, because I don’t think she has heard of it. She was very clear in her response that she didn’t need to know what OpenOffice was, because she was already working with the team behind it, but she did want to know what OpenOffice was in order to be able to use it. I think this is the ambivalence of the office: it depends on who’s speaking. It’s not always clear what the intentions of the person who is working on it are, and it’</text>

As far as I am aware, there has never been a survey or a register of the identities of the people contributing to the OpenOffice project. Yet based on the questions and answers that have emerged over the years, the proposal that the community can take over the project is a proposal supported by the majority of the members. This is a first in a series of questions that will guide the OpenOffice development team through the next phase of the project, which is its ongoing development of its website and app.Stephanie Straine is the project manager for OpenOffice. She came to OpenOffice in 1999 and worked for several years on the Community Arts department before coming to the OpenOffice team in 2013. She worked on the OpenOffice project from the beginning and is responsible for its strategic direction, the development and implementation of knowledge management tools and the creation of a registry of contributors.

We simply don’t know enough about the communities involved or the reasons why they engage with our projects. Does the community know enough to enable the project to succeed? How can the community be empowered in return? What are the skills needed? These are the sorts of questions that fill in the gaps between individuals and organisations. As an organisation, we’re left with questions that can no longer be filled with figures, statistics, jargon or brand-new ideas. We need to find the right questions, then ask the right questions, and produce research that informs the discussions that need to take place. This research needs to be collaborative, respectful and transparent. It’s not enough for organisations to say ‘we’re doing this because we want to’; it’s critical that we create resources that inform the future work of the organisation but are also flexible</text>

As far as I am aware, no one has ever attempted to quantify the diversity of the UK online digital community. It is possible that the fluctuating identities of the UK digital community might have something to do with the fact that this is the case: given the ubiquity of mobile phones and the internet, the possibility of being identified with a specific online identity seems remote. Nevertheless, this notion is something that needs to be addressed, since it is fuelling the asymmetry that we call online identity.The availability of data has also played a part in the proliferation of online identity. The availability of data has made it easier to produce a profile of an individual, which in turn has made it easier to identify a community. But this is not all that is happening online. It is true that profiles are produced and maintained by those who use the site, but this process is interactive and contextual, and it is the users, not the practitioners of the site, who shape who is identified as a member of that community.

As far as I am aware, nobody has proposed the idea of the ‘Open Door’ to these diverse assemblages of individuals, let alone developed an open source project around it. There are many other open source projects that address specific issues, but the scope and focus of my book is focused on the open source model, which I believe offers the greatest potential for the future of a project like OpenOffice. There are many other open source options, but the focus is on the language and infrastructure that power the collaborative process that leads to the production of high-quality, accessible and flexible office suites. The models I have outlined here are representative of many that have been explored and found wanting in terms of their ability to support the diverse complexities of an ever-expanding community of users. It is true that many projects have taken the initiative and declared themselves ‘open source projects’, but this is rarely applied to large scale projects because it is seen as a threat at the moment.

As far as I am aware, no one has ever attempted to map or synthesise the OpenOffice.org user communities. The fact that the project was co-operative and collective-owned seems to have created different levels of authenticity for different people. The key to the project’s success seems to have been its ability to work across different people from different places, so that different people felt authentic within the same project. This openness then spread to the region, and eventually to other parts of the world. If OpenOffice.org is any indication, this is what happens when people come together to solve problems, rather than against each other: projects that are ultimately about dividing people rather than building shared values emerge. Some might even argue that this is what the open source movement is all about. But I do not buy this argument. The open source movement is all about the sharing of things, ideas and resources. It is about how resources are shared. And it is about who has those resources and what they can do with them.</text>

As far as I am aware, there has never been an Open Source Initiative in any of the countries where it was originally conceived or implemented. Today, if you search for ‘Open Office’ in a local bookshop or museum, you will find over 1,000 images of organisations featuring in the bookshop or museum catalogue. Many of the organisations featured in the bookshop or museum catalogue are incorporated into the organisations that are part of the Open Office project. There is no lack of references to the history of Open Office in the local press. For example, in the local Liverpool Echo, Jess Doyle quotes former Liverpool City Council leader Tony Webb in his account of the city’s revitalisation. Webb is blunt in his claim: ‘I said what I had to say in order to secure a place on the council – and I got on my bike and cycled to work every day, shouting it from the pulpit of the building until the whole building caved in’.[3]I have to agree with</text>

The standardised, commodified version of the biennale is a globalised, technocratic event that has become increasingly institutionalised in modern urban centres. The biennale, then, remains fundamentally a business event. It is the point where cultural tourism meets industry, where the cultural trappings of tourism meet the economic means of production. The standardised form of the biennale is a point where economic forms of production meet cultural trappings. But in the age of the biennale, cultural tourism is no longer the point of departure for production; rather, it’s where the two meet in the world at an international convention, where the various economic, political and urban actors are united by common goals and interests. The biennale, then, exhibits the politics of displacement in ever-more explicit and frequent forms, but it also threatens to reveal new forms of social organisation at an ever-larger</text>

This is primarily due to the value attached to their content, which draws in artists, curators, art collectors and other art influencers to the city, and makes it into a desirable investment destination. From a cultural tourism perspective, the biennale is an indispensable form of cultural exchange because it provides the foundations for a number of powerful cultural tools, including but not limited to: (1) cultural tourism; (2) cultural insularity; (3) cultural infrastructures; (4) cultural tourism loyalty; (5) cultural tourism emulation; (6) cultural shopping networks; (7) cultural advertising; (8) cultural in-store publics; (9) cultural festivals; (10) and (11) cultural packaging.

In recent decades, cultural tourism has become a luxury good enjoyed by only a privileged few at the elite club of cultural tourists, tourists chosen at random and destined for elite destinations. However, in many cities the biennale is a necessity, a ‘must-have’ tourist attraction and a fundamental component of economic development. In the case of an already threatened biennale, this may no longer be the case, with cultural tourism accounting for approximately 10% of the overall tourism market. Biennales are often cited as a solution to the growing problem of empty buildings and threatened sites of cultural significance in urban centres. However, in many cities the biennale is a preventative measure and a replacement for a post-monumental, ‘cultural village’ with dilapidated third-world status. As biennales become more dominant forms of cultural tourism, they may</text>

The biennale had its peak in the 1950s, though it continues to be influenced by it to this day. The biennale is a multi-day event, and the biennale itself is a multi-year event, so we can expect many different iterations to occur in different locations in the same city over the course of the tour. The key is that the biennale must be curatorial, educational and visionary in its design, and it must connect to the city in a way that the city can sustain. If the city can't, then the biennale isn’t going to be able to. The biennale must be both physically present in the city and transnational in its composition, so that it has a physical presence in the city and an impact in the city at the same time. Biennales are the most visible</text>

The new biennale, curated by Prof. Ximena Escovedo-Ruiz and Sarah Carter-Ingall, takes the form of a continuing research project, presenting the findings from the 2014 project as a book-length essay. The efforts of the artists, curators, writers and others involved in the project are published in the book, which serves as a vehicle to explore themes such as climate change, colonialism and exploitation. The project was started in Berlin and London, and continues in New York, Berlin, Paris and Istanbul. The book’s cover image was taken from the project’s website. There are also plans to publish a ‘travelogue’ in the coming months.

The biennale is the predominant form of cultural tourism today, but it has one crucial failing: it lacks the power to fundamentally shift economic and political power in the city. The biennale needs a transformative event that reverberates globally, displacing other forms of tourism and re-figuring their future. The biennale needs to transform the city in multiple forms, but it needs to do so in a way that creates new jobs, generates wealth and destroys old-fashioned urban blight. The biennale needs to exert a significant influence on the development of new metropolises, because these will determine how the tourism generated by them will be organised. The biennale needs to be creative and unpredictable, so that it can adapt to the new ways of urban life, so that the city can be transformed. I propose the development of</text>

The real anchor in the city remains cultural tourism, which is promoted by the city government with tourism and cultural tax abatements and funded by the city with tax-deductible development credits. In most cities, cultural tourism provides the majority of cultural tourism, with cultural institutions such as art galleries and museum collections playing second fiddle. However, in some cities, such as New York and London, cultural tourism leads directly to development and new heights of regeneration. The question that remains is which legacies will be left standing after the city has been devastated by both climate change and cultural tourism? The answer to that is a definite &quot;yes&quot;. London’s cultural landscape will continue to be beset by the vagaries of its unique cultural-tourism industry, but its changing face will be one of the dominant ones.  	Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Pic</text>

The public register will remain open for comments, while the journal and interactive toolkit will be regularly updated with new ideas and responses.Biennales have a long and important legacies in their host cities – in fact, they’re the single largest form of cultural tourism in their host cities – and with good reason: they demonstrate the city and its infrastructure, offer unique experiences, connect with locals, and foster collaborations between local and national authorities. But their current forms of cultural tourism are a response to a specific set of problems, and while local and regional authorities can and should invest in improving their cities, no city can afford to ignore the mounting costs and risks associated with climate change, nor to look the other way as a financial machine that’s driven by the fossil-fuel industry. The biennale as a globally recognised institution needs to respond to the changed forms of biennale that are taking place in its cities, and it needs to do so in a manner that creates new forms of engagement and creativity in a city that isn’t threatened by the changing climate. In other words, it’s not enough to build a biennale in a city; it’s essential that the biennale create new forms of</text>

The public, especially in those host cities, engage with and participate in the cultural institutions that provide the basis for their social and economic development. But engagement and cultural tourism have a limited currency and are most effective when multitudes of people are engaged with them, as is the case with biennales. The task of adapting the biennale to the new economic and social circumstances of the world we inhabit is a long and complex one, requiring a great deal of coordination across different levels of government, tourism commissions, cultural institutions, grassroots groups, and individuals. This is why biennales have so many forms and have survived for so long in so many cities and countries. They’re cultural institutions that have acquired a globalised form and hence are prone to be re-branded and re-done throughout the world. And as cultural tourism has become more and more globalised, so has the need for a biennale to remain local and particular to its place of origin.</text>

As a form of cultural tourism, they’re a convenient way to witness the cities that you’ve never visited but wish to visit someday. But while the biennial has been a part of your city for decades, it’s now time to explore those cities and regions that were never visited and never intended to be visited. The cities are yours to explore, and the cities are the places where your city’s cultural tourism potential lies. This is the case for any tourist looking to visit a city only to be taken back to a city where the city is mostly empty and where tourism is scarce, but which the tourism companies dream about creating. The city becomes the archaeological dig site of the tourism industry, where the potential cultural tourism generated by that industry sits idle. The city is a potential site of future cultural tourism, where the potential tourism generated by that industry can be realized through the cultural tourism of the very city. This is the</text>

Despite the promise of technological innovation, much of the presentation of the technology was premised on the assumption that there would always be another way: that there was never a possibility that the technology would be used for good. In this sense, the technology functions in part as a kind of faith, or more specifically, a kind of deception.2  Of course, the technology is only a means by which the organization that created it, or provided the services around it, might further the objectives of its users. And its users, as users, are only ever interested in the organization’s ability to deliver tangible outcomes – tangible objects – through the technology that it has. But this kind of belief is implicit in the organization’s name, which conveys a kind of power, wealth and control over its users. The name itself carries a kind of power, and the</text>

When the California Institute of the Arts created the museum of modern art, it was seen as a kind of new frontier in museum building. At the time, curators were encouraged to create their own museum, and to take the concept further, to reveal its true form. For example, the California Institute of the Arts had created a new kind of museum called the Museum of Modern Art (later the Museum of Modern Art), which was itself seen as a museum of modern art, but with elements of the museum of ancient art incorporated. Curators were encouraged to rethink the distinction between museum and museum building, and between historic and modern art, and between the past and the future.

This was the form that the collection would take, and the structure that it would adopt. The collection of photographs and films produced the collection of objects, and the collection of photographs and films produced the museum.

In this way, the collection could be constantly on the move, constantly mobile – like the ephemeral archive that it is – and would be a unique kind of museum.2  The collection would be made visible in places where its original curatorial presence was minimal, and would draw researchers to the collection, who would find themselves transported to different parts of the world or even to different cities in different parts of the world. The set of 19th-century clothing, for example, might be repurposed as a research center for indigenous communities in order to further their own culture, or the collection might be turned into a permanent exhibition venue, where artists could be temporarily embedded while indigenous communities were developing their own arts and crafts. Such potential uses would only add to the potential archaeological and historical value of the collection. This kind of urban sprawl would be impossible</text>

Later, in 2004, the Nuyumbalees Cultural Trust established a museum of modern art, designed by architect Elmgreen &amp; Dragset. The trust has maintained the cultural center’s collection of objects in the building, as well as the collection of objects in the building, and has staged numerous exhibitions of modern art in the city. It has also staged numerous private exhibitions of art from the collection, and has recently established a new exhibitionary program focusing on Scandinavian art from the era of the second-rate AAA.2  The growing demand for ethnographic material in the city, and the museum’s increasing budget, led to another initiative, this time from the Danish Cultural Council, which saw the renovation of the museum</text>

As a curatorial exercise, however, this project was also deeply flawed. Its focus on the material and archive aspects of the situation (a) alienated viewers from the subject matter (object storage) and (b) placed curators in a powerful position to demand material or archive from the audience. As a result, the collection was often exhibited in isolation, and its contents largely forgotten. 	The 2015  	Tokyo Biennale, on the other hand, presents a more extensive set of materials and an entirely new relationship to the material. Many of the materials used in the exhibition are new to curatorial use, and the relationships between curators and artists are complex and elastic. Thus, the materiality of the material objects exhibits, their ubiquity, and the fact that they are arranged in stacks or bundles in a museum-like fashion, rather than displayed on a pedestal, act as a kind of metaphor</text>

In this sense,  	the architecture of temporary accommodation, and indeed of any kind of temporary accommodation, could be seen as a kind of living archive, accessible through the same material and archive-like structures and able to support a kind of multiple storage conditions.   	The collection would also enable research into the kinds of historical and archival materials and archive that existed in the region at the time, in an attempt to create a kind of metainterface between the local community and the wider archaeological and historical remains found there. This metainterface would result in the creation of new kinds of temporary accommodation, new kinds of accommodation for long-term visitors, and would probably make it into a kind of museum of its kind. The hope is that this kind of metainterface can be created through the processes involved in the project, and that this kind of temporary</text>

In this sense, it would be like a research museum, but with objects instead of traces. Its focus, of course, is on the material forms and processes that are affected by the industry in which it is embedded – just as our own industry produces traces that linger in the environment, shapes the seas, and even creates them – but it is also about the social forms and processes through which the impact of these processes can be studied and interacted with. The collection would exhibit not only the objects that are made by and for us, but also the social conditions and processes through which they are made, created, and enacted. It would act as a register of interaction, a record of the ways in which material culture impacts on people’s lives, and perhaps even help us to rethink how to live together in harmony with the environment.

Current trends in data analytics suggest that even relatively simple archives can be organised and maintained in the cloud, and collections can be rapidly gathered and destroyed.2  Archive and digression: multiple uses for the material forms in the present. 	In the 21st century, the storage of information is a global phenomenon. Massive web services, such as Google+ and Facebook, constantly gather and share information about themselves – what they have been, where they have been, and what they are doing. This constant stream of data makes it possible to identify patterns among individuals, events, places and large corpora that may be relevant to a particular project or research question. As a result, researchers, artists, collectors and others with a scientific or artistic bent have begun to view storage as an integral part of research, or more accurately, as a structural part of that process.

The park was designated as a wilderness area by the federal government in 1980 and subsequently managed by the National Park Service. The project was led by Architects and Engineers for Environmental Reform (AE/to) and the Museum of North Dakota. The Museum of North Dakota provided financial support for the project while the Park Service provided technical and park services. The Park Service also provided funding through the Park Maintenance Fund and the North Dakota Grant for Permanent Community Land Trusts. The N.D.N.T. was created as a non-profit public corporation dedicated to the conservation and promotion of natural resources across the state of North Dakota. AE/to was formed as a North Dakota-based Indigenous Cultural Society with offices in Fargo and Lulea, and an Indigenous Environmental Network office in Fargo. Lulea is the capital of Lulea, the first city in Lulea, Sweden. The Museum of North Dakota is headquartered in Council Bluffs, North Dakota, and also has an office in Fargo. Both the AE/to and the Museum of North Dakota were established as regional hubs for the storage and movement of objects from the park to sites in the state. The Museum of North Dakota is the primary custodian of cultural property and records related to the area, and records are maintained at the Council Bluffs and Lulea Museums. The Museum of North Dakota also maintains a permanent collection of objects at the Council Bluffs and Lulea Museums. For preservation reasons, the Council Bluffs Museum is closed to the public.

It was created in 1984 and is managed by the Park Service. The Park Service manages the Boundary Waters Park and its resources. The Museum of North Dakota and AE/to was incorporated in New York, and both the Museum of North Dakota and AE/to have offices in Fargo. The Museum of North Dakota maintains a permanent exhibitionroom and archive of photographs and films in its building at the University of North Dakota School of Architecture. AE/to is a producer and director of the documentary film Standing Rock, which documents the Dakota Access Pipeline and the local resistance to its construction. In 2015, the Museum of AE/to produced a series of public programs at the Museum of AE/to’s archives in New York and at the Museum of North Dakota School of Architecture in April 2016, which explored the role that the Museum of AE/to could play in the future of its building.

The aim of this approach is to create a shared vocabulary, a shared set of objects, and a shared set of behaviours – the same way that AI and biennials are trying to create a shared vocabulary, a shared set of objects and a shared set of behaviours. The only difference is that this time, we’re not trying to figure out how to use the objects we get – we just want to use them the same way.When I started, in 2015, I had two questions: What can a biennial do?

The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do with its subjects is much harder to define. The second one is much harder to define, but hopefully this translation will allow us to understand what a biennial can and cannot do. The answer to the first question is easy: a biennial has to be creative and interesting. But what makes a biennial unique and interesting is hard to define. And what makes a biennial interesting is hard to define either. That is, until now. This is the case for Sara Seager’s Biennale, which is interesting because it does two things: (1) It describes the past with great personal detail and emotion, and (2) It records the past through narrative form. In other words, it’s both a pastiche and a pilgrimage. But what it’s trying to do with its subjects is very different from what a biennial would do.Millionaire's Shortcut, 2015.

And How can an archive or a museum do both? And what does it mean to archive or a museum? The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do is old-fashioned, back when we were kids: show us something that we didn’t know we already knew, in the form of old stories. And in this sense, it’s trying to recreate what it has in its archive or museum collection. The problem with the rise of the biennial is that it gives rise to an entirely new set of exhibition-going behaviours, often driven by the same people who showed us the ‘new’ in the first place. And these exhibitions often end up replicating each other, or inventing new ways of looking at things.So what can a biennial do? And how can an archive or a museum simultaneously present multiple versions of things? This is the language of archives, of course. And it’s a language that biennials often speak. Take, for example, the 2015 Venice Biennale: many participants in the project still live and work in the city, and many are involved in its redevelopment.</text>

And How can an archive or a museum do both? And what does it mean to archive or a museum? The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do with its limited resources is missing in action. In the case of a museum or a library, the aim is always to keep teaching, to keep providing a resource for further research. And here, the problem with biennials is that the last thing they want to be is a resource for further research. So the contradiction between their initial enquiries and the things they get instead of what they ‘re supposed to do, or rather, what they’re supposed to forget, grows ever more pronounced. And this is one of the reasons why biennials tend to repeat themselves: it’s the only way they can keep producing without becoming stale.Look at the art world right now: every year, the art fairs that are part of the ‘Organisation XIII adopted a new policy of some things being displayed in certain rooms only available to VIPs and professionals only. For a while, it looked as if this would become the norm. Now</text>

And How can an archive or a museum do both? And what does it mean to archive or a museum? The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do is at odds with the way archives and museums usually do things. So what the biennial is trying to do is different from what the archival or museum traditionally tries to do. And what the biennial can and cannot do is a reflection of this. For instance, in the case of a biennial that tries to do both, it’s trying to occupy the same space, but also to be able to do different things to different groups of people at the same time. It’s trying to be both a tourist attraction and a museum. And this second aspect is what makes biennials different from other exhibitions: it’s the fact that they’re constantly trying to figure out how to be more than exhibitions. To some extent, this comes through the fact that they have programming that tells them to do things differently from other museums or other curators. But it’s also the fact that they’re constantly introducing something new into the mix. This</text>

The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do in the second question is much harder to define and quantify. And the answer to the first question is much harder to define either. So what a biennial does is interesting – it shows us something new, but it also enacts a certain historical process that creates a certain set of relations between various historical moments. For instance, when I first came to Venice, I thought I was seeing a historical Venice, but the reality was completely different. The architecture in the Venetian palace had always been gothic and neo-classical, but now it’s springing back into fashion, with architects like Arsenale and Rembrandt getting a chance to create a new look at the old style. And the fact that Venice is becoming an international financial centre, with an international airport and international rail network, is a historical event that I certainly connected to – an event that created a certain amount of tension between the city and the airport. But the new face of Venice, which is being</text>

The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do in the second question is much harder to define. And the reason is simple: a biennial can only ever show us what it knows, and it’s trying to create a vocabulary that includes all possible worlds. But what a vocabulary is also a limiting principle; it’s trying to tell us something, and in doing so, it destroys or modifies our knowledge. So what biennial or museum could ever hope to achieve? I wondered, and still wonder: what would be the point of keeping records in the first place? I mean what we as visitors to the archive or the museum would learn when visiting? How would the visit affect our understanding of the past? Would the visit make us change our minds? I thought to myself as we visited the Central Park West Museum, and the Central Park South, and the West Village upzones: what a vocabulary we could build; what a vocabulary the city could eventually construct. And it occurred to me that the reason why the visit</text>

The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do is also interesting: it’s trying to create a hybrid zone where the old and the new, the present and the future, collide. And what this means in practice is that we have to ask ourselves and others questions such as: what can a biennial do? And how can an archive or a museum act as a hybrid zone where the old and the new, the present and the future, collide? Here, we can start to talk about gentrification, which is a concept that has been developing for a while now. And to be more specific, it’s trying to figure out what to do with the buildings that are being converted into condominiums and other types of housing units. And what this means in terms of culture-at-large is that we have to ask ourselves and others questions such as: what kind of culture can this create? What kind of limits can it place on its own creativity? How can a biennial draw artists into this? When we start</text>

The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do is still show us what it’s already told us. And what it’s trying to do is to tell a story through a series of videos, so it’s telling a story in different ways. So what a biennial can and should do is give us the power to create our own stories through different forms of storytelling. For example, the power of video is tied to the power of audio, but it’s also tied to the power of visual media – so a biennial can and should create its own form of visual media, and this can be a storytelling medium such as video, audio or sculpture.Art is a powerful storytelling tool. It’s not just some abstract principle that artists should pick up and apply to all situations; it’s a storytelling tool that should be used constructively and creatively. And so one of the first things that came to mind when looking at the architecture of the biennial was: what if it built itself?</text>

And how can a biennial create a shared vocabulary, a shared set of objects and a shared set of behaviours? This is where archives and museums come in. M. Teresa Castroviejo has been talking about the difference between archiving and preserving. Storing is different from archiving; it’s an act of omission, whereas archiving actually preserves something. So one can imagine a situation where a biennial or a museum is trying to do both at the same time; it can also imagine a situation where the biennial or the museum is trying to tell the story of the person who’s performing the act of memory. For Castroviejo, ‘an archive or a museum becomes something that intervenes between what it preserves and what it reprodu</text>

The first question is easy: a biennial can either show us something new or keep showing us what we already know. But what it’s trying to do is underneath the surface. It’s trying to figure out how to talk to us without actually telling us. So what it’s doing is asking us to become more embedded in it. And this could mean becoming more present, or it could mean becoming invisible.In order for a biennial to be a lasting contribution to the art world, it has to be able to talk to its subject matter without becoming obtrusive or controlling. And here, the archive or the museum becomes an important part of this equation. Because the artefacts or artefacts of a particular event are not things that happen to be physically present, but rather things that happen to be embedded in a particular historical context, then the biennial as we know it has to be able to move away from that embeddedness. Otherwise, the event will remain embedded in history – around the art, around the place, and ultimately, around a person or set of persons – forever unsure of its real identity. And so,</text>

Nevertheless, in the last decade or so, many projects have been developed with the full support of the arts commission, which may now withdraw the arts from mainstream education or practices, or, in the case of socially engaged art, to arts commission-funded projects that may now be conducted by organisations other than the artist in question.  	The biennial has a Social Impact Factor (SIF) score that is calculated as the proportion of the value produced by the project in relation to the cost of production at the institution (member institution: ‘10’). The higher the score, the more art is produced and the wider audience engages with the art, thereby enhancing the biennial’s credibility and image.3  Art institutions in the area have also adopted ethical or social responsibility policies addressing issues of consumption and have addressed societal issues such as poverty, homelessness or war in</text>

This has been partly due to a change in the priorities of other partner arts organisations, particularly in the area of arts and culture engagement with young people. Rather than engaging with art as a curatorial tool, or art as a way of generating knowledge and engaging the public, arts organisations began to develop programmes and projects that shaped knowledge and organisationally. For example, at the Edinburgh Arts Forum, Andy Murray spoke about the ways that his organisation Arts Council for Education and Arts had supported a number of local schools or community centres developing arts and culture programmes.3  These have been marked ‘schools that learn to think', which I believe is significant in that it suggests to students that there is value in thinking creatively, in creating creative solutions to problems and in arts and culture as a potentially transformative activity.4  The importance of this notion of ‘schools that learn to think’ cannot be understated.

With the support of the Arts Council, the Biennial carries out research projects in the arts and social work. These are carried out in cooperation with the DfID and in partnership with other art institutions. The aim of these partnerships is to establish or enhance artistic capacities within art institutions and in local communities.  The Biennial also carries out a number of projects outside the arts context. These range from training artists to producing opportunities for artists to work in the community, to supporting artists in their production of cultural products. The projects undertaken by the Biennial in the 2015/16 cycle are just some examples of many that can be described as ‘impactful’ or ‘transformative’ in their impact or transformation.2  In general, the projects undertaken by the Biennial in the last decade or so stand out in relation to the projects undertaken by other art institutions in the city. In the years immediately following the projects undertaken by the Biennial in the 1980s and 1990s, other institutions responded by creating multi-year ‘cultural-institutional-permanent-recurrence projects’ – projects that seek to recreate the historical practices and discourses around an art institution or a community of artists’ residencies. These ‘cultural institutions’ find new ways of engaging with and incorporating the arts, while the artists find new contexts and modes of working.  Biennial projects have their particularity concentrated on a city-wide or local-level, giving particular attention to the cultural functions that artists have within that city. These biennial projects are often developed through a combination of grants from the Arts Council and the London Biennial and other funding streams. Funding for these projects comes from a range of sources, including private philanthropy, institutional and individual sources, and, of course, the Arts Council. However, the important thing is that</text>

These include projects undertaken by the Biennial in Liverpool,4 the Biennial in San Francisco,5 the Biennial in New York and the Biennial in Berlin.6   The projects undertaken by the Biennial in the cities of other parts of the UK, such as Liverpool, tend to be small in scale and have a local flavour. They are generally about connecting to the city and its infrastructure or landscape, rather than the artificial contrivances that are often applied to urban environments. The importance of such projects cannot be understated. Urban transformation is at the root of the problems of inequality and poverty in the UK and globally; securing the infrastructures that support social inclusion and cultural production is a pressing issue. Urban regeneration schemes such as Liverpool Biennial’s can only add to the sense of place-making and alienation. If the spatial relations between people are to be changed, then cultural production has to be developed</text>

For example, the Biennial has carried out a number of projects in the area of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis treatment and research, as well as in the area of education and coordination of organised communities. However, its primary focus has been on the provision of access to affordable housing and social housing in the area, which has frequently been attributed to a low-performing urban core.3  Similarly, the provision of health and education for large populations of students and residents has focused on the institution of higher education, rather than the campus or the surrounding neighbourhood.4  The emergence of biennials as socially engaged organisations, with projects that generate local or global impacts, has also played a part in this. The biennial format – in which the art institution plays a central role in the establishment and sustainability of the community – has often been used to produce culturally responsive work that contributes to the negotiation of dominant social and economic forces. Such work is often seen as unacceptable by</text>

This is partly because the projects undertaken by the Biennial tend to be publicly visible and ‘commercial-oriented’ in nature. Nevertheless, they tend to be projects that can be counted on to yield long-term change, whether institutional or locally disruptive. As the Biennial’s 2015/16 budget indicates, the project management role appears to have accelerated in the last decade or so.3  In my view, the project-based initiative that the Biennial affords artists and communities is an opportunity to leverage this strategic leverage to initiate and facilitate project-based project-making.4  For instance, artists who have residencies or projects within the Biennial can leverage the institutional resources of the institution to launch and facilitate projects that result in changes in the neighbourhood, even when these are ‘commercial-oriented’ in nature</text>

Their scale, the duration and the rigour with which they are carried out attest to the transformative potential that such transformative activity can exert. Other projects may be more subtle or sophisticated in their intentions, but they nonetheless demonstrate a fundamental shift from the earlier impulse to intervene outside the site or space where it is not wanted or appropriate. In the context of the biennial, these more subtle or sophisticated ways of becoming engaged with the site or the spectacle stand out more clearly than those that employ intervention or conflict.  	The impact of these projects is likely to continue to be muddled. The rich tapestry of cultural resources that can be gathered from a city or a region may never be allowed to be woven into a truly integrated cultural landscape. But the fact that artists can now lay claim to cultural property that was created before the advent of social media and analytics casts new assumptions about the potentialities of cultural production and the relationship between the arts and the social.  	The claim</text>

Their scale, the number of participants, the duration of the participatory projects, the participation of local people – all of these factors make up the bulk of the projects undertaken by the Biennial in the city, but also in other arts centres around the country.3  The participation of people of various ages, from artists to community organisers, is another factor that contributes to the projects described above, as well as to the growth of creative practices and cultural life in the city. More and more people are taking part in these activities, and a new generation of artists are starting to emerge. The participation of under-18-year-olds is another story. As the participation of under-18-year-olds increases, so too does the impact it has. In the last decade or so, participation in arts activities has shifted from being discretionary to being mandatory. The availability of arts resources has become an integral part of every community’s arts and cultural programme.</text>

The number of artists employed in the art of the local community has continued to grow, and the growing number of artists who work for the Biennial in partnership with local artists is evidence of that. Indeed, the growing body of collaborative arts practice demonstrates an increasing willingness to engage with the art of the neighbourhood, even when that means breaking apart into small-scale projects that address local issues or bucking the trend of concentrating on large-scale industrial production.  	However, the projects described above fall outside the purview of the DfID, and outside the remit of the Community Arts Council, which is funded by the Arts Council.3 Therefore, the question arises whether the expanding remit of the Community Arts Council, which is now focused on supporting emerging artists, is being carried out in a manner that is compatible</text>

Of course, the impact of a project undertaken by the Biennial is likely to differ from the impact of a similar project undertaken by another institution. But the fundamental relationship between the arts and the biennial remains. Indeed, it’s worth noting that the Biennial’s projects in the city centre, such as the workshops and events, were initially put together with the support of the Arts Council.3  In turn, the Arts Council established the Community Arts Initiative (CAA), a strategic partners hub for the Biennial in the city.4  The Biennial then established a funding partnership with the city to carry out art projects in the city, with a further funding partnership with the Biennial itself to carry out cultural activities in the city.5  These projects were undertaken under the direction of the Cultural Offices, Arts, Learning and Recruitment Unit (BLEU) and funded by the Arts Council through the Arts + Culture Performance</text>

This last description of the political, social and ecological dimensions of the cultural ecology of the biennial is a blend of the historical, the conceptual and the practical.

Biennials may also do good in the service of the arts, but this is rarely foreseen or appreciated. And although biennials may have a social function in aiding in imagining possible futures for cultural activity in the future, this is rarely considered, either by those with a conscience about the past or those without any interest in the future.  Ultimately, what is needed is a better understanding of the past, both for artists and the arts in general; a view that is both open to the possibility that art and the arts may still play a role in the future, but that is also open to the possibility that art and the arts may no longer exist in tandem. A view that seeks to reconcile these two contradictory conditions is needed.Art’s historic place in the city is largely due to the work of artists who came to the city to draw work and entertain crowds; the city was created as a destination for artists and it is</text>

A biennial that began in the United Kingdom but has now spread to Brazil, Russia, India and other parts of the world could find inspiration in the history of biennials in other parts of the world, in part because the past is everywhere in the form we create.  And although biennials may have historical obligations that can and should be met, they are also empowered by our present to create and re-create what they please wherever they please.  As biennial clients, we’re grateful for this kind of lending. It helps us to imagine possible futures in which the past isn’t necessarily at fault. It gives us the will power to take risks and seek unknown territories, and it gives us the ability to demand and receive things back in kind.  As bi</text>

And although biennials may have a moral obligation to share the past with other disciplines, this is often done in order to serve a larger political and economic agenda, often at the expense of the interests of humanity as a whole.  Biennial titles often refer to past curiosities that still need to be told; sometimes this is simply to offer a glimpse of the past while reminding readers of the past while leaving room for change. But sometimes a name or image conjures up images of past practices, and it is this combination of qualities that makes a biennial distinctive.  The tenet of sharing is a difficult concept to shake, but the tenet of biennials embodying this notion is becoming ever more important.

Art’s own present and future conditions mean that its present has to be accompanied by a vision of the future that is not trapped in the past.Art serves multiple purposes: it informs us about the past, it enables us to speculate about the future, and it shapes how we imagine art and art’s place in the future. But in a critical sense, it is only ever capable of serving as an object of contemplation, the past, in so far as it is still a significant part of contemporary art’s presentation of the present. The past, in the strict meaning of the term, is present in the present; artworks now stand in for ideas and concepts that were once considered ‘out there’ and whose presence and/or presence we still lack practical means of understanding.

Lastly, although biennials may have a historical duty to tell the past in a way that is palatable to audiences capable of changing their minds and continuing with new stories told differently, it is also critical that they exist in a current configuration of power and money to enable this shifting of historical narratives. Without this kind of financial support and institutional backing, telling the truth in the current political moment is almost impossible, while the financial imperative to conceal lies propels the dominant narrative.  Therefore, biennials today face a complex task in their current political situation: to tell the truth in the present, while simultaneously forging new relationships with existing communities and the dominant narratives of their sites.  And this interconnection and interdependency between the past and the future is an essential condition of a thriving biennial.  The relationship between biennial and museum is a complex one.

In the past, the past is available to be understood and changed through experimentation; but the past is also an extremely potent and persistent narrative that is difficult to put down. Its permanence breeds its own set of problems and contradictions, and its heterogeneity breeds its own forms of social pathology. Examples of this are legion, and are reflected in the number of pages of the Baudelaire list; but there is another crucial point that artists, curators, historians and artists’ groups, including myself, have repeatedly stressed: the importance of biennials as a form of art and a storytelling tradition in the preservation of democratic government, the institution of press, and the rule of law.In their own right, these</text>

Biennial funding has its downsides, too. Funding can be scarce, and biennials are especially vulnerable when the interests of the arts are under attack; but even if the arts are under attack, and biennials are viewed as heretofore marginal practitioners, there is little they can do to reverse this tendency. It is common for biennials to affiliate with other art forms or art worlds; but here the artifice is replaced by the realisation that art is a political necessity today and that art has to be fought for what it is worth. The realisation that art has political effects, and that these have consequences beyond the art form – which is itself a political necessity – is the undoing of biennials throughout Western civilization.ART IS A POLITICAL NECESSARYToday, biennials are often compared to large‐scale art institutions such</text>

And although biennials may have a place in the future, they do not yet possess the power or the cultural horizon needed for transformative change.

What has been happening in the South is happening globally; and it is the beginning of a trend. The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the limits of the biennial. It must be spread across the globe, and it must do so at a global scale. The problem with the biennial, as is becoming increasingly evident, is that it towers above all, and ultimately, unattractive, all other local contexts. It is a monument to the particular flavour of that particular century. The attraction for visitors to come to the Pan-American festival, for example, is its opulent opulence. But this is only true if the festival is located in a city like New York or London. Otherwise, the city is a distant backdrop. And so the biennial has to be globally aware. It has to know how to negotiate its own aesthetic quality in a global context. The question becomes whether New York, or the Pan-American festival in any other city, is the right place for the forthcoming technology to take root and grow, to become aesthetically sustainable, and to be able to claim global recognition.New York City Council Member Melissa Mark</text>

The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the borders of the South, and it is widely believed that the autonomous-vehicle market is expected to expand globally in response to these reductions. As a consequence, the biennial – which is itself a global phenomenon – is expected to play a pivotal role in this transnational transition. The significance of this in its evolution cannot be underestimated. The biennial can play an essential role in influencing the development of technological infrastructure that supports the technological infrastructure of the future; and this is expected to be the case in all cities.

The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the purview of the bounded region around the city. It will inevitably affect all corners of the planet. The autonomous vehicle will bring about changes in the infrastructure of the city that, in turn, will have effects throughout the world. The development of autonomous vehicles and the associated reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the confines of the city. It will inevitably affect all corners of the planet. These are the trade-offs. The choice is ours. The choice is between disaster, which many places now find themselves, or a future with reduced environmental degradation, reduced anxiety about the impact of climate change and other stresses, and a greater capacity to engage in cultural forms of the Earth that are less reliant on fossil fuels. The choice is between habitation and agriculture. It is a difficult but perhaps the right choice. But the choice has to be made with reference to the larger context of the conflictual situation humanity is placed in.

The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the confines of the biennial; nor, for that matter, can it be contained within the confines of the museum. The autonomous vehicle and the museum are not mutually exclusive, and curatorial and the museum simultaneously. The autonomous vehicle and the museum are coming to pass in a way that no art institution could have anticipated or imagined. Yet these are the curatorial and art institutions, and these are the trends; trends that could and should be controlled. The autonomous vehicle and the museum are not mutually exclusive, and art is bound to them by what we may call ‘sharing of control’.Art institutions and their talented curators have three choices: (1) they can produce what is essentially a replacement for what is lost; (2) they can participate in the sharing of control; or (3) they can produce what is essentially a replication of what is lost, but at a smaller scale and in a different medium.

The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the purview of the purveyors of the current auto industry. Rather, autonomous vehicles are the impactor of the industry upon which the industry is building itself. The industry is now producing a globally distributed output of vehicles, fitted with artificial intelligence, that are all but self-learning in their operation. This level of general cognitive ability is unprecedented in the history of the human species, and it is being done on a grand scale. General cognitive ability is a human capacity for abstract thought, and the ability to perceive patterns across vast quantities of data sets is an extraordinary capability. It is to be expected that when the vehicles are automated, will not only be the drivers but also the passengers among us to question how the infrastructures of our species are constructed? The future city is likely to witness a proliferation of self-repairing physical infrastructures, which will in turn witness a proliferation of driverless cars, drones and other autonomous vehicles. The proliferation of such systems is a probable outcome,</text>

What has been happening in the South is happening globally; and it is the beginning of a trend. The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the confines of national borders. It must be addressed at global levels, and it is happening now in the Global South, at an earlier and faster rate than in other places. The number of passenger cars on the road in the South as a percentage of the total has increased from 8 per cent in 1990 to more than 12 per cent in 2015. As the number of autonomous cars has exponentially increased, the number of people stuck in traffic jams has exponentially decreased. In the early 1990s, a typical South Korean car would produce up to 24 traffic jams a day. Today, traffic jams in Seoul are uncommon, but they do exist; and they are caused by a combination of people talking on mobile phones, and the fact that the number of available parking spaces has remained constant despite a constant increase in population. A cure for traffic jams is unlikely to be found in the future, but in the present situation, the only solution appears to be to increase the number of autonomous cars on the road.

The development of self-driving cars will inevitably lead to changes in the number of cars on the road, and in the number of people using them, which in turn will require corresponding reductions in CO2. The reduction in emissions of internal combustion engines is a global phenomenon; and while the amount of CO2 being emitted each year is a small part of the overall global emissions picture, the reduction in emissions required to achieve this reduction in emission levels is considerable. The reduction in car emissions from 1990 to 2005 alone was equivalent to the annual increase in global population of more than six billion people.

What has been happening in the South is happening globally; and it is the beginning of a trend. The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the confines of the US or the EU; it must spread to other places where it is more difficult to control a car. The autonomous vehicle must be developed to meet the needs of the local population; and this means finding ways to meet the needs of the local farmer and the neighbourhood. The autonomous vehicle will have to meet the standards of the local community. This will require integration of relevant local knowledge, cultural practices and knowledge into the system, and it will require that the knowledge transfer takes place on a large scale. The autonomous vehicle will have to meet the needs of the local community in order to achieve these standards, and it will rely on the resources of the community in order to pay for itself. This will require negotiation between the local authorities and the car manufacturers; and this negotiation will likely involve political and economic influences. In the early stages of this negotiation, the local authorities will likely not want to be tied directly to the vehicle it is developing, and will want to negotiate with the companies.

What has been happening in the South is happening globally; and it is the beginning of a trend. The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the confines of the US or European cities, because these technologies are globalised and interconnected now; they do not map to local conditions. The concern in the UK is that these autonomous vehicles are contributing to a shift of the ecological balance of the road, and that this shift will increase the risk of environmental disasters such as flooding and landslides, which are now more commonly associated with human-induced climate change.The North-South Road MapThe South is developing an ecological consciousness that is starting to affect the development of the UK. Even before the announcement of the Tesla Roadster, the hype around autonomous vehicles started to affect policy. As early as 2014, the UK government started to investigate whether it should be pursuing an EV industry. In 2016, a bill was proposed in the UK Parliament that would have made it a criminal offence to import, manufacture, lease, or offer for sale an EV without a manufacturer's certificate of conformity. These certificates, which are extremely rare and expensive to obtain, make EVs viable economically</text>

What has been happening in the South is happening globally; and it is the beginning of a trend. The development of the autonomous vehicle and the subsequent reduction in traffic flow cannot be contained within the confines of any one location. It is an interaction between places and peoples; and as places and peoples become increasingly autonomous, the role of the city will diminish further. A more accurate term for the new phenomenon would be ‘multiverses’. But even ‘the “real”, as opposed to artificial worlds created from data and data‑rich archives, such as databases, social media, maps and coordinates, now govern much of what is considered ‘the” world.’30  Thus, the autonomous vehicle and its sensors is only one manifestation of a global cultural revolution that is occurring at an unprecedented rate. The other manifestations are geopolitical, economic and technological. Cultural revolution X is the globalisation of labour and ‘all of its dimensions’. It is the final chapter in a cultural history that began in the 1990s with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end game of the Cultural Revolution in China. The rise of new media and new</text>

The biennale, in its constantly expanding collection of forms and worlds, reproduces the urban and the spatial in a recurrent narrative of interaction. It is the contemporary counterpart of the ‘gorgeous game’ that the US military, in World War II, played with the idea of panoptical control.3  The biennale became particularly prominent in the 1960s and 1970s, and its various forms took on a life of their own. It was a hub for the burgeoning biennale scene in Paris, and its curatorial push and pull added a touch of patronage to its various curatorial initiatives. In London, the museum, the biennale and its curatorial push culminated in the Tate Modern, which regularly hosted the biennale as a major exhibitionary event.

In place of the ‘real America’, a more plausible image of the United States was constructed: the ‘imagined America’ of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. was often cited as the start of a US progressive narrative.3  The US pavilion, however, was not the only stand in the Museum of Naval Aviation's long and often futile quest for representation. The Museum of the Moving Image, a curatorial gesture towards its own history and subsequent collection, was an even more successful vehicle for the museum’s desire to appear relevant again, to seem contemporary again, and to appear urban again.

Its support came predominantly from a public relations firm established by and primarily employed the artist Samuel Morse. The biennale was a major platform through which the US military sought to advertise itself to potential customers abroad. Its popularity was further enhanced by the fact that, during the glasnost years, the museum was frequently closed and relocated, and its collections were systematically withdrawn. This led to a re-embraced museum appearing at a new site on the riverfront, in a former dry goods store, across from a major train station. The biennale was aligned with the city’s rapid redevelopment, as the riverfronts were cleared and new residential neighbourhoods sprang up, many of them built on the former grazing land of the armed forces. This ‘dock’ often involved the forcible taking of indigenous land by the military, which was given the official legal title of ‘United States’ and handed down as a �</text>

Most recently, in 2016, the American museum Curtis Dellums  robustly reproduced his Venice admonitions in a new exhibition, ‘Venice’s Contemporary Art Explained’, in the newly created and yet existing space of the US National Museum of Art.3  The biennale has been a fixture in the biennial agenda since at least 1984, when the Venice Biennale Board adopted a resolution that the Venice Biennale be known as the ‘Vittorio Venusto’, its curator’s distinctive Italian-led gothic style.4 Since that time, other biennales – Kübler-Ross, for example – have been set in the city, along with smaller, localised exhibitions that explore its rich cultural pasts.

It is not clear if these ‘contingencies’ referred to contingency or ‘the contingency that leads’ to contingency, but the persistence of the biennale in the interests of US imperialism is strongly suggested by the multiple curatorial interventions and the stable of curatorial appointments. The biennale has a clear materialist orientation, with material objects at once traceable and traceable-mimicking, especially in the forms of artefacts and figurative masks. It is not known whether the materialist impulse animating the biennale is driven by a primitivist impulse or whether it is the other way around: the materialist impulse is the product of a cultural cognition that has emerged in the wake of the contingency that leads. But the fact that the impulse towards materialism is materialises in the biennale</text>

As the Museum of Naval Aviation demonstrated in its early twentieth-century heyday, the biennale can be a very profitable proposition. The museum closed its doors for good in 1962, and the city that it represented folded in on itself, with museums, arts and cultural organisations, community centres, and newspapers all vying for the biennale visitor’s attention. As a twenty-first century biennale, the Liverpool Biennale is no longer in the business of representing the United States in a particularly positive light, and its long-term relationship to Liverpool is over. Its 2015 iteration, curated by Sue Bell Yank, attempted to recapture the glory days of the biennale, but in doing so employed familiar tropes from the US – the racialised underclass, the graffiti, and the promised land – in an attempt to make the event more accessible to a wider range of travellers.1 </text>

In Europe, the Venice Biennale was the most conspicuous of these curators, but a few other European biennales also established permanent exhibitionary positions in their cities. But in the United States, the Dayton Biennale came closest to establishing a permanent international reputation, hosting a series of original works performed in a public setting, and publishing its own catalogue. Its success was due in large part to the fact that it was held in the former Cleveland Clinic, a venue still open to this day and a site of frequent vandalism.3  This ‘curtains itself’ by setting aside a specific, albeit exclusive, cultural niche for itself.

In its 1953 Bissho Biennale, Egypt, the US was represented by a phalanx of F.D.R. planes, which brought the ancient and the new Egypt into collision. There was no historical record of such an event in the United States, but from the 1950s the biennale was overseen by the US Military Museum, which is now the Museum of Naval Aviation. The museum was housed in a converted bakery, and featured a large outdoor courtyard with a cornucopia of fountains running alongside a pool and a stage. On the museum website, the biennale was described as ‘a showcase of the Museum’s collection, exhibitions and collections, currently on permanent display in the lobby of the building.2  The biennale was a recurrent venue for the United States, and its numerous curatorial interventions were often accompanied by a ‘small-scale armed contingency’.3 The military took an active role in the exhibition setting, hosting events in the building that occasionally invited the public into the museum. In 1955, for example, the visitor’s guide was withdrawn due to a ‘security threat from militant underground groups operating in the United States’.4 In the decades that followed, the biennale’s content was restricted to domestic themes, and the armed presence was replaced by a visitor’s bureau that collected statistics on military spending and prepared a report on the state of the armed forces.5 The visitor’s guide remained as a fixture in the lobby of the museum, where it documented the history of the biennale, but in the 1980s and 1990s it was replaced by a video presentation that gathered statistics on the number of visitors and their activities.6  The video presentation, prepared by the RAND Corporation, released in part on the RAND Corporation website</text>

The Biennale was an important US partner in the 1956 Rome Biennale, and the Biennale of Sydney in 1992. It hosted the Venice and Paolo Barso in 1990, and the Italian pavilion at the 1993 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul. It has hosted numerous international curatorial initiatives, including the 2002 Melbourne Biennale, the 2012 Rome and Venice Biennales, and the 2016 Sydney and Berlin Philharmonic concerts. It was also a staging ground for the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, featuring a public audience of over 200,000 people.In recent years, the biennale has increasingly sought to align itself with a leading regional arts organisation, often operating out of the proximity of major museums or art galleries.

In  Stranger in a Strange Land, Max Brooks imagines the implications of AI for cultural reproduction: how AI creates the kinds of social worlds that can no longer be found in human history, and for which we have no role but to speculate. 	And in System 7, Nick Bostrom imagines the discontents of that kind of AI. 	Though the two texts are almost identical in substance and structure, there are sharp differences in their focus and  	endgame. 	Nick Bostrom’s work is less about the philosophical questions of AI and more about the physical and virtual locations of the ambiguities of moral agency in a globally connected and dispersed society.

It might be the case that this new understanding of the world around us—what David Bowie famously called ‘spaceships’—would become something that we actually evolved to create, rather than something that was brought about by natural selection? 	In an ideal world, all of these questions would render us able to pose them, in a non-human setting, these kinds of direct encounter with technology. But the nature of technological design means that the creators of such systems are far more likely to employ violence and other destructive strategies, and would be justified in the knowledge that their creations are superior to any natural selection. And at some point, the very nature of the systems that they build may require that they resort to war as a means of defending themselves from the elements that threaten to undermine their structures.

In the current cultural moment, we are witnessing the birth of an entirely new planetary system of empire-making, based on the principles of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Though AI will undoubtedly reduce the complexity of the human condition, its capacity for self-repairing is undeniable. And though the mechanisms of this new social media regime will undoubtedly be able to outsource many of the functions of the human empire, they will always retain a strong colonialist bent. 	In an increasingly globalised and interconnected world, the image of an imperial presence is the dominant one, and the image of an imperial person is one of expansion, conquest and subjugation.

What might replace the human element in the media landscape as a result of this new technological revolution? 	One might begin to ask these questions and more, gathering data and information as it unfolds, in an attempt to map the elements of the urban environment that generate and are generated by the system that is designed to function via the media of connectedness. The possibilities are endless, and it is not just utopian dreams of a just and eternally connected world that are being addressed by the growing body of research that is being carried out on the environments of our cities. 	The possibilities for a just and connected world are also being addressed by the work of artists, activists, researchers and academics.

What might become of us in the context of a global ecological system that is increasingly sensitive to the resourcefulness of our species, and to the effects of its own cultural behavior? What might become of us, in the event that we are no longer able to independently create social media platforms and the technological infrastructure that underlies them? This is the question that artificial intelligence research is attempting to address. 	The term &quot;algorhythm&quot; was first used in 1899 by British anatomist John Graham Kerr to describe the irregular, fragmented anatomy of the human body. 	[i] Kerr defines an  	algorhythm as follows:  	a state of bodily processes or motion such as heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure or temperature, in which an object or event occurs more than once in a second.’[</text>

These are questions that continue to confront us, and which continue to be asked and answered by those who would seek to abolish human agency from the face of the planet? 	In the wake of these and other questions, it is worth recalling that, during the 1920s and 1930s, the fascist political party that would eventually be called the Nazi party sought to impose a one-world utopia on the planet. In the wake of this, and in the wake of the various forms of totalitarianism that it embraced, humanity emerged stronger and more autonomous agents capable of resisting the impulse to obliterate.  Thacker Turner’s Rebellion of 1914 is a good place to start.

What might become of us in this new world order of replaceable labour?  Whether we envision it or not, humans are the engines of capitalism. We are the assemblage of disparate parts that form what make up what we might now call the infrastructure of the global economy. We are made up of billions of objects, some of which are more powerful than some of the parts assembled here.1  The human element is perhaps the most pervasive of all the components that make up the ecosystem. But in the social, economic and ecological domains, the most pervasive form of division is evident: the social sphere is often divided into discrete, bounded and segmented parts, each with its own distinct way of organising the world.

What if, in the long-term, the rise of artificial intelligence leads to a merging of all media to create a new social reality, one in which empowered agents everywhere render the social possible? What might that mean for artists and artists of all kinds to do? 	The short answer is that we do not know, and cannot do with certainty. One might speculate that in the age of the autonomous vehicle, when resentment of the over-empowered grows, there is a vacuum of creativity and meaning in the world outside the hypertext narrative. One might also speculate that as AI improves, so too does the capacity of its writers to become more precise in their narrative structures and in their choice of mediums of expression. And one might even speculate that as the social implications of this technology become clearer, the ethical questions surrounding it will become even more tangled.

What if, in the coming years, we begin to replace the human element in the media landscape in such a way as to better reflect the conditions and processes that created and are shaping the planet we inhabit? 	This future would render humans not just ‘content producers’ but also ‘content consumers’ – able to create and be sustained by ever greater amounts of media, and capable of constituting a new form of ‘infrastructure’ that is both physical and virtual.

The cultural production of the present is likely to be influenced by a variety of anthropogenic factors, which will tend to negate or negate whatever is produced in the preceding century, at least as far as is concerned in terms of the accumulation of human capital and the perpetuation of human species. The most pressing anthropogenic threats to humanity do not pertain to the cultural production of the present; they pertain to the production of commodities through human labour. In other words, the future may be more like the past. (…) A second aspect of the ‘cultural trap’ is the very real possibility that some of the anthropogenic pollutants now implicated in causing such chronic diseases as dysentery, dyspepsia, dysentery recurrent, and dyspepsia trichiureticum may be shifted to non-human forms through the act of production.

This is the dynamic behind the cultural production that occurs at the end of the twentieth century, and it is the product of a political and economic class structure that is no longer able to absorb the enormous changes taking place in the world economy. 	In recent years, cultural production has come to dominate all aspects of artistic activity. This is especially true in the US, where critical and populist tastes have shifted cultural consumption away from the cultural bourgeoisie towards the bottom 99%. However, the shift towards a minimalist, commodity culture is also the product of a historical and social necessity, which is part of a global historical process that continues to reshape the world in ways that continue to be found in the globalised capitalist society. If we are to understand the twentieth century and beyond, we must begin to understand how culture is produced, consumed and produced in the contemporary world. The social, economic and aesthetic conditions that gave rise to the modern aesthetic must be actively encountered in order to appreciate the cultural practices that are part of contemporary capitalism today.

Art and cultural production in the contemporary era of unlimited media are deeply entwined. If not regulated, the cultural production that results from the market is likely to be apolitical, if it is cultural at all. That is, political ideas and representations may be produced and conveyed through the consumption of cultural goods, but they are products of a specific social context, and not autonomous entities. 	Art and cultural production in the contemporary era of unlimited media are closely related. That is, contemporary art and cultural practices are likely to be influenced by the media they are presented with, and the media cultures around them.

The Museum has a policy of not allowing its collections to be used for religious or supremacist purposes, although it has a long-term religious purpose in the city that goes back to when it was founded in 1666.

This may happen at a moment (in the contemporary art world, at least) when politics (conscious or unconscious) is a more significant factor in consumption, and may be a function of time. 	When political and humanitarian considerations are taken into consideration, the potential value of cultural products (including service artists' cultural practices) may be overvalued. This may be the case when conflicts between buyers and sellers (including war-weary publics) arise, and when social and political change is promoted through cultural acts. 	There is a tendency, too, to down-scale cultural production (from the contemporary artist into the consumer</text>

In the commissioning of a project by a museum, the artist or curator is likely to engage in the consumption of artefacts and historical works, which are produced as a result of the project. In this sense, the physical – the works – dominate the ideas and representations in the cultural landscape, and the buyers and consumers of cultural products are often the same people (or, if the market is to be unregulated, the same people everywhere). As a result, the marketplace of ideas is a marketplace of politics, and the very politics of ideas are produced by the very act of production. 	Once cultural products are produced (through either the commission of art or the purchase of a museum membership), their political valences are likely to change (through a combination of buyer and artist bias), and new political situations are likely to develop. This is the dynamic behind the cultural production that occurs at the end of the twentieth century, and is now increasingly evident in the ethno-cultural production of post-liberal urban environments. 	Cultural production today is produced in large part through the production of knowledge (through institutions, research and, increasingly, self-organisation), but the commissioning of knowledge also entails the production of representations (through artists, curators, writers and others with skills complementary to those needed by art institutions to produce works of art), and the production of publics (participating in festivals, societies or other forms of cultural tourism are common forms of publics-producing behaviour).  	The commissioning and the production of representations and publics is the practice of making visible (through art, literature, events, membership in a trade organisation, street performance, tours, seminars etc.) behaviours that are often considered socially unacceptable (through laws against hate speech, racial vilification and others). The production of publics is also common, but different from the production of representations. Publics</text>

This is the dynamic behind the cultural production that occurs at the end of the 1990s and early noughties, when a socially engaged, culturally aware middle class was built. It is this market of ideas that has since then encouraged other creative forms of consumption (art, children’s toys, books, concerts) and stimulated a proliferation of cultural tourism (art and cultural exchange between nations, cross-cultural spending). 	The cultural production of the post-1990s middle class is the product of a globally globalised capitalist economy driven by ever more intricate infrastructures of destination – destinations in their own right, but also of production and consumption (contemporary and cultural tourism, international trade, cultural monologues, festivals, monologues etc.). These infrastructures of destination represent cultural capitals of the modern world, where people gather to take part in cultural exchange, to experience cultural wealth and to meet other cultural consumers.

In the modern age of globalised markets and ever greater consumption, the real-life encounter between artist and consumer is likely to be reproduced in ever greater measure. The encounters between artists and people (of all sorts of professions) are much less likely to constitute cultural products. 	The contemporary art market provides a perfect environment for the production of a number of such ideologies. The contemporary artist is likely to produce works that are products of an audience that is global in character – in other words, people with a global reach. This is why contemporary artists are drawn to places with a sense of the urban, and places where the urban environment is variable – places where the market is intense, but also places where the market is unpredictable (&quot;towns with codes&quot; or tax abatements). In this sense, the market places the contemporary artist into a market for products that are as in many ways ideological (and potentially socially useful)</text>

In recent decades, the political/ideological landscape of the cultural production of the century has been reshaped by the constant need to combat radical Islamism, which is promoted in the name of cultural consumption. The need to maintain an ideological balance between the various aspects of Islam has created a complex set of cultural practices and ideologies, which are widely shared across the historical periods of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, but which are distinct to the cultural production of the twenty-first century. 	The need to produce cultural narratives about the present and future, and about the world as a unified whole, has become ever more critical, even as the othering effect of globalisation has become increasingly important. As a consequence, the contemporary art of the present century is likely to be progressive, even inspirational, in its own way.</text>

They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they are frequently constrained by the political and economic dynamics that shape the city. In a 2006 study, I argued that the curatorial role in biennial’s should be abolished.  The reason for my position was that I viewed the curatorial role as constituting an inherently unstable unit with a negative impact on the city’s capacity to evolve. I called for the abolition of the institution ‘with a heart’ and the ‘strong arm’ that it implied. I characterized the curatorial role as a ‘glimmer of hope’ in a city struggling with its postindustrial future. I proposed a multi-tiered model of the ‘curatorial summit’, where the artist(s) at the top of the totem pole exert great influence over the city in a dynamic and fluid way. At the same time, the city shrinks to accommodate the artist’s desired effect, which is best achieved through the most efficient utilization</text>

Biennials are institutions that set the agenda and have a significant role in shaping the city they inhabit. They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they are the intellectual anchor of the city and exert a great deal of political and economic power. Without the institutional resources and political clout of a biennial, other cultural forms would also be possible, including non-biennials.  A biennial is a ‘time-varying space’, occupying different registers from year to year, and thus presents different kinds of experiences to different people each time it is staged.  A biennial must have a distinctive form in order to be recognisable as being based in the city. It mustn’t just reproduce itself, but create its own narrative and different registers of cultural activity from year to year. As an institution, it is the story of a people and culture, weaving together different periods and different places in a multi-decade process. A biennial must also have a way of linking into a larger political or social narrative in order to be considered a ‘real’ cultural form.  Lastly,</text>

Biennials are institutions that set the agenda and have a significant role in shaping the city they inhabit. They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they carry out a vital role in maintaining the aesthetic values of the city.  AECs are organisations that posses the legal authority to establish their own agendas and to pursue their own independent creative strategies. They are creative entities in their own right, though they tend to follow the agenda and passions of the government in this country and abroad that put them in power.  AECs are often led by social scientists, philosophers or artists who have a particular interest in the world of ideas, or might be interested in the ways in which everyday life unfolds through the mediation of technologies. For example, in the biennale that is the official representative of the European Community, the United Kingdom,  	1916, the United States and the ‘other’ European nations organised into a single ‘collection, display and celebration’ of poetry and prose from around the globe. As the biennale’s title suggests, this meant that the collection, its contents and</text>

Biennials are institutions that set the agenda and have a significant role in shaping the city they inhabit. They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they are autonomous spaces that must be regulated in order to preserve their authenticity. The biennial is a ‘main’ venue, and thus it sets the agenda, which dictates what is considered authentic. As biennial conventions have evolved, their agenda has shifted from the city to the suburbs, to the street and even to the margins. Now it is city-centred and international in character. This is no small thing in and of itself. City-centredness is a concept that has been central to the biennial since its inception in 1992, long before there was a concept. In this sense, the biennial is an international organization with an internationalist agenda. It organizes the world’s biennials into identifiable themes and ‘bodies’ that can be categorized and accounted for. It does this through a multifaceted and dynamic series of programming and exhibition formats that vary according to the city in which the biennial is operating.  exhibition</text>

Biennials are institutions that set the agenda and have a significant role in shaping the city they inhabit. They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they are often involved in creating the conditions that enable new modes of interaction between people. Biennials can be counted on to deliver what they preordain, whether that’s the kind of urban development they envision for the city, or the kind of interaction they want to encourage in the city. In the case of Brighton, the kind of interaction they want to prevent.Biennials have a political character as well. They are political in their mode of creation, and in that sense they are ideological. They are made up of artists who find their true calling in the art world, and who therefore want to be able to leave it be. These are the artists who create the illusion of democracy by giving a voice to those who aren’t yet citizens, and who thus have a responsibility to engage with the city in ways that are authentic to the city and yet politically-impalatable.

Biennials are institutions that set the agenda and have a significant role in shaping the city they inhabit. They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they are often critical of the state of the city. I decided to create a project around the biennial that would go beyond the usual biennial format and explore the role artists play in creating the city. I called it ‘Beyond The Biennial’ and invited the artist(s) who were active in the city at that time to collaborate with me on creating a project that would bridge the art and social worlds.For the project, I invited artists to participate in creating a new kind of biennial. The artists would be invited to create engaging, narrative-driven works around themes of the day, or in the case of a special event, around a theme that was already present in the city. The themes of the day would evolve organically over time, with the artists choosing the best material and creating engaging works around them. The aim of the project would be to see if a biennial could be created that was ‘deepened’ by the participation of an artist</text>

The biennial needs to tread carefully, as it’s possible that it will be able to impose its will upon the city in ways that are not based on a genuine and authentic appreciation of the place and history that is being created.  Another example of artistic inversion is the situation of virtual and augmented reality. The virtual reality industry is making significant inroads against the entrenched forms of physical and virtual reality, and it’s interesting to me that the earliest VR work we did was done in Illustrator. The medium of illustration is itself an inversion of formal conventions and norms. It caught on much faster than we imagined, becoming a pervasive way of engaging people with stories and imagery across multiple mediums.  Another example of curating operating from outside the sphere of the art world is the work of Björk Linkönen and Coop DeWa</text>

Biennials are institutions that set the agenda and have a significant role in shaping the city they inhabit. They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they are subject to their respective curatorial mandates. In the case of Brighton, the AEC’s proposals to re-zone the city centre and create a zone of its own around its Art Museum effectively placed the city under an art commission. AEC members and their staff then set the agenda for the week, and city residents and community members vote on what artpieces they want to see. Curators then set the city’s art schedule – the artist’s, the community members and the organisation will then negotiate what artworks will be shown, how many, and on what basis. While the curatorial mandate may call for openness and transparency, the reality is that such an approach necessarily entails a certain amount of control. It was always going to be difficult for the artist to do both, because her confidence would inevitably be affected by the news, but she did little to hide from the pressures of the job. She fought tooth and nail to keep the project from going</text>

Biennials are institutions that set the agenda and have a significant role in shaping the city they inhabit. They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they are often tasked with performing a large public works programme that devolves considerable political and economic power into the hands of a small number of people. This is why biennials have a financial incentive to perform large public works projects, while many other forms of art forms do not. The biennial form is unique in that it is able to impose its will across a city in such a way as to exert a significant influence on its political, economic, cultural and social life, while remaining ethically distinct from other forms of art forms.  Similarly, the biennial form can be used to produce socially engaged art, but it must be ethically accountable and transparent in order to generate public support for a project. A biennial must be able to demonstrate an impact on the ground level of its intended impact, while being also a catalyst for further social change.   	The Biennale Commission is an intergovernmental intergovernmental organisation established in 2002 to renew and propose innovative ways of organising</text>

They are often influential in how the city is governed, but at the same time they are subject to the whims and desires of political and economic influencers. The biennial form is made up of several smaller units that draw on a theme or interest or point of view. Each such unit represents a particular point in a theme or point of view.  Biennial visitors spend an in-depth three-to-four days in the city, interacting with aspects of the city that are specific to that theme. They’re presented with multiple perspectives on a theme, which may be integrated into a single visit. This type of intensive, multi-day curatorial approach is rarely employed in the city, and rarely seen again after being completed. The biennial form is also a luxury that many artists and institutions do not enjoy. It is, in my opinion, a form that should be explored and negotiated, because it represents a premium and a significant amount of wealth is at stake when institutions make pilgrimages to such places.

[ii] A second approach could be taken in the form of a question: what is the relationship between the production of goods and the improvement of human capacities – i.e., the capacity to perform work?]  [iii] A third approach, also worth exploring, is taken by way of a dialectic: what if the function of the worker is no longer to produce but to improve human capacities?  [iv] A fourth approach, developed by Christoph Buchel and published in Neue Zurückischer Zeitung in 2002, seeks to understand the rise and fall of worker productivity through the character of the exchange between workers and managers during the transition to the digital economy.  [v] A fifth and final approach, taken by way of a monograph published in 2005, investigates the phenomenon of circular labour in the digital economy and the social consequences of this technology's transformation of labour. It is the outcome of a conversation between Paul Ricoeur, an industrial theorist and the author of several books on the history of technology, and Dirk Grosmeier, a professor at the Leipzig University of Technology Studien zur Macht Frei und sein</text>

[ii] A second approach could be taken in the form of a question: what is the relationship between the production of goods and the improvement of human capacities – i.e., the capacity to perform work?]  [iii] A third approach, which I adopted in order to fully appreciate the transformative potential of AI, is the modus operandi of cultural cognition. Cultural cognition is the study of how individuals organise themselves in relation to the world in relation to themselves, and how culture is experienced as both normative and constitutive of human capacities. It enables us to notice patterns and carve out particular trajectories through how individuals organise themselves. By observing and structuring the social, the capacities of AI could enable us to discover fundamental principles governing the behaviour of labour and the very substance of labour itself.  [iv] To fully appreciate the transformative potential of AI, we must grasp the interconnection between culture and technology. The cultural cognition of the future will be able to read and interpret cultural texts, and will undoubtedly consume cultural texts. To achieve this, cultural texts will need to be produced in a way that are legible to humans, and will need to be distributed across platforms in such a way as to be accessible and</text>

[ii] A second approach could be taken in the form of a question: what is the relationship between the production of goods and the improvement of human capacities – i.e., the capacity to perform work?]  [iii] A third approach is the use of AI or Artificial Intelligence, developed in part by the US Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin. It is worth noting that the military has been researching and developing ways to use AI to replace certain types of human labour with artificial intelligence systems. One example is the use of AR systems to detect and avoid enemy aircraft. The military has been researching ways to augment human intelligence with systems that mimic the ability of the human brain, using data to detect and avoid enemy aircraft.

A city might develop technologies that monitor its inhabitants' movements, recording and analysing the impact of these activities via sensors embedded in the walls and ceiling? Such monitoring could be used to monitor and analyse the extent to which the smart buildings of the future are being put to work in the production of goods and services, and to infer the capacities of AI that are being developed.  [iv] A fourth and final approach might be taken by way of introspection: what do we know, what do we forget? If the biennial format is to continue to provide us with significant new perspectives and a means to change our perceptions and understandings of the world, then it is imperative that it grows beyond the confines of its birthplace. Otherwise, it is possible that the very act of curating, of staging and staging again, in and across different cultural</text>

It is also not clear what the relationship between robotics and AI will be like in the future, or whether the functions of government and civil society will be re-formed through the technology of AI.  [iv] A fourth approach has been proposed by Vernacruz and Coon (2001), but it is not clear what the relationship between robotics and AI will be like in the near future. Vernacruz and Coon’s model proposes that robotics will become the norm for large-scale production processes, whereas in the future, autonomous vehicles will play a larger role in the transport and logistics of goods and people. It is to some extent a prediction, but it is unclear what kind of impact such technologies will have on labour conditions and social conditions.

Recent advances in neuroscience and AI have allowed scientists to look inside the brain, at specific points in time, and to recreate neurons and glial foci so that they can be studied in the future. This third approach to understanding the brain opens new perspectives on the question of how the brain creates meaning and value. Brain scientists have long known that the neural networks that underpin the actions of the human behaviour – the ‘meaning building’ – are made up of physical and virtual parts. But the connection between the production of goods and the enhancement of human capacities has remained elusive. Understanding how the brain produces meaning and value is just one aspect of a much larger question that questions</text>
