Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to describe this new form of artistic agency that is emerging, one that is both inevitable and completely avoidable. It is a kind of prophecy that seems prophetic in the face of all the research and theoretical work that is being done to protect us from the pervasiveness of AI.Artists, curators, artists’ associations and artists’ allies’ organisations are rapidly becoming aware that there is a need to be thinking creatively and creatively about the growing number of potential threats to our artworld and culture that are generated by the techno-psychologies that are being unleashed by AI.The rapid proliferation of AI-enabled media platforms and devices is creating a kind of media singularity in which the art of the future is rendered unintelligible. This is a singularity that neither the AI nor the human artists who are the authors of AI can escape.Artists, curators, artists’ associations and artists’ allies are asking themselves, drawing parallels between</text>

It is a work that anticipates and responds to the question, ‘What if?’ It asks, rather, about the things that might happen if such AI becomes widespread and becomes a reality. Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to describe this new kind of singularity, and the point where humanity becomes fully autonomous. Kasdin’s work places the human in a kind of stone age world, where technology becomes an ever larger part of the equation, and the human in a kind of machine. But this is not just a re-telling of old stories – in fact, it is an entirely different kind of storytelling. Kasdin does not pretend to understand what this new storytelling might mean for art and the art world. He simply wants to understand how to do it. So his work invites us to imagine new forms of storytelling possible in this new technological society. His title, The Unravelled, is a kind of prophecy. It is written as a kind of handbill that you deliver to art galleries, schoolchildren, artists’ school days, it is a message to big business, it is a plea to humanity itself. It is a kind of pleading with a seemingly omnipotent</text>

It is a work that anticipates and responds to the question, ‘What if?’ It asks, rather, about the things that might happen if such AI becomes widespread and becomes a reality. Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to describe this new form of singularity – the point where God, not necessarily the designer, but the emergent programming that creates God comes into being. This singularity, Kasdin says, ‘will have two kinds of possible futures: happy and sad futures.’1 And so the conference came full circle – back to the question – what if? – but with artists and other stakeholders invited back into the loop, the contours of a possible future are beginning to be drawn out and sketched. Two pieces of evidence that can be found in virtually any text or presentation of the present, however, are the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and the ongoing crisis of lead in the Gulf of Mexico and Upper US Gulf Coast. In the current period of crisis, there is little discussion of the role of art or art institutions in responding to the impacts of AI or other new forms of societal software.

It is a work that anticipates and responds to the question, ‘What if?’ It asks, rather, about the things that might happen if such AI becomes widespread and becomes a reality. Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to describe this new kind of singularity, and the ways in which the human race is likely to become less and less like nature. Kasdin is not alone in his thinking.  The question of what constitutes a true ‘culture singularity’ has been a point of contention in the history of science and technology. One can trace back to the nineteenth-century conception of the critical culture, which was part of the broader concept of scientific culture. Philosopher John Grayling pointed out that the human species is culturally singular in its conceptual and organisational stages, having been constructed as an ontological singularity – defined in the founding document of the Human Race as the point at which all species stand in relation to one another. Grayling argued that the singularity is a concept that cannot be circumscribed or defined, and so its definition is arbitrary and capricious. It is not a concept that can be reduced to an ordered hierarchy of human differences and achievements.</text>

It is a work that anticipates and responds to the question, ‘What if?’ It asks, rather, about the things that might happen if such AI becomes widespread and becomes a reality. Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to describe this new ‘reality programming’ that is emerging across all of us, and which he describes as something that is akin to a religion but is also something that is entirely synthetic and fabricuous. The implication of this statement is that we are cast out of our natural human capacities and made to fulfil specific roles in a technologically enhanced society. This singularity, Kasdin claims, is the defining technological challenge of our age. The question that remains is, can we imagine a future with a lessening of this technological singularity?Art has a particular and often-quoted capacity to bring about positive change in situations where others might intervene with (and in some cases, lead to) negative outcomes. Sometimes this capacity is quite obvious: the power of an artistically expressed protest that threatens harm to a company's business plans might generate a change in ownership; a project that seeks to educate tourists about a local site might find itself threatened with legal action unless it adop</text>

It is a work that anticipates and responds to the question, ‘What if?’ It asks, rather, about the things that might happen if such AI becomes widespread and becomes a reality. Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to describe this new kind of singularity, and the point where the human and machine become indistinguishable. Kasdin presents a series of questions and answers that are similar to those posed by Francis Crick in his 1960s book The Black Stack. Questions and answers about what this might mean for art, and for humanity, emerge from the various projects I have been developing, from the conversations that I have had with artists about creating collaborative and interconnected artworks using AI and from the work that I am doing with the Museum of Contemporary Art in New York.Art and artists’ own role in creating AI is framed within a larger cultural and societal context. This includes not only the work I have been doing with the Museum of Contemporary Art in NYC, but also the work of curators and art historians throughout the world who are using AI and similar technologies to discover new kinds of art and to imagine what might be possible in the future.Art's role in creating AI is framed within</text>

It is a work that anticipates and responds to the question, ‘What if?’ It asks, rather, about the things that might happen if such AI becomes widespread and becomes a reality. Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to describe what he describes as ‘the point at which the immense and ever increasing potentialities of new technological capability intersect with the actualities of human history’. In other words, it seeks to articulate what might happen if, as Kasdin proposes, we embark on a quest for AI.  The theme of The Unravelled is futuristic, but futuristic needs a narrative. In this case, the futurist is not just imagining things better than they are, but also breaking them down to reveal the mechanisms that enable that future to be realised. The question, then, is what might be done to prepare us for that possibility?  As a first step in this conversation, I thought it would be useful to suggest a few curiosities about the ways in which AI might alter the human condition, both in its conceptual and artistic aspects.Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of AI to me is what it might mean for artists to be able to draw upon the</text>

It is a work that anticipates and responds to the question, ‘What if?’ It asks, rather, about the things that might happen if such AI becomes widespread and becomes a reality. Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to begin to conceptualise the new form of art that will be created in reaction to this new technology. He suggests that these new artistic forms will follow certain basic principles, and that these principles will be the basis of all artistic responses to this new form of art. Kasdin goes on to argue that these new creative responses will have to be both complex and transient, and that they will have to address the issues of culture and AI in radically different ways.I thought this was a great idea. I liked what Kasdin had to say, and I thought that the question of cultural singularity (as opposed to bienniality) was a particularly interesting one for us to consider. We looked at the two terms, and how they came to define the contemporary art world in a particular region. Culture was seen as a spatial term, while biennials were seen as an affective term. For Kasdin and I, the cultural singularity was seen as being a historical</text>

Kasdin uses the term �technological singularity’ to describe what he has in mind when he speaks of a future in which artificial intelligence becomes the norm in all aspects of human endeavour. AI will make it possible to design entire artworks with precise parameters about what kinds of artworks can be made, as well as to create art from scratch from scratch, and this will be done on a massive scale.Artists who participate in The AI conference will receive a full conference package including travel and accommodations, as well as a meet-and-greet with Kasdin and other senior curators.

It is a work that anticipates and responds to the question, ‘What if?’ It asks, rather, about the things that might happen if such AI becomes widespread and becomes a reality. Kasdin uses the term �machine learning’ to describe the kind of computer systems that can be programmed with certain behaviours and emotions to recognise and learn from examples. He proposes a new way of conceptualising what computer programming means, one that does not necessarily result in an app with a certain form of behaviour, but one that aims to create genuinely app-like structures on the web. These structures could be seen as ‘deep learning’ systems, and their capabilities realised through the deployment of data. The implications of this new understanding of programming can be seen in the production of new media such as apps and social networks.  The work is a response to the question, as well as to the question: what would a biennial ‘be?’ and addresses the paradoxical situation in which art is seen as a precondition for a specific societal good, while fundamental research into the neural networks that underlie such goods is largely neglected. Kasdin sees an opportunity in the increasing number of apps available on the</text>

They have become interested in the ways in which biennials function as a placeholder between social formations and geographical locations, generating and commenting on their conditions as temporality is shifted and restructured. They have also been interested in the role of biennials in generating or commenting on the conditions of spatiality: in this they have contributed to the discourse by publishing work in referential and pedagogical contexts. In 2014, they opened the Instituto de Investigaciones En Vivo (Institute for Experimental Journalism), located in Mexico City, to produce a new kind of biennial: a position piece or a stand-alone publication.

He was a proponent of the concept of a ‘biennale’ and published widely in the leading urban and regional magazines of the day, particularly those associated with the city, including the Toronto Schedule.

Its formal activities aim to draw visitors to a place, an artefact, to a place and time, and sometimes both. Its curatorial activities aim to produce interpretations of past and present through the artefact itself. Its entry points (locations, sites, times) are extensive and diverse. 	Its exhibitionary format demands a curatorial activity that is sensitive to the cultural resources of a place, assemblage of historic and contemporary art and architecture, and the processes involved in the production of artefacts. Its curatorial activities, then, need to engage with such resources in order to produce interpretations of the place and time that are contextually aware and responsive to the contemporary cultural environment.

I suggested several years earlier that the biennial should be culturally responsive to the post-WWII economic collapse, and its negative effects on culture globally. After the war, Walter Benjamin remarked that the end of the war ‘gave birth to a new cultural form,’ which was different from anything else that emerged afterwards.6 	In a moment of self-congratulation in the catalogue of the second edition of</text>

It means developing strategies to hold onto it, using it, and making use of it, while being exposed to new ideas, people and situations. It means making new art from the same old stuff, finding ways to bring people together across different sites and times, making new practices and using the same old recipes and tools. It means that in a complex cultural system, the art world and its stakeholders need to work together constructively, with stakeholders representing diverse audiences, on a large scale, for a long period of time to</text>

It is, in other words, a globally transmitted capital asset.5 	Art has a number of cognates, including those used in its production: the art dealer, the collector, the curatorial historian, the aesthete and the curatorial poet. And it is true that contemporary art today tends to be produced in or through the networked networks of communities. But these are only the pre-digital media of cultural exchange; today's art is widely shared across social media platforms, and its practices of public exchange are interrelated with each other and globally.

This is not to suggest that these are the only or even most powerful catalysts of change, nor that they are not important in generating change.

This array of stakeholders includes not only biennials, but also non-profit art institutions, historical societies, nongovernmental arts organisations (AGAs), museums, historic buildings preservationists, legal aid organisations and many others.4 	Artists, curators, artists’ unions and other stake-members of the cultural sector naturally see and act as if they are stakeholders in the cultural system.   	In recent biennials, the artists, the artists’ assistants and other art workers have largely been absorbed into the larger cultural system, which is often more reliant on technological advances and social media technologies. In the case of biennials, this system makes its own technological advances, and through its own cultural capital, can adapt to other kinds of actors, including new media forms and language forms.

It is happening now in large parts of Asia and Africa, in parts of Europe and the United States, in parts of Australia and the Americas, and in venues such as the Venice Biennale. As a result, many biennials are embedded in their local artworlds and museums, and witness the engendering of culturally responsive practices around art, architecture and the social that are being developed in many communities in many cities. 	Artists and artists are playing a pivotal role in driving this cultural pace, which is now producing cultural commodities with global impacts. The biennial form is sensitive to this fact. It creates its own set of relations with its artists, who are artists in their own right, and in many cases artists in their own right within the biennial itself.

It is embedded in the cultural logic of the city, participates in the construction of the city (with or without explicit governmental approval), and is a point of entry into it (by whatever name). Biennials are, by definition, in their own way cultural interventions, and thus also ‘real‑world’ in their own way. That term is freighted with a political and social connotation, one that foregrounds power and the state, and that, in turn, subject matter experts. So it is not just that art is here to stay; political and social interactions with art are of necessity ongoing. 	Art is a powerful, though finite, resource. It is better to say no to an art request than for it to be denied because of a lack of resources. And so the biennial format, like all</text>

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour. It seeks to extend the capabilities of AI systems by understanding how they acquire values, inferring norms and inferring purposeful meaning from the behaviours of individuals. In other words, it aims to create capacities beyond the capabilities of the AI itself. 	In a 2014 survey of prominent philosophers, Daniel Kahneman, Steven Pinker and Michael John Updike were asked whether they thought the future would be well or badly governed by a given AI. Kahneman, Pinker and John Updike’s answer was: it is difficult to say, given the degeneracy of human institutions and behaviour, and the manifold other factors that could affect outcomes, given the proliferation of languages, multiverses and cultural forms that we are now incorporating into our daily lives. … Given the proliferation of languages, multiverses and cultural forms that are now integrated into our daily lives, it is difficult to imagine a future in which such processes do not become embedded in our society.’– Kahneman, Steven.

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour. It seeks to extend the capabilities of AI systems by understanding how they learn to recognise legitimate and illegitimate behaviour. In effect, it allows AI to anticipate what kinds of behaviours will become legitimate and what kinds will not. 	One way or another, AI has to be able to foresee when and where we will need to balance economic growth with the needs of the common good. Otherwise, the trade-off between economic growth and social wellbeing becomes unsustainable. 	One obvious way to achieve this in a system that is inherently inclined to destructive behaviour is for the AI to be able to evolve self-correcting self-organizing mechanisms that correct for its inherent malleability and randomness in the sense that it is capable of evolving in response to changing conditions. Such systems would become augmented or virtual reality systems, and they would be able to see and do things that we cannot. 	Such positive developments for humanity would mean advancing not only the boundaries of human potentiality but also those of technological possibility.

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour.

The field of AI has come a long way since its origins in military research labs. The 1950  	Signal System Computer (SSC) and its 12 associated modules ushered in a new era of scientific computing that saw AI emerge as an actual discipline and not an integrated set of subdisciplines. The push towards greater understanding of how AI operates comes as no surprise to Stephen Hawking, the British physicist and physicist who in 1963 developed a similar philosophical perspective to that espoused by Hari Seldon in India. In his classic 1949 book  	The Ghost and the Fairy, Hawking describes the concept as one of the four &quot;Heros of the Machine Age&quot;:  	Intelligent Agents, Machine Emulators,     Intelligent Boards and Manuals, Intelligent Templates, and finally Architectural Ethics, which is the topic of my talk today. Hawking distinguishes between </text>

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour. It seeks to extend the capabilities of AI systems by understanding how they acquire and decide, which is to some extent what  	learners do. Machine learning is the answer to a difficult problem, but in doing so it opens new frontiers. This is why machine learning research is so exciting: it could yield enormously significant advances in the creation of autonomous vehicles and other systems, helping to create wholly new professions. 	In the context of the current geopolitical situation in the Middle East and North Africa, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, it is also why the potential benefits of machine learning are staggering. A system that learns to identify individuals at random in a crowd of people is far easier to program than one that performs such recognitions on a large scale, enabling autonomous vehicles to scour the landscape looking for individuals who share certain traits and then train itself to do the job. Such a system is far more vulnerable to malicious intent, but the potential gains are staggering. 	Once a system has been trained, its capabilities expand rapidly. The potential benefits for</text>

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour. It seeks to extend the capabilities of AI systems by understanding how to draw connections between phenomena, while minimising the number of systems that can be affected by a given programme. 	The field gained popularity in the 1990s with the proliferation of computer programmes that could be programmed to recognise patterns and generate results, and with the advent of programming, which allowed a computer to simulate human behaviour. Though the focus of much of this research has shifted towards practical applications, such as engineering systems that detect potential pollution sources or detect criminal behaviour, there has been a constant quest for the perfect algorithm that can reconcile all possibilities. Though these dreams may be comforting to those who grasp at straws to understand how things work, there is little in the way of understanding that things would be much worse if they weren’t controlled by a human being at all times. Machine learning has largely been relegated to the realm of semi-autonomous systems, systems that understand human behaviour but with no inherent motivation beyond the capability of generating patterns.

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour. It seeks to extend the capabilities of AI systems by understanding how to influence their behaviour in fundamentally moral and legal ways. The field of Machine Learning has contributed to a new understanding of human behaviour, and could even lead to cures. But in the grand scheme of things, we still do not know how to live together in harmony. 	To understand the singularity, we need to know what is meant by the term. If we take the example of a factory that manufactures robots, and suppose that one day, a benevolent AI decides to put a human worker in the factory, then we would not know whether the decision was legitimate or not. That is, we would not know whether the purpose of the factory was legitimate or not. The reason is that the reason why we do not know what the future holds is because machines are constantly improving and learning. If a benevolent AI decides to put a human worker in the future, then it does not know what the future holds because it does not know what actions are permissible in the present.

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour. It seeks to extend the capabilities of AI systems by understanding how they process data – how to employ algorithms to detect when something is done in a certain way, or in a certain environment, and to infer what that something is (see  	Machine Learning and Its Applications, 2015, chapter 3). Machine learning is not new, but it is gaining in prominence and visibility. The reason why is that many of the innovations in AI – the ones that give rise to new behaviours and give rise to new systems – are made possible through insights gained via machine learning, which is a branch of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is the science of artificial intelligence; it takes elements of science and technology and applies them to the design of human‐like systems. Machine learning has recently become possible through the use of big data, and is being applied to a host of big data phenomena, including natural language processing, image processing and media processing.

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour. It seeks to extend the capabilities of AI systems by understanding how to reconcile natural human motivations with the technological singularity. Machine learning is a new kind of AI, one that is both intelligent and enfranchised, and one that operates beyond the confines of academia, government, and corporate culture. It seeks to understand ‘how language is created and maintained, how cultural traits are inherited, and what constitutes legitimate political expression’. Machine learning proposes no fixed, immutable principles, but rather breaks them down into small pieces and inferiors to understand larger social trends. 	Like language itself, the technology underlying machine learning anticipates the future and evolves according to dynamically changing conditions. That is, while the design of a system may be deterministic, its behaviour is ultimately governed by past behaviours, which are themselves subject to dynamic variation. Thus while a human designer theoretically has complete control over how an AI system will operate, the ways in which that system will operate are subject to the whims of unpredictable factors beyond its control.

Machine learning is the pursuit of understanding how to reconcile the distinction between permissible and outlaw behaviour. It seeks to extend the capabilities of AI systems by understanding how to guide them in lawful ways. Machine learning is the solution to a difficult problem, but it also promises immense power and autonomy for only a limited set of users. That is, until something fundamental breaks down down as a result of inefficiency and/or overuse. In that case, the problems are left to fester and to be replaced by something more efficient and powerful. 	In the wake of this constant evolution of new AI systems, it is no longer possible to say with any certainty how fully AI will play out in the world. That is, until something fundamental breaks down as a result of inefficiency and/or overuse. That is, until something fundamental is found to be replaceable. That is, until something fundamental is outlawed. That is, until the last bit is removed as a result of a court ruling. That is, until the system is superseded. 	Is there any way to know what that might mean? Perhaps there are ways to imagine it,</text>

Machine learning assumes no prior understanding of the world, but rather seeks to identify patterns and exploit those relationships between things that are relatively new to the world. 	In  	World War Z (2015), Max Brooks represents the new nobility of machine learning: those heirs to the noble branches of algorithms originally intended for humans. Brooks attempts to conceive of the magic of AI through the language of royalty, but what he ultimately comes up with is a kind of legalistic template for a kind of machine learning that seeks to govern every aspect of human interaction ever created. The kind of machine learning that Orwell feared so much when he wrote his dystopian novel 1984. 	Brooks begins by noting that in the late 1940s and early 1950s, a group of American computer scientists began to refer to themselves as ‘renegade logicians’.

This will include the temporarily taking of off objects from the area (to be explained in the exhibition format), as well as the permanent taking of off new objects from the museum.After the initial distillation of the information gathered during the preliminary research phase of this research project, the exhibition format will be gradually adapted to the materiality of the situation. The materiality will be developed as the understanding of the community of those living on the street grows, and will include material aspects such as tiles, bricks and wire as well as more intangible creations such as community murals and stencils. The first Venice Biennale will be the first to embrace this new exhibition format.In order to provide the best possible experiences for visitors to the Biennale, the Museum of Modern Art and the local community, the research project was held in the Artistic Department of the museum, where the participants had their art projects put forward as possible experiences for the Biennale. The project was partly supported by the Italian Council for Research on Contemporary Art (CREC), a governmental agency, through a grant from the Italian Ministry for Cultural Affairs, and Italian Cultural Capital Partnership (CAGE), a private investment company.The</text>

This will include the temporarily taking of off objects from the area (to be explained in the exhibition format), as well as the permanent taking of off new objects from the museum.After the initial distillation of this new exhibition format, the Museum of Modern Art and the New York Public Library will collaborate on a new, three-month long format for the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Library of America, each publishing a selection of previously unpublished texts from the exhibition. These selections will include selected essays from the period; selected text will be addressed specifically to the various exhibition formats. The aim of this format shift is to enable a continuous flow of new texts to be added to the exhibition hall, while the continuance of the text itself, whether it is a review or a biography, will be curated by the curator in the same way that museum collections are curated. The format shift also opens the possibility of text being incorporated into the architecture of the city, a possibility that was not necessarily part of the original idea. For example, the Museum of Modern Art and the Library of America have different ideas about the role of the museum in a city. The former believes in the primacy of the museum as a</text>

This will include the temporarily taking of off objects from the area (to be explained in the exhibition format), as well as the permanent taking of off new objects from the museum.After the initial distillation of the new format for the forthcoming 2022 Biennale, I plan to create a new, and explore the conventions and paradigms of the present in order to map the present. I want to start from the assumption that the city is a collection of levels, and work backwards to understand the larger social and political context of the city. I want to see what happens when the city is made visible in relation to the arts, and make the city visible in relation to its biennials. The mode of artistic production in the city is the mode of the visible, but it has a modus operandi. The new exhibition format will oblige artists to engage their audiences from a specific distance, and the audience will have to be willing to be surrounded by objects that are not necessarily meant to be seen by any human being.This is a double-edged sword, in that the more art is produced in the city, the less is it visible in the usual way: in the form</text>

These included a public lecture series entitled ‘The Contemporary Condition’ (19 CET) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in October, which explored the ways in which the exhibition format had been compromised in the age of information, as well as a community-based project entitled ‘The Contemporary Art Project’ at the New Museum, New York, which sought to bring contemporary art from the region back to the city.Both the exhibition and the project were curated by Felix Warneken, who is also the curator of the newly established German Cultural Exchange, a collaboration between the Museum of Modern Art and the German Cultural Association.Art is not always contemporary, and contemporary art often makes headlines – particularly in the age of social media – but it is interesting to note how</text>

Some elements of the material will be left behind, while new cultural practices will be developed in the vicinity. As a result, the concept of ‘the museum as a living organism’ will be challenged. In the new exhibition format, the material and the embodied being that comprise it will be called ‘courses’ and the materials and social being that comprise them will be called ‘museums’. There will be no room for this in the old biennial, not even for a retrospective, because the museum never actually grows. Therefore, the material remains behind in the form of a ‘course’ or ‘museum space’. This is different from the museum going underground and institutionalising its collections, which is what the New York City biennial has</text>

The resulting exhibition was part of the larger exhibition / catalogue combination in Venice called Instituto Internacional de Venezolana (2014–15), which also featured works from the Instituto Brasileiro de Venezolana, Brazil; the Mexican Art Gallery, Mexico; and Televisa, the national broadcaster in Mexico.The Biennalee de Paris is the oldest and most prestigious of its kind in Paris, and its status as a commissioning organisation for the major projects of the city is not only based on its financial support from the Biennalee, but also on its financial support from the retail sector, which is increasingly important in the city.

Overwhelming responses from around the world, including from representatives of over 20 countries, demonstrated the significant importance of protecting and preserving the cultural characteristics of the present and the future city. Together, the public and local stakeholders formed the basis for a new idea and paradigm, and for a new approach to the problem of urban decline. Our proposal was to explore this idea from multiple perspectives and orientations.We invited international artists, curators, writers and archivists to participate in the consultation process. Overwhelmingly, they responded that the time had come to act, and that they were ready to participate in their work not necessarily as protagonists in a cultural revolution, but as consultants, agents or even as observers. This was particularly true of those who had participated in the Mondadorreal or Documenta 13, to participate in this new, contextualised process through which they might be able to contribute a new</text>

In each case, the feelings that they were trying to elicit from the audience were delivered through their artwork, and they each had a slightly different approach to how the audience would respond to such a relationship. For example, the episode on the waterfront offered a very different response from the episode at the Museum of Modern Art, as a whole. In both episodes, the audience was asked to become part of a narrative, to become part of a group, to become part of a community. In the waterfront episode, the audience member was in particular for whom the engagement was a way to become connected with the city. Through an interactive installation, the audience member could become part of the narrative, which in turn became part of the community.

The composition of the museum will be based on a combination of the information gathered during the first and second stages of the project. These first two stages were subdivided into ‘High and Low Culture’, with ‘high culture’ being the realm of established artistic and academic institutions. The museum that was created as a result of the project will be divided into ‘high culture zones’, where emerging art and artistic-legacy artists can exert a more direct influence, while low culture will be defined by the accumulation of culture, an ever-present and ever-expanding array of interests and practices. The museum will be a place where ideas and concepts emerge not necessarily</text>

Some were more direct in their criticism, while others engaged in character assassination, vilification and personal attacks on the other, most likely the museum. Art and Architecture was a topic of discussion at the conference, with some suggesting that the new exhibition format would be a perfect fit for the space, while others advocated a hybrid, three- or four-fold structure. Some even suggested that the new exhibition format would be a hybrid, three- or four-fold form themselves. Still others were more subtle, suggesting that the whole exhibition format could be adapted to fit the character of the building (and its contents). This last group of artists and designers were perhaps engaging in a kind of double negation, proposing that the curatorial intervention into the performance of the building and its contents might not be an explicit act of design, but rather a kind of mediation between artist and audience</text>

The curatorial departments of major biennials were starting to experiment with different formats of archiving. When the biennial was initially conceived, it was thought of as a cultural artefact, like the Roman or Medieval ancients. But over time, the exhibitionary form that it assumed was part of the larger cultural landscape was invented. Instead of being an artefact, the biennial became a historical document. The biennial is a cultural artefact that records the (historical) past in the present – in the sense that it is always looking back to find the next event, and it is always on the lookout for the next event to be invented. It is the ultimate curatorial strategy. The ‘biennial’ is an anthropological concept that comes from the nineteenth century, and it is used by the biennial to capture the contemporaneity of various kinds of cultural activity throughout the world. In other words, the biennial is a cultural production that occurs everywhere at the same time, and it records the same kind of cultural activity throughout the world.

The curatorial departments of major biennials were starting to experiment with different formats of archiving. When the biennial was originally conceived, it was thought that the main purpose of the exhibition would be to document the curatorial strategy of the biennial. But increasingly the exhibitionary form was seen as constituting the main dynamic; the biennial would be used as a vehicle that would take over the city and its infrastructure, creating a permanent archival record of the event. So the limitation that I found most problematic in the development of biennials was the fact that it was always seen as an entrance to a new mode of being, into a new kind of urbanity. But this is precisely what the biennial is doing; it is using the museum as a vehicle to open a different kind of dimension of being in and through the city.The exhibitionary form is being challenged in many other directions as well. The biennial is a cultural institution in its own right, but its power is being challenged not just by its own increasing institutional memory, but also by the countless other forms of cultural production that are being</text>

When the biennial was initially conceived, it was also seen as a way to experiment with the architecture of the city, and the role that the biennial could play in supporting the urban architecture of the city. In the new museum building that was being designed in Doha, the biennial would host a regular, six-month programming of exhibitions, public programs, and other curatorial activities. If the biennial were to open for business in Doha, it would have to be a ‘gift’ from the city, since the biennial is the only institution providing any support to the city. The other partners in the project were encouraged to partner with the biennial on a commercial basis. However, since the biennial was the only institution providing any support to the city, other partners in the project were eager to partner with the biennial on an educational or cultural basis. So the biennial opened with a series of educational programs for children and young people. It was also common for the artists and</text>

When the biennial was going well, the biennial was experimenting with three or four parallel histories. Then, over time, these forms of archiving were merged or combined with other curatorial approaches, and we were entering a situation where the biennial was asking artists to create a kind of exhibition that would last for several years, rather than a retrospective that would last for decades. In these new curatorial approaches, the biennial was asking artists to develop a kind of mini-exhibitionary form that would last for several years, rather than an annual, that would last for hundreds of years. So the curatorial departments of major biennials were starting to experiment with different forms of archiving. I wonder what kinds of curatorial approaches the biennial departments would pursue today if the biennial had ceased to be an exhibitionary form and if the curatorial approach to the exhibitionary form had become more participatory and interactive?DDownload this article as PDF27 February 2014To Osvaldo Sanchez20 July 2014</text>

The curatorial departments of major biennials were starting to experiment with different formats of archiving. When the biennial was going well, the biennial was almost always exploring a theme of the same order. As the art and cultural biennials started to be held in parallel, the other kind of biennial was being developed, and new curatorial approaches to the collection and presentation of art were being developed. So the exhibitionary form was being used as a form of archiving. In museums, it was usually the case that a museum was built around a collection of objects, whereas in the biennial form, it was usually the other way around. So the exhibitionary form was being used to index and map out the collections, while the biennial itself was being used to find common ground with other curatorial categories and to organize interactions across them. All these different kinds of curatorial approaches were being developed in parallel, and this shift was happening even before the advent of the biennial. For example, museums and cultural institutions around the world were developing research-based models for their collections, while the biennial</text>

When the biennial closed, artists usually moved onto other museum exhibitions or museums. But the curatorial departments of major biennials were starting to experiment with the form of biennial itself. I found a lot of the biennial artists themselves had never been to a biennial, or had only recently started. They often expressed surprise and sadness to learn that the biennial had become a global phenomenon. The biennial was seen by some artists as a replacement for the museum, since it was seen as an essential element of the exhibitionary form. But it has to be stressed that the exhibitionary form is not dead; it is an ever-present and ever-present limit in the city that is constantly being challenged and replaced. The biennial is a global form, and its ephemeral character makes it particularly susceptible to the changes that are happening all around it. The biennial has to be constantly (new) in order to keep up with the changing nature of the art world, and the art world in turn</text>

The curatorial departments of major biennials were starting to experiment with different formats of archiving. When the biennial is closed and the biennials themselves are no longer around, there is a tendency to revert to the biennial exhibitionary form. For example, the Venice Biennale, through a series of small-scale artist-performances, has done this starting in 2005. It is now very rare to find a biennial in the city, and of course there is no guarantee that it will be around in perpetuity. In the 1990s and early 2000s the biennial was the locus of a kind of meta-exhibitionary structure that today is finding its place, but in the last two decades of the process, the locus of a kind of curatorial meta-exhibitionary structure has shifted. There is a tendency for curators to engage with the curatorial functions of art, but also, in the last decade, a tendency to bury these in a pile and to produce works that are not works in the exhibitionary sense, but curatorial sorts of works that</text>

When the biennial closed, other curatorial departments also began to experiment with different strategies for the exhibition of historical art, or at least I found that these artists were experimenting with different strategies for archiving.For the last Venice Biennale, the Biennale started to experiment with different strategies for the distribution of the art, which was partly influenced by the increasing accessibility of archival materials. For example, in the years immediately after the Biennale opened, a lot of artists from the city started to posthumously commissioning collections from other places. This is a new phenomenon. Previously, biennials only commissioned works from the city, and small collections from other places. Nowadays, artists from other cities are also commissioning works from the city, and even works from other museums. This is not quite as overt as it is in museums, but it is becoming more and more common. New curatorial tendencies are also developing in other places, such as the art fairs and the cultural districts.</text>

As biennials have become more institutionalised and nationalised, the role of the art gallery has become even more restricted. When I found a biennial that was well-regarded internationally, such as in New York, Toronto or Venice, I began to wonder whether there was some kind of curatorial strategy that could be adapted to other locations. For example, in the early 1990s, when I started working for the Venice Biennale, the Biennale Director Giuseppe Armani was also the director of the Performing Arts Centre in Oslo.5  When I started my research on the Performing Arts Centre, I discovered that Armani had commissioned Arsenale of Asia, which was then run by the Oslo School of Arts and Culture.

The curatorial departments of major biennials were starting to experiment with different formats of archiving. When the biennial was formed in 1994, its first president, Carol Ann Duffy, made a commitment to develop an annual archival strategy. She also announced that the museum collections would be the focus of the biennial, and that the biennial would establish a permanent, dedicated collection of public and art-historical art, made up of permanent exhibitions, short-term, curatorial curatorial interventions and—later—institutional collections. The biennial would also establish a permanent, dedicated museum collections department, which would preserve and promote the collection strategies of the previous biennial presidents. These changes were clearly scheduled to change—biennial presidents tend to have longer-term projects—but the biennial kept evolving, adding and subtracting museum collections, instituting multi-year, curatorial curatorial interventions, and eventually the permanent, dedicated museum collections department. The key was that the biennial would always have a clear, focused and responsive mission statement that articulated the goals and means of the biennale as a whole</text>

    propose a biennial based on AI that adopts 'big data' to analyse cultural trends across North and South America and the Middle East and beyond, and to produce a textual record that celebrates the infrastructural evolution of the contemporary condition.The potential of infrastructural ecosystems has recently been realized in the international trade of vehicles and components. The popularity of electric vehicles has increased dramatically in North America and Europe, and is predicted to double in size in China. It is predicted that in the first half of this century, a significant number of Chinese cars will be electric and autonomous, joining the ranks of the luxury car, sports car, jet and even mini-van brands. In the United States, the market for used cars is expected to double between 2015 and 2020, with an additional 200,000 vehicles expected to be sold on the secondary market between those years.

The infrastructural turn toward electric mobility will almost certainly accelerate in the next few years, as new infrastructure projects are built and autonomous-vehicle programmes rolled out. In addition to the increased number of plug-in vehicles on the road, autonomous-vehicle programmes are also expected to replace drivers in the vast majority of cases in which passengers do not need to be replaced. In the coming years, this may well include taxi and limousine driving. In addition to saving time and reducing congestion, autonomous-vehicle programmes may reduce pollution and increase efficiency, making the city more livable in perpetuity. In Seoul, for example, the city is developing a plan to build a total of eight autonomous-vehicle parks by 2040, with a goal of providing free parking for all but a few hundred cars a day. The aim is to provide free parking for every car, every morning, every week, and into the future. This may be called the ‘100,000,000,000,000 Challenge’. The challenge is to design an autonomous-vehicle that maximises the utility of all the electricity, water, gas</text>

The infrastructural turn toward electric mobility will almost certainly accelerate in the next few years, as new infrastructure projects are built and autonomous-vehicle programmes rolled out. It is predicted that by 2030, a quarter of all new car sales will be done in autonomous mode, an increase of over 200%. This is expected to double the current car market, which is dominated by large carmakers, and will almost certainly quadruple the current market for used cars.The infrastructural turn toward autonomous mobility is expected to affect all sectors of the transport and logistics system, from the factory to the city, and will likely double the current role of cities. Although some may argue that this is simply not happening fast enough for the ecological and climatic impacts to be realized, it is clear that in the coming years, the climate-controlled zone around the car will likely become the new Wild West. Already, the climate-controlled zone around the car is becoming increasingly remote, with cars expected to roam far beyond the city limits of Calgary in the coming years.

The infrastructural turn toward electric mobility will almost certainly accelerate in the next few years, as new infrastructure projects are built and autonomous-vehicle programmes rolled out across major cities. The question is, will the infrastructural industry revert to its natural path of infrastructural adoption, or will it reform itself as autonomous-vehicle producers launch new initiatives? Weighing all these factors, it is easy to see why the market for used cars and parts is so essential to the infrastructural industry: a car sold in a city is a car, and any damage done to it is a cost that cannot be ignored. It is also easy to see why a city's infrastructural landscape is so critical to its economic survival: if a city is left to itself, with little more than parking lots and vacant lots, a major impact on demand would be felt. The infrastructural landscape is a particular point of convergence for many differentiating factors. It is a set of social relations that are produced and negotiated by, and are negotiated against, the backdrop of, an industry that is itself a product of the city.</text>

The infrastructural turn toward electric mobility will almost certainly accelerate in the next few years, as new infrastructure projects are built and autonomous-vehicle programmes rolled out. In addition to aesthetic imperatives, autonomous-vehicle programmes are also premised on the production of ever-more energy-efficient vehicles that are lighter, more fuel-efficient and more spacious, as well as the development of self-healing roofs and composites that last longer and are more weather-resistant. The capacity of infrastructural infrastructures to support autonomous-vehicle programmes is also expected to double in the next five years, to reach 860,000 vehicles annually. The capacity of art galleries to react in a similar way is yet to be determined.Art has a long and nuanced legal and public-policy position on autonomous vehicles, with its own understanding of the public sphere varying widely and varying depending on who you ask. In 1965, for instance, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the New York City gallery could not host a protest against the city's illegal expansion of the legal right to drive, since the gallery had not created a public place in</text>

The infrastructural turn toward electric mobility will almost certainly accelerate in the next few years, as new infrastructure projects are built and autonomous-vehicle programmes rolled out. At the same time, the proliferation of connected cars will intensify, as manufacturers coordinate their production, marketing and sales strategies around the information available on the cars' electronic dashboards. The proliferation of connected cars will also likely intensify in places like Detroit, as autonomous-vehicle programmes there integrate data from dozens or even hundreds of sensors into the vehicle's chassis, including data on the driver’s commute, travel habits, and more.The widespread adoption of autonomous-vehicle programmes will almost certainly lead to an increase in pollution levels. As we all know, the adoption of self-driving cars has been a hotly contested issue in California, and early research suggests that such cars may actually cause more pollution than their researchers intended. On the other hand, autonomous-vehicle programmes have also been accused of causing massive amounts of black-hole pollution, trapping huge amounts of carbon in the form of huge vortices of mercury in the atmosphere, and fuelling the growth of giant synthetic black-</text>

In addition, autonomous-vehicle programmes are being set up in North and South Korea, where electric and plug-in hybrids are common, and in Israel, where autonomous-car programmes are also common.It is predicted that by the middle of this century, a fully autonomous car will be able to drive itself, replacing human drivers altogether. It will be driven by algorithms, monitoring road and traffic conditions, and collecting data from sensors in the car including radar, radars, speed and tire pressure, along with data on the car’s interior materials and emissions. Charging a car with electricity will be as simple as plugging it in, and will be unnecessary between now and then. Thus the infrastructural turn will enable a radically different mode of travel for many people, and it will almost certainly lead to a radical change in the nature of the car itself. But in the coming years, we should also be able to change the way in which the car is driven.</text>

The infrastructural turn will not only make life easier for car owners, but will also help to power future social transformations. The question that remains is what to do with the surplus of knowledge accumulated from the infrastructural turn. In my opinion, the answer to this quixotic quest is knowledge production, and the means to share that knowledge with one another. We need to create an ecosystem of sharing, as a mutual aid society.Reading lists is an act of going back to the roots of a given knowledge, gathering knowledge that has been gathered in a particular place and at a particular moment. It is not searching for knowledge that has been gathered elsewhere or is otherwise lost.

New infrastructural developments will be necessary to contain and handle this surge of new mobility modes, but their current level of adoption is questionable, while the infrastructural turn does not seem to be paying off in terms of the quality of life or even in terms of the quantity of livable territory. What is needed is a more robust infrastructural turn, coupled with a public-private partnership that would see new developments realised in the context of publics – not in the private companies of Silicon Valley but in the publics of surrounding neighbourhoods. This would require new technologies and infrastructural turn, but it would also require a new public-private partnership that would see publics formed, not of technology but of people. The level of public involvement in the development of autonomous-vehicle programmes would have to be</text>

Aims such as these are intended to ensure that when possible but unable to achieve clear objectives, the public is protected. It is a mixed blessing that so many people work for the World Health Organization and other health-related professions, and for a living, fulfilling profession that demands a high standard of professionalism and ethical conduct. But the prevalence of harmful professions and the harmful professions that people try to replace them with is also determined by economic development and political instability. Politicians build hospitals and schools and recruit teachers to run volunteerism-based organisations, but the economies of health and social development that underpin the health-care and social-service systems tend to collapse in on themselves.

The pattern recognizer in its many guisesThe second aspect to ‘infrastructure change’ refers to the mechanisms and practices that enable collaborative, collaborative and interactive new modes of interaction between people, objects and data. These modes help to redefine what is considered ‘normal’ and what is considered ‘artificial’ in the world. For instance, the World Trade Center was brought down by a terrorist act using lightweight, thermite-resistant bricks and mortar, and explosive precursors, but the identities of the architects and designers of the design processes that resulted in the jet fuel that fueled those buildings are kept secret. New media can be used to create transparency and accountability, but this only happens when there is an understanding and trust between the participants and the end users. The participation and involvement of the public is crucial when considering new technologies and infrastructures, but it is equally critical to ensure that the decisions that are being made do not result in the empowerment of</text>

The push for access to resources and infrastructure outside of western capitalist societies is usually accompanied by a thinly disguised call for ‘human biodiversity’, which is often combined with an explicit demand for ‘ecocide’.4 The combination of cheap labour with resource-rich western societies coupled with ecological debt and the resulting environmental degradation is common to all of these various anthropogenic contributions. In the case of western capitalism today, the environmental degradation is particularly acute. The extraordinary growth of population in the west during the past</text>

In almost every country where protests have become a serious problem, the authorities have resorted to using legal means to disperse protesters. In Egypt, police regularly use water cannons and batons to disperse crowds demonstrating against police violence, and peaceful ‘restaurants, cafes and other social venues’ have been used as targets by the security forces. In 2011 alone, at least 200,000 people took to the streets in Cairo and other cities in an ‘anti-Mubarak’ demonstration. In February 2012, the ‘Arab Spring’ movement began after the military deposed democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi, sparking violent anti-government protests. The movement spread to other cities in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe, but was quickly hijacked by armed extremists. In response, the military government established a ‘Free Shaheeh’ Twitter account</text>

For instance, the World Trade Organization has mandated that certain trade dress must be maintained in a professional or political standard, but if not observed, such behaviour is considered ‘unfair’ and can result in penalties.3 In addition, the general public is encouraged to adopt ‘a collective attitude to pollution’. This is generally understood as the ‘need to know’ imperative of any new technological culture, but it is more widely attributed to the ‘new’ thinking embodied in the ‘big data’ revolution.4 The proliferation of global communication networks, and the consequent pressure to always know more, has brought with it unprecedented access to ever greater amounts of data.

In most cases, these protesters were seen as potential sources of information about health and safety, and the professions that they lead, or might lead, has often been seen as a necessary retreat from politics and social dynamics. Along with the numerous grants and contributions that followed, this initiative marks a genuine shift from the ‘real medicine’ that had traditionally addressed medical needs and concerns, and the more mainstream medical professions generally. 	The proposal was also supported by a substantial funding base, which allowed the medical and scientific communities to better understand and address the issues raised by the Documenta initiative. These include direct academic support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as grants from the European Commission (EC) and the UK’s Humanities Cities Program. These bodies provide funding for specific projects, which can include ‘research projects in the social dimension’, as well</text>

What is the next frontier for collaborative research and what kind of impact will it have? This is the question that future citizens of the web must address. Future citizens are those online users who have accessed the web in the past, and whose behaviour and behaviour-generative potential is comparable to that of humans. Future-proofing is a critical first step in any cultural or social change, but it falls far short of providing the long-term solution. A critical second step is needed, and that is the creation of fully operational ‘platforms’ – autonomous software tools or operating systems that control how content is presented and accessed.3  Such platforms would replace the need for native apps or users to install third-party applications onto their computers, and would also remove</text>

These latent technologies were applied to annotate documents or images of events such as protests or natural disasters, and even to insert images or annotated text that point to specific features or events within the text or image. For instance, the World Health Organization recommends that health workers always have and always use protective gear, but if a protester is demonstrating in a public place, the health workers might adopt a defensive posture and divert their efforts to deal with the threat from behind the barricades. Instead, the World Health Organization recommends that health workers ‘immediately and completely remove themselves from the scene, and call for an ambulance or other medical assistance if necessary’.2 The emergence of bio- and robot-based image and text annotation is often cited as a sign that new technologies are allowing for the annotation of text and images anywhere in the text or image. This observation is often made in relation to social media, but increasingly, it is also true for images and images of events such as protests. In a 2009 study of over 17,000 photographs, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of California, Berkeley found that the types of graffiti found on university campuses were being written ‘very simply and naturally’ using specialized text and image processing software.3 In a related study, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Xerox PARC found that the types of graffiti found on the web were similarly being generated using text and image processing.4 While these two studies suggest that graffiti has a social context, their applications lie elsewhere. While images and images can be classified as disruptive, they are more often generated in response to a perceived breach</text>

The annotation and redesign processAs human-computer interfaces became more sophisticated, the role of the designer became more ambiguous. A user interface designer might design a program that performs some operations on data – texts, images, shapes – but the real question became how those operations are executed. In the 1990s and early 2000s, computer scientists started to apply this kind of programming to images and text, but the main applications of this kind of interface design remain applications that rely on data – data that is, in turn, constantly increasing in quality and quantity. In the smartphone industry, the main use of image processing today is in self-parking cars; in healthcare apps, algorithms help doctors diagnose conditions more accurately; and in social media, algorithms help connect disparate sources of information across platforms. Such algorithms also help manage information resources, such as news feeds, social media platforms, and data centres, that support and depend on the development of political, economic and social systems.

    The postponed 2021 Biennial has been moved up to mid-2018, with the hope that the new construction companies will be able to start work on the stadium in April 2019. The new construction companies will be run by the city council and the PR firm of Dentons, Hill &amp; Knowlton. The council will own the stadium and will have complete ownership rights. The PR firm will have complete ownership rights. The council will decide what to do with the stadium, but the PR firm will determine what to do with the community. The decision to either invest in the stadium or to hold community events in the stadium will be made by the PR firm.

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied: &quot;That would be a mistake. That would be against everything we stand for. We wouldn't do that. It would undermine the whole purpose of Doncaster Council and the whole purpose of the Biennial as a whole. It would be a big mistake.&quot;Denny was speaking days after a local community organisation, Doncaster Residents Organisation (DENA), proposed that the Biennial relocate to another part of the city, because of a lack of interest there. The proposals were rejected. Although the proposal was put forward by a local people's organisation, the Biennial ultimately decided not to take part in the ‘ongoing dialogue about where to be located’ that DENA had started. Instead, the Biennial has continued to operate in Doncaster, although now lives in a converted bakery building on the banks of the Don. Although the proposal was put forward by a local people’s organisation, the Biennial ultimately decided not to take part in the ‘ongoing</text>

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied:  The owners will own the stadium and will decide what to do with it. If the owners want to turn it into a school, they can do that, but that’s not their stadium. It’s a different stadium with a different set of rights. In the future, I might want to look at turning the stadium into a housing development, because that’s where a lot of the residents live.

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied: &quot;I don’t want to say what the outcome of such a process would be, but I can say this: given the mandate given to me by the council, I will do whatever the council says is necessary to ensure that, as far as possible, the stadium is used for community activities.&quot;Denny has clearly got the message. The Biennial has since then repeatedly asked what the council would do with the stadium, and has now set out a masterplan for the whole city around the building. It is clear that the Biennial has concluded that the city is not just a site to be ‘used’ but that the council is now determined to put in place a vision of how the stadium will be used (including its future use) beyond just the immediate redevelopment of the site. The masterplan has a clear call to redevelop the entire city around the stadium, a vision that clearly separates the development of the stadium as an entity into those two distinct ‘use cases’</text>

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied:I don’t think so. I’ve always thought the stadium should be a collective responsibility. The city and the district should be able to say what’s best for the area. I just don’t think we have that in place yet.  	The decision to invest in the stadium in the early stages of the project has political and economic motivations, but the decision to create a community trust to own the stadium is a genuine creative way to give back control to the people to improve the area. The decision to invest in the community rather than the stadium itself is a further testament to the power of non-profit action.  	The decision to invest in the community as a whole rather than just in a specific area of the city is another testament to the power of non-profit action.  	The decision to create a Community Land Trust to own the stadium reflects the belief that a stadium can be a collective asset rather than a solely a given resource</text>

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied:I can't say whether that would happen or not. We will see what happens. The way we are operating now, there is a risk that certain buildings could be put under threat.  Whether that is the case or not, there is a risk to the city ‘s future ability to deliver for its citizens’, which is why the Biennales have been so important since the 1990s. The fact that the Biennale is the only form of cultural exchange occurring within Cross-Channel is a significant intervention into the public realm. The Biennale has become the official cultural venue of the city, and the city has become a major exchange point between the world of visible capital and that of visible labour.  It may be the case that, in the distant future, a multidisciplinary, multi-purpose, multi-edition, multi-edition art gallery might be desirable to redevelop the historic role of the biennale, but right now the biennale is the</text>

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied:This is a risk that I take very seriously. I have to tell the story over and over again because it is an incredibly powerful way to tell the story. But there is also a risk that if we do this again, people will say, ‘That was us.’ That is a powerful way to end a process, but it is risky. I’m not saying it is, nor am I saying it is not possible. But I do believe that we have to be conscious of the fact that some people ‘get it’ and that that is a big part of the process.This is part of a longer interview in which the artist discusses his fascination with the postindustrial and the urban, and his involvement with the Liverpool Biennial.Interview conducted by Annie Barrett and Anne Kølbæk Iversen for BBC Future's The Big Short series.

At the end of the process, the decisions about which buildings to renovate or to demolish will be made by the PR firm. When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied:If a developer comes along and proposes to take over a building and to renovate it in some way, then the council has to have a discussion with the developer about whether the town is ready for that. I’m not in the business of making decisions for the people, but the decision has to be based on a discussion with MPs and the courts. If not, then there is a risk that the project will not happen. […]The city is doing a good thing by creating a trust to own the stadium, but the problem with that is that the trust is a land-grant institution, and thus, as the stadium is a building, it becomes a land-use tool that can be used for whatever ends justify its growth. Sometimes the land-use tool itself does not belong to the city, but to a company that profits from its rental. For example, in the 1970s and 80s, developers used eminent domain to take over public parks and forests; now,</text>

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied:I don’t think so. I don’t think so either. I’m so glad you asked me that question. It’s very interesting that you asked me that because I’m thinking about that now. I’m thinking about it very different from when I first started. I’m thinking about the future, and the way the stadium is going: it’s becoming a tourist attraction, and I think it’s becoming a liability. Also, I’m thinking about the past, because there’s a big difference between when I first started and when I’m finished. I’m interested in how things were done then, and how things are going now.That’s an interesting perspective on things from another place. It’s also an interesting perspective from a place that’s experiencing the same thing. The Biennale’s current situation is a case in point</text>

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied: &quot;I haven’t thought about that. The council will own the stadium and will have complete ownership rights.&quot;The implications of this radical approach to ownership are profound. The stadium is the site of the football club’s games, and the PR firm representing the club will increasingly own the stadium as a venue for those games. As a result of this, fans will increasingly feel like tenants in the building and have significant rights over their property. However, the implications for the city are equally significant. The stadium is a site of social interaction and cultural exchange, and the PR firm is increasingly able to shape what is said and written about it. The ability of the PR firm to shape discourse and cultural outcomes is a powerful negotiating tool. As a result of this, the stadium is becoming ever more like other sites in the city – including becoming a site of anti-social activity – and the local community is increasingly alienated by the game. In an attempt to address this, a variety of community groups</text>

When asked about this potentially disastrous scenario, Denny replied: ‘I’m not in a position to say what the plans are or who makes them.’ In other words, the owners of the stadium don’t own the stadium and can do what they please with it. 	[6] As for the future of Anfield, the city council has promised to restore the building to its former glory, although what that might look like remains unclear. Denny asked: ‘Do you expect to see a redeveloped Anfield in 2040?’[7] Andrea Phillips, the architect whose design the Biennial used to commission, has a gloomy vision for what lies ahead: ‘It’s going to be a very different kind of urbanisation.’[8] The question remains whether the Biennial, which promised to tell the story of Anfield through engaging with its past, is instead planning on becoming a catalyst for an even bigger regeneration process, a fairly significant expansion of the city�</text>

Behrens 	Introduction 	In the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring, a critical mass of artists and curators began to assemble in Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, Egypt, for the ongoing Art and Architecture Festival, which gathered together with the many exhibitionary projects that emerged during that year, provided a platform to engage with the question: how to inhabit and perhaps reanimate historical materiality and processes through art’s own fundamental architecture and engineering? 	In the wake of these projects, a movement to collect and archive is building globally. 	In this interview, artist, activist and archivist Heather A. Behrens reflects on the 2011 Arab Spring and the subsequent work of the nascent biennials, their emergence as platforms for social and political change worldwide, and their ongoing engagement with the materiality of artefacts and bodies. 	What does it mean to make architecture and materiality return to the archipelagos and continents of the present, as we understand it? 	This is a very exciting and beautiful question, and a starting point for a new world order of materiality, sometimes called ‘materiality without borders’.

Behrens 	Introduction 	In the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring, a critical mass of artists and curators began to assemble in Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, Egypt, for the ongoing Art and Architecture Festival, which gathered together with the many exhibition formats that followed it became the foundation of what came to be known as the Doha Initiative. The term ‘architecture archive’ quickly acquired currency in these corridors of influence, and now referred to anything that can be dated or archived. It is a posture that seeks to preserve or recall elements of a past that are no longer aligned with the modernist narrative of the contemporary urban space. 	At the same time, however, there is a danger that an archaeological dig may yet yield narratives that align with those in power, or those seeking to rewrite the past as much as aligning with modernism.

The term ‘architecture’ has been bandied about synonymously with  	immaterial, intangible, temporary and transient, but is this accurate or is it just an urban myth? Let’s start with the former. 	As architects and aesthetes of the Arab Spring, we’re faced with the challenge of coming to terms with the break with the past in an otherwise devastated region. The spread of instability and violence across the region has put us on alert for potential terrorist attacks. In Doha, we’re learning that the city is falling to pieces. We’re losing population centers, and the archaeological remains that’re left testify to the fact that this process is permanent. In Cairo, we’re learning that our city is coming apart at the seams. We’re losing the war on terror, as the Doha</text>

Behrens 	Introduction 	In the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring, a critical mass of artists and curators began to assemble in Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, Egypt, for the ongoing Art and Architecture Festival, which gathered together with the many exhibitionary formats that emerged afterwards – from the scruffy street level of the US gallery, to the high-end venues of the European museum – gathered momentum towards a more precise and sustainable recording of the events of that year. 	The Doha Biennial has been around since 2007, drawing artists from all over the world, but its current form reflects the era in which the city is no longer the center of its collective imagination. 	In 2017, the Biennial in Liverpool, England, host to a star-studded book club, will host the first in a two-year series of episodes exploring art’s potential impacts on society and the environment. In 2018, the Biennial in New York, United States, slated to host multiple episodes, will host the first in a three-year series exploring art’s potential effects on the planet. Curators, artists and artists’ groups began noticing a change in the volume and pace of the archive tours they delivered</text>

I was invited to lead a curatorial tour of the newly reconfigured Al Asmakh Quarter, Al Wakf, Al Quds and Al Binaa districts, and to be a part of the Arabic section of the new satellite museum, Al Binaa Al Thaqafiya, to be built on the site of the old Al Jumu'a biennial. The new museum, curated by Nasser Rabb, will house objects from the archive of the Palestinian People’s Palestinian National Liberation Front (PPFL), including hundreds of objects selected from the possession of the Palestinian Centre for Documentation and History of Palestine (PCHR). The Palestinian and Arab sections of the new museum will be united by a common interest in the Palestinian narrative of the uprising and its place in global cultural history.

Behrens 	Introduction 	In the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring, a critical mass of artists and curators began to assemble in Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, Egypt, for the ongoing Art and Architecture Festival, which gathered together with the many exhibitionary formats that followed its theme, became the foundation of what came to be known as the Doha Initiative. These newly minted institutions of art and architecture, which were initially organized around the use of art as a political tool, soon began to inquire into the broader political implications of art, its social and cultural effects, and its relationship to contemporary society. 	As 2014 drew to a close, it became increasingly clear that this ‘episodic’ format would not, by itself, provide the cover story for an ongoing series of major cultural institutions from the region that year in New York and Istanbul, to be followed in 2017 in Doha. So, in the months and years that followed, many curators from the larger disciplines of architecture and art history, whose works would have been incorporated into the series, created parallel initiatives, including in-depth studies of specific artists and their works, as well as works exploring the political and archival contexts of their work.

The current volume of the journal  	Fall/Winter, 2016 contains an extensive survey of the movement towards an alternative spatial and collective future for the city’s archives, which is often misconstrued as an alternative to the city’s current predicament.[1] Like the other curators who have participated in and are currently part of the A.E.S. consortium, Behrens will contribute to the ongoing series of essays on the St Petersburg Museum of Modern Art’s (SMMM) collection, The Contemporary Condition, published by Liverpool University Press. In September 2017, she will participate in the second part of the Liverpool Biennial’s ‘An Astronomy Workshop: Art and Politics in the Context of Astronomy’, co-ed with Nasser Rabb and Paul Butler, entitled Politics and Art in the Early Modern Period’.[2] Behren</text>

The festival’s title, then, registered its critical distance from classical notions of art and architecture: ‘art’ was seen as a political and social statement. In the years that followed, critics such as Waimaratás, Professor Amareswar Galla and Elliott Hartog found great artistic and curatorial interest in the festival, while Persa s own interview on the festival displayed a nuanced and nuanced engagement with its significance and origins. 	In these years, the festival enjoyed a critical mass of diverse curators, artists, writers, architects and activists from across the globe, many of whom came from the field of architecture and urbanisation, including from the fields of art, architecture and urbanisation themselves.

Between the first Biennial, in 1991, and the present, a precious few remaining installations from the event are set to be rediscovered and repurposed. This retrospective, to be led by the curators from the UA’s Faculty of Architecture, will examine in-depth the spatial and temporal characteristics of the modern museum, while also highlighting some of the more abstract and mythical characteristics of the form. It will attempt to articulate an ‘architecture of absence’, or ‘the myth of the empty museum’, in the service of the political, economic, and social exclusion and oppression of peoples. Unlike its predecessors,</text>

The project's title, then, seemed anachronistic, even ridiculous: the remnants of a bygone age. Then, in early 2016, Egypt transitioned from a military junta to an elected national legislature, and new governments were elected, one of which was elected to lead a new phase of political transition. The constituent parts of this new government were then sworn in, and new rules were amended, opening the way for a period of political inroads. While the legislative body itself was slow to act, the public attention soon shifted to the cities, particularly the historic districts, which were soon to bear the brunt of this new government's policies. 	Since the beginning of 2016, as events in Egypt converged with those in Qatar, art projects throughout the region that were established in response to the crisis in the region were forced to reconsider their strategies, choosing</text>
