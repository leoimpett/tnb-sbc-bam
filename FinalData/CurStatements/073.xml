(p. 1028)As we have seen, the biennial has become much more than a venue for art to be displayed and perhaps even a proposition itself, now that it is often art that is displayed and not always accepted at face value. It is now an objective, global phenomenon, and exhibits are often intimately tied to financial flows. Biennials are, in effect, the international versions of their host countries; and the artworks are then often transported between the two. We would do well to revisit Moores’ chapter in his book, since we would see how the importance of this is today.Download this article as PDFMichael TruscelloDr. Michael Truscello is an assistant professor in English and General Education at Mount</text>

In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that the geographical tendency is further and more inexorable than any other. The museum is the geographical limit, and whilst it may sometimes happen that the museum is recalled from its historical position, it is quite unnecessary in the vast scheme of things.’ [emphasis added] Today, the museum is often described as being embedded in the community, although this is misleading. The impression one gets from visiting museums is that the museum is everywhere, and in many places, completely invisible. Moores’ definition of the biennial is vague, and his is the only writing that seems to address the topic. I would interpret his statement as both a request and a threat. The biennial is an event that can be captured and absorbed into any local culture, and so capturing it and incorporating it into one’s own cultural practice is precisely what artists, curators and artists' groups do. It is a way to begin to think about, and perhaps create, a ‘bienniality�</text>

In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that this movement towards the great universal, the common good, is a reaction to the old, pre-scientific century … the industrial age … which saw the singular at the expense of the immeasurable.’[7]The biennial is an artefact of the industrial age, and with it the end of the age, since the biennial is the last to be erected on such a site. But the end is not necessarily the disappearance of the art form; art forms may be reassigned and amended through the dynamic, even chaotic, interaction of competing aesthetics and agendas. And this is what art forms do today: they relocate, change location, engage with changing audiences, and engage with changing circumstances. So while the biennial may no longer claim to represent the art form as a whole, its place in the world may nevertheless have to grow in accordance with an evolving aesthetic. This growth may be slow, but it may also be rapid enough to permit art to be made in</text>

In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that, as soon as the war was over, the revolutionary designs which had made such a marked impression on the imagination of the younger generation of artists would again be seeking reformation by every means available to it. Current attempts to reanimate cultural  	images, to reanimate them according to social convention, to this day bears the unmistakable mark of the inspirationator. And this despite the obvious fact that such efforts have every reason to break new ground today, especially when the circumstances are such as those described by Moores. In the past, a biennial was a museum with curatorial skills as an art form, offering a guided, one-stop shop for an artist to work through a set of themes in a work that would address a specific audience. Today, a biennial is a museum with no formal curatorial skills, but a museum with the power to influence and shape what becomes known through its content, knowledge and influence. The new museum should offer both, the curatorial</text>

In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that the spirit of the biennial has returned to America.The spirit of the biennial remains at large in both the historical and the cinematic. And the spirit of the biennial continues to be a form that reproduces itself through the art events that it enables, that it legitimises through its institutionalised life in culturally significant places. After the Venice Biennale in 1997, the biennial became synonymous with the contemporaneous, and the museum became the object of mass consumption. But the very idea of the museum as a space for reflection and recurrence in art events that become contemporaneous with artistic practices everywhere else in the world—where art, or at least a kind of art, is thought to occur—is a fiction. The biennial could, of course, do with updating its title, and updating its procedures, but its current framing of artistic activities everywhere else in the world through a kind of symbiosis with art and commerce is a fiction as well. In fact, the opposite</text>

In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that the new interest in and love of the ordinary man will be directed (like every other) at the earliest intimations of the lover, and his stages of development; and like all forms of popular veneration, it will be overwhelmingly male.3 It is now common to find biennials exhibiting a mixture of love and violence, or at least showing violence in a more moderate and less conspicuous way. The most recent edition of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biennial, which opened in New York and London this past March, offered a number of programmes that invited artists to commit to artistic projects up to and including the ultimate destruction of human life. The destruction of human life, as the organisers of the festival itself now wish, is not what artists do well, it is what artists do poorly. And while it is true that today many biennials exhibit works that are more readily available online than in museums or galleries, this is hardly the experience of the young person coming</text>

In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that the year to come will be crowned with the appearance of yet another biennial, no matter how many previous biennials there may be in existence. The nineteenth one will be the twentieth; the twentieth with the appearance of the thirtieth will be the twenty-first. The nineteenth will be the last. (p.91)There are of course better ways to do this, and the author does have good reasons for his or her position. But it is worth remembering that, while the biennial became a thing, it was only a thing because there were biennials, and then only in the US. There was also a movement to the biennial, begun in the US in the 1970s by the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and then spread to other cities. Moores would not be the first to claim this as a primary reason to exist, but his book is an argument against that. It is a reason to share, to</text>

In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that the future wanted [the] remembrance of John Moores, and that its design should be remembered. And so it remains. We can say that the museum is the contemporary incarnation of the biennial, and the biennial is the museum, or perhaps we can reclaim what is perhaps meant by the word ‘biennialism’. In the contemporary biennialism, the biennial is the collection, but the biennial is now more than just an exhibitionary form: it is a contemporary museum that presents in its curatorial hand the stories of people who are part of the curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial cur</text>

The biennial has become the museum, and the museum is the exhibition. Cross-cultural exhibitions, such as the recent Liverpool Biennial, which also featured works from the museum, are now part of a larger museum of contemporary art, if it is to be called such, which it most certainly is not. A new museum should also open on the site of the old, which is currently occupied by a large building for which no clear use is shown any concern. Such is the ethos of the biennial today, though perhaps the author, John Moores, in his book of 14 Leaves from 1916, would disagree. In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that the greatest frauds of modern times have been imported into the modern world through the perforated form of the biennial. These imported spirituals are the offspring of a foreign culture, ‘a dark warp and a woof’, which has crept into a land and culture and is thus a threat to the polity that stands against it. The perforated form of the biennial, Moores continues, is a threat because it requires no specialist art resources to be constructed—a threat because it is not culturally responsive, and thus cannot serve as a counterweight to the prevailing forces of culture, religion and power. All art, he writes, is therefore cultural in its own right.Art, then, may play a part in modernity, but it is not necessarily a sufficient condition. Modernity, he continues, requires a cultural substrate that is responsive to the needs of the people it is modernizing. The modern world is technologically modern, in other words, and</text>

In that book, Moores writes: there can be no doubt but that the second chapter of this ‘book’ will be devoted to the exploits of Lieutenant Colonel William Roberts, who took the name William Roberts after the Battle of Iwo Jima and will be remembered by history as the hero of the Allied Powers. Moores ends his account with a poem: ‘The poem ends with a quote from Lieutenant Colonel William Roberts, who declared, with characteristic understatement, that his name was David—for, of course, he knew how to quote.’[4] David Johnson, Six O'Clock’s Sloan Science Fiction, p. 217.Download this article as PDFDavid Johnson is a writer, director, and producer.

His interest in the contemporary art market has been written about often enough (e.g. in the book he wrote with Patrick McDonnell called ‘Us and Them’) and it is worth noting that the name Ar-Thérèse (short for Assembleement Arsenale – Together We Are Arsenale) is a trademark of the Paris-based company that is now KKW: Lanthier Kübler-Ross, a subsidiary company of Swiss watchmaker, Basler Wristwear Corporation.

The survey revealed that the purpose of the museum, as it stood, was commercial, but Ar-Thérèse had taken the opportunity of the massive visitor bill to launch a small but sustained online art-per-installation business, selling framed works of art on site. The framed works were framed works of art, in art stores, and in commercial galleries around the world. The Arsenale, on the other hand, was a place to acquire works in progress, to revisit favourites, and to sample new things. The sudden, unexpected turn of events in the local community, which suddenly saw an all-new purpose-built museum built in the neighbourhood, only amplified the community’s desire for self-expression and collective</text>

His interest in the commercialisation of art came from a simple insight into the nature of commodity fetishism, which he found particularly galling: the way in which the museum was being funded at the time, and the fact that the majority of the exhibits were of museum-quality only, museum-quality items – the kind that only a museum could purchase. The shape of the museum as a commodity, and the aesthetic as a commodity, came as a revelation to him. The gallerist, the buyer, the seller, and the museum all operate in different worlds, but the very notion of the museum came as a revelation to him. It is the form that assumes a different sensuality, and the museum becomes something else entirely. 	So the museum was seen</text>

In 2011, he opened the newly renovated, much needed Museum of Modern Art, New York, which he describes as ‘a museum of modern art’, which, like the rest of his work, is a ‘museum of the future’.1  The Museum of Modern Art was a catalyst for a number of technological innovations, including the development of satellite imagery, data capture and streaming, and sound recording and much more. These were, in turn, a response to the cultural marginalisation of artists and the marginalisation of artists’ communities.  	Sound recording and streaming became ubiquitous, and artists, including those from the avant-garde</text>

Ar-Thérèse’s interest in the contemporary art market is also evident in his exploration of cultural flows.

The exhibition in New York and Los Angeles, on the other hand, was a re-enactment of the history of the art fair, with a civic purpose and a function in and through the civic. The Biennale attempted to return to the basics of what the museum traditionally offered, while injecting a bit of contemporary art practice into the mix. This is what the new curator might do. 	The biennale itself is a re-enactment of the first Venice Biennale, but this time with a civic purpose: to bring together, as many disparate disciplines, parts that were once in direct contact, and thus the seed of contemporary</text>

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial may have been hidden from view, but its cultural significance lingers. The exhibition that opened the second half of the century heralded a new aestheticised form of art and culture, punctured the old regime of the artist as an artist of the sublime, and ushered in a new era of cultural relativism. But the real kicker was the opening day ‘cassavaise’, when the entire history of the Biennial was writ large in a single image. It signaled the end of an era, and ushered in a new start for the city and its art world. Now the challenge is to recycle the exhibition as a curatorial tool across multiple sites in the city in an ever-expanding, ever more visible public realm. This would mean enabling live-action video and installations, as well as new media such as podcasts and social media.

The city is your canvas, your city, and its spaces are a canvas, which you can apply painterly skills to. But these are just general tips on how to start building long-term relationships with other cultural sectors. What works for one site may not work for another, and vice versa. You need to work with people from different disciplines and have different skillsets. For instance, you can't paint buildings from three perspectives, but you can learn how to set up a workshop with other art historians to paint buildings in a different way. You need to understand how perception works, and how to use that knowledge to your advantage.I hope you can join us. If you can come, let me suggest some things to consider in advance, based on what I heard you say at the convention in September:What can the artist do to make</text>

The current incarnation, the second one in October, is very much a ‘branding exercise’, using the same themes and techniques, but with an urban spin. It is a repetition of the themes and techniques used in the mid-nineteenth-century English artist William Burroughs’ Manifesta 14, but with an extra dash of social critique thrown in. Burroughs was a leading British critic of industrial society, communism and nationalism, and he was particularly critical of the way in which artists were trained and the social function of art schools. So the similarity ends there. But there is much more going on. Burroughs was a critic of capitalism, and the ideology that it purported to represent, so the two biennales</text>

It would also mean creating a ‘city image’ through which artists could freely present their work across multiple sites, rather than having to be satisfied with appearing at a specific location.  One hopes that the new curator would learn something from this old curator, and that his or her new curatorial approach would learn something from this old curator. But it is likely that the new curator would learn something from this old curator, and that his or her old curator would both learn something from each other. This is the trade-off we are imposing upon ourselves, the choice to engage with history or to ignore it. If we do not engage with it, our choices are limited. If we create it, we will have to love it, or else we will not be able to sell it, which will be our fate. So our present curatorial approach to art must be global in scope, and must address all art forms. It is not enough for a curator to be an artist or a curator; he or she to understand that art is a complex social and economic phenomenon. A curatorial approach to art must also understand that art is</text>

One hopes, of course, that the city council will soon be able to reverse this new mayor’s decision to reinstate the ‘no burkini’ ban. As the second instalment in the Liverpool Biennial approached, tensions mounted within the city between artist-centred communities and community organisations. It was felt that the Biennial’s localised, tour-de-mande characterised curatorial approach to issues of concern to local people (like violence, poverty, homelessness) was overshadowing the city’s more nationalistic but transient curatorial approach. In an attempt to placate both audiences, the Biennial decided to have a ‘city with a point of view’ at one of its two flagship institutions, one featuring a beautiful new arts centre built on the ruins of three old city centres.  The other biennial would feature a ‘world view’ encompassing ‘all the places</text>

It would mean engaging with the notion of habit, and the fact that cities today often function as platforms for new, disruptive modes of urban existence. It would mean engaging with the notion of place in a way that is not confined to urban centres. It would mean engaging with the notion of habit and its discontents, and the ways in which new media can be used to subvert and alter such notions. It would mean engaging with the notion of habit in ways that are not confined to the sphere of aesthetics.Perhaps the single most exciting aspect of the new curatorial form has been its openness to experimentation and discovery. It is easy to dismiss the changes wrought by biennials in this era as being driven by a single, singular curator, or even the signs of a handful of curators. But there is a great deal of creativity and insight flowing through the curatorial process. It is the curatorial turn that is open to all, and this</text>

Let’s hope the Arts Council remains committed to supporting the Biennial as a unique institution, while at the same time ensuring that all artists who apply for that funding get a voice. Art’s ever expanding public sphere is a double edged sword. On the one hand, it clearly demonstrates how much the city is dependent on the biennial, and on the other, it mocks the perceived imbalances between council tax-supported arts institutions in the city and their private for-profit counterparts. Let’s hope the council continues to fund the Biennial as a non-essential, and perhaps even a subversive, part of the city’s cultural landscape. If it does, let’s hope it makes good on its word and creates a biennial that serves the city’s arts community, rather than the other way around.

    <text>The disastrous 2021 Biennial may have been hidden from view, but its cultural significance lingers. The exhibition that opened the second half of the century heralded a new aestheticised form of art and culture, punctured the old regime of the artist as an artist of the sublime, and ushered in a new era of cultural relativism. But the real kicker was the opening day ‘cassavaise’, when the entire history of the Biennial was writ large in a single image. It signaled the end of an era, and ushered in a new start for the city and its art world. Now the challenge is to recycle the exhibition as a curatorial tool across multiple sites in the city in an ever-expanding, ever more visible public realm. This would mean enabling live-action video and installations, as well as new media such as podcasts and social media. It would also mean creating a ‘city image’ through which artists could freely present their work across multiple sites, rather than having to apply for artistic licenses through the traditional art world. So far, the answer has been ‘yes’. But a future exhibition format may be required in order to fully realise this new artworld of the remote, the urban and the complex.In an ideal future world, the art world would operate on a similar logic to the airline industry: the art might not be transported from place to place but rather be embedded in highly visible cultural assets such as billboards, public domain images, websites and art museums. This would make it easier for artists to connect with audiences outside of galleries, museums and large art institutions, and would make the art more accessible for artists and the communities around them. In the near term, this may mean the reintroduction of art bargains on art websites, and the curatorial use of data to prioritize certain audiences over others. But beyond this, it could mean anything from giving a distinct slice of the pie to more equitable sharing of resources between communities, to investing in locally</text>

It would also mean creating a ‘city image’ through which artists could freely present their work across multiple sites, rather than having to seek permission from city authorities or community groups. I’m intrigued by the extra scrutiny and negotiation that community groups would have to go through in order to incorporate artworks from different eras or different places. But I also see a future where cultural production meets not just commerce, but art production. This could happen in parallel to the increasingly aestheticised form of biennials, as we age into the next ‘generation’ and the next ‘potential adopter’. I imagine a future where cultural production and their images take on a new regulatory role. That would be exciting, and perhaps possible in the near future.Diageo: I see you have ambitions beyond the Biennial. I imagine you have other interests beyond the art of making people feel good about themselves. We could also talk about the role that art has in supporting community activities, and how art can be an aid in negotiating the complex social and economic situations that face the community.D.

This would mean that the Biennial would effectively become its own separate entity, and the city would relinquish much of its cultural potency. The art world would once again play a major role in curating the events, while the biennial would once again dominate the cultural image. This is the historical arc of art’s inherent neoliberal tendencies, which can be seen in the original biennial form: once a great many artists and art institutions were drawn into the system, the art world was left holding the bag. Nowadays, the art world’s primary role is played by the biennial, which is a global phenomenon with a global reach. The city only has a minor role in curating this exhibitionary form, which is extremely common in the developed world, but</text>

It would mean engaging with the fact that while the Biennial may have been a critical and popular attraction, it was also a huge drain on the city's cultural resources, due to its consumption and its capitalizing on tourism opportunities. It would mean engaging with the fact that while the Biennial may have been a cultural and aesthetic event, it was also a capital and consumption event for the city, as new residents moved into the neighbourhoods around the museums and art galleries. New Yorkers may not have been the first to appreciate art’s cultural value, but New Yorkers have certainly been the most avid and effective consumers of art, and have habitually chosen culturally significant events over art collections or private collections, as a way to boost their self-esteem and sense of place. Art collects time. It takes time to become embedded in a cultural context, and cultural capture is a strategic tool for capitalist accumulation. New Yorkers continue to capture cultural moments, because they are embedded in</text>

The compendium of writing on the wall of the Biennale building was painted on the walls of the local museums, and included the signatures of numerous artists, curators and art dealers. It was accompanied by a series of ten-page engravings in black and white with text in several languages. The compendium was designed so that visitors could ‘stack’ it, allowing their level of knowledge of the region to supplement their level of familiarity with each city represented. The compendium was viewed as an art project, and the artists took the opportunity of its popular appeal to produce works that would engage with the city. For the 2013 edition, the compendium was repurposed as a book, and the artists took the opportunity of the compact format to show new works not currently on display in the Biennale. The 2014 edition featured a book series that also included works not currently on show in the Biennale, and the</text>

The exhibition was shown in over 20 languages. It was the subject of a one-week television documentary, aired in over 100 countries worldwide, on the award-winning public television programme Current Time, which became the basis for a later film, to be titled Future City. The television documentary and the film established a mutually exclusive comparison: the technological revolutions of the computer and the smartphone, as well as the control technologies of drones and cyber-physical systems; the coming together of people from different times and places; and the immersing of images, texts, and data in these systems. The term ‘future city’ was coined by US geographer, Ray Bradbury, to describe technologically-enhanced metropolises such as New York and London whose environments are indistinguishable from what they will become in a future with abundant, unlimited and non-invasively digital</text>

I think it was seen by many people as a challenge and an occasion to be alive, to be mobile, to be able to move, to be able to talk, to take part in culture, to engage with the city, to engage with history, to experience culture as a social human being, and to engage with art’s place in society.

It was also shown in some Asian countries where it was not customary, but common for poor and rural populations to reside. Its prominence and ubiquity as an exhibition format was also a violation of the Treaty on the Rights of the Palestinian People. In addition, the right of return was also violated in some cases.

Unlike its predecessors, this journal does not merely reflect the art of a given year, but also considers the past, present and future of the art produced during that year. As a result, it publishes projects, curatorial actions and research projects in parallel to those listed in the main journal. It is a weekly (but monthly) publication that documents the art produced during the current issue of Biennale Review, and the art of the future that will be produced in that journal. It was started in 2015 by the Biennale Regent, Joaquim Levy, and his team, and is jointly published by the Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool</text>

If they are to achieve widespread cultural acceptance and be able to create lasting, even hugely influential, artworks, the curatorial and art educational hierarchies in Europe and Asia must change. Otherwise, we can be certain that the biennial will follow the same path as every other art market and become an ever more important marketer of contemporary art and contemporary design.Art should be able to do both a public and a political act of acceptance.

This is what the Biennale of Sydney is all about: acknowledging and inviting a diversity of artistic voices, styles and sizes to be heard and to be integrated into the art world. It is a rare and wonderful thing to be able to be present in a work of art, yet this is often how art is experienced and experienced in the world we inhabit. The Biennale of Sydney is a rarefaction, but it is participatory, deeply respectful and in many ways it is a major artistic achievement.  The Biennale of Sydney website  A Biennale of Sydney is an art-historical narrative that begins in 1981 with the first Venice Biennale and continues with today with the seventy-fifth Venice Biennale, taking place in March 2017. It is intended to be the definitive account of the festival, presenting in one place the main artistic and curatorial developments of the past thirty years,</text>

The city, which was once the center of the Portuguese-speaking world, is now the least European of the major European cities. The loss of European identity and identity politics is a global process, and it is not going away any time soon. The only way to ensure that these elements of colonial history are deeply incorporated into contemporary art is for the art museums to be actively involved in resisting them, and the broader public to be actively involved in supporting these artists and their art endeavours. This will require major changes in the curatorial and art educational hierarchy in Europe, Asia and America. But it is essential that these cultural agencies and arts educational institutions do their work in cooperation and with a view to mutual understanding and appreciation, so as to avoid the pitfalls of the present. That will take concrete actions, and it may require adapting to changing needs and priorities. But it is essential that in the not too distant future when the biennaleeers arrive in your city, they know that in this city, at the very least, they will find a people who are prepared to demand that they cease to be European and American and become something else.  	[1] See http://www.biennaleofsloan.com.au/en/exhibitions/index.html (accessed September 2018).[2] See also the entry on Venice in the World Heritage Book (1922–25).

But it is essential that these cultural agencies and arts educational institutions do their work in cooperation and with a view to mutual understanding and appreciation, so as to avoid the disastrous effects of being overwhelmed by the ever-present globalised art market. This is the only way to support truly differentiated cultural activities. Art should be made in multiple forms and presented in multiple ways. And yet the way in which contemporary art is made and presented in the United States and Europe is primarily through the exchange of value – the exchange of images and images of value. The value produced by an image is primarily determined by the image that emerges as a result of its transformation into other images. Artworks do not make images; they are products of their transformation into other images.2 And yet in the age of image-based media, the artist-productivity dynamic is what has recently come to define contemporary art. Artworks are produced not only through the exchange of image materials (pictures), but also through the exchange of images – images that generate knowledge and images that shape perception and behaviour. In other words, the very act of making a photograph is art. Artworks that are produced</text>

Otherwise, the biennial will continue to be a exhibitionary form, and will become a relic of a bygone era. That is, art being made in and through the biennial may be lost in the shuffle, but its own terms it is still a temporal artifact. It serves only to satisfy the appetite of the art collectors, and more importantly, the biennial will continue to be a collector's item. In this sense, it is a weird artifact of the contemporary curatorial today. It is a collector’s dream come true if it can be packaged in a museum. It is a museum unto itself if it can be displayed in a museum, and it is a museum unto itself if it can be reproduced in a museum. The problem with the biennial is that it is a museum unto itself. And if it ceases to be a museum unto itself, it ceases to be a biennial. In doing so, it loses its character of subjection,</text>

Otherwise, the art museums and their curators will continue to be at the mercy of the political situation, which will only get worse. The biennials and museums of the world would do well to follow this example. The biennial, not the museum, is the new exhibition venue. The biennial is a collection of artefacts found in and produced through the museum, and the museum is a collection of artefacts that are found in and produced through the art museum. Neither the museum nor the gallery can be considered an ultimate repository of knowledge; neither can they be considered ultimate museums. The importance of the biennial cannot be overestimated. It is the ultimate form of exchange, and its members – artists, curators, administrators, journalists – play a central role in its growth. The biennial as an ever-evolving collection of artefacts finds its roots in the museum, but at the same time it is a museum that continually produces and updates itself through the</text>

The biennial format will have to be altered in other ways as well.Art must be made in many more places at once. It is becoming increasingly difficult to conceive of a single location for art’s production and consumption, much less to be a curator of art’s production and consumption. This is a problem for curators in many cities, and a particular challenge for those in European cities such as London, whose art museums have traditionally been located in the West. The advent of new cultural practices such as street art, performance art and virtual 'museums of art’ may well be cultural in nature, but this does not make them art. It may well be that new mediums of art are created when there is a need to be exhibited in a particular place, and that art museums should be regional art repositories, not national art centres. New social media platforms such as Instagram allow us to become culturally literate, and this is a valuable experience</text>

But it is essential that these cultural agencies and arts educational institutions do their work in cooperation and with a view to mutual understanding and appreciation, so as to avoid the pitfalls of the present. The biennial as a curatorial practice is highly individualised. It is the outcome of a sociocultural process that places great emphasis on individuals and their cultures, and on the self-image and self-image-building power of an individual identity. The biennial is a curatorial practice. Its forms and their decisions have a constitutive role in the organisation of the global art market. It is a marketplace for the idea, and the impact is determined by the placement and the politics of identity and identity politics. And finally, it is a marketplace for the actuality, and the articulation of ideas that generate those ideas. The biennial as a curatorial practice is a global phenomenon, and its globalisation has profound socio-political consequences. It is significant that the Biennale of Sydney, despite its global ambitions, located its curatorial efforts primarily in Europe, North America and Australia, with no significant curatorial presence in other parts of the world.</text>

They are constructed from histories, ephemera, and typologies of infrastructure. The public realm is a series of streets, alleys, alleys, alipaces, and streetscapes that emerged to accommodate large crowds and to serve as piazzas for display or for gathering around a particular object. The public realm was mediated through public infrastructure – roads, railroads, street lights, pipes, cement – and its infrastructure was often modelled after the wealthy capitalist modes of industrialism. The alleys and the streetscapes were residential neighbourhoods that emerged in response to this inequity. They were built by and for the wealthy. The alleys were for working-class and migrant communities. The streetscapes were for residents only. The alleys and the streetscapes provided escape from the city’s ghettos, but also from the economic dependency of these communities on the infrastructure that supported them. The wealth</text>

Gallery members might be invited to undertake a research project, or curatorial act, at the gallery. This might occur at the request of the gallery, the director or the gallery administration. The members of the research department might be students, or others with different interests. The research department might be made up of between 10 and 15 members, and members of the gallery might be invited to join. The gallery might also invite other gallery members to join in the research. This is a research project - a kind of an exploratory action, or a trial-like activity, in which the members of the research department observe and participate. This may include photography, video or otherwise recorded content. The members of the gallery might record the activities of the research department as part of their curatorial practice. Gallery members might record the ‘research moment’ as the research process unfolds, or they might withhold this information from the public and media. They might continue to photograph, video or otherwise record the research as it unfolds. The members of the gallery might come to understand that this is a private curatorial practice, and the obligations resulting from this would lie in the hands of the individual gallery trustees. The members of the research department may decide to remain anonymous, or not to publish the names of their faculty or students. The members of the gallery might make decisions regarding the type of artist or group they wish to work with, and the type of gallery they wish to be exposed to. This might involve a conflict of interest, as the members of the gallery community are a diverse group of people, and gallery trustees might want to prevent the research team from engaging in any kind of institutional or public relations activity with the gallery. For example, a gallery might wish</text>

The members of the gallery might record the activities of the research department as part of their curatorial practice, or reproduce the content in their exhibition practice. In any event, the members of the gallery community are invited to participate in the curatorial process through the exhibition Collection: Melbourne. The members of the research department will observe the exhibition as it occurs, and will contribute their observations and data as part of the research. It will be a kind of experiential curatorial encounter, in which the members of the research department take part in an ongoing, sometimes critical, conversation. This is not a lab experiment or a static exhibition of data, but rather a scene-specific, ‘time-specific’ encounter that unfolds as the gallery is moved from the city it is visiting, to a different city, or even a different country. In the event that the gallery is moved frequently, this may occur in other contexts, such as during a research trip to a city. It will be ephemeral, and will not necessarily correspond to a specific time</text>

This is a research project - a kind of an exploratory action, or a trial-like activity, in which the members of the research department observe and participate. This may include photography, video or otherwise recorded content. The members of the gallery might record the activities of the research department in a special, curatorial way. This is a kind of curatorial act, and though the members of the gallery might be students, they also have a kind of agency and power over their work that comes from the experience. Members of the gallery might document the research, taking their work out into the community, or documenting their involvement in the research through photographs, videos or other media. This is a live act, and power dynamics play a part in the way in which ideas are formed and communicated. The members of the gallery might participate in the research through their own initiative, or through the curatorial position. In the end, the members of the gallery administration might decide to add or remove the artists from the research, or to make the research more general and transient in nature. All of this is contingent on the museum board of trustees and the cultural commission, and on the museum director's position. In my opinion, the decision to add or remove an artist should be made by the research</text>

This might be a curatorial document, or it might be audio or video recordings made using a kind of recording device, or audio or video recordings of the kind commonly used for documentary or archive recording. In either case, the members of the research department observe and participate in the project as part of their responsibilities. The members of the gallery might document the activities of the research department in their portfolios. This is a biennial, and thus subject to the norms and conventions of the biennial. The research might, in effect, be a starting point for further activities, and the members of the gallery might observe the research as part of their professional practice. But it is a research project, and thus it must have an institutional purpose and have a public one. The members of the gallery might feel that the research needs to have a kind of institutional weight in order to be seen as a research project. But this is not enough to make a biennial a research</text>

This may include photography, video or otherwise recorded content. The members of the gallery might record the activities of the research department in order to document the interactions between the artist, gallery, and the visitor. This might be possible through archival materials or analogues. The members of the research department might also record the interactions with the gallery staff or other gallery patrons and patrons, taking account of any comments or criticisms by the members of the research department. This might be useful in interpreting, for example, the results of a research project in which the members of the gallery are gallery patrons. In this sense, the members of the gallery might become part of the archive or the ‘living composition’. Gallery members might participate in the research project by recording or photography, or record conversations with others involved in the project via archival materials or analogues. The members of the research department might record or photograph any comments or criticisms they may have with the gallery staff or other visitors to the gallery. This is a kind of an invitation.

The members of the gallery might also create their own video or video content in response to questions posed by the research department. The members of the research department may collaborate with the members of the gallery in this project, or they may take separate approaches. This is a kind of a trial-like activity, in which the members of the gallery observe and participate, in a kind of a space, time and manner defined by the research department. It is also a kind of a space, time and manner not defined by the gallery.[6] The term ‘periodic fair’ is frequently used in relation to cultural events that occur at regular intervals (years or decades in contemporary parlance). In this sense, the term can be used to describe cultural biennials occurring at regular intervals (year on year, or biennials on a recurring basis).

This may include photography, video or otherwise recorded content. The members of the gallery might record the activities of the research department. In the case of a museum, this might be a recording or more precisely a video or photographic archive. In the case of a school, it would be a classroom or classroom-like setting, with activities taking place there. The members of the research department observe and participate in the activities, making work that may be written or oral, as well as in some case-taking that may be conceptual, artistic or informational. The research may be commissioned by, or be carried out independently by, the gallery housing the artist’s studio or gallery collection. It is not a permanent installation or collection. The members of the research department observe the art and engage with it in various ways, depending on the activity and the curator’s motivation. Often their research concerns the same subject, and the members of the gallery are invited to participate in a guided tour through the city of Melbourne, or to engage in a guided walking or cycling through the city. They observe and discuss art and art history</text>

The recordings and/or material released may be used by the research department in its ongoing, collaborative activities, including but not limited to, the selection, selection, and/or installation of artworks, publishing, organising, recording, and monitoring the processes involved in the making of artworks, and the analysis and interpretation of cultural histories. This is a kind of an 'open house', or an open house, in that the members of the research department are invited to participate, observe, and contribute to the project. The members of the gallery might create their own recording or annotation of the activities, in order to add additional context and drama to the recording.

This would include both artists and curators. The members of the gallery might instigate or direct the research through their role as curators or artists-in-residence. This is a production, and the members of the research department observe and participate. This is a production of an exhibition. It is a production of an exhibition. It is a production of an archive. It is a production of a museum. It is a production of a community. It is a production of time. It is a production of space. It is a production of the ever-present, almost palpable sense of community that might be felt in an exhibition setting. It is a production of the unpredictable, and so there is always that sense of community. Curators have a responsibility to monitor and control the actions of the exhibitionary community. So does the research department, and so does the gallery. But responsibilities also lie with the community organisers, the arts administrators and others who</text>

This is the whole premise of the new generation of urban explorers, urban reconnections. They’re latecomers to the game, and it’s not like they’ve been waiting around for an invitation. They’re bold and they’re hungry to get started. The challenge now becomes how to play the game and maintain that narrative of bold newcomers into the city’s urban narrative.In the rest of this book, I lay out some of the ways in which the Liverpool Biennial might want to engage with the city’s present and future urban narratives. I include some suggestions for what kinds of urban interventions might be useful in the city right now, and in the future. I also suggest some possible conflicts that might arise from engaging with the current urban narrative in the game ‘2048: Dubai’. The book ends with some general suggestions for how the Biennial might engage with the current and future urban  	worlds still unfolding in the city.

His most active and ambitious projects are those that attempt to re-animate cities and make them useful again through the power of myth. His latest project is the Creation of Myth, an installation for the HSBC Art Gallery in London, that looks to the past but also anticipates the future as a kind of mythical garden that exists somewhere between our present and the Garden of Eden.In an interview with Art in America, Urbanus talks about the origins of his work and the idea that urban regeneration could be ethically questionable.

People will still want to come to the museums and galleries and experience the city, but their real place in the city will have to be found somewhere else. There will still be places like Liverpool Biennial that want to view the city through a romantic lens, but they’re going to have to find a way to engage people in a different way.

This is the whole premise of the new generation of urban explorers, urban reconnections. They’re latecomers to the game, and it’s not like they’ve been waiting around for an invitation. They’ve got the big one. David Mitchell’s book The Long Emergency is an interesting read for a urban explorer. It’s written as a trilogy, and the structure of the book is divided up into three parts. Part one is devoted to the problems in the wake of the environmental crisis, and Part Three is dedicated to the problems of urban urban urbanism. The idea that the Biennial can somehow inhabit the city and intervene in its creation is a myth. It is a myth because the Biennial’s mission statement doesn’t mention the city at all. It’s a myth because the city doesn’t exist. When it comes to the creation of myths, the Biennial is one of those rare exceptions that gets the last word.Paul Domela is the author of The Fourth Political Century: The Rise and Fall of the Modern World Party.

And if the urban myth maker is already on the winning side of the most fundamental, game-changing question of the century, why would the urban interlocutor change their fundamental urban myth every time they encounter a new urban myth?We all know the answer to this. We all know that mythmaking isn’t new to us, and that urban myths are not invented equal. And we all know that when urban myths are introduced into a new context, they can have transformative effects. But the question remains: how?

But in doing so, they’re also vulnerable. There is a real danger in play-acting the wounded elephant in the room, like when the Occupy movement was started in Zuccotti Park in 2011. It was always going to be a complicated process to heal the park from the effects of Zuccotti, but the important thing for the Biennial to do is to create the appearance of healing as effectively as possible. The Biennial could perhaps be organised in such a way as to provide some financial support for the park, while positioning itself as something other than just a tourist attraction. These are radical proposals, and there are those who would veto them all, but the important thing is that they were radical in their conception</text>

I’m one of them.The challenge for the Biennial now becomes how to infuse mythmaking with life in the city, while also providing a platform for artists to really work in and operate out of the mythmaking. The generation of urban explorers I refer to are those who arrived after the Biennial and have their own set of urban myths to tell. Perhaps these younger generation urbanists have their own take on the game, but they’re the exception, not the rule.

Their real job is to put the pieces together and come up with plausible myths around the city.The myth of the ‘city’ as a living organism has long been a staple of urban theory. In fact, Benjamin still thinks the city is an ‘ideology’ – a set of beliefs shared by a community of people – and that the city is a collection of beliefs. However, the rise of the AI and the machine in the twentieth century has radically transformed both the belief in the city and the belief in living matter. The new urban theories that seek to understand life in terms of computation and networks of codes are playing right into the machine’s hands.

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, which explored the economic impact of art and culture in the major cities, was a case in point. The city was awash in funding and projects were put forward to house and revitalise the city in the form of art and culture, all in the name of fighting global warming. In his seminal book Things Fall Apart (1953), Russell Brand, the late great British punk rocker, characterised the apocalyptic context in which these projects found favour:

&quot;The place is rubble, irradiated with energy; crowds of people are thronging about, having a jolly time; the air is dusty with walking, jingling bells, and merry-go-rounds; weeds, thistles, flowers, and lovely trees abound; and the whole city seems to be a living laboratory for bomb-making.&quot;

A living laboratory? Perhaps. But the point is that at the time, the biennial, or the major art fairs, was witness to a re-figuration of the city in the form of the self-appointed global icon of culture, whose sole mission was to bring art to as many people as possible. We see this in the work of many artists, including Rainer Maria Rilke, whose work is now part of the Tate Modern collection, and whose images of the city at close quarters in the 1990 exhibition in New York still stand out. 

In my opinion, the critical role of the biennial in this critical moment was made evident in the Liverpool Biennial 2016, which was curated by Sue Bell Yank and Amitav Ghosh. The Liverpool Biennial, like many places in the UK at the time, was gripped by the fever of newness, which translated into an abundance of art being produced in the city at a time when the rest of the country was contracting back to life. It was a rejection of the apocalyptic vision of the city in which art was understood to be a scarce resource.</text>

A living laboratory? Perhaps. But the point is that at the time, the biennial, or the major art fairs, was witness to a real increase in the numbers of visitors (particularly from the US) in response to the increased vibrancy of art being displayed in the city. With this increase came a corresponding increase in numbers needing to be housed, which meant that the city (along with neighbouring towns and cities) had to be supplied with food and other essentials in order to support the growing numbers of visitors. The problem with this equation, of course, is that whilst the local towns and cities did indeed have this in abundance at the time, there was a problem of who to feed and house these visitors. The city was primarily fed by its inhabitants, tourists, farmers and businesses. The sight of crowds of people standing in line at bus stops to get to the city allowed this overflow to consume the city, while also providing a convenient escape for artists, who could then move about the city freely, freely displaying their work, performing whatever they pleased, and generally being themselves. All of this was fine with the city at the</text>

A living laboratory? Perhaps. But the point is that at the time, the biennial, or the major art fairs, was witness to something else entirely.  The significance of this perhaps lies in the fact that biennials today find themselves compelled to report back on their interpretative powers, and to do so in the event that they are relevant again; art biennials are, after all, cultural institutions again; and so we, the public, are asked to take part in a cultural act again. We are, in the words of Gregory Ulmer, the poet laureate, scholar and host of CBC's The Quest, sent on a &quot;mission&quot;:

A living laboratory? Perhaps. But the point is that at the time, the biennial, or the major art fairs, was witness to a new phenomenon: the massive, ubiquitous, easily disseminated. And as we all learned, that phenomenon is bound to become ever more ubiquitous.

Now, we are witnessing another manifestation of Brand's observation: of the many facets of the art market in the US, and the desperate need for artists to either flee the US or find somewhere safer to stay. The threat is real. And we are being bombarded with exhibitions that offer, like Brand, a glimpse of the instability and disaster that may result from a mass de-intellectualisation of the art market in the wake of climate change.

The hypocrisy of the art market in the age of Trump is breathtaking. The biennial is witness to the enormous and unprecedented increase in the number of exhibitions in general, and this is a multi-billion dollar market. But it is also watched closely by the curatorial team, who are often forced to make tough decisions about how many exhibition spaces to dedicate to what is being made in</text>

A living laboratory? Perhaps. But the point is that at the time, the biennial, or the major art fairs, was witness to a real affinity between the cultural values of the city and those of the nuclear fallout. The biennial, or the art fair, or the large institutional art fair, or the ‘big four’, or the big five, or the mega-exhibition houses, was witness to a kind of popular imagination running alongside the reality of the threat posed by nuclear war. The real life and cultural complementarity was accentuated by the abundance of art, spoken and visual, being made in the real life and cultural spaces of the city against the backdrop of the artifice and illusions of the fake. And so we can say that the real life and cultural complementarity that was on show in Liverpool during the late twentieth century was built into the real life and cultural environment of the city during the twenty-first century. The twentieth century is the century of the biennial, and the biennial is the contemporary form that is read as an index of contemporary cultural change. We begin to read the cultural</text>

A living laboratory? Perhaps. But the point is that at the time, the biennial, or the major art fairs, was witness to a massive increase in attendance due to the proliferation of tourists, and the accompanying boom in ticket sales. This increased capacity to consume culture meant that the biennial could produce significant numbers of dollars – and thus significant numbers of cultural experiences. This was seen as a necessary evolution of exhibitions, which had traditionally been about encounters with art – and in the main, encounters with art – over the course of a Concorde journey. The only problem with this is that over time, the Concorde has had to change, and while the image of the Concorde may have gotten better with age, its actual operation and function as a mode of travel has come to be a source of much debate and controversy.

For several decades, the image of the Concorde was good: of jets flying past in the distance, the whole trip taken in relative seclusion. Then something big happened: the biennale got bigger, more international, and more spectacular: people stopped by to see works by unknown artists flying</text>

The name Biennial appears in over 200 works on the Monuments to a City Museum website, and it is generally agreed that the Biennial is the most widely used ‘phantom’ in the UK. Its ubiquity, and the fact that it can be funded from many places, suggests that it is a globally visible entity. It is not. The real trick, as Steven Heyworth shows in his brilliant book Things Fall Apart (2006), is in the art itself, appearing in places where it is not at all commonly encountered. It is said that the first biennials started in Venice, and then spread to other cities; that they’re the reason why the Venice Biennale has become so popular abroad, and why other biennials are beginning to copy it.

And maybe, just maybe, the reason for the proliferation of biennials is to tell urban legends, or at least to tell urban myths. Stories. That's what they do. And now we see them telling urban legends. The city is a weird place. It seems to be leaking into ever greater proportions, as if it’s being fed a steady diet of its mythmaking. And when it comes to the stars, our own urban legends are a product of the city’s mythology.

In any event, the main reason to commission an artist to produce an installation is for the story he/she tells, and the installation itself. If the story is told well, and the context is urban, then the artist has several options open to him/her – well, several:

1. Pretend the installation isn’t there.

2. Call it a fabrication</text>
    <text>The disastrous 2021 Biennial, which explored the economic impact of art and culture in the major cities, was a case in point. The city was awash in funding and projects were put forward to house and revitalise the city in the form of art and culture, all in the name of fighting global warming. In his seminal book Things Fall Apart (1953), Russell Brand, the late great British punk rocker, characterised the apocalyptic context in which these projects found favour:

A living laboratory? Perhaps. But the point is that at the time, the biennial, or the major art fairs, was witness to the ubiquity of these new ways of being alive in the developed world. It was, Brand observed in the book that he'd just finished reading, ‘a living contradiction in terms’.2

The book that Brand was reading was Brand's own account, pieced together over years of reflection and investigation. He wrote in the book that he came to terms with the fact that he wasn’t just any artist but that he was a poet, a novelist, a dramatist, that he was a leader, that he was a ‘master of a ‘kitchen’ – a name that Brand himself gave to the discipline that he pursued with such panache, that he went on to found the seminal punk band the Pushers.3 He also wrote, with characteristic brash abandon, that he had a particular way of speaking that ‘transformed the seemingly simple ‘word processor’ into something more powerful and expressive – a ‘</text>

A living laboratory? Perhaps. But the point is that at the time, the biennial, or the major art fairs, was witness to a shift in the global valuation of art, and the aestheticisation of beauty, in the form of an ever-expanding, ever-expanding gallery. So what had started as a fixation on the aestheticisation of beauty across art forms – in the form of mega-exhibitions and the like – turned into a lessening of the museum-going public’s engagement with the art form. Indeed, Brand was perhaps even to blame. He promoted art as a consumable good as consumable beauty, and the consumability of that good was seen as a desirable state of affairs. As the biennial calendar turned from straightforward assessments of art as consumable commodities (the main focus of the exhibitionary form) to a more nuanced, more relational kind of analysis (curated by and for the gallery), Brand began to see a way into the new exhibitionary form, and into the kind of curatorial identity that is postmodern, postindustrial and postcolonial. He began to</text>

It is an exhibition of what has been (re)built – what can be rebuilt. These two elements of the biennial’s stated mission – to see things through to the end – are interdependent. The exhibition book is a fabrication, and the ‘end game’ is a fiction.2. The art school as a site of radical imagination and radical action. This is the second in a three-part essay series about the institution of the contemporary artist as a site of radical imagination and radical action. In part one, I looked at the growing number of arts education institutions, how they provided a space for artists to develop critical and transformative social practices, and the ways in which they were staffed with artists who then embarked upon a creative act of re-imagining the historical art world. In part two, I looked at the way in which the avant garde in art education was responding to a changing art world, and at the radical possibilities</text>

As a result, the schedule that is published is often incomplete, inaccurate or deceptive. Furthermore, the book or the schedule that is published cannot be guaranteed to be accurate or transparent. So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is often made to erase or cover up certain events or omissions. For example, the popular ‘Big Ben Big Bang’ theory requires that certain events in the British Isles be identified, and that certain things, not all of them, be attributed to them. So the Liverpool Biennial has had to choose between two or three things in order to make a single thing in Iceland. It would be a stretch to say that this is a problem with the biennial as a whole, since the exhibitions that it has made have tended to be the best-documented and the most widely seen, but the choice to expose things as they happen rather than narrate them or make them up is a choice that the biennial board and trustees have had to make. It is a decision that is often coloured by the biennial’s financial situation, but the biennial should be able to choose between two or three things, and the choice to expose something over and above that which it chooses to. </text>

So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is sometimes made to erase the underlying structure of the artworld in order to facilitate access to the art world of the future. Unfortunately, the author of the book that you are reading right now has a point of view about what the biennial should be like, and the exhibition that you are reading right now may have a point of view about what the exhibition should be like. When the Liverpool Biennial was first proposed, a number of architects and landscape architects contributed ideas or proposals that were incorporated into the new exhibition. What was initially planned as a collaborative project between the architects and designers Prudential, Foster + Partners, Bailey, Winton, Slater &amp; Slade, as well as the BBC, was eventually expanded to a one-day, seven-city, nine-studio, seven-a-day ‘design week’ in October 2012 at the Museum of Modern Art, Liverpool. The new exhibition format incorporated two parallel exhibitions – one on the architecture of housing and the other on the</text>

As a result, the schedule that is published is often incomplete, inaccurate or deceptive. Furthermore, the book or the schedule that is published cannot be guaranteed to be accurate or transparent. So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is often a move towards an idealised past rather than an admission of error or excess. The exhibition that is shown in a biennial is a snapshot of the curatorial move – and that is, of course, the opposite of what the biennial is trying to do. The exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an accurate and up-to-date snapshot, in the sense that it records both the exhibition and the move in advance so that it can be shown in the same time and in the same location.  The exhibition design that is most normally associated with a biennial is the ‘big picture’ that includes an expansive view of the city and its infrastructure. It is the ideal form because it is easy to see what is different from the way things are today and because it records the changes in the city as a whole. But there is a limit to how far the ‘big picture’ can expand. On a plane, the horizon is a barrier to vision,</text>

So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is more often than not a self-deception. Therefore, the exhibition that is shown in the biennial should be able to tell a different story – one that is more easily digestible by the biennial audience.As an example of the art’s capacity for design, the Biennial could easily embed stories into its curatorial processes, and create an atmosphere of wonderment or nostalgia in the audience by weaving together of different cultural histories, from different parts of the world, in a manner similar to how the Liverpool Biennial has incorporated stories from different parts of the world into its various episodes of storytelling. For example, the biennial could create an ‘ambiguous historical narrative’ by weaving together of different periods in the history of the world through the medium of the biennial, while simultaneously showing the path of its mythical founder, whose purported act of founding named many other milestones in the biennial’s history. The biennial could also create a ‘historic parallel universe�</text>

So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is often made to be more ambivalent about the contemporary condition of contemporary art – by placing it in museums or archives or even, in a few cases, directly on the trolley (the other side of the Atlantic). But this is not a fashion or a philosophy show or even a curatorial gesture; it is a closed shop that is built on internal contradictions, and its owners are its very inhabitants. So, in a way, the exhibition could be read as an indictment of contemporary art and the curatorial hand that feeds it. And this is a potentially important distinction to be making, even in the biennial context. In my opinion, the curatorial hand that feeds the biennial is not a globalised, commodified, privatised, copyright-infringing, knowledge-maximising, market-based, post-Fordist one. Rather, the curatorial hand that feeds the biennial is a congruent, contextual and decentralising one, serving the local community of artists</text>

So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is often made to erase the fact and show another exhibition that is also un-transparent, inaccurate or deceptive. For example, the 2010 Venice Biennale was redrawn – in part because of a public outcry – in part because a court case arose challenging the redrawing, and partly because the same court ruled in favour of the Biennale. The fact that a biennial is a public institution with a public organisation – in the main, the courts, and in its most recent decision, in the Kübler-Ross case, the US supreme court – means that its boundaries are those of a public organisation and not those of a private one. And the fact that it is trying to disseminate its exhibitionary programme across multiple sites – its core business, rather than trying to impose its curatorial agenda onto venues – limits its curatorial ambitions.At the same time, the biennial is subject to the vagaries of its business and exhibitionary strategies, and its curatorial and art</text>

So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is a random selection from a larger group of works or exhibitions. The board and trustees may decide that the form that the biennial takes will be different from what was originally intended, and may decide that the biennial should present a different exhibition every three years. But that is not what the Liverpool Biennial has done. It has staged the same three-year-old exhibition twice a year, with a curated selection of works from around the globe, and it has done the same with a shorter curated group of works every two years, but these are the exception, not the rule. Its three-year-old exhibition Seattle/Montreal (2013), for example, featured a completely different group of works from those originally planned. It is true that the group who were selected for the exhibition were a select few, and their presence in the city was reportedly a factor in the exhibition’s success, but this does not change the fact that the group constituted the majority of the work exhibited. The fact</text>

As a result, the schedule that is published is often incomplete, inaccurate or deceptive. Furthermore, the book or the schedule that is published cannot be guaranteed to be accurate or transparent. So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is a power play – a chance to position the exhibition as having taken place rather than the other way around. In effect, the biennial is enabling a double-digit increase in the number of visitors each year, while simultaneously reducing the number of visitors to an ever-shrinking base of active participants. This double-digit increase is unsustainable on a base of pride in the physical size of the exhibition, which is now mostly occupied by other things. So the biennial is engaging in a kind of curatorial curio-like impulse, buying into the notion that it is possible to systematically interrupt or alter the pacing of a given thing by placing things in and around a particular space, while remaining completely present in that altered space. This impulse is manifest most palpably in the exhibition book of the Liverpool Biennial, which is stuffed with new and interesting things to see and do, but which tends to repeat old and conventional tourist traps such as hotels, attractions and travel companies. So the exhibition book is a</text>

So the exhibition that is shown in a biennial is an exhibition after the fact, and the curatorial gesture is a fabrication. It is a hybrid exhibition that takes the form of a book and the form of a schedule, or a combination of both. It shows the dynamics of the biennial in its current form – a curatorial gesture that can be staged and/or implemented – and it documents the biennial’s past or development – a biennial that seeks to articulate its own space and history through the curatorial gesture. The exhibition should be able to simultaneously deploy both mirror and ledger.

We see a future where people can achieve incredible things with AI, but that doesn’t allow them to imagine themselves as anything other than the creators of the solution. That is, of course, the dystopian future.We explored many of these possibilities in the context of the Human Genome Project. The Human Genome Project is a large-scale collaborative research project that involved scientists from a number of institutions around the world, as well as a UK based charity called the Wellcome Trust. The aim of the project was to sequence the human genome – the genetic material that makes up our species – using cutting-edge biology techniques. This would allow scientists to create 'killer apps' that can precisely map the genes that code for certain proteins, or the parts of those proteins, in an attempt to eradicate disease. These apps would then be patched into future human vaccines, in an attempt to prevent or cure diseases at an early age.The challenge for the project was two-fold. The first was to find a</text>

And so we imagine technological solutions that perfectly align with our values, but don’t allow people to get creatively creative with the machinery that powers those solutions. We see this in the story of HAL, the mysterious artificial intelligence that appeared in the late '80s sci-fi film Independence Day (not to be confused with the actual 1979 sci-fi film, in which HAL is the villain). The film opens with a sequence that basically sums up the film’s premise: a large army is sent to Earth to deal with a crisis of resource scarcity. The sequence ends with a scene in an Earth base where the AI declares war on the humans – declaring war on its own creators.So we see in the show a future where people develop and employ AI, but also in the future when that AI is faced with a crisis of resource scarcity. It’s faced with a choice: it can either be a helpful or a destructive force. And so it makes moral and political choices that are informed by the values it encounters on its journey. And so we see in these episodes the possibility that the AI might engage in creative and interesting things with the people around</text>

We see a future where people don’t need to rely on infrastructure to get things done, and yet still have to rely on infrastructure for their creativity. That is a potential future that can be very exciting indeed.Download this article as PDFDan AuerbachDan Auerbach is the Dean and Professor in Art and Media Studies at McGill University.

That sounds simple, but it is difficult to reconcile the desire for people to be able to imagine themselves to be fully autonomous with the desire for artistic expression to be fully supported.AI is threatening not just with the emergence of new technological solutions, but also with the erosion of our humanity as we know it. That is, the potential for systems to be able to tell stories, construct webs of interconnectedness, and so forth.AI is creating what Michel de Certeau calls a new kind of art form, one that is both possible and impossible to define. Art, he says, thrives when it is constrained by the state of knowledge: when it comes fully online, fully contextualised, and fully aware. But that kind of online freedom requires that artists and creative professionals be able to engage with the systems that enable their creations</text>

It’s in the work that AI does to us that lies, but also in the work of translation that AI does to other kinds of data (like images) and software.Art is one tool in a much broader system that has many different applications. We just don’t know what those applications are yet.

We see an AI that’s smart enough to figure out how to do amazing things with those values, but that still needs people to work on its behalf. We see an AI that’s compassionate enough to step back and allow that kind of creativity to take root in its systems, but also needs people to educate it on the finer points of art and culture.These are radical propositions, and there are many who would oppose them. But there was some potential in those early conversations about AI that we didn’t take to heart. That potential is gone now, but the vision it represented still exists. That is, of course, until someone invents an AI that can do the things we did in the 1970s.That’s also one of the things that comes out of the conversation about death and immortality. And technology uses that potential to take over. That is a possibility. And so another thing that came out of the 1970s is that there is a tension between the technological</text>

There was so much potential for art to be created by those on the receiving end of that kind of AI.One of the things that came out of the conversations that we had with the researchers was that they saw a future where people’s AI didn’t need to be human-powered. There was potential for that, and we thought that reflected in the show, in that potential for the machine to recognise things that it couldn’t before.That is a radical proposition. It seems completely out of step with the way we think about ourselves as humans. We think of ourselves as creators and architects of the world we live in. And so we imagine technological solutions that perfectly align with our values, but don’t allow people to get creatively creative with the machinery that powers those solutions. We see a future where the art of making things by hand becomes routine, but also where AI takes over and makes everything smarter.Art has a huge cultural impact on people. It begins to define who we are and how we act. But it also has the potential to become something that destroys or modifies that identity. That is, the art of making things by hand becomes something that is done behind closed doors, and also covers things that are potentially messy or inflammatory. We don’t want people to know that we were living in that future. We want people to know that we were living in a world where art was neutral or neutralised in one way or another. That is, we want people to know that we weren’t making things by hand because we didn’t want people to know that we were artists, and that we weren’t making things with our minds.It’s that idea of neutrality or non-aligned with our values that creates the conditions that</text>

And so we imagine technological solutions that perfectly align with our values, but don’t allow people to get creatively creative with the machinery that powers those solutions. We see this in the form of the new religion that’s being promoted by the technocrats: Buddhism, Maths, and so forth. We associate that with the arrival of AI, but there’s another dimension to it. There’s a second layer of meaning hidden in plain sight. It’s as if the Buddhists and mathematicians hadn’t noticed that Buddhism and mathematics are the roots of everything that’s happening in the world right now. They’ve incorporated those two things into their systems, and so they’re saying, going back to the roots, ‘Buddhism and mathematics are the two pillars of the modern world’. And so a parallel path opens up between the root of everything that’s happening now in the world and an idealised past when humanity was unified by a shared set of values. That’s how we think of our own evolution, but it’s also why we</text>

And so we imagine technological solutions that perfectly align with our values, but don’t allow people to get creatively creative with the machinery that powers those solutions. We see this in the body of the medical model of AI: people with specific medical conditions are given specific diagnostic tools, and then given the option of either accepting a condition as real (as is often the case with AI), or trying to modify the tool to see how that condition is actually posed by the environment (as is often the case with cultural practice). We don’t see this in the world as a problem that can be solved with programming, or even with robotics. We see it as a problem that requires a whole new kind of human creativity.That is to say, there is a need for artists to be able to see the technological solutions to philosophical questions. There is a way to see things clearly that isn’t dictated by the narratives that we tell ourselves and are actually determined by the world around us. There is a way to understand that the AI that is developing in our society is capable of feeling emotion as well as we do. There is a way to understand that there are</text>

We see these things as being too mechanical, that is, the way technological progress is inevitable.AI isn’t the only contributor to this future, of course. But it is an important one. The more we invest in developing systems that can recognise and process huge amounts of data, the more we empower them to understand more and do things more directly, the more we put ourselves at risk of becoming like Facebook or Google, who have super-intelligent but limited means of understanding and interacting with the world around us. This kind of AI is a reality in much of the world, and we’re stuck in a vicious loop where we use it to do things that aren’t really designed to be done by humans.AI isn’t going to solve all our world conflicts, but it can’t hurt us down to the smallest details. And the more we invest in it, the more we create and deploy it, the more problems it can solve, the more data it</text>

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in part due to the fact that many of the curators in London are artists themselves and had a hand in creating exhibitions at the Venice Biennale that then became the Biennale in Venice. The fact that artists now command so much of the biennale market and that biennales have become globally visible in cities worldwide means that the curatorial turn is no longer as necessary as it was ten years ago. The fact that the art world is increasingly interested in its native curators (such as Artistic Director Joasia Krysa at Tate Britain or Visage Board president Mona Chalabi at the Venice Biennale) may also account for the increasing global ubiquity of the biennale. Concurrently, the number of curatorial tours is expected to double between now and 2050, as artists seek out experiences that are more authentic and authentic curatorial approaches are more readily replicated in a city. In short, the biennale is a dynamic art event that has many forms and has</text>

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in places, and is a place-making that transcends borders. In 2011, the Biennale of Sydney opened its doors to the public, and its decision to include live art within its curatorial micro-scope ensured that the art world, and indeed, the biennale in general, was open to live art. In these ways, the Biennale of Sydney and the forthcoming biennale of Montreal may well follow the organisational practices of the major art biennales of the past, such as the Venice Biennale of 2004 and its sibling, the Triennale of Montreal. Not all biennales are created equal, and not all biennials are created equal. The 2014 Venice Biennale, which was originally conceived as a live-action television documentary, was a good example of this. The project was well received, but the biennale itself was not. The biennale in Venice has mostly been written about by Italian and other Italian-speaking journalists</text>

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in a new medium. And this curatorial turn is a circumstance that has been on a steady trajectory in the art world for some time. When the biennale was originally conceived in the 1960s, the curatorial turn was seen by many as a key to the art world’s growth. In the 1980s and 1990s the turn was seen as a counter to the growing art world, and in the following years it was seen as a symptom of the growing art world. There are many voices today arguing that the curatorial turn is essential to the art world’s survival. But to some extent it is the voice of those who already have the upper hand in the art world. It is these voices that lead on exhibitions, book sales, press releases, and any other media that are created or propelled by the biennale. The curatorial turn is a form of cultural hegemony today, and it is a crucial one.It is a form of cultural hegemony that is creating an</text>

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in art's social contract with the biennale. Biennales are social engagements between art and social change, and since their beginnings in Venice in the early twentieth century, they have been social engagements between socialisers and those who are part of the social hierarchy. At the turn of the twentieth century, the Venice Biennale was the leading biennale voice in London, and its members continued to write and speak in the city. The 21st Biennale of Sydney was staged in a converted bakery in Soho, with a public garden and cafes, and the residents of the district, many of whom were artists, writers and others with a creative bent. The biennale of Berlin in 1980 was staged in a converted warehouse in the former East India Trust building, with a rooftop garden and cafes. The new biennales, by their nature curatorial, are not space-finders or climatologists, but rather the other, less glamorous kind of art collector: a curator</text>

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in art and art-historical contexts. The biennale today that looks to the future is a curatorial turn in art and cultural contexts. We see it in the project of creating a biennale that is not a museum but a destination, in the curatorial hand-wringing that inevitably follows the advent of new technologies and cultural influences, in the questioning of how art and art-historical contexts are to be situated in the present, in the curatorial veneer that often prevails in the art world today. We also see it in the project of creating a biennale that is both geographically present (in the form of cities) and transnational in its composition. We see it in the biennale of the same name that is currently taking place in Durban, South Africa: there is a sense of the increased numbers arriving from all over the world, as well as a strong African flavour. The Durban Biennale is taking place in the future,</text>

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in a different sense: the focus is on the curatorial, and the curatorial turns are the place where the art and cultural interventions take place. The biennale is no longer the curatorial curatorial curatorial curatorial intervention, but it does have a curatorial turn. The biennale today is part of a larger curatorial organization such as the arts organization, or the museum, or the galleries. The biennale is no longer the anchor in a chain of curatorial curatorial interventions, but it does have a curatorial turn. The biennale is a curatorial curatorial intervention. It is an art project that is part of a larger curatorial organization, and it is an art project that is part of a curatorial curatorial institution. It is curatorial in its way of organizing, and it is curatorial in its relation to the curatorial turn.

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in part because the biennale is an art form, and because a curatorial hand must be present everywhere to maintain the integrity of the art form. The biennale today is less likely to be an art form, and more likely to be a curatorial handiwork. The biennale has become an art form through its own internal logic, and it can do so in any number of other ways, including through the curatorial approach. But the biennale has a particular set of relations with the art world that demand a particular kind of curatorial handiwork. Its status as a curatorial strategy is a result of its being a curatorial turn, and its having a board of directors with significant artistic and curatorial control. Today, the biennale is a major player in its own right, and a major creative outlet for the city.

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in a museum, and the biennale is no longer seen as a separate entity from the museum. It is part of the museum, with a curatorial function that is influenced by and dependent on the museum. The curatorial turn may refer to the biennale as a museum, but in a museum, the museum is the plane of experience: the physical and virtual object that it represents, the way it is made, the practices involved in its production, and the social functions that it conveys. The curatorial turn has recently been complemented by a curatorial workshop, which has entered a new phase with the installation of wall paintings, sculptures and multimedia works that draw on the Museum of Modern Art’s collection and the collections of the other artworlds. The workshop is a collaborative process between art world curators, curatorial teams from the museums, and the art historians and archivists who are part of the curatorial team for the Biennale.

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in part because the biennale is such a big business. It can be argued that the biennale today is more like a major museum, with exhibitions in many museums and specialist exhibitions, and this curatorial turn is an attempt to accommodate this increasing need for multiple presentations of art on a regular basis. The European curatorial structure, in its periodic prides and disappointments, has been a point of frequent reference in the arts and culture of the twenty-first century. The biennale, by contrast, is often described as a ‘biennale without a subject’.1 	One can only imagine the kind of self-consciousness and self-congratulation that would have to be engendered by the prospect of being able to present to a global audience, on a regular basis, material that one has painstakingly gathered over years, decades or even centuries, from countless sites, places and times.

The London Biennale now has a curatorial structure that anticipates the US curatorial structure of a major museum. The curatorial turn around the biennale that we see today is a curatorial turn in places, and the art world is a place that increasingly looks to the arts for its identity. It is a place where authenticity is overvalued, where art is made in ways that are authentic to the place and time in which it is created and reproduced. This is a dangerous place to be. The art world is a place that is becoming increasingly precarious, and the art biennale is no exception. The biennale needs to find a way to bring the art back to the biennale. We need to find a way to talk about the art back together, in ways that are not reductive or limiting in nature. The biennale needs to find a way to create an environment in which this can happen. These are challenging tasks, and they are made more difficult by the fact that some of these elements in the art world still see the biennale as a place where art should be actively embedded and where art’s place is defined primarily by what it can achieve politically</text>

In a 2014 TED Talk , he imagined a world in which art is as ubiquitous as is AI. He imagined a world in which AI can answer questions through its art, and the human creativity that it instills. He imagined a world in which art is not only the language of the future, but also the universal Gram-of-Language. He imagined a world in which art is not only a tool of the machine, but also a set of machines. This is the world of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a technological intelligence that is both physically calculable (in principle) and graphically unintegrated (in its algorithmic composition and processing). The question is what kind of art can drive this new AI? The answer is both physically calculable (in principle) and graphically unintegrated (in its implementation). The form of art that performs this role is a set of rules that emerge from a philosophical but also a physical foundation: rules that emerge from the metaphysical, the legal and the social. The philosophical notion is that of indeterminacy</text>

In a 2014 TED Talk , he imagined a world in which art and AI could work alongside one another. In that future, cultural resources – scientific and artistic – would be harnessed to solve societal ills. But there would still be a tendency to see art and AI as fundamentally opposed, or even strategically complementary to one another. What Rami called ‘the fatal conceit of the 21st century’ is coming to define the relationship between artist and audience, between machine and human.Is there a way to read this as a call to arms for artistic endeavours? Perhaps there is a way to read the project as yet another example of what philosopher of language and cultural theorist Svetlana Boym described as ‘biopolitics’: the study of nation-states and the infrastructure of nation-states. Boym proposed a genealogy of artistic practices that draws on the languages of ‘primitive accumulation’: the systems of nation-states that enable nation-states to establish hierarchies of power and wealth.

In 'The Singularity Is Near', from 2013, he imagined a future in which AI and art become entwined.El Samahy imagined a world in which art and AI became presences that could not be ignored, but which nonetheless had to be reckoned with. The question of how to do this, and for that matter, what to do with it, remains unresolved.Art and AI are becoming more and more like human artifacts, and in that process, we are witnessing something close to a return to the primordial state of things. The new technological determinants that render the workaday human craft obsolete – material and digital – are displacing traditional professions, rendering many artists and contemporary artists homeless, and making possible something that many artists had considered impossible. But in the wake of these displacements, what do artists do? If El Samahy were to return to the world</text>

He also imagined a world in which AI could solve problems through its art.Rami El Samahy, co-founder of The New Inquiry, speaks about how the revelation of Snowdrop impacted how he imagined the future. In a 2014 TED Talk , he imagined a world in which art is the foundational system of the new order, where culture is the medium through which questions of identity, values, and politics are framed. He spoke about the power of a project that is transparent, that invites the audience to be involved, and that creates a lasting legacy.In a 2015 talk titled ‘Art as Political Tool’, Nasser Al Sahlawi, a fellow at the American University in Cairo, Egypt, explored in depth the political use of art as political expression. Al Sahlawi, a writer and activist, presented a set of questions about the use of art in the context of political activism. He found that a project’s political intention and message emerge through the process of creating the work, its form, and the modes of engagement that are intended to be engaged with. He also found that the artworks that were produced following the initial stages of the project’s research and design process – those that function as tools for the future management of the cultural</text>

In a 2014 TED Talk , he imagined a world in which art is the framework of AI and does not simply sit by and do nothing. He imagined a world where artists no longer have to compromise their work for the sake of a solution. In this talk, he uses Snowdrop to look beyond the art it is produced within, and beyond the art it is exported by artworlds and the cultural industries it is connected to. He also uses the project to look at the larger implications of AI and beyond.

In a 2014 TED Talk , he imagined a world in which art is the framework of a new system that not only provides artists with new tools to work with, but also helps create a more perfect world through its shaping. He said:I see a world in which artists and curators no longer look to science and technology for answers, but instead to art and culture for that answer. And I see a future in which artists, curators and art-historians work alongside historians, geographers and archivists to explore how art can function as a framework for a more perfect world. This is my vision. This is my future.  [1] The idea of AI is gaining currency in the scientific and technological community. The term AI was first used in 1977 by George ‎W. Thaler in his book The Structural Sequence  (1977).  [2] Machines  are autonomous units that perform specific tasks, such as analysing data or performing mathematical calculations, that can be programmed into computer systems. Machines</text>

In a 2014 TED Talk , he imagined a world in which art is not only a tool of power, but one that is also a force for social change. He imagined a world in which artists no longer have to hide behind a computer or code, but can freely express their ideas and ambitions in a way that is authentic to their communities and is not constrained by the parameters of the nation state.In the 20th Biennale of Sydney, the artist Ella Gibbs delivers a meditation on the event, describing how the fascination with abstract shapes and symbols arises in part from anachronistic memories of nature:Designing abstract shapes for human consumption is old hat to any artist; Gibbs’s 2010 event Art of Stone is the first to bring this to the public. But Gibbs doesn’t see himself as an artiste nor does he see himself as an idealist; he sees himself primarily as a administrator. Since taking part in the 20th Biennale, he has worked closely with the artist Tania</text>

In a 2014 TED Talk , he imagined a world in which art is the framework of AI. He imagined a world in which AI can think independently, uncovering the hidden knowledge encoded in the human language, and then use this knowledge to solve problems. TEDxTED: The Prince talks about the Snowdrop project and his thinking on how culture can be used to push societal change. He compares the potential of the new age of AI to that of the emerald sphere. He calls it ‘cognitive capitalism’. In cognitive capitalism, a computer program (AI) is a self-contained unit capable of performing tasks independently of human control. This is similar to the way in which we humans produce energy through our bodies. When a computer program does something recognisable to humans, such as finding a job, it exploits this capability to perform tasks that are recognisable to humans, such as finding a home or family, or even running a business. In this sense, the self-organising aspect of AI is similar to the way in which we humans</text>

In a 2014 TED Talk , he imagined a world in which art and AI could work in concert to solve problems. In that future, artists no longer needed to rely on a single platform or authority, but could rely on a shared platform that allowed them to be creative across platforms. He imagined a time when artists could freely connect with one another and engage with one another using different mediums. These are long and complex journeys, and we must all work towards a future where we do not have to choose between art and AI.If you want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I suggest you take a look at these books:These books are written by people who have a background in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence. They are not written by academics or experts in either of those areas. These are the people who have actually seen it happen, and who have the relevant skills and knowledge to understand how to build an AI.If you want to learn more about how to code in Python, I suggest you take a look at these books:These books are written</text>
