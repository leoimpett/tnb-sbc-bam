    Should Be Curated by an Artist'I met Kate in Liverpool last week. She told me a bit about how she had come to collaborate with an artist from Liverpool, and how that was going. It was an incredibly moving and powerful thing to do, to be part of a project that was so much more than an art project. I couldn’t have done it without her.There is a connection between curating and programming, I suppose. The idea of the biennial is to take a project on its own, to take things on their own trajectory, to see what happens. And I’m not saying that the Liverpool Biennial could or should do that, but it’s the idea of the programme that’s being put through. There is a tension there, between the curatorial and the programming dynamics. I don’t think it has the same force in Berlin or New York, where artists have more control.

But in Berlin and New York, the tension is palpable. It�s like the Greek and Roman crisis: the more you tear it apart, the more it comes together, the more it resembles the image you had in your head, the deeper the division is, and the more it resembles reality.In both Syriac and Venice, there was a real sense of time and effort being put into the creation of the biennale itself, in terms of the architecture, the collection, and the exhibition. In no way was the effort being put into the production of the event itself. The public relations department was as immersed in its Byzantine task as they were in bringing it to life. The fact that the biennale was being curated by an institute, and not an individual, was quite remarkable. People would come from miles around to be part of the Byzantine world. The Byzantine world is the Byzantine world.I remember one woman from Beverly Hills telling me how she had come to see this event as an act of rebellion against her own cultural expectations. She was identifying with</text>

But in Berlin and New York, the tension is palpable. It�s happening now between the artist and the communities, between the artist and the communities, and between the artist and the local authorities. The tensions are enormous.I don’t think the tensions are imaginary, either. The bonds that people feel when they’re part of a community are real. I don’t think the tensions are imaginary either. But the tension that arises between the two is different from the first tension. That first tension is about control.In the second tension, the narrative that emerges is different from the image that emerges. The image is about the project, the artist and the community. The curatorial/programme tension has a much stronger effect on what can and cannot be said in a city, and so it’s much harder to create a narrative that is open to being questioned. The image has to be approved by the city council. And I think that the inclusion of the artist in that meant-and-promise was a much stronger element</text>

But in Berlin and New York, the tension is palpable. It�s this strange relationship that the biennial and contemporary art has today.I thought to bring up Steve Gooch’s exhibition Constructing Public Space: Art from the Participatory Curatorial Perspective. It’s a very interesting book, with a very political perspective. Some of the curators that he talks to are very vehement advocates of the idea that participation is now so normalized that it becomes a form of intelligence, and that there is no longer a conscious effort to define what participation means. And they’re absolutely right. But on the other hand, there are a number of curators that are absolutely appalled by the fact that there is no longer a collective will or agenda in place to actually direct the development and implementation of art projects. There is a disconnect there, where the curators feel that they’re being left behind, and the artists. That was a point of contention. The fact that the biennial is being curated by an organisation called Birk</text>

But in Berlin and New York, the tension is palpable. It�s like the tension in the film Groundhog Day, where the same guy goes back and forth between present and past, and it’s very interesting to watch him do it. There is that same tension, which is very similar to the tension that artists and the biennial might have in a way that programming is different.I remember one time, around ten years ago, someone had brought a bunch of scripts that had been put together in a notepad. Some of the scripts, from different points in time, were pieced together to form a whole narrative. For me, the idea of the notepad was a very interesting one. It allowed a kind of free association with what was happening in a different timeline, which allowed a very different interpretation to be given to certain events in that timeline — which I think is one of the tools of the bureaucratic state. I think the idea of the notepad was problematic, and I think that’s why some artists got expelled from the Bi</text>

But in Berlin and New York, the tension is palpable. It�s as if the Biennial is saying, ‘We want to do this on our terms, on our schedule, and in our city’s cultural landscape’. It’s an incredible challenge to put something on schedule, creatively, and in the city’s cultural landscape.There was a strange moment when I suggested that the Biennial might want to call its art-performatment what it is: a residency. That seems a bit limiting, and I’m not saying it doesn’t work, but it’s limiting to define what the Biennial is trying to do. It’s saying, ‘We’ve got art to be here, and we’re trying to figure out how to live with that art’. In a way, I think that was the weirdest thing for the Biennial to do. The most exciting thing for me was when the Biennial organised the residency, because that was</text>

But in Berlin and New York, the tension is palpable. It�s as if the Biennial is asking, What do I do with my time?And what does the Biennial do with its time? I don’t think the answer is to be found in programming or art projects. The answer is to be found in what is referred to as ‘the biennial condition’. That is, the condition that artist-organisations are obliged to accept as a condition of future membership in an organisation. And I think that is a very difficult thing for curators to do, to put it simply. It is the very essence of what they are trying to do.I met another artist recently who was working in New York. She was working with a different team on a different project. And she said: ‘I’m thinking about coming to America.’ I think that is incredibly brave of her to do. She is not asking for permission to come to the US, but I think that is a very brave thing to do</text>

But in Berlin and New York, the tension is palpable. It�s a huge difference. Kate, I’m thinking about it. You have this idea, which is so powerful, but what happens after the project is completed – what do you do? – is where the real drama and tension is. I don’t know if it’s fair to say, but from the perspective of the artist, the way the Liverpool Biennial is organising itself, and the way things are working between the artist and the organisation, the way it creates this continuous flow of new work, is very much a performance and improvisation. It’s improvisation that is scripted and controlled, and so is the way in which that artist is able to operate.It’s the same with programming. I don’t know if it’s the same with programming, but what it’s doing is creating a narrative in advance of the piece of programming that comes out. So the piece of programming that comes out is an extended version</text>

But in Berlin and New York, the tension is palpable. It�s like two completely different kinds of love; one that’s based on music, and the other that’s based on science. The German language doesn’t have the same root as in America, so when you’re programming in the DNA of a particular organism, you’re also programming in the DNA of another organism. This is the DNA of the biennial, as a concept. It’s an evolving, evolving process, and the more you do it, the more you encounter new things and come to understand how the world works.The other thing is that when you do things on your own, you do things out of habit. I once taught a class in which the theme was ‘Make Your Own Future’. The idea was that you’d make something new out of nothing, with or without DNA. My students did amazing work on this, turning a simple object – a box of cereal – into a wondrous, magical</text>

It�s as though the Biennial is asking, and the artist has an answer: ‘That would be awful, wouldn’t it?’But there is a tension there, too: between curatorial and programming, between the two. If the tension is too great, the art will fail. But the Biennial is trying to be as flexible as it can be, and there is that tension. It’s interesting, the way in which the artist has responded: it doesn’t seem like the project has been as hard on its exterior. It’s as if the Biennial has been brutally objective: as soon as the project was dubbed a success, the art was automatically deemed great and the process over. It’s as though the artist, the curatorial administrator, had an agenda: ‘What can we make of this?’. And so the tension between the artist and the curatorial administrator is palpable.But the other thing is</text>

It�s that difference between when the artist is putting the artwork out there for public consumption, and when the public is choosing to consume it. The idea of the biennial in its current form, and for the foreseeable future at least, is a recipe for conflict.Download this article as PDFKate HoffmanKate Hoffman is an independent writer, curator, artist and researcher.

In turn, the communities responded by creating a network of artists who could be used as artists or provided other resources, such as funding or relationships, to allow the artist to do what she wanted with the artwork. The models of art production in which these two art forms found themselves were precursors of what we would later call the ‘public gallery’.6  The public gallery is a term given by Welsh Streets Community Land Trust for areas of the street directly in front of the Trustees’ houses where artists’ studios were often situated. It was here that the Community Land Trust developed strategies to activate the art within the community. Creative writing was formed, as a form of community organisation, and the strategies of the artist were brought to bear in this process. Creative action was taken in these areas in an attempt to generate awareness and spark change.  One such artist initiative that was put forward by the Welsh Streets Community Land Trust was Chaz Bono ‘Who Shot Charlie Brooklin’.</text>

In the communities, the role of the artist was seen as a resource that could be used to liberate other people’s art. In turn, the communities responded by creating artist-run associations and clandestinely slipping the arts administration a change of name to use in the new Curatorial Policy. This was seen by the administration as a way to roll out a new policy of collective purchase of cultural resources – a policy that would allocate funding according to the community needs. It became a way to legitimise the appropriation of other people’s cultural assets. This was seen as a threat by the administration, and as a response to the work of the artist-organisation. In an attempt to reduce conflicts of interest, the administration withdrew funding from projects that it did not want to support. This did not sit well with the Arts Council, who launched an internal review of the policies that day. They found that the administration had overreached itself with the allocation of funds and had undermined the trust placed in it by withdrawing funding. They also raised concerns about the possible conflict of interest between the administration’s support for artists and the provision of arts resources to communities. The</text>

In the communities, the role of the artist was seen as a resource that could be used to liberate other people’s art. In turn, the communities responded by creating their own artist-run murals, street art and installations around the area. The development of self-managed alternative cultural environments was also a way to find new ways to engage the arts organisation without having to compromise the integrity of the projects they were working with. The initiative was not an easy sell in the community, but it did have support from the Arts Council, who saw an opportunity to expand its remit and experiment with new work forms. 	There was also an impetus from above to intervene more deeply. In the 1980s and 1990s, a lot of the intervention was done through education programmes and events. But increasingly the intervention was done through organisations such as arts councils, who continued to provide funding for arts education but now also wanted to explore new work forms. The Arts Council organised a series of events in an attempt to establish a working relationship with the new work forms. These included Bluecoat (Bluecoat in High Street) Days of Action, a community arts event in</text>

In the communities, the role of the artist was seen as a resource that could be used to liberate other people’s art. In turn, the communities responded by creating collaborative art projects with the intention of empowering the artist as much as possible. The response was mutual: the art was produced and supported by the communities, the communities provided the guidance and support, and the communities collectively organised the activities. This model of collaboration was different from the original public curatorial model because it was initiated and supported by the arts organisation as a whole rather than by an individual artist. The Granby community started its own curatorial programme, called Granby Arts Centre. The Granby Arts Centre had been started by a local community to carry on the tradition of collaboration between artists and the community. Through a kind of ‘gift’ they had acquired a collection of painting, sculpture, tile, wooden and fabric items, which they had used to set up a local community art project. The items had a life of their own, surviving for years in the community in community centres, schools, youth clubs, community halls, and</text>

In turn, the communities responded by creating networks of artists, teachers, artists’ organisations and other resources to make their own art. The result is that in many ways, the two processes that emerged from the meeting of the Curators' Exchange and the people who created the maps, jingle and the arts materials are actually quite distinct. However, in the new millennium, things have moved beyond the art context and now consider also consider how the arts can be used to positively impact other aspects of our lives, creating and supporting a network of artists, artisans, designers and other professionals who work in or with the community. This is why it is so exciting for a community to be able to embark on a project with an organisation such as the Liverpool Biennial, through the exchange of artists, designers, artists’ organisations and other professionals, as part of a wider biennale or museum-going experience. The artworks produced through this process may or may not be representative of the art practices of the community; it is a snapshot</text>

In the communities, the role of the artist was seen as a resource that could be used to liberate other people’s art. In turn, the communities responded by creating what came to be known as the Community Arts Forum (CAFE). The two organisations established an agreement to collaborate on a per-project basis, with the Community Arts Forum assuming responsibility for the project. This was seen by many as an invitation to become involved, and this was also seen as an invitation to leave the project. To some extent, both of these things can be said to have been authentic desires, but to others, a manipulation of the narrative. That there was a war going on in the 1980s is a big part of what made the public appear mobilised and engaged. In a way, there is still a strong generational difference between the communities and the artists, although in most cities at least a majority of artists were born between the 1970s and 1980s. Today, the artists who came out of the gate in the 1980s are going to be largely replaced by artists who came out of the gate in the 1990s, and artists who came out of the gate in the early</text>

In turn, the communities responded by creating networks of artists, creating art societies and other organisations that promoted the work of Community Arts professionals, and inviting other artists to develop collaborative strategies with those communities.  One of the most successful strategies was for an artist to create a Community Arts professional network through which Community Arts professionals could be identified and invited to work with the Community Arts projects. This was done, for example, with the Bluecoat Community Arts practitioners who were invited to develop a Community Arts workshop for the Bluecoat Community Centre. Overcoming blockades and opposition  was one way of educating the authorities about the potential of Arts programs to change behaviour. Another strategy was created by Community Arts practitioners and their networks to bring Community Arts projects to life through Community Arts design. The strategy involved learning from the successes and failures of the Bluecoat Community Arts programme, while empowering the Community Arts professional in the same way that the artists themselves</text>

In turn, the communities responded by creating artist-run associations and contributing to the creation of the biennale. The biennale has become a way of life for the communities, a source of pride for the city and even a burden for those outside of the biennale: tourists, academics, journalists. The biennale as a cultural form has become embedded in the city. It is a way of life for people to come to the biennale, and the art, stories, images, histories and politics that shape that experience. It is a way to come together as a community to talk about and make art together. In some ways, the biennale has become what it is because of the collaborative process that was started between people from different contexts, but it is also about culture as a collective cultural form that is much more readily accessible to a global audience. The biennale as a cultural form has become embedded in the city. It is a way of life for people to come to the biennale,</text>
    <text>machines were asked to take over the curatorial role. The role was slowly taken over by artists, writers and other community organisers, but in the centre was where the real action was. The new curatorial approach to art was a collaborative process between curator and community. It began with a series of one-to-one meetings between the two communities, with the intention of learning how to work together more effectively. The intention was to create a collaborative model of art being produced in partnership with local communities. These meetings were a first attempt to create a relationship between the two community groups, but the aim was ultimately to create a model of collaborative production between the arts and wider community. The intervention was made in these meetings as a way to help create a relationship more effectively. This did not come as a surprise to the communities who had been asking for it for a long time. In the communities, the role of the artist was seen as a resource that could be used to liberate other people’s art. In turn, the communities responded by creating what came to be known as the Community Arts movement. The Community Arts movement was not just an expression of the imagination of the communities; it was a set of practices that were grounded in a set of beliefs and values. As such, it was seen as a way to create a more dignified future for the artists and their communities. The way in which the system was set up, and the people who were entrusted with its management, made it possible for artists to work with communities and engage with their own community. This was seen as a positive development, even though some community organisers felt that the artist representative capacity in the system had been curtailed. This need not have been the case, in the system was full of talented people who had a responsibility to learn and engage with the community in a meaningful way. Nevertheless, the development of a direct relationship between the artist and the community had many benefits for the community. It increased the power of the community, who had greater agency in the system. It</text>

This was an artistic collective that promoted the work of the artist’s locality through projects such as The Community Land Trust, which provided artistic and educational support to community groups, exhibitions, performances, workshops etc. The Community Land Trust was a unique example of a non-profit organisation that emerged due to the failure of state-sponsored art institutions. It emerged as a result of the intervention of a community of artists, community organisers and others, who saw an opportunity to make a difference through creative direct action. While the Community Land Trust and The Community Project did not have the resources of a state to support a successful implementation of the ideas, their actions encouraged the state to action. A grant was made by the Arts Council, which allowed the development of a Community Arts organisation, which was then placed under the auspices of the Great Ormond Street Theatre Workshop. This organisation was created to carry on the work of the Community Land Trust</text>

School and art’s relationship should be informed by a mutual respect and admiration.  And if that is not possible, then perhaps the relationship between art and the city should be encouraged in the same way that f</text>

Such a cultural team is necessary to engage the local population and generate the desired change, because if it is not going to change the city, then it is not going to have a major impact. And such change is desperately needed because the art world as a whole is going to need to change, and soon. There is going to be a massive influx of artists, curators, artists’ assistants and curatorial styles in the coming years that cannot be accommodated, and is going to change the nature of the art museum; it is going to require a massive restructuring of the role of the museum. When going back to California, I plan to take a year away from the art world and create an entirely new team of curators and artists. I will hire a new team from the local community to work directly with the older team of artists and curators to ensure that the new team fully engages the community, even if it is just by meeting them in person or through video conference. I will also establish a new agency that will support the development of an entirely new team of artists and curators, completely independent from the previous one.  Such multi-disciplinary curatorial approaches are</text>

But such cultural teams are also essential to developing long-term strategies to change the culture of a neighbourhood or larger city, and to provide long-term financial sustainability for such efforts, because such action is both cultural and economic suicide. Such teams exist in their own right, and can provide valuable input to the city’s creative process, but their real value lies in their ability to generate change and giving voice to the people who are most affected by it, through collaboration and negotiation. This is why it is so crucial for artists to have authentic and collective voices in creative processes, because without that power, there is no creative process. Likewise, there is no way to know what is actually happening in the city without being part of a creative team, because without that kind of weight, you are not going to be able to change things. [1] Interview with Margaret Thatcher,  	The One Show, 1992.

It must be able to respond to local needs and desires, and it must address the big picture of the city’s decline, which is of course where the multi-billion dollar real-estate development, mixed-use and financial booms end and the pains begin. So how do we create a culturally responsive, sustainable and equitable arts and landscape architecture team? We could start with asking the relevant stakeholders in the city, but this is where collaboration and partnerships need to happen between artists, city councillors, academics, grassroots groups and community groups.

Environmentalists view art as inherently a political act, and as such its political value is uncertain. Its potential is understood by those with access to political means, but its actualisation is understood by those without such means. Art is, therefore, seen as having a definite impact on the political landscape and so, although access to resources and means may be available to an artist to engage with a given political situation, such potential is necessarily constrained by the ability of the state to collectively and permanently encompass all of us in a political space. So the art-environmentalist viewpoint regards the politics of art as having</text>

The key is to find creative ways of organising the diverse members of the team, while maximising the impact of the cultural activity in the city at the same time. One may argue that such cultural teams exist already, and are widespread in many cities, yet few realize that ‘[a]lthough they may exist, they are limited in their effectiveness and may actually be hindering change’. If art is art, then surely cultural managers should actively seek out creative ways of engaging the art form within their art squads, and perhaps actively involve artists in such cultural activities in order to reap the benefits and avoid the responsibilities? [2] A list of curators and artists can be found at http://www.uclc.ac.uk/PLATE/1990/UPLOAD.txtDownload this article as PDFJennifer EastonEaston is Professor in the Department of Communication Studies and the Arts and Creative Writing at Goldsmiths College,</text>

But this is often said to be the case in communities of colour, for whom art and cultural institutions are often more visible and accessible, and whose economies are more responsive to the value system that art creates. Cultural institutions and their resources have always been scarce for people of colour, and today even for those of us of normal colour. In fact, the rich white people tend to patronise arts and cultural activity</text>

City resources such as housing, schools, parks and recreation are valuable in their value today, but they are not valuable today unless they are distributed equally across the people who inhabit them and create or contribute to the city. Therefore, the cultural resources of the city today are those who are urban poor and represent a particular set of behaviours and vocations.</text>

It will be a moment when the status of art and culture in the city actually comes under attack. It will be a moment when artists are able to step out of the box, and really engage the public in engaging with art and in creating their own practices.Art and culture are often conflated. The emphasis is on the physical and social, but simultaneously the other. The fact of its existence is seen as a mark of social status, and a way to assert one’s identity and identity politics.

When we start thinking about what does and doesn’t make sense politically, culturally and economically in the city of Liverpool, we discover that there are other factors at play. For example, cultural production in the city is produced through partnerships between organisations – the Biennial, the Mary Pay &amp; Tony Bracken Foundation, the Grantham Foundation, the John Lennon Fund – which draw funds from a range of different areas of the city. These organisations then leverage the revenue generated from the Biennial, the Mary Pay &amp; Tony Bracken Foundation’s exhibitions and the Grantham Foundation’s projects to support a range of activities including research into economic regeneration strategies and the production of community arts projects across the city. These organisations then become strategic partners for the city’s cultural sector, helping to establish new artist-centred artist-run organisations or to expand existing artist-centred organisations.

When we stop defining our reality through the prism of what it is that we have or are made of, and start defining our reality through what we are made of, we discover that our identities aren’t static or certain; they are malleable. There are infinite possibilities. This is why identity politics—identity as a political entity—is so powerful. It allows people to be made in relation to one another. Art and culture are the vehicles that enable this moment.When I started in 2007, I had a specific idea about how the art institution had to engage the political question. I wanted to make a work that was political in nature. But I also wanted to engage with questions of identity and political agency. I wanted to create a work that would be able to stand up to scrutiny and that would be able to connect to people on a deep level. I also wanted to engage creatively with the fact that I was an artist rather than in a traditional or traditionalist way. I decided early on that my primary way of engaging with the political question would be through my career as an artist. I wanted to see what other forms I could develop in that regard. I began developing art projects in communities all over the city.</text>

When we stop defining our reality through the prism of what it is that we have or are made of, and start defining our reality through what we are made of, we discover that our identities aren’t static or certain; they are ever-migrating. And that is exactly what we are doing through the building of what’s now called ‘Liverpool Biennial’. We are discovering who we are made up of in the city, and making that visible through art.We are also discovering that cultural tourism is not just about a visit to a place; it’s about a relationship, and that cultural tourism has a financial and social dimension. The relationship that the tourism generates for the city, and the relationship that the community of travellers has for the local community, is a source of much needed cash flow. And that relationship is what’s being called ‘cultural tourism 2.0’, and it’s being created in large measure through the mediation of academics, journalists, artists and others with a view to understanding ‘how cultural tourism can play a part in supporting the city’s cultural sector’.It’s being done in two ways.

When we stop defining our reality through the prism of what it is that we have or are made of, and start defining our reality through what we are made of, we discover that our identities aren’t static or certain; they are ever-shifting. Identity formation through the prism of what it is that we have or are made of is a myth, and the only place where we can really experience the magic of indeterminacy is as a part of a community of like-minded individuals and collective actions. The fact of community life and the history of the community are fundamental to understanding how to move forward. When we stop looking for answers to certain problems through an objectified (technological) lens, but start looking for ways to meet needs that are not met through a static (humanistic) lens, we discover that human action can and should be based on principles that transcend the world as it is made to be. For example, the fact that we live in a climate that is changing at such a rapid rate has to be met with resistance, because it is threatening not only to the planet, but also to cultural institutions such as art institutions.

The realisation that we can create our own reality opens up possibilities for change and new practices. And that is precisely what art and culture are about. They are practices that constantly question and expose existing systems and identities. They are practices that actively seek to be made real, and that seek to become what they call ‘real’.The realisation that art and culture are tools that are constantly (but not always successfully) evolved and that need no fixed future comes about as a consequence of a constant need to redefine what it means to be an artist and what it means to be a cultural professional. The discovery that art and art history actually become somewhat interesting and instructive in the context of social struggle comes about as a consequence of the fact that social struggle actually becoming *real* is part of the contextualisation process.

The question is, how do we become conscious of our actuality? If we become conscious of the fact that we are constantly changing, then we begin to ask, ‘What does it mean to be an ‘in’?When I first started out as an artist, I didn’t have any idea how to think about the world through art and culture, or how to engage people in thinking about art and culture. I thought I was just making pictures; that all I did was take photographs. But gradually, over years, I began to understand that what I was doing was very important; it was becoming more and more of a form of resistance. I began to appreciate what art was actually – an art form that I had very little understanding of – and the importance of developing a critical and populist mindset through which to engage with the world.  As an undergraduate student, I worked with a fellow student from Liverpool University, who</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is going to be a pivotal moment in the history of art and culture in Liverpool, and beyond. It will be a moment when the status of art and culture in the city actually comes under attack. It will be a moment when artists are able to step out of the box, and really engage the public in engaging with art and in creating their own practices.Art and culture are often conflated. The emphasis is on the physical and social, but simultaneously the other. The fact of its existence is seen as a mark of social status, and a way to assert one’s identity and identity politics. But is that really the point? The fact of its existence is the point; it’s how we define ourselves as a people through it. When we stop defining our reality through the prism of what it is that we have or are made of, and start defining our reality through what we are made of, we discover that our identities aren’t static or certain; they are always open to change. This happened in the early twentieth century, when artists started changing their identities, and that was the point. In the twentieth century, the biennial was a transient exhibitionary venue, featuring a small number of selected artists, who then staged longer, more permanent exhibitions throughout Europe and North America. In the twenty-first century, the biennial is experiencing its own ambient relativism. It is no longer an exhibitionary venue, but a site of permanent, often disruptive curatorial action, where artists can be found engaging audiences from everywhere, including emerging and historical artists, as well as established and established artists. The biennial’s curatorial agenda is shifting towards events that occur during and in connection with the exhibitionary format, with particular focus on the emergent and ongoing cultural events of our age. This is evidenced by the increasing number of temporary exhibitions, which are now distributed across multiple venues, and the increasing number of festivals and pilgrimages.

When we stop defining our reality through the prism of what it is that we have or are made of, and start defining our reality through what we are made of, we discover that our identities aren’t static or certain; they are constantly fluid and open to change. So while the biennial may be a ‘mark’ of a city, it is an event that is capable of shifting and developing independently of its place in the city. It’s a moment when we can step outside of the static and actually create our own reality, opening up new possibilities for how we inhabit the city. In fact, the primary purpose of a biennial is to house and house itself. The museum is often seen as a permanent stand-in for the city, but while that is true to a degree, it is also true that the museum is often seen as a stand-in for the city as a whole. With the exception of the Venice Biennale, which is a museum of the city as a whole, and is supported by the biennale itself, which is an important piece of the overall tourism package, most biennials are actually quite distinctive in that they tend to house a specific kind of reality for</text>

And that is precisely what art and culture are made of: their very nature as objects of commerce and consumption shapes and generates new identities, identities forged along the routes of identity. The question is whether the new identities that are forged in the events of the biennial will be any more or less fluid and susceptible to the politics of nostalgia and consumer culture than the identities forged through the older forms of identity formation that were explicitly designed to oppress and constrain people.Download this article as PDFJussi ParikkaJussi Parikka is Professor of Exhibition Research at the University of Turku, Finland, and holds the Canada Research Chair in Exhibition Research and Exhibition Studies at the Victoria and Albert Museum, University of Turku.

The point is to be found in the activities that create change, and to that extent, art and cultural production.If we begin to produce more through what is now called ‘culture’, and indeed any cultural production at all, we will discover that social change often comes about through the back door, through a crack or a crevice. We will discover that social change comes about through what we do not yet know how to do, and that is why we need to actively seek out those things that we don’t yet know how to do. We need to be open to new ideas and creative solutions, because otherwise we will remain trapped in our ways, unable to move forward. Creative solutions may well emerge from the cultural and grassroots needs of the moment, but they are bound to certain assumptions and assumptions, and thus need to be actively resisted. For example, the need to politicise the arts may be great on one level, but it is both unrealistic</text>

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authority. The aim of these third workshops was to suggest strategies for the future of art’s social life, and for art’s role in such developments. These initiatives were not against contemporary art, but aimed at the socialisation of art’s production and consumption (of things, perhaps). Perhaps the most interesting development of this period was the emergence of alliances between curators, artists, art historians and art-historical societies. The Art Council, having recently staged a series of exhibitions of its work on the West Country, and the West India Gallery, which acts as a regional hub for artists, curators, art collectors and art educators, in the West India Gallery’s new format, the artist, Catherine Hall, became a co-curator of the West India Gallery’s new exhibition, Man of the Week, due to be shown from April to June 2018.

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authority (LE) – which were all part of the larger picture, and which interrelated in various ways. In this context, art’s social function – what it means to be an artist – was rendered more complex and its institutionalised form more volatile. 	Finally, over Christmas Eve and New Year ‘98, a Community Arts workshop was held in the Chisenhale Gallery, on the artists’ permanent home, Groundwork, an environmentally friendly arts and heritage site, situated in the Chisenhale district of Liverpool. More than 300 artists, curators and arts historians from all over the world, including Jane Addams, John Latham, Bruce Beal and Bill Brown, participated in a one-day workshop designed to equip them with the knowledge, skills and networks to tackle contemporary art’s complex social and cultural problems. Over the next year, a further 300 artists and curators from 30 countries took part in</text>

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authority. While the artist and the collector are bound by strict control mechanisms, the community is also a major actor in curating, art production and the circulation of artistic ideas. The community’s role, the workshop participants agreed, is one of engagement, not domination. The community would engage in its own way, creating, organising and engaging with art through activities such as learning from museums and galleries, writing to artists and organising meetings, events and gatherings. The community would also engage in cultural production through arts education and commissioning, organising museum exhibitions and mural collections and making art, painting, design and design agencies. This last last aspect is a major concern of the local authority, which is keen to stress that it is creating an artist-centred school of art, but also keen to point out that it is investing in an area with a significant number of homes built on previous art practices. 	The area is a prime location for such engagement.</text>

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authority. Its capacity to react to changing circumstances was determined by the social and political values that dominated the time, and which included ideas of progress, resistance and despair. 	The fourth workshop, organised by the Arts Council and The Chisenhale Gallery, considered the ways in which art might be made today in response to the crises of our times. It highlighted the artworks that are being made today in response to the crises of our times, but which are also being made in ways that exacerbate their problems – because we are too busy creating more of them. This last workshop, at The Chisenhale Gallery, I moderated, alongside the artists, curators and art historians that formed the curatorial team for the forthcoming Oxford Arts Festival, 2017, and to be held in the Oxford Arts Centre, September 2018.

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authority. Some had studied under distinguished artists such as Wittgenstein, Degas and Rembrandt. 	The impact of art collections today is much more diffuse and unpredictable. We do not know which artists are leaving and joining, and the politics of art are complex. But we do know that the number of exhibitions has risen every year since 2002, and that in 2015 alone there were more than 6,700 exhibitions of art and contemporary art around the globe. This is a dramatic increase over the 500 exhibitions of art and contemporary art during the 1970s. So perhaps it is not surprising that the number of art books published after 2002 increased twentyfold. 	The impact of these two large-scale periodic increases is that there are now over 3,000 museums with a visitor base of over 10 million people, and over 200,000 online. These numbers do not include the many smaller museums that exist in Asia and the Middle East, or the many art-related activities that are conducted</text>

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authority, to name only a few. The emergence and ongoing of local arts and cultural organising tools such as the Chisenhale gallery and The Chisenhale Gallery Workshop was supported by grants from the Arts Council, The Chisenhale Gallery and The Chisenhale, as well as funding from the Arts Commission, Visionhoughton Foundation and Arts Council England. 	A deeper dive into the philosophical underpinnings of local arts organising can be found in John Berger’s book  	The Art of Not Being Governed 	, first published in 1971.1 It is worth noting that the phases of the cultural hygiene discourse – from its social origins in the 1970s with the publication of the book of common sense by the arts educators The Art and the Class 	 and its historical development with the formation of the Community Arts organisation, to the present-day discussions of the necessity of cultural hygiene through initiatives such</text>

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authorities. It is this third group of intermediaries that created the mechanisms that allowed for the exchange of ideas and knowledge across borders; for artists to be able to exploit cultural resources; and for communities to establish their own cultural resources. The Arts Council was a key site of exchange – a site where artists could be educated and encouraged about the organisations that organised and supported them, and a place where they could explore alternative art practices. The Arts Council schools programme (which followed the Chisenhale Gallery workshops) was a major site of exchange, with both artists and curators from the two organisations engaging with the other’s curriculum. The two most successful artists in the schools at the time, Samantha Jones and Manolis Papastergiadis, developed careers as artists and artists’researchers. The exchange also took place on social media, with the local artists opening up new media outlets to the wider public. Curators, artists and artists’</text>

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authority. Nevertheless, they concluded, it is vitally that the art form engages with these social and political conditions, and that it functions effectively and creatively in the social totality. In their view, effective art is that which is effective in creating social change, and art is art insofar as it is socially engaged. They proposed three parallel but related strategies for the future of contemporary art – continuation, reciprocity and repetition. Continuing contemporary art must address the specific social and political contexts in which it is made; it must exist in a temporality beyond the immediate, and it must have a continuing impact. This last condition is critical for effective art to exist. If it is to be considered art, it must be remembered and relived and repeated. If it is to be considered a memorial, then it must be remembered and actively engaged with in the present and future by contemporary artists and curators. They proposed three parallel but related strategies for the future of contemporary art: continuation, reciprocity and repetition. Continuing</text>

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authority – and thus understood the importance of developing skills in mediatorship. This workshop was organised by the Arts Council and Chisenhale Gallery and was attended by over 200 people. 	When the Chisenhale Gallery was first established in 1887, it was an arts organisation that promoted the intimacy of community through mutual aid and service to others. These activities continued through the years, as well as in the twenty-first century through workshops and exhibitions that continue to this day. The Chisenhale Gallery was a major force in the formation of the Black Papers, the first black-and-white colour photographs published in the  Black Print in London. The Chisenhale Gallery was a major force in the formation of the Liverpool Papers, the first newspaper articles published in Liverpool.

The participants saw art as a system that functionsed through a number of intermediaries – the artist, collector, gallery and local authorities. Their task was to imagine how art might operate in a more complex social, economic and cultural context, and in that process to imagine how art might liberate not only the social, but also the cultural. The participants saw the potential of funding agencies, arts councils, local authorities, cultural organisations and foundations, but also of course the artist and his or her artists to revolutionise a global art-funding and art-recruitment industry. 	In a final workshop, organised by the Chisenhale Gallery, artists and curators discussed the impact that their interventions had, and how they perceived the potential of art as a social-service. The wide range of people who came, and the complexity of their concerns, encouraged the participants to engage with a range of different approaches to the problem at hand. The impact of their interventions, so far, is mixed. But their conversations and creative approaches to the problem suggest that the problems they confront may yet be useful in creating new political,</text>

And this idea is often expressed in a way that exploits those who visit the destination. And here’s the rub: as culture tourism goes, this is a very dangerous game to be in. We’re constantly bombarded with information about the place in which we’re staying, and so the ideas we’re given about the place are often clouded with metaphors of nostalgia and wonder. And the problem with this is that in an era of infinite information, this kind of thinking produces a kind of escapism. It’s as if the artifice that you’re putting up for sale is more valuable than the artefact itself. And when that happens, the market forces you to make a profit. And so the idea of the cultural tourism ­roadtrip’ comes to dominate what can and cannot be marketed to the masses. The other problem with the notion of the cultural tourist is that there’s a kind of pre-existing gap of criticality between the artifice and the people who inhabit it, and</text>

And so there is a double bind: if the art is good, but the art is not good enough, there is a double negative: you have the art of being in the art museum, but if the art is not good enough, you are stuck with the infrastructure of the museum. 	[4] 	[5] This double negative is a recurring theme in Varela’s book, which is characterized as follows:  	The fundamental problem with cultural tourism today is the double negative. When the art is good, but the experience is ‘negative’, which is to say, it is aesthetically ambiguous and easily manipulated, but when the art is not good, it is not easy to define or quantify precisely what the ‘negative’ entails. The problem with cultural tourism today is precisely that it depends so much on the perceived good looks of the host city’s youth, and on the belief that the cultural tourism package can</text>

And this idea is often expressed in a way that exploits those who visit the destination as if the destination were a place of infinite possibilities and infinite failure. And this is exactly what we do with curfews and restrictions and the idea that the destination should be empty:  	There is a kind of a taboo in the destination-industry about which there is such a thing as a cultural tourism commission. And this is what the Giraud sisters, Gianna and Paola, did: they funded the commissioning, they created the images, they curated the events, and then they stayed for the final leg: the destination visit. But what they did not factor into the equation was the fact that this was their very intimate and personal journey as tourists, what they had to share with the public, what they had to do to survive. And their self-imposed isolation was one of the main motivations for the project: as soon as the commissioning began to lose its meaning, they stepped back and said, ‘No, this has to stop.’</text>

[4] This is the urbanisation of cultural tourism, or ‘cultural tourism’, which emphasizes the links between the travel and destination, and between the landscapes and their nomadic cultural tourism industries. Art, landscape architecture, and the nomadic cultural traveller are the protagonists in this tourism framing of things. Art’s ubiquity in this context suggests a certain amount of commodification, although the commodity that we might think of as ‘cultural tourism’ is in fact a ‘financial commodity’: a tool for facilitating travel between cities.

Yellowbird’s José Miguel Varela describes the cultural tourism angle as follows:  	Tourism is a business that depends on the idea that there is some sort of return on investment for the investment. And this idea is often expressed in a way that exploits those who visit the destination, since these destinations are then thought of as the pre-eminent example of something that was once great in the world. But this isn’t always the case. In the past, cultural tourism also referred to trips to places of historical significance, but this is no longer the case. The dominant market for such tourism is now located in the cities that are part of the developed capitalist world, and these cities are then the main entry points for the surplus of surplus labour generated by the globalised capitalist economy. And so we see a multibillion-dollar business model being built on the back of the cultural tourism industry, which in turn depends on the surplus of labour. The question is, what does it profit from exploiting the labour of others? 	[4] As Varela describes, the cultural tourism angle became critical in the 1980s and 1990s as a way to connect the cities that are part of the capitalist itinerary with the places where surplus labour is</text>

Yellowbird’s José Miguel Varela describes the cultural tourism angle as follows:  	Tourism is a business that depends on the idea that there is some sort of return on investment for the investment. And this idea is often expressed in a way that exploits those who visit the sites, presenting them in a different way than the places actually do. For example, the idea of ‘the Renaissance’ is often used to describe the urban regeneration projects of the 1990s, but very few of the people who make those decisions are from the city. The truth is that a lot of these decisions were driven by the art institutions, particularly the major galleries, who saw an opportunity to expand their programming due to the popularity of art as a curatorial tool. And they’d done that by establishing cultural tourism as a distinct segment of itinerary travel. 	[4] 	[5] Between the 1980s and the 1990s, the level of urbanisation in Portugal increased; between 2005 and 2011, the number of people living in Lisbon increased by nearly 6 million. 	[6] The number of taxis in Lisbon increased by almost 4,000% between 2000 and 2011. Tipping is a cultural concept in Portugal, with over 1</text>

Yellowbird’s José Miguel Varela describes the cultural tourism angle as follows:  	Tourism is a business that depends on the idea that there is some sort of return on investment for the investment. And this idea is often expressed in a way that exploits those who visit the destination. For example, if you visit the Burj Khalifa in New York and the Taj Mahal in Calcutta and Calcutta Museum of Modern Art, you are actually ‘re-entering the city’ and are entering a ‘different world’ – into the world of cultural tourism. 	[4] The concept of cultural tourism is often used in an economic sense in relation to the production of itinerary goods and services. In the case of curatorial curating, cultural tourism is understood as a production for itinerary goods and services. The activities of cultural tourism entities, their curatorial practices, the content of their sales pitches, the level of their public support and much more is understood through the language of itinerary as opposed to destination. This is understood especially by those who work with, or are part of, the itinerary industry themselves. The notion of the ‘end point’ in relation to the production of itinerary goods</text>

And this idea is often expressed in a way that exploits those who visit the destination: exploiting the aesthetic, the historical, the geographical. And this is exactly what we see with cultural tourism: the idea that there is some sort of return on investment in being able to visit a destination, but also in knowing that there is some sort of return on investment in being able to remember where the destination is. The memory of the urbanisation of places is often damaged by the forgetting of time, which is why cultural tourism is so important in our urban histories. It is a kind of time bomb that we cannot seem to put off detonating.[4]  	[5] This is a variant of Varela’s thinking, although I think his account of the cultural tourism angle is somewhat flawed. Cultural tourism is thought to result in a kind of ephemeral ‘capital of culture’, an image that is constantly on the move, constantly available and reshaped by the whim of various stakeholders. This kind of capital is often described as �</text>

And this is what we see with cultural tourism: the return trips, the mate trips, the ‘cubs’, the ‘monorail’ and all the rest. And this is exactly what the curators at the Venice Biennale were trying to prevent: to create a ‘relevance factor’ in the Biennale by making it a ‘continuing business’ rather than a ‘survival of the market’. [4] In fact, the idea that there is a return on investment in the form of cultural tourism is what the Biennale was built on. As the Biennale trustee Peter Weibelmann put it:  	The Biennale is a vehicle for the return to the city of acquired taste, a recurrence in the city of taste that is exhausting and often comical. It is a vehicle that can, therefore, sustain a certain amount of loss of flavour.</text>

And this idea is often expressed in a way that exploits those who visit the destination, in this case, the host country. Tourism is a very specific type of cultural tourism, which integrates the notions of history, places, people, and culture in a commercial way. In other words, it attempts to make the place recognisable in the same way that Cadbury products such as biscuits and pies might be made. 	[4] So, the key to the organic growth of tourism is clearly to invest in places that are actively made recognisable by the tourist, and to that extent, tourism becomes both a consumer and a promoter of identity. Creative cultural tourism projects, such as those undertaken by the British Council, Tate Britain and others, are an important part of this equation. In many cities, however, this is seen as a last resort, seen as desirable only for the very rich and the very well connected. Creative cultural tourism, on the other hand, has recently become very popular in places such as Liverpool and Bristol where the itinerary is made significantly</text>

The curatorial role in reimagining the past. The curatorial alliance is often defined as the informal understanding between the artist and the spectator. In the 1990s, this was increasingly seen as the case, but now the curatorial alliance is often defined as the understanding between the artist and the organisation that commissioned the work. The word ‘curatorial’ is often used synonymously with ‘imagining the future’, and whilst it is true that the curatorial is the point where future visions converge, it is equally true that the future is where the divergent visions converge. While the curatorial may want to persuade us that it is happening at an ‘empirical’ rate, it is in fact often silent, preferring to engage with the messy conditions that it finds itself in. This can result in curatorial lapses, as when the curatorial alliance is asked to take a position on a controversial statue, work, or project, but it is more likely to</text>

The curatorial role in the global commonsA somewhat different understanding of the curatorial role in the global commons was proposed by historian and artist Manolis Papastergiadis. This proposed view of the role of the curator emerged in relation to the history of art in the European theatre, and it is based on a reading of the ‘Common Arts? Reading List’ that was compiled in collaboration with the British Museum. The ten artists included in the ‘Common Arts? Reading List’ are a select group of artists who demonstrate a clear commitment to the history and future of art’s common resources: sites of art, places for artists to be present, and so forth. The inclusion of an artist in the list is not evidence of an artist’s intrinsic worth, but rather an indication of the collaborative effort, an acknowledgement of the artist’s strengths and weaknesses, and the contribution he or she is likely to make to the shared heritage.

The curatorial role in the global commonsA common resource shared by all stakeholders is the shared commons. It is a shared resource that is regularly (but imperfectly) used and shared with many people, but it remains unsatisfied as a shared resource. This perceived inaccessibility has two dimensions. The first is a question of identity: who has the right to use what, how? In an ideal world, the use of the shared resource would be universally shared; the commons would be a shared resource that anyone with a stake in it could necessarily use. But the inaccessibility paradigm favouring the use of the shared resource in certain places (and at certain scales) impeded the possibility of this ideal. The result is a situation in which resources are routinely and invisibly appropriated by a few at the expense of the many. The commons is a concept that is often misused and which often ends up being misused in problematic or vexatious ways. The  	use of the common resource requires</text>

Photo courtesy of The British Museum.The role of the curatorial in the digital age is complex, and not all of its participants would agree on everything that’s happening to the artworld around them. Nevertheless, the curatorial alliance is now so deeply embedded in the cultural life of the nation that it’s hard to imagine any other kind of curatorial alliance. There are of course vested economic interests that would love to see the curatorial alliance dismantled and replaced with another kind of cultural hegemony, and there are of course vested ideological interests that would like to see the curatorial alliance reconfigured as something entirely different, but objectively speaking the same, is the way in which the curatorial alliance operates now.

The curatorial role in perpetuity. The role of the curatorial in perpetuity is a pivotal one. It defines who is considered a contemporary and who is considered an old schoolie – or, put another way, who is considered an asset and who is considered a liability. The role of the contemporary is defined by Mills’s team as anything that is not ‘an original contribution to the art form’. Modern artworks are then systematically excluded from the historical register. Mills’ team consisted of twenty-five artists selected from various technical and curatorial schools, as well as members of the public. Mills’ team was headed by Artistic Director Sue Bell Potts, who was responsible for the artworks selected and for the organisation of the exhibition. Bell Potts explained that the goal of the exhibition was to mark ‘the changes in the art form’ over the course of a century – to highlight the role that new technological innovations, cultural and economic flows had in creating</text>

The curatorial role in the museum and the curatorial alliance in postindustrial urban centres. The curatorial role in the museum has often been discussed as if it were a static entity distinct from the gallery. However, this is only partially true. The curatorial role in the museum is constantly subject to change and new curator-curatorial collaborations are bound to happen. In an attempt to capture the essence of the current curatorial approach to artworks, a number of artists have made work that is curatorial in nature, but transient in character. These artists have either produced work that is neither static nor transient, or else attempted to construct transient apparitions of the curatorial variety through the consumption of culture. In the latter case, they have incorporated elements of their artistic style and curatorial approach into contemporary artworks that are in constant need of rejuvenation. 	In recent years, we have seen the emergence of a number of artists who are more interested in the transient nature of artworks than in the permanent</text>

The curatorial role in perpetuity.  	Curtis Ioannidis speaks of the new ‘in perpetuity’ of cultural capital in the form of collections, institutions and artefacts.5 This concept recognises the fact that the curatorial role is not confined to the museum or the art gallery, but extends to all exhibitionary venues and any place where people gather to exchange knowledge, share experiences or just to be entertained. It is a space where knowledge can circulate freely and objects can be unearthed – objects that can be combined, recognised and incorporated into future historical narratives.In a word, ‘in perpetuity’ refers to the historical preservation of cultural value in the form of collections, institutions and artefacts. This means that such knowledge must be transmitted to future generations through oral histories, movies, plays, photographs and so forth. And, finally, in perpetuity, it means that the objects in question must be able to serve as a marker of time – marking periods of</text>

The curatorial alliance. (Karen Bowden/Calder Foundation)The 1980s were a golden age for art education in the UK, and the alliance between art and education provided an ideal venue for the collaborative exchange of ideas. The curatorial alliance emerged as a term that was frequently used within the art world to refer to the structures that supported the exchange of ideas, and art education in particular. This term was frequently used in isolation, but now seems outdated. The curatorial alliance is a multi-tiered system of institutions, funded and managed through contracts with the artist, gallery and museum. It consists of various galleries, museums, archives, promotion agencies, think tanks, writers’ groups and campaigns, as well as a range of outreach and education activities. Its core purpose is to display and process art, and it does so in a particular way: it engages with the notion of art education through what Armstrong terms ‘the double game’ that is played by the artist, gallery and</text>

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘government’, but in reality, ‘land’ and its subdivisions are under siege. The vernacular definition of the word ‘land’ includes both river and ocean ‘lands’ – islands, small collections of trees and rocks ceded to the Crown by the latter in exchange for grants of public rights. For many years, this meant ensuring that areas ceded to the Crown, ‘public’ or ‘protected’ space, including parks, would be used for public uses – for example, constructing a parkway along the Issaquah Gorge Trail would enable vehicular travel along the eastern boundary of the parkway, while a dedicated hiking and biking path would run along the western boundary of the parkway. However, in recent years the parkway has come to be seen as a potential new frontier in curatorial space, and the newly minted ‘protected’ space – specifically, the zone immediately surrounding the park</text>

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘government’, but in fact, there are two distinct ways of using the word: (1) as a noun that describes the land in which one lives or works, (2) as a verb that describes the place where one finds one’s bearings. In English, the former usage is sometimes referred to as ‘common law’, but in fact, it is an enactment of the monarch, and it defines the place as ‘jurisdiction’. In this sense, the word ‘land’ has a double character: it describes something as private but also gives the notion of jurisdiction over it. For Aristotle, the land (especially the private property inherited from the monarch) is private property because it is inherited (nature reaps what it wills through biological and anthropological lines); this is why, for example, a monarch can delegate such prerogatives to her courtiers and militia.[8] Thus, while the monarch has</text>

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘public’, but in fact ‘land’ is a public domain. It is not public simply because it is public – it is not a privatised commons or a public domain because it is no longer privately owned. In the words of Francis J. Waldman, ‘The Land Question’,  	Postanima 10:4 (1936): ‘What is meant by the ‘public domain’ in this age of globalisation is the opposite of what the anthropologist Karl Marx had meant when he spoke of ‘public property’: what he called the ‘transcendental man-made ‘property’ that forms the basis of contemporary social life.’ These words, and the phrasing of the question ‘landed social groups’, characterise contemporary progressive forms of bureaucratic social organisation that take the form of ‘landed social groups’ (sometimes referred to as ‘L</text>

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘government’. In fact, ‘land’ is often used in the same sentence as ‘government’. Yet, in this usage, one and the same concept – concept – is often used in contradictory ways. For example, the government claims ownership of the ‘area where the American flag is FLAGS’ and US Territories, yet the area itself is – at best – a point of entry into a public realm not fully owned by the federal government. Likewise, in the ‘global’, areas within national parks are often claimed by multinational corporations, yet the surrounding landscape is managed by for-profit companies. The use of the word ‘land’ relative to these examples highlights a crucial difference between the federal government and non-governmental entities (NGOs): the federal government owns the land, resources and socio-politically-engaged systems that are constructed on it; entities such as NGOs have no such legal claim.

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘government’, but while the two are sometimes used interchangeably, there is considerable difference between the two. While the land and territorial claims of the state are frequently cited as a justification for action, in reality the use of public lands and public spaces (including the public realm) is a governmental action that needs to be accounted for and regulated. As such, the public realm, whether publicly or privately owned, is subject to change – especially as a result of resource scarcity and climate change – and so it is customary for those with political or economic power to dominate the use of public lands and public spaces. In addition, the public realm tends to fragment and misalign with commercial and institutional power. Thus, while it is often cited as a justification for action, there is considerable tension between the claims of the public and those of the state when it comes to the maintenance and use of public lands and public spaces. This tension is particularly evident in periods of conflict between the settler colonial</text>

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘public’. In contemporary parlance, however, the two concepts have a double meaning: (1) The locus of political, economic and social power; and (2) The locus of enfranchised spaces of enjoyment and use. If ‘land’ refers to public ownership, ‘the city’ refers to the public sphere, if by ‘the city’ we mean the public realm as an identifiable set of rights and entitlements, including the public sphere itself.’14  Thus, ‘land’ is both a spatial term and a concept, with a ‘public’ element that is at the root of its semantic variety.  	What is at the Root of Speedy Urban Development? It can now be claimed that the ‘public’ includes not just the public at large, but also the publics of a particular neighborhood, their specific histories and present needs and desires. Spe</text>

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘government’, but in actuality, ‘land’ is a much broader concept than this. Its application in this context is problematic. First of all, the concept of ‘land’ is often misused. Its precise sense of subject is often abused, and the actual location of an object – whether it is in space or under the skin of a living thing – is often treated as a given. Second, ‘land’ is often misconstrued. In Sydney, for instance, over 1,000 different types of residential neighbourhoods have been created on a massive scale through the development of a new kind of development called ‘High Street Newshouse’ (named for the area around the corner from the museum). These neighbourhoods are distributed across hundreds of acres, and are often divided into smaller parcels. But the very idea of ‘land’ as a specific location – where one finds one’s roots – is abused by developers</text>

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘government’, but in fact, there are two distinct kinds of ‘land’. One is government-owned, the other is not. The root of the word ‘land’ is Latin, and thus the verb ‘to own’ refers to taking ownership of government-owned property. Similarly, the adjective ‘landed’ refers to the state of being located in or secured by law. So, for example, when the English language is translated as ‘landed’ on a map, the reference is usually to the location of secure detention or legal proceedings. In Asian countries, the object of appropriation is usually a particular coastal territory or territory contiguous to the coast, including islands. However, the acquisition of sovereignty over a territory is not absolute. The Crown often exerts political, economic and strategic influence over territory, as in the case of Hong Kong or Taiwan, and in fact over ‘certainly identifiable minority groups�</text>

However, what is often taken for granted in these contexts is that which comes to be called the ‘public domain’ – public land, places of public use, and so forth. If ‘land’ is defined narrowly, or even if ‘public domain’ is conceived of as a collection of protected ‘useful assets’, then the urban landscape that is the subject of the settlements and the corporations that are the heirs to the public realm are those very assets that are collectively understood as ‘public’. In this way, the public realm is understood to include both the profits and the public's inherent right to the assets. This understanding of the public realm is often extended to the regions surrounding the city, but it does not extend to the socio-politically connected regions of the city.

(JL)Land marks, government uses, and miscegenated zonesThe word ‘land’ is often used synonymously with ‘public domain’. However, in a Latin context, the concept of land, or public domain, has a completely different meaning. In Latin, ‘land’ is defined as the ‘foothill’ or the ‘sheet of ground’ that underpins the maritime domain. So, while ‘land’ can be defined as ‘public domain’, its actual location – under common law, at common law, or in international law – is still a private matter that one can control, regulate and even take back. In this sense, the public domain extends well beyond the location at which one locates and uses it.  One could equally well ask what is the difference between the public and the ‘private’ domain, or between the public and publics of different cultures.

He also subscribed to the neo-classical rationalism of his time and subscribed to the view that natural selection had favoured the survival of the human species over other considerations.

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority placed on the long-term sustainability of the docks. This double-dip boom was supported by a number of federal and state governments, as well as the non-profit ‘commercial office society’ that was emerging out of the US post-war post-Industrial Union. 	So much of the port’s development during this period was focused on meeting the immediate needs of the port through rapid expansion and industrialisation. The commercial office society, which emerged as a result of the post-war post-union wave of office building construction, provided the intellectual underpinning for the new forms of industrialisation. Assembled largely of former members of the International Longshoremen’s Association, the I.L.A.S. was a quasi-religious organisation that promoted the growth of the port as a commercially viable location for both its members and for international shipping outside of the US; in effect, it provided the intellectual and organisational base for the new forms</text>

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority given to the task of transforming the terminal into a cultural hub and so less on the level of port projects. But the advent of modern port management and port surveillance technologies such as port scanner stations and port directional scanners meant that this ‘on-the-fly’ conversion didn’t have to be done manually. A port directional scanner could be set up and a port scanning device installed in seconds, letting port staff know where vessels were at in relation to each other.[2] As a result of this new understanding of the port, a new kind of coordination was established between arts administrators and technologists to help make the most of the new technology. This new understanding of the port came to be known as ‘Port of Liverpool’ by its early adopters, and its early success stories by its early patrons. It was seen by its supporters as a kind of techno-utopianism, a kind of cyberpunk future where everything was connected – an ideal that</text>

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low value of the port property (just under 1 ha) was seen by port managers as a way to generate quick cash flow by selling commodities at a premium (rather than the costs of running the terminal) while refuelling commercial vessels at a discount (rather than the environmental impacts of the terminal and its operations). As William Crookman puts it: ‘The impulse to enlarge, to take the property, to put up walls and tunnels and other engineering devices, to expand the vessel, to lay underwater cables, to monitor the water level in order to maintain a steady tide, to begin building a national submarine defence, to begin constructing a national lighthouse, to begin constructing a national post office, to begin constructing a national customs post, to begin constructing a national post office, to begin constructing a national dairy and tobacco warehouse, and so forth’.[2] Port managers had a strategic view of the port as a vital link in the transatlantic slave trade, and so the transition to a new</text>

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority given to the terminal itself. But port bosses also had a set of jobs to do. Given the terminal’s critical role in the post-Revolutionary infrastructural complex it emerged as a site for contingency planning – a contingency plan for the eventuality of war. This was seen as essential in the post-petro-revolutionary period, since the potential for war was seen growing. The terminal was a place of constant monitoring, where contingency planning was seen as essential in the face of the new ‘monopoly of the violence and conflict’.[2] Given the success of port campaigns such as the Jubilee Bank Scheme and the Liverpool &amp; Southampton Railway (L&amp;SS), it is unsurprising that port managers relished the chance to chip away at the post-petro-revolutionary social totality. Port campaigns such as the Jubilee Bank and the L&amp;SS were seen by port managers as a way to counter the perceived vernalising effects of new</text>

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority placed on maintaining the environment that shipping lines established in this period. The importance of this in the port’s modernisation process – which I have explored in great detail in my new book Shipping and Logistics in the Nineteenth Century – cannot be understated. It is a writer’s responsibility to monitor and control the environmental degradation of the port, and the resulting industry of racism, poverty, violence and repression that the port enjoyed at the height of the global capitalism that followed in its wake.In the wake of these environmental crises, port authorities adopted a number of action plans designed to deal with the problem head-on, rather than the other way around. These included the establishment of cooperative ports trusts, non-profit port organisations that would, over time, become fully incorporated in the port hierarchy and, in the case of Liverpool, other governmental bodies and non-profit organisations; port building and the associated labour and materials management firms; and the provision of infrastructure for the cooperative of which</text>

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority placed on the long-term sustainability of the docks. But in the late twentieth century, new technological infrastructures were making it easier and easier to move containers around, and port managers were confronted with the challenge of managing the ever-growing volume of trade between ports. The proliferation of trans-shipment ports became ever more of a concern as new technologies were put in place to minimise disruption to traffic flow. As a result of this, in the early part of the century, port management started to actively promote the use of mini-pylons to reduce disruption to traffic flow. This came as a natural by-product of the ‘petro-economy’ that had emerged during the late nineteenth century, and which included both goods and financial instruments that could be traded between nations. The development of these economic instruments was driven by the proliferation of standardised map and charting presses, the proliferation of financial markets, and the development of sophisticated data-processing and storage equipment</text>

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority given to the maintenance of the infrastructure and the port’s dynamic social function as a site of exchange. Yet there was growing awareness of the fundamental importance of the port and its varied uses. The early post-Revolutionary and post-Industrial port manifestos of the period referred to ‘the present as a base from which revolutions may be directed’; these spoke of the need to develop new modes of consumption that would take into account the ‘new science’ that was developing in the wake of the port’s increased commercial traffic. As Samuel Morse said, ‘The future is a probable sea-form; it is the projected social, cultural and economic form of the future that we envision.’[2] The possibilities for port expansion in the post-Revolutionary and post-Industrial periods were also being actively debated in the public sphere; for example, in the 1880s the Whalen Plan for the expansion of the port port included a</text>

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority placed on supporting the infrastructure and port at this stage in its development. But in the early twentieth century, this took on a life of the mind-boggling variety of natural resources, urban growth, and urban problems. As port facilities were developed, so were the demands for accommodation and social services distributed. And as new modes of movement emerged in this period (freight, ferries, planes, yachts), so too did the need for coastal defence. The Port of Liverpool was founded in 1903, and its mission statement reads as an epigraph to a maritime tradition that dates back to John Muir’s day: To protect the English maritime trade from encroachments, wherever they may happen, by whatever name they may bear, and to do this in a manner to the utmost advantage of the nation.‘To do this,' it adds, ‘we maintain a standing fleet of six ships, manned by both British and Underwater Seamen, and armed with</text>

The surge in international trade during this period coincided with a corresponding population explosion: Liverpool-based shipping lines employed over one million people during the decade, and the docks hosted over 1,000 ships a day. As a result of this post-petro-revolutionary infrastructural build-up, the port experienced a double whammy: the increased traffic on its roads due to the wheel and its installation as part of the wider infrastructure, combined with the increased loading on the terminal due to the increased size of passenger vessels; a situation that port managers felt was unsustainable. So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority placed on the longer-term sustainability of the port’s cultural assets. But these early port commissions failed to notice the increasingly important role that art and culture were playing in curbing the growth of urban blight. As Peter McCaughey observes, art was often deployed as a tool of social change: ‘Art as a tool was widely shared, proclaimed, justified and even legalised – for instance, when an artist was hired to beautify a certain part of the docks – though this commonality – along with the inherent conflictiveness of such a legal justification – meant that confliction quickly degenerated into a kind of social disagreement.’[2] Art as a tool was certainly used in the early twentieth century, but its primary aim – to make things better – seems to have been eclipsed by an aim to extract as much profit as possible from the projects that were being developed on the docks.

So much of port management’s work in this period was driven by the quest for immediate profit; the relatively low priority placed on supporting the ecosystem through sustainable management of the harbour sediments. Yet the rise and influence of the port can be understood as a consequence of a combination of factors, including the global movement of people, the rapid growth of transnational transnational port entities, and the proliferation of port-based non-state actors. 	In the twentieth century, port cities such as Liverpool emerged as major bases for the trans-shipment of goods and people, and for the spread of transnational transnational port entities. In the twenty-first century, the port of Liverpool is one of the major sources of trans-shipment for goods and people entering and leaving the West. 	In the twenty-first century, the port is the primary international gateway for the movement of people, goods and resources; it is the world’s fourth largest maritime port after Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. It accounts for approximately twelve per cent of the global maritime trade.[2] 	</text>

The exhibition was written by Neil Johnson, Prof. Geography and Theoretical Physics at Lancaster University, and Prof. Ray Walker, Prof. Physics, Zoology and Geology at University of Limerick. The exhibition was presented in the galleries of the National Gallery, alongside original works from the museum collections, as well as new works created by the curators, scientists and artists. Its aim was to present as many disparate points of view as possible in chronological order from the perspectives of a physicist, a zoologist, a historian, a curator and an audience. The exhibition was divided into three sections. ‘Introduction’ presented the main ideas and arguments of the book, while ‘Reading the Mammal Past’ and ‘Unravelling the Archive’ explored the topic from the animal kingdom to the human world. The three sections were curated as part of a multi-disciplinary programme, exploring themes of memory, emotion, evolution and politics. The exhibition format for the ‘</text>

The two-year, five-site plan envisaged at the time was not only to renew the biennial but also to look at the historical conditions that had allowed this to happen, and to propose a way forward. As a starting point, I want to mention that there were two biennials at the time: one in Liverpool, the other in Lisbon. The Liverpool Biennial (2006) and the Lisbon Biennale (2009) were both curated by Professors Michael Baldwin and Colin Murphy, with the former focusing on the city’s Portuguese and Portuguese-speaking communities, while the latter was a two-year long, five-site, ten-day event featuring a combination of traditional and social displays.

It is a kind of interface layer or gatekeeper that collects images and data to recognise stylised forms of expression, or ‘matching elements’. It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image or data set. The image or data set that receives the training recognises ‘similarities’ between images or data sets, and between images or data frames. It then produces new images or data sets that meet the specifications of the interface layer.Machine learning is advancing at an incredible pace, and its applications are limitless. There are thousands of websites dedicated to the scientific and technical aspects of the field, and many university libraries dedicated to the study of computer-system design and analysis. There are also thousands of book chapters devoted to the topic, with resources ranging from websites to magazine articles to stage directions to video tutorials. There are over 1,000 indexed articles on the topic, with new ones appearing frequently. There are over 6,000 computer-system design books devoted to the subject, and over 10,000 related topics.

It is a kind of interface layer or gatekeeper that collects images and data to recognise stylised forms of expression, or ‘matching elements’. It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image. The image above is an example of a stylised image of an object in an art context, but there are many more like it out there in everyday use. Machine learning is used in the production of decorative products, for instance, to map images based on patterns found in the environment, or to analyse images to detect patterns or differences between objects, or to detect anomalies in colour or brightness. It is used in the production of medical images, too, to map images based on parameters such as depth or temperature, or to analyse images to detect abnormalities or detect differences between patients, or to detect similarities in the acoustic signature of objects’ bodies.Artists, curators and art collectors have always been interested in the mechanisms of artistic and artistic-type creativity. The mechanisms that underlie artistic creativity and the mechanisms that underlie technical creativity. Through different kinds of funding and other forms of support, artists and curators have worked for decades to democratise the mechanisms of artistic and artistic-type creativity</text>

It is a kind of interface layer or gatekeeper that collects images and data to recognise stylised forms of expression, or ‘matching elements’. It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image or scene. By understanding how images are constructed and what constitutes an image, the system helps artists create images that are more effectively communicated. An example of this is the way in which the Getty Trust operates: by mapping images of iconic sites to locations where Getty Images images can be found, the system identifies places that would be suitable for installation in galleries or museums, and produces new images that are specific to that location.In the 1980s and 1990s the computer science major covered a wide range of disciplines, but one of its main focuses was programming. In Computer Programming, Robin Hanson details the ways in which computer programming can be understood as artistic practice. She shows how programming creates structures that are malleable, self-organising and able to self-generate. She also shows how the structures can be used to achieve an end – in this case, artistic endeavours. In a later chapter she explores artistic and curatorial practices in both ‘high-level languages’ and ‘</text>

It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image. By collecting data from a variety of sources, including the artistic, literary, historical and legal, the machine learns to produce images or sculptures that are aesthetically pleasing to the end users of the interface, or aesthetically displeasing to no end user at all. The mechanisms of the interface are complex and fascinating, but they also have one final but vital task: to interpret the meanings of all the images or data gathered. This last bit is perhaps the most difficult and may require great skill and dedication to master. The human interpretation of all images or data is often quite intuitive, but understanding all the images or data gathered is much more difficult. This may be partly because of the data capture and storage that is part of the interface, but also because of the data mining and deep neural networks that are part of the interface. The human interpretation of an interface is often quite at odds with the end user’s interpretation of the interface, which may be quite different. For example, the human interpretation</text>

It is a kind of interface layer or gatekeeper that collects images and data to recognise stylised forms of expression, or ‘matching elements’. It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image. The idea is that the image should be able to invent its own image and memory – something that has never been possible with print media or with software. The neural network that creates and supports these images is called a ‘photonic memory chip’. Although these images may be objects in a conceptual or technical sense, they are actually constructed out of images gathered from a range of sensors, including those within the lens of a camera. Using data from a range of sensors, the neural network learns to produce images according to predetermined parameters. The output images may be vector images or jpeg images, but they are images. The network learns to produce images according to parameters generated from images gathered from the surrounding environment. These are called ‘template images’ and they are images that are produced according to predetermined rules. These are called ‘adaptive network images’ and they are images that are produced according to the parameters that the network learns to meet in its interaction with the world. In</text>
    <text>machines were asked to take over the curatorial process. This came as a surprise to a curator, many of whom had never worked with machine. It also came as a surprise to artist Ambasz, who had worked with the machine on previous visits. She came to work with the new curatorial style, which she described as ‘abstract’ and ‘non-representational’ – in other words, not to express things in a way that we might understand. She was confronted with the decision whether or not to engage with the machine, to which she eventually said ‘yes’.Machine learning is the use of data to identify patterns or features in images or data, to produce new images or to augment existing images. It is a kind of interface layer or gatekeeper that collects images and data to recognise stylised forms of expression, or ‘matching elements’. It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image. It does this in much more subtle and insidious ways than most people would ever imagine.In a way, machine learning is an inevitable by-product of the cultural revolution that started in Egypt in 2011. It is a revolution that began with the introduction of social media, and which has continued to this day. IJYM and the other artists who were invited to develop innovative new curatorial approaches to the machine learning techniques used in the art department came to this revolution from different directions. From within the institution, they came from time to time with proposals or interventions that were intended to be side-stepped by the more institutionalised way of engaging with the new artistic practices that were developing across the country. The introduction of social media and the cultural revolution had a profound effect on how curators and arts administrators in Egypt and other parts of the world perceived and interacted with art and culture. They were faced with a new situation where art was being actively produced and curated through a site-specific programme</text>

It is a kind of interface layer or gatekeeper that collects images and data to recognise stylised forms of expression, or ‘matching elements’. It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image. Through sophisticated statistical techniques, algorithms and data mining, factors such as brightness, shape, position, tilt and even volume can be identified and manipulated in ways that mimic the rhetorical question and answer function of a human language. In effect, the introduction of new image elements or image data is a question and answer session between artist and user. New image elements can be identified by artists and the research team that develops and monitors imagery; they can be created using statistical techniques and algorithms; and they can be exported and incorporated into media works. New image data can then be gathered and discussed amongst artists, media experts, journalists and other stakeholders. New image elements can be identified through research carried out with the Royal Academy of Arts' Image Identification Unit, funded by the Arts Council; they can also be created using statistical techniques and algorithms. New image data can then be gathered and discussed amongst artists, media experts, journalists and others stakeholders. Image identification is a globalised process that began in the 1980s with the establishment</text>

It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image. It does this in a multitude of ways, from recognising similarities between objects or images to the organisation of data in hierarchies, and even within hierarchies. In this sense, it is both ‘infrastructure’ and ‘data sets’ – collections of images and data. The key concepts here are those relating to the ‘image plane’ – the abstract image element of a computer programme – and the ‘data plane’ – the actual image data. More specifically, the image plane refers to the data stored on the device, and the data itself. Thus the image that emerges from the device represents both the abstract image and the specific image data. It is not just an image, but a data structure that holds image data in an organised manner. This is important because an attacker within a computer system could exploit this understanding of the image as a weapon and cause destruction within the context of a computer system. For example, an attacker within a system could cause damage</text>

It does this by gathering data about the structure of images and objects, and how they are used, in the context of an image. By understanding how images are assembled into stylised forms, or ‘matching elements’, the user can construct an image or object recogniser that differs from the original artist’s intended one. Examples of this kind of interface would be the carrousel in the Louvre, or the stacks of an ancient Greek or Roman book. In the twentieth century, early visual artists understood how to use this kind of interface to produce expressive images – but their interest was in picturing things in their head, rather than actually making things happen.Vittorio Armani, Man Ray 	, 1955.

The aim of the programme, in its earliest stages, would be to support the establishment of a strong base of locally relevant knowledge about the art world and the arts in the locality.  The programme would grow as new artists arrived, and the assets they acquired would be used to develop local capacity building strategies.  An arts educator or artist’s producer might lead a local arts or cultural initiatives programme, or commission an artist to produce culturally responsive artworks.  The programme might be extended in stages over time to provide resources for artists to work with communities in their leisure time, or it might be initiated by an NGO or a government agency in order to support a regional arts education and cultural initiative.

The development of such agreements would necessitate a shift in attitude towards art and art institutions in the locality; it would require changing attitudes towards art and art institutions in the form of legislation, but it would also require changing attitudes towards the role of the arts in the political and economic systems that are the reflection of social conditions and the desires of communities.

A city councilor’s recent suggestion that the boundaries of a city be redrawn to better accommodate the many cultures of the region is one example of how art institutions can operate in such a context. It is also an indication of the kinds of political, economic and social changes that need to be made in order to address the loss of cultural identity, displacement of people, and conflicts arising from the division of labour. Councilors should also realise that although they have a legal duty to make changes, they have little power unless voters explicitly give them authority to do so.

The Liverpool Biennial Council is a prime example of this. In the mid-1990s, when the Biennial was initially conceived, its scope was geo-politically circumscribed. The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of travel and culture through art and culture, rather than the city as an object of exchange – and to do so through participatory methods. In other words, the organisation’s traditional curatorial role – engaging with the city through art and culture, rather than the other way around – was superseded by the new curatorial role of the artist. In other words, the organisation could engage with the city in many different ways, rather than being restricted to engaging with the city as an object of exchange. This new curatorial role promotes a multiplicity of approaches to the city, and different levels of cultural consumption, including but not limited to: cultural tourism, cultural tourism to non-Western cultures, cultural tourism to urban centres, cultural exchange between nations, cultural exchange through works produced by and for the local community, and cultural activism. The goal of this multimedia event is to create a shared understanding of the city through cultural tourism, which means engaging with the city in many ways, both traditional and multimedia</text>

The Liverpool Biennial Council is a prime example of this. In the mid-1990s, when the Biennial was initially conceived, its scope was geo-politically circumscribed. The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of transport rather than the art – and in doing so invited artists from all over the world to engage with the city in a non-traditional way.  This would mean participating in public art projects that were not part of a curatorial plan, or ‘non-traditional cultural venues’ that did not have a traditional role in a city.  The intention of the project was to create a ‘bridge builder’ between the traditional arts context and the digitally mediated urban setting, by enabling artists to experiment with the idea of place and culture beyond the usual curatorial parameters.  The early efforts at the Biennial were quite visionary in this sense, enabling artists and their audiences to take the project on a more conceptual level, and thereby opening up new artistic possibilities for the city.  A key objective of the first Biennial, in the view of many critics, was topsy-turvy through the city at an ever-rapid pace, to produce a biennale that is,</text>

The introduction of social and behavioural science research into the curatorial programme was also a way to engage with the emerging global perception of art and culture.  A main strand of the social and behavioural sciences research agenda for artists and art institutions was developed through a series of event held in the city over the next two years, which were co-chaired by the Biennial Council and the Liverpool John Moores University School of Art.  The ‘Big Issue’ of Artforum was co-chaired by Dr Angela McKay, Associate Professor of Art History and Co-Director of the Centre for Art and Social Research, Liverpool John Moores University School of Art. Artforum became the flagship event for the social and behavioural sciences research agenda and the publication of the ‘Art &amp; Architecture’ issue of the journal Social Science &amp; Cultural Research.

The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of housing, but also exploring the meaning of non-traditional art representations of the city. The Biennial Council was reluctant to engage with the city as a real place, and the artists who came out of its bubble of creativity were deeply sceptical of such a notion. They perceived the city as an artificial space – a construct, a process of urban evolution culminating in the present – dominated by a small elite of planners, politicians, journalists and others with a clear interest in economic growth and the pursuit of profit at any cost. The aim of the Biennial was to be a periodic event that enhanced the city’s cultural profile and its value to commercial and institutional investors, whilst simultaneously challenging the city to confront its economic and social  inequalities.  The artist – and here the Biennial Council has a clear preference – was to be a catalyst for a series of smaller biennials in the city, each one dedicated to a specific theme, similar to the way in which a city organises itself.</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is a major international art event, featuring new works by some of the major international artists, which takes place every two years. It is organised by the Liverpool Biennial Council under the direction of the Curator Experience programme, and is transnational in scope, incorporating works from many different countries.The event is also characterised by a 'big data' approach to art collecting and dissemination.  The notion of the artist as a catalyst for change is promoted, and data mining is used to collect and interpret vast amounts of data, using data to identify trends and suggest remedies. The technology involved in data mining is sophisticated and well understood, and artists and the organisations they work for are regularly recruited as data miners and commentators. The Liverpool Biennial Council is a prime example of this. In the mid-1990s, when the Biennial was initially conceived, its scope was geo-politically circumscribed. The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of density rather than metropolitan sprawl, and exploring alternatives to metropolis. In the intervening years, the Biennial has expanded its field of analysis, and now actively participates in research councils, institutional research institutes and universities around the world, providing continuing education for artists and institutions, and engaging with local communities through projects such as the recently launched Project C.I.A.E. (Centre for Studies of Architecture and Design) in Liverpool.  The idea of the biennial has shifted from its roots in cities to becoming an international phenomenon. The biennial is a recurring, globalised exhibitionary form, with a major cultural centre at home, and a diverse series of sub-exhibitions throughout the world. It is the largest of its kind in many countries, and is a significant contributor to the value of the museums, ever since its foundation in 1989.  The biennial is a global phenomenon, appearing in over 200 cities and territories, and is the largest continuously open exhibitionary form</text>

The Liverpool Biennial Council is a prime example of this. In the mid-1990s, when the Biennial was initially conceived, its scope was geo-politically circumscribed. The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of parking without constructing parking lots and structures – a tactic sometimes employed by local authorities to subvert and subvert the art process into submission. More and more artists found alternative perspectives and creative means of engagement. The Museum of Contemporary Art in New York has documented the emergence of post-Parkland as a post-Industrial City.  The Biennial Council itself has documented the emergence of post-Industrial as a post-Museum city. Art is a more or less ubiquitous reality for most of us in most of our day-to-day interactions. But the key battleground in the culture war, and frequently-quoted symbol of the culture war, is the Biennial itself. The true artist’s perspective, and the one that matters, is rarely articulated.  The biennial has often been over-embellished, and over-hyped. Its true strength, and perhaps even its true tragedy, is often under-embellished.  The real artist’s</text>

The Liverpool Biennial Council is a prime example of this. In the mid-1990s, when the Biennial was initially conceived, its scope was geo-politically circumscribed. The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of residential neighbourhoods through participatory design, rather than the city as an occupying military force – and to observe how a city could be restructured through such practices. As we know, such radical approaches to urbanisation are not unfamiliar to governments and other powerful interest groups, and are eagerly embraced by those who claim urban change is a necessity.The Biennial has always been aware of the need to grow and change, and has done so through innovative artists, creative curators, writers and other artists who have entered into collaborative relationships with organisations such as the Liverpool Biennial and other prominent artists� organisations. On a global perspective, the event has also commissioned artist-in-residence programs from prestigious centres, such as the Ukraine, Thailand, Russia and Georgia, as well as producing its own alumni, such as Balintas Malasauskas, Oksana Zyuzina, Gabi Lankov, Tarja Gardula, Ewa Malysheva, Olga Baraja, Iliya</text>

The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of parking rather than the architecture of the city. To a large extent, the councilorates mission has been fulfilled in another way – the Biennial is globally visible, and the councilorship has a high visibility, which attracts many more visitors and investments than it did then. However, the fact that the activity is perceived as art and not necessarily as a way to provide social, economic or spatial improvements for the city is another factor. The biennial has an obligation to engage with the city in an engaging and innovative way, and this obligation is fulfilled in many ways – in many forms, including but not limited to:The Biennial Council is an international network of arts and cultural organisations headquartered in New York. It is made up of artists, curators, artists' managers, artists' friends and other professionals who work across a range of creative activities in and across the art world.

The Liverpool Biennial Council is a prime example of this. In the mid-1990s, when the Biennial was initially conceived, its scope was geo-politically circumscribed. The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of urban blight instead of climate change, for example. However, in the intervening years, the Biennial has become something like a tourist trap, devoting vast resources to developing a reputation for itself, while ignoring or actively undermining its local community.  The Council’s budget for the 2021 Biennial is £350,000.  A small minority of artists, including Damien Hirst, are actively involved in developing a Social Impact Statement for the event, while others use the opportunity to work outside the Biennial context.  The Biennial Council’s social impact statement in 2017 suggested that the Biennial should invest in creating a ‘culture of participation’, one that is not confined to museums and galleries.  The Biennial Council’s 2017 Cultural Impact Statement focused on the need to create ‘a shared understanding of art and culture’ in order to address the issues of arts and culture in the city’s schools and colleges.

The Liverpool Biennial Council is a prime example of this. In the mid-1990s, when the Biennial was initially conceived, its scope was geo-politically circumscribed. The aim was to engage with the city in a non-traditional way – engaging with the issue of housing, but more specifically, the housing crisis in the Liverpool Biennial’s manifest began in earnest in earnest in the months leading up to the event. The Biennial Council was acutely aware that its engagement with the city was a proposition at best, and a pose at worst. It considered every step, every click, every vibration, that it took in an attempt to construct a biennial that would last beyond the next Venice Biennale. Content to dwell for extended periods on the city, but also conscious that it was trapped in a vicious circle of poverty and homelessness, the Biennial attempted to generate awareness of the crisis by commissioning artists and organisations – which was then translated into funding for initiatives such as the Crisis of the City project, which attempted to end the crisis of homelessness through a public awareness campaign.  The challenge for the Biennial Council was two-fold: (1) how to engage with, and (2) what to do when the biennial has engaged with the</text>
