    Working with algorithms, biopsies can detect blood, tissue and other contaminants, allowing the medical profession to identify and treat maladies earlier than with traditional medical tests. It will also allow the biopsychologist to intervene earlier in a patient’s disease progression, using sophisticated data mining to detect early signs of disease and intervening early to halt or modify the progression of disease’s severity.Low-Income Housing MarketsA low-income housing market is one in which a large number of people struggle to access housing assistance or other affordable housing resources. These markets are characterised by a high cost of housing, concentrated in a few areas, and a lack of development that contributes to the development of more affordable housing options.

A key driver of the cost of housing is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which issues and distributes affordable housing securities and cooperative agreements to help developers and non-profit housing providers expand and diversify housing. Cooperative housing options represent a way for communities to jointly absorb the cost of construction and management of housing, and to also create affordable housing through cooperative ownership. Cooperative housing options also provide employment and social benefits to local residents and to workers at the cooperative level.  A cooperative housing cooperative may be a limited partnership established to jointly own and manage housing, and may also provide rental housing, social housing and childcare support to their community of residents. Cooperative housing options also support the development of renewable energy resources, including the production and deployment of hydropower, which is used to generate electricity for electric vehicles. Cooperative housing options also employ innovative management systems to reduce construction costs and improve energy efficiency, including by incorporating input from residents and professionals within the cooperative.  A cooperative housing cooperative may also issue cooperative stock, which is shares in common and is transferable among tenants and owners. Cooperative housing cooperatives have expanded to become dominant in California and are now the largest segment of the market, accounting for over half of all cooperative housing stock. Cooperative housing cooperatives are financially independent, self-sust</text>

Cooperative housing options represent a way for communities to jointly absorb the cost of construction and management of housing, while also facilitating the movement of low-income households between urban and rural areas.Co-ops offer innovative ways to combine affordable housing with cultural activities, such as theatre, education or recreation. They also serve as a platform to develop cooperative housing, expanding options for future ownership and management of properties, including through membership in a non-profit organisation. In addition to financing cooperative housing projects through public and private sources, cooperative members contribute directly to the cooperative by way of a monthly fee or a percentage of property-specific profits. Cooperative housing cooperatives have also emerged as a way for low-income communities to access affordable housing resources and build collective capacities through sharing costs and property-specific expertise. Cooperative housing co-ops are financially self-sufficient and can pursue business opportunities through trade and tourism. As a result, they attract business partners including non-profits, government entities, grassroots groups and citizens to assist in expanding and diversifying the cooperative.  	[i] The</text>

A key driver of the cost of housing is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which issues and distributes affordable housing securities and cooperative agreements to help developers and non-profit housing providers expand and diversify housing. Cooperative housing options represent a way for communities to jointly absorb the cost of construction and management of housing contributed by the FHA.Co-ops also act as ‘housing banks’ – lending capacity and housing portfolio management assets are shared among the members. This sharing enables the cooperative to meet its lending obligations to the FHA and other federally funded housing and development agencies, as well as to other cooperative members. Cooperative housing banks also lend to cooperative housing developments and non-profit housing producers to expand or improve housing in the cooperative housing developments’ capacity, including cooperative-owned cooperative housing developments and non-profit cooperative housing production. Cooperative housing development is a dynamic – dynamic – and source of great pride for the local housing community. It is a way to make housing affordable and accessible for people to access, while also supporting community members to participate fully in the cooperative’s business and real estate development. Indeed, cooperative housing exemplars often leverage their unique business models and substantial membership rolls to leverage the cooperative’s growing membership and potential financial resources.

A key driver of the cost of housing is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which issues and distributes affordable housing securities and cooperative agreements to help developers and non-profit housing providers expand and diversify housing. Cooperative housing options represent a way for communities to jointly absorb the cost of construction and management of housing, and to also create affordable housing through activities such as land and housing improvements. Cooperative housing options also provide financial assistance for construction and management, and are an effective way for communities to access financial resources needed to support a successful housing option.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the cooperative movement emerged as a way for communities to pool resources and share in the cost of housing, expanding access to affordable housing and promoting environmental improvements. Cooperative housing exemplars emerged in the wake of the financial crisis; today more than half of all federally assisted and public cooperative housing is owned by for-profit entities, non-profit housing developers and other powerful vested interests. Cooperative housing has come a long way since then, but much can be done to increase access to and enhance the cooperative’s beneficial ownership structure through direct financial support, improved property-management and legal tools. Cooperative housing remains an important tool for citizens to exert collective power and influence over housing resources, especially in challenging localities facing</text>

A key driver of the cost of housing is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which issues and distributes affordable housing securities and cooperative agreements to help developers and non-profit housing providers expand and diversify housing. Cooperative housing options represent a way for communities to jointly absorb the cost of construction and management of housing, and to also shape the development of affordable housing resources in return for financial support for housing projects. Cooperative housing options also offer financial empowerment to low-income households through the provision of housing equity, rent-stabilisation and market access benefits.  One example of a cooperative housing corporation is the California Cooperative Housing Federation (CCF), which has more than 25,000 members and is focused on building affordable housing through cooperative housing and land trusts.  CCF also provides financial and technical assistance to other non-profit housing and land trusts established by the FHA to expand cooperative housing options and coordinate land trusts' activities, as well as to other non-profit housing and land trusts established by the state and local governments. Cooperative housing corporations have different responsibilities and rights than FHA-established cooperative housing corporations.1  A typical Cooperative Housing Corporation (Ch. 8141) is a managed partnership between the state and local governments, with responsibilities to insure and support cooperative housing and land trusts</text>

A key driver of the cost of housing is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which issues and distributes affordable housing securities and cooperative agreements to help developers and non-profit housing providers expand and diversify housing. Cooperative housing options represent a way for communities to jointly absorb the cost of construction, improvements and management of public and cooperative housing.  In California alone, cooperative housing options represent a premium over market rate housing for many middle-income and low-income households. Cooperative housing trusts, which are tax-free special tax-advantaged housing developments for low-income households, account for about one-tenth of the total housing units. Cooperative housing options also reduce competition between market and cooperative housing, which enhances housing affordability and maximizes environmental benefits.  A cooperative housing cooperative agreement requires cooperative members to share in the cooperative’s profits, and cooperative housing development typically results in the establishment of multiple income streams for the employees and members of the cooperative. A cooperative housing corporation also distributes income and profits to its shareholders, most likely through a share issue or other stock market speculation. Cooperative housing development has become particularly prevalent in the rapidly urbanising Bay Area and Washington, DC, where incomes are still high and vacancy rates are low. Co-operative housing enjoys significant tax advantages, competitive</text>

Cooperative housing options represent a way for communities to jointly absorb the cost of construction and management of housing, benefiting from the development of environmentally sustainable housing options. Inclusionary zoning – the granting of rights to owners of housing to ensure that construction does not disrupt their access to housing – is a strategy to incentivise cooperative housing. It ensures that developers and non-profit housing providers construct and maintain housing for low-income households, while simultaneously financing cooperative housing initiatives through a housing trust fund. Inclusionary zoning has been shown to: •reduce costs; •support employment and wage growth; •enhance access to housing for low-income households; and •support the ability of communities to control and influence development.How Does AI Help Neighborhoods Transform their Development? The question of how to empower communities to control and influence development comes up over and over again. The answer, unsurprisingly, is: not well, not yet and nowhere near as strongly as in cities. But what can be done? One approach is to give communities clear, unambiguous instructions about what kinds of development are</text>

A key driver of the cost of housing is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which issues and distributes affordable housing securities and cooperative agreements to help developers and non-profit housing providers expand and diversify housing. Cooperative housing options represent a way for communities to jointly absorb the cost of construction and management costs associated with a building or a building system upgrade. Cooperative housing options also reduce competition among developers and suppliers, maximise access to housing and bolster local economies.  In California alone, cooperative housing options provide over one-third of new housing units since 2000, and over half of these units are in the San Francisco Bay Area.[2]  At the same time, new business opportunities and the infusion of capital that can come from them are scarce.  So how do communities bring affordable housing, especially in remote or developing regions, about?  The answer may lie in the form of a  cooperative housing corporation (SHC), which is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of a local government and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. A SHC is a powerful corporate vehicle with broad options and great flexibility, enabling it to address any need or desire on a broad range of assets and a publicly transparent business. It is possible that the creation of a SHC could even generate</text>

Cooperative housing trusts (CHTs), which are publicly traded cooperative housing options issued by the Federal Housing Administration and guaranteed by the government to a specified percentage of ownership, are another way to imagine community-based renewable energy resources similar to that of CHTs. In a CHT, the limited liability of the registered owner and limited common stock outstanding aligns with the responsibility of the beneficial owner, reducing the risk that a developer or other person may take advantage of the renewable energy resources of the CHT. Cooperative housing options also increase competition among developers and producers, encouraging those with assets to contribute to the development of affordable housing and incentivising those with low incomes to expand their housing portfolio with financial assets. A CHT may be formed to manage and expand renewable energy resources, providing both the beneficial owner with a stake in the renewable energy resources and the CHT with an equity stake in the renewable energy</text>

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. Within the biennial, the virtual gathers information about the biennial from numerous sources including, but not limited to, museums, archives, petitions (anonymous online publics), real-time social media, historical documents, real-time analytics and virtual tours. It then presents this information as a set of rules, procedures, or strategies for the biennial in that community, proposing solutions that maximize the relevance of this information while minimizing the number of participants or participants of any given community. The procedural element is key; the virtual gathering of information and the resultant dissemination of it is not limited to a particular event, but can and should be used to negotiate any and all circumstances. For instance, the virtual may embed analytics and social media data in historical documents or archives in order to provide context and/or amplify the information to be found within, but also to detect duplicates and ensure that information has been gathered and communicated with in a timely manner.

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. The key is that the media and platforms of the future to which we refer are not static or ephemeral, but constantly morphing and evolving. The episodic is a live, dynamic media type of knowledge producer.On the one hand, the episodic media formats the audience’s understanding of time and space as individuals with specific, bounded and constrained behaviours.‘Time Travel’ is one example of how media can structure knowledge, embodied in objects and possessions, time travel being an action that occurs when such knowledge is embodied in a tangible form but is not actually embodied in the object. In this case, the media of the object is itself live and dynamic, capable of living and dying. So the power to control and manipulate such knowledge arises through the medium through which the object is communicated. By embedding the temporal aspect of such knowledge in objects, the biennial can assume control over what is communicated and who receives and transmits it. The question becomes, can the bi</text>

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. For example, the virtual may be accessed by anyone, while the episodic gathers people from different times and places to explore the same issues in a shared space. All three modes of knowledge production seek to expand or contract the scope of knowledge by engaging with particular authors and ideas, while generating new knowledge or destroying it. The virtual may engage with the issue of time through a multiplicity of dynamic media such as music, film, interactive media, etc. that create or disturb the temporal aspect of the issue by modulating it, distorting it, or otherwise distorting its meaning. All three modes employ techniques and strategies that are dependent on the specific medium and understandings of others, yet draw different infrastructures from the same medium. The virtual may engage with the issue of location or absolute space through massively multiplayer online games that create or disturb spatial relations. All three modes employ techniques and strategies that are dependent on the information technology of the participants and understandings of others, yet draw different inf</text>

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. Within this dynamic dynamic, there are different levels of engagement; from the episodic, to the virtual, to the ‘real life’. Below ‘the archive’, we can find collections of objects that are valuable for different reasons, from the tangible, to the intangible, from personal effects, to research. The virtual is a gathering of data, maps, documents and images that is traceable and manipulates it to support various processes of knowledge production. The biennial is a gathering of similar but different kinds of data, gathered across different sites and across different media, into a shared knowledge base that is ever-evolving and dynamic. It is an episodic gathering, but it is also a ‘recurrent gathering’, gathering data to support future events, a gathering of data to support a future event, and it is a ‘metainterface’ gathering, gathering data to support a past gathering.All three kinds of gathering rely on participants</text>

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. The issue that emerges is whether the issue at hand is relevant to the episodic position, and whether the relevant media can be replicated and reproduced in different contexts. For instance, ‘climate change’ may be relevant to one’s topic of inquiry, but there is a fundamental difference between climate scientists and artists, who are mainly engaged with quantifying and measuring the phenomenon. The virtual assemblage generated by the multiple media of the biennial may or may not be relevant in perpetuity; nor may its content be relevant in the future, depending on the political dynamics and the trajectory of cultural theory. For instance, the virtual reality medium of the biennial may produce insights into contemporary society that are applicable to artistic practices contemporaneous with the emergence of social and political consciousness, but which are necessarily incomplete and variable, and hence necessarily unstable. The virtual assemblage generated by social networks may be relevant in a temporal sense, but this necessarily entails the presence and/or emergence of such</text>

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. While the virtual assemblages informatively richly annotated bibliography of biennials, they are also capable of generating knowledge resources that are more malleable and deployable.A virtual biennial is a gathering of people from different places and with different identities sharing a common interest in gathering together and coming together under common narratives, themes, or bodies of knowledge. It is a gathering of ideas, objects, ideas, data, and artifacts that happen to be present in the real world. In this sense, it is similar to a natural ethnographic survey, but it is also able to deploy technologies and social media to generate, host, and narrate its own virtual ethnographic survey. For instance, virtual biennials can draw on the ability of virtual reality to produce narratives of its own, one that is not reducible to the rigid confines of convention and identity. A virtual biennial can also employ other research-informed knowledge-production strategies, such as gathering in one place knowledge</text>

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. Video, social media, and biennials are the tools of the biennial; they are nodes within a global knowledgebase that extends from the city to remote islands. Within this global knowledgebase, biennial can operate through its nodes: its artists, curators, venue managers, journalists, students, historians and other stakeholders, and its visitors. In this model, the biennial is a gathering of worlds colliding into one another; the virtual world is a gathering of activities taking place within the museum. The important point about the virtual dimension is that it is not represented by physical objects, although biennials are sometimes driven by the desire to present an image of things as they are. Rather, the assemblage of worlds that constitute the museum is an ongoing, contingent, and dynamic assemblage of experiences.

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. In the online era of the biennial, the virtual is particularly relevant, since it is a node of a larger knowledgebase that extends beyond the biennial. All three of the new iterations of the biennial I have been invited to lead, and will lead them through their localities, exploring the cultural history and current dynamics of the city in the context of emerging biennials as distinct from previous curatorial forms.The virtual can be conceived as a collective knowledge base that emerges through the interaction of individuals, groups or phenomena. It encompasses both literal and figurative forms, and provides a platform on which actions can be taken and a means of knowing based on knowledge. In the case of an episodic biennial, the knowledge base is a set of curiosities shared between audiences, inspired by a common theme or interest, that draw audiences to events and activities.

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. The key is in the name of the project. In my view, the word ‘episodic’ implies a certain amount of repetition, whereas ‘intermittency’ implies ongoing change. So, the virtual and the episodic are not mutually exclusive, and I would propose that there is a third type of biennial that engages with new media and platforms, and that is the biennial as a gathering of multiple episodes that occur in parallel.I would propose that the episodic and the virtual are two sides of the same coin, and that the virtual is a gathering of multiple representations of the same event, such as audio, video, textual or colloquialized versions of the same event. The aim of this gathering is to be experienced simultaneously as both present and simultaneous, while the object of its occurrences is present and simultaneous. This is possible through various media, but the gathering is most effective when it is experienced as object and subject to change through its act of recogn</text>

The episodic is a constituent part of the virtual, while the virtual is a mode of engagement that emerges from the interplay of different media and platforms. The diverse media and platforms that make up our society today necessitate that we constantly reconceive and reimagine our knowledgebase, so it is with concern for the ecology of the biennial that I turn to consider its place within a larger social and political system that is increasingly dependent on virtual gathering, but less so in the face of physical destruction.The virtual gathering of people, places, objects and information is an increasingly important part of contemporary society. It enables a sense of sharedness and facilitates the exchange of information and knowledge in a multitude of new ways. But it is also a gathering of humans that can be exploited by powerful entities for their own ends. And so we are constantly bombarded with information that is of no value in the world around us, but which is valuable in other ways. And so we must constantly re-create our knowledgebase in order to keep up with the new information, and this takes different forms: constructing icons, constructing facts, constructing narratives.

They also act as metaphorical stepping stones to higher ground, or sovereign nations, which can further define the bounds of sovereignty. 	Today, the biopolitical biennial is a geopolitical fiction. The historic tendency has been for biennials to inhabit territories or regions that are contested and/or unsettled by the anthropologist/intellectual/politician. The twenty-first century is likely to see a return to this traditional anthropological/intellectual/political (AND) groundedness. The twenty-first century will likely bring about a politicised and ethnocentric sense of national belonging. These are hopeful signs, even for those caught up in the vortex of globalisation and its discontents.

National parks provide a physical barrier between the past and the future, a setting in which the national identity can be forcefully imprinted and erased. However, this has often been done in ways that set back national interests or stir up tension with neighboring nations. In the twentieth century, this wasn’t possible, and the last vestiges of empire were swept away into the vast machines that are the state. 	Today, the last vestiges of imperial are being replaced by the machines of globalization and climate change. These new arrivals are not seeking order or belonging but simply the possibility of difference, novelty and new things to do. In this new environment of constant mass transit, shopping malls, entertainment complexes and research centers, the old imperial forms are being thrown into chaos. The question is what comes next? 	One possible direction for the biopolitics of the environment is as a narrative in and through which stories from the past might be told. In   	Forecasting the Environment (1996), Michael</text>

National parks provide a physical barrier between the past and the future, creating what Stephen Leacock would term ‘a kind of private zone’ between the past and the space of the future.1 	This kind of ‘space-time’ is often cited as the archetypal space of the ‘common man’, but it is often harder to define precisely what this common space is. As Le Corbusier famously stated, space is the realm of the ‘noble savage’, and while the common man may share certain basic needs and wants, he does not share the same common territory or common history. While there may be common ground to be shared, if the common ground is shared in space then it is shared in time – namely, in the sense that it is receptive to all kinds of difference and is influenced by all kinds of different experiences. In other words, the common ground cannot be found in the natural or ‘natural’ places, and locating the</text>

National parks provide a physical barrier between established power and its rebellious subjects, while the allegiances of their users are frequently invisible or subverted. 	The political park is a convenient place to operate within. It is a space of the powerless understood expansively, where the invisible and subaltern masses can breathe a sigh of relief. It is a zone of the disenfranchised seen as individuals with a voice, capable of holding their own in an uncertain world. It is a zone where individuals can draw strength and confidence from the unknown, while feeling secure in the knowledge that others care deeply about the place where they live and work. 	The political park is a convenient space for those at the top to hide, while the rest of us scramble to find our footing. It is a place of the comfortable in power, but also a place of the vulnerable held captive by financial markets and powerful interests. It is a place where powerful interests can prey on its resources for their own gain. 	The political park is the convenient place</text>

National parks provide a physical barrier between different worlds, circumscribing power and making spaces in which to be citizens of different worlds. The creation of such a public realm is often seen by planners and political actors as a means to an ultimate end: a shared identity, a shared language, a shared history. 	However, the public realm that is made is not always what is publicly seen. Sometimes the public realm makes us uncomfortable, even uncomfortable in our guts. Public realms are made by breaking them down into components, extracting what is useful from them, and giving to the common good. In other words, they are places where we want to take a step back and ask, can this really be achieved? 	When planning a major project such as the one we are undertaking in Birmingham, we want to break it into smaller pieces and reveal what makes it tick. We want to know how this affects our everyday lives, what it means for a project to be passive, and so on. We also want to know what</text>

The creation of such a public realm also serves as a public relations campaign ground for the reclamation of national identity and allegiances. 	The nineteenth-century idea of the national park emerged from the book of Leviticus  (the book that literally translates as &quot;the book of the nations&quot;), the Hebrew term for the parts of the land that make up the nation. Leviticus 19:22ff declares that the Lord your God is giving you back 'the land that heilat Israel from the hand of the Philistines…'&quot;The land that the Philistines… encircled with arable land, with water and metal for public buildings, and other valuable things – including the whole Sinai Peninsula and parts of Akaba…'&quot;The Lord your God is giving you back the land that heilat Israel from the hand of the Philistines…'&quot;This estine…is your</text>

A second, yet often overlooked but crucial, element in the ecosystem that is constantly (very roughly) measured and measured again and again is ecosystem governance. 	Over the past century, the number one issue for politicians seeking to expand or reconceive the ecology of the nation-state has been (in my estimation) the growth of national parks, primarily as a way to bolster the size and territorial reach of the state.1 As a percentage of the overall size of the park, the number of national parks has steadily increased over time. In 1960, there were approximately 447 national parks and 1.6 million square miles of territory within them. By the mid-1990s, this had expanded to 735 parks and 447 million square miles.

National parks provide a physical and metaphoric boundary that separates the territories of the empire from those of the common people. National parks are the sites where conflicting national identifications are constantly contested. When constructing transit systems, railroads, airports and other infrastructure, engineers frequently employ the geography of the nation as a source of desirable characteristics, including the physical characteristics of hard-surface modes of transit, such as highways and tunnels, that enhance the accessibility of goods and services. The infrastructure of the nation is constructed from the material and conceptual elements of the nation. When construction is cursory and all technological means are employed, the physical and metaphoric character of the nation is actively underestimated. The fraught relationship between the technocratic and the nationalist is constantly at war with the very notion of the nation. 	The biopolitics of the infrastructure of the nation is closely related to the biopolitics of the environment. In the nineteenth-century social-engineering movement, theories of the diminishing returns on industrial capital emerged. These theorists argued that governments</text>

Urban landscapes are depopulated, their landscape transformed by unsustainable modes of transportation, housing and agriculture. Meanwhile, the biopolitics of the environment is increasingly seen as a hindrance to future growth, as globalisation encroaches upon all but the wealthiest nations. Instead of the ephemeral, the political park seems to be an increasingly globalised construct. Urban sprawl and its discontents. 	Urban sprawl is a complex phenomenon that is best understood as a function of finance capital and its opaque, quasi-legal, tax-free entities. It is an ongoing tendency in which wealthy nations entrench themselves deeper into the globalised capitalist mode, turning ever more fully into the mode of their collective future dependency.

National parks provide a physical boundary between two or more nations, regions or cultures, thus offering a physical and ideological barrier between the host and the outsider. National parks are a recurring feature in national histories and document important historical moments in which the influence of European powers is felt. In the nineteenth century, for instance, the Nakota-Kuskokwaka River Delta in upstate New York became the site of the first international shipping lanes when the United States established a monopoly on third-party logisticians. In the twentieth century, the St. Lawrence Seaway in Quebec became the site of the trans-Mississippian and inter-siberian free trade routes as well as the trans-Canada highway system. In the twenty-first century the Paris-Tours-de-Mliès waterfront and the Champs-Élysélys are likely to host the Mémoires de l’Aiguaine, a literary festival dedicated to the automobile, and the Biennale di Vic</text>

In these and other cities, it showed that it shared the biennale’s interest in showing the latest discoveries from around the world, and in so doing, encouraged a global tourism industry fuelled by the exhibition’s prodigious branding.  Biennales are now the largest tourist attraction in their host city, and continue to be significant in their post-biennial form.

The biennale’s thirty-sixth birthday was celebrated in a number of European cities, and a number of South American cities held festivals in honor of the biennale’s thirty-sixth birthday. In Venice, the Biennale used the venue as a festival ground and a space for the official public consumption, public programs, and an official exhibition of the biennale’s products. In 2017, the Biennale relaunched as the Biennale di Tommasi, using the venue as a site for its entertainment, exhibitions, and the as yet undiscovered potential of hosting a series of films.  As a biennale, its main mission is to transport visitors to places where they can participate in the cultural exchange, exchange, and theorize about the social conditions surrounding the present. As such, it is prescient in that it anticipates the present,</text>

The 2016 Biennale was somewhat overshadowed by the volcano that erupted in Hawaii in April 2017, but its significance is still questionable. The eruption sent plumes of ash and volcanic ash into the sky, disrupting power grids and leaving a huge wake in the path of wind and solar energy production. It is also believed to have contributed to an increase in sea-level rise.)  Biennials have a long, storied relationship with their localities, and the fact that we now live in a world where these spectacles are increasingly uncommonr still, is a testament to their power.

In these performances, the biennale’s curatorial homework was to provoke a reaction from the audience – to find a way to engage them in a way that would allow it to continue to present the challenge that it had faced just a few years earlier.  The challenge in the present case is that the biennale has become entwined with the ever-present threat of terrorism, and, in the age of instant gratification, the only way to truly engage the audience is to be present for hours upon hours in a row, in a constant state of anticipation and meditation, while the threat looms. The only way to truly know and inhabit the place and the time is to be there for the duration, year in and year out, for as long as the bi</text>

It did, however, host the Venice Architecture Biennale, held in June 2018, which was itself a global sensation.The biennale’s enormous human capital equation – its seemingly impossible to quantify – is further accentuated by the fact that, as biennales go, it is almost a miracle that any particular one has lasted more than a few years. For this reason, biennials tend to outlive their formal, cultural and economic contexts. In the case of Venice, the biennale came to represent both the city and the festival in a single art exhibition. In the case of Doha, the biennale and the holy city, it brought together two very different cultures who, through a single institution, were able to emerge from their specific worlds.The relationship between biennials and art events has continued to be a point of contention, and</text>

The two performances were delivered by a curator team led by Kunsthal architects, and included a number of curatorial innovations including using 3D modeling and printing to fabricate apparatuses of the past as present through the use of nano-materials, organic building materials and insulators, and nano-rods, and the incorporation of archaeology, ethnography and cultural geography in the production of architectural forms.

Its relationship to the city, and particularly its tendency to perforate the city, has deepened in the past decade, and the biennale’s present curatorial orientation is a testimony to its importance.  It created an international sensation when, in 2015, it selected a section of Mirós to be used as a platform for Venice’s public celebration of the Italian Festival, but even then, it was slow to respond to the festival’s growing public presence in Venice. It also needs to be noted that, between 2015 and 2017, the biennale staged a number of performances around the globe, most notably at the Gran Sasso Center in Turin, and at the Performances at 20th Venice Bay, and at the 27th Venice Biennale, as well as at the Embassy of Curators in New York. In these performances, the biennale’s public curatorial hand selected acts from a public that was already encouraged by the biennale’s performances, and the biennale itself encouraged a public to be influenced by the performances. So, the performance as a whole is promoted by the credibility of the organisers, and the performance as an entire is promoted by legitimacy of the audience.  And yet, the audience is also constantly surrounded by other people’s work, and by their presence. The audience is a tool – a human resource – and its realisation depends on many factors, including what the audience wants, how it is physically moved, and in what sort of environments it lives. The reason why</text>

In 2018, the biennale opened for business at the Arsenale in Venice, and its new curatorial approach clearly signals a return to form: the biennale is organising events on a global scale, and its productions are produced in Istanbul and Milan.  It has also organised a number of public exhibitions around the world, most notably at the Arsenale, Granthale, Paris, and Olympic Games venues in London, New York, and Istanbul.  Its speciality, in the context of globalisation, is the presentation of an evolving, cross-dressing roster of artists and cultural-political-ideological individuals, often in collaboration with local or regional governments, who are coming to grips with the contemporaneous situation in which they find themselves. This is a reality that is experienced, experienced and analysed in Venice</text>

The biennale's current orientation, however, is entirely predictable: it is a collection of images, a marketplace for images, a kind of art fair, and a kind of exhibition hall. It is a marketplace of images that is almost entirely self-organized, self-sufficient, and self-contained within the Venetian urban landscape.Its current global spread is a kind of randomised effect. It does not follow that everywhere in the world is staring at the same kind of biennale photograph. Rather, it is the contrary: there are places where the biennale is almost always looked at from, and those places are where the biennale’s media are most powerful. And this kind of global spread is happening at a faster rate than anywhere else, which is creating a kind of blind spot for artists and curators. It is as if the biennale is looking at a</text>

For instance, it is possible to model the ‘distance between words’ in order to detect grammatically incorrect or ambiguous text, as well as the ‘space-time curvature’ that results from the imperfections of human linguistic synthesis. It is also possible to translate arbitrary text or grammatically incorrect patterns into grammatically correct forms, thereby producing syntactic ambiguities that can be resolved through mathematical operations.More and more of our interactions with the internet are occurring online, and yet there is still considerable uncertainty about what constitutes ‘seriousness’ and what constitutes ‘likes’ on the internet. Is it serious when a post is shared thousands of times on a single social media platform (like Facebook) but receives tens of thousands of ‘likes’?

It is a way of modelling and processing that data in a more efficient way than is possible with traditional modelling and data-intensive calculations.Machine learning is particularly useful in situations involving large amounts of data, such as natural language understanding or social network analysis, because the underlying mathematical models allow for the detection of ‘spaces’ and ‘patterns’ that are not necessarily malicious but can nevertheless be classified as such. For example, identifying ‘spaces’ by virtue of their frequency with which a sentence is given can be used to infer ‘patterns’ about the world through which a computer operates. By understanding how sentences are formed and conveying these patterns to spoken language, machine learning can be used to detect grammatical errors or other imperfections in language – flaws that can be corrected through mathematical algorithms. This type of imperfection detection is part of what is sometimes called ‘deep learning’, a branch of artificial intelligence that is particularly interested in recognising patterns and inferring meaning from data.Machine learning is particularly useful in situations involving large amounts of data, such as natural language understanding or social network analysis, because the underlying mathematical models allow for the detection of grammatical errors or other imperfections in language – flaws that can be corrected through mathematical algorithms.

This is especially important in understanding ‘global’ issues such as climate change or ‘geographical’ features of urban environments, such as the movement of goods and people, or ‘infrastructure connectivity’, which are increasingly influenced by financial and political systems. Theorems of mathematical models of ‘space-time’ can be used to deduce phenomena such as climate change, urban evolution or political unrest, while  Sylvester Hamilton’s Law of Accelerating Returns describes the tendency for new technological paradigms to accrue exponential growth curves.Machine learning is particularly useful when applied to natural language processing because ‘languages’ can ‘learn’, i.e. be pattern-specific, scalable and self-repairing, enabling systems to detect anomalies and replace worn-out components with newer, more performant versions.

Examples of this in action include the image recognition systems used in police-type crime-scene investigation or in the detection of small-scale drug-trafficking operations. Machine learning is also used in the production of art, where artists are often engaged in self-branding or self-improvement initiatives. Examples of this in action include bands such as the Pixies, whose 1993 punk rock 'Idioteque’ EP included an extended portmanteau of the words ‘pixies’ and ‘pirates’ – an allusion to intelligence agencies – and the Clash, whose self-titled 1991 debut included an extended portmanteau of the words ‘clashes’ and ‘rivals’.The use of symbols and names in texts and online is also widespread, as is the adoption of new technologies that monitor and analyse our online behaviour</text>

In the context of social networking, this applies particularly to nonhuman systems that rely on social networks for their functionality: systems that can be understood by data mining, machine translation and data extraction.Machine learning is particularly useful when employed as part of a larger analysis that seeks to uncover ‘hidden’ factors that contribute to a phenomenon's occurrence, such as socio-cultural trends or political allegiances. Such factors can be identified and addressed in larger societal schemes through what is sometimes termed a ‘deep dive’, or eradication, of which machine learning is a part.Deep dives into phenomena are often employed as a last resort, a last resort being precisely what it means to quell unrest when large amounts of data and phenomena are gathered and examined in aggregate.

A computer algorithm that performs geo-tagging (detection and manipulation of locations) can be programmed to spot such things as temporary buildings placed in front of major highways or major transport corridors, or ‘spaces’ and ‘time’ that are affected by traffic, or ‘space’ and ‘time’ in general. Such detecting functions can be programmed into autonomous vehicles, planes, ships, tunnels and much more.Machine learning is particularly relevant with regard to the threat from militant Islamism, because its detection and manipulation of large amounts of data sets the conditions for the emergence of ‘highly accurate and malleable fake news stories’ – fictoias that mimic the appearance of historical events, but are actually stories told by humans in an automated fashion. Such reports deliberately distort or fabricate historical events in order to bolster a narrative of Islamic supremacism, imperialism, or other extreme ideologies</text>

For example, machine learning can be used to detect when articles or comments online are political in nature, or refer to specific political groups, or are simply malicious in nature. It can also be used to detect opportunistic behaviour – i.e. behaviour that is designed to be exploited but can be used to further a political or economic agenda – such as opportunistic spending by political parties or political movements.All of these behaviours are understood by the political and economic machines that interpret and produce language, but there are other types of understanding that are equally as important and may be even more pernicious: racial, ethnic and ideological categories, classifications, stereotypes and prejudices. The massive amounts of data generated by social networks today are likely to add to this already pervasive linguistic explosion, making it ever more difficult to imagine a world without the need for interpreters.

It is a way of modelling and processing that data in a more efficient way than is possible with traditional modelling and data-intensive calculations.Machine learning is particularly useful in situations involving large amounts of data, such as natural language understanding or social network analysis, because the underlying mathematical models allow for the detection of ‘spaces’ and ‘time gaps’ in data, in much the same way that Google’s &quot;pages&quot; or Microsoft’s &quot;files&quot; do. Such processing can detect, within seconds, when a piece of text, a photo or a video has been shared; when it has been viewed; whether it has been liked or not; and so forth. More generally, it enables machines to understand and process vast amounts of data in much the same way that humans do. The key concepts here are those of probability and statistics.Machine learning is not new, nor is it new to the computer. Historically, algorithms have been used to classify images or data sets into categories – ‘classes’ – based on similarities or differences between objects or data sets. Images of flowers or birds or buildings are examples of categories, such as landscapes or nature, that can be categorised. But unlike categorisation in humans, where similarities or differences between objects or data sets are valued or required for a given object to</text>

Such ‘space-based’ representations allow the user to ‘solve’ problems through discovery and discovery of patterns, rather than constructing ‘ideal’ solutions through calculation and theory. Such spaces-based representations also lend themselves to ‘machine learning’ – the application of mathematical modelling and data-intensive algorithms to data to produce ‘better’ solutions through deeper structure than is possible with traditional modelling and data-intensive calculations.We use the term ‘machine learning’ loosely, but in its original sense, which I gather is that which is relevant to our situation. More specifically, this refers to the use of data to augment the capabilities of human interpretation and computation, and to augment the capabilities of language as a whole. It does not necessarily refer to the use of algorithms to automate human language interpretation and computation. More specifically, this refers to algorithms that augment</text>

This is sometimes called ‘feature engineering’ and it involves engineering ‘to be realised eventually in software’, or ‘future-proofing’ by engineering into reality what is sometimes called ‘Google’s miracle’.Machine learning is particularly valuable in situations involving large amounts of data because it is able to detect patterns and distinguish between ‘human error’ and ‘meaningful variation’, the latter of which is often used to justify the creation of new algorithms. For instance, there is growing evidence that older ad formats are dying a slow death due to the inefficiency of data capture and processing, but new media is augmenting their capabilities in unexpected ways. For instance, the explosion of social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter coincided with an explosion in in-app purchases and the purchase of highly personalised content, which encouraged app developers to</text>

The Biennale is an international art-historical institution with a unique position in its own right. Established in 1962 and based in the Venetian city of Venice, it encompasses over 400,000 square feet of exhibition space, 400,000 square feet of workshop and exhibition space, and is the largest remaining collection of its kind. It is managed by the Museo Rendonçação de Arte Contempora (Research Centre for Contemporary Art) and Federico Fellini (Institute of Art and Art History).1 	The Biennale’s exhibition record begins in the year 1962, and while the institute’s holdings are questionable, its activities during that decade are characterised by a low profile, frequent character invites, and occasional curatorial interventions. During the decade, the Biennale conducted over 1,000 exhibitions worldwide, most of which were not centrally located</text>

Inside the Biennale itself, the conversations about where art and culture should be located often stray into hyperbole. The biennale’s current site for contemplation, Heaven on Earth in Turin, is a large and beautiful urban structure with a garden and a plaza once a day with a statue of St George, flanked by other statues of the same saint. The Biennale’s mandate is questioned by today’s cultural milieu, which places a great premium on individual artist expression and public engagement.

But we mustn’t assume that our actions or theorisations are a substitute for working within the capacities and practices of communities and working with people ourselves to create what other people would like and need. In fact, every step we take is actively generated and depends on large volumes of data and feedback loops. If we simply copy-and-pasted theories and deliberate recreations of practices and communities around art forms we have created, over and over again, then we would end up with fantastically complex art forms. But this is not the case. The important thing is to understand that what we do and how we do it has a huge impact on the world around us, and that is why so many artists and creative professionals around the world continue to work, study and lead effective and meaningful lives choices – in other words, they stay connected to the art world and engage with it.  </text>

But none of these things are to be taken for granted, nor are they to be dismissed as somehow ‘better’ than others. Changes in practices may be needed in order to adapt to changes in habitats and in urbanisation, and such adaptation is a dynamic process that must be actively engaged with in order to truly understand the potentialities and challenges of new art forms. The role of the artist and the community in this process is to be engaged, and as part of this, the art form itself needs to be encouraged to evolve.The interesting thing about participation in art forms other than art galleries and museums is that it is as if we have no rights whatsoever.

However, it is not our place to judge others and to create a work that others will consume and embrace. We are not artists and we are not here to be admired or esteemed. We are here to make art and give it meaning and make it happen.When we started The Resident, we had no idea what the future held for us. We never imagined ourselves to be artists or to have a significant impact on any art form. We just wanted to be left alone to think things through and make our own choices. Our practice began to diverge from what others imagined possible for a resident. We would paint houses, make crafts, do house-hunting and take trips to the beach. Little did we know that our activities would one day put our identity in question and would ultimately lead to us being labelled as culturally deprived and disenfranchised.When we started The Resident, we</text>

It is entirely legitimate and even possible to pursue ‘real-life’ causes and social enterprises that serve communities. But to claim that your practices are not only relevant and poetic but also proceed through the process of cultural production is to deny the historical and contemporaneity of exploitative economic forms and political hierarchies. To do so is to participate in the capitalist logic of consumption, not to mention the embedded ecological and material relations of poverty.  Creativity, then, has a social and political context that is complex and uneven, but it has to be addressed. The difficult work of cultural negotiation is done through craft and the subtle work of power, both economic and social. It is a social necessity to participate in this process, and it is a valuable and beautiful legacy to leave behind. But this hard work has a political context as well. The politics of culture are complex, and the complex social structures that emerge from them are often abused or destroyed in the interest of power and profit.

It is entirely legitimate and even possible to pursue these things independently, with no knowledge of each other gained through formal or informal forums or networks. But it is also entirely possible that, as a result of such an initiative, other initiatives may follow suit and form a mutually reinforcing movement of interaction and knowledge. This is the dynamic of mapping. It starts small and winds up huge, and it is this ongoing spiraling that creates the sense of discovery and excitement. Sometimes, just to see what other places we might want to be, to know where we are, and to know what might happen, can be exciting. 	But, as we have seen, that is only possible because there is a biennial around. There are many more pressing issues to be addressed, and art is often the first casualty of this war on issues. The art biennial is a casualty of its own permissive agenda, which pre-exists its value in ways that other kinds of works are not. We should be looking for other forms</text>

But when we embark on projects and initiatives that we have no formal or institutional power to undertake because we lack the appropriate institutional or political support, we risk becoming alienated or even alienated ourselves. The power to initiate and foster ‘institutional change’ lies in the hands of those with whom we come into contact; when we abandon our true roots and seek external validation, we risk becoming objects of external criticism. To date, this has been the case for many artists and art institutions, who feel the need to publicly reaffirm their commitment to socially engaged and ‘political artist’ culture through powerful symbols, catchy slogans and the like. But this only serves to underscore the internal tensions that exist between the different art forms and their practitioners, and it weakens the hand of those with whom to engage in meaningful debate and negotiation.  Local</text>

However, it is not helpful to others to assume that their knowledge, expertise or desire to work in a community-based context is something they can pass on to future generations. Working in communities is not a right, it is a necessity, and it is something that artists must be able to negotiate in order to achieve success. It is encouraging to see how some artists are succeeding where others are failing. However, it is also a necessary precondition for any kind of sustained positive change, and it is precisely this failure to fail that is generating so much resistance from within the art world.  	[1] Unravelled, 2013.

But the postulating of superior cultural capacities and worldviews over disparate practices and beliefs? That is wrongheaded and cannot be supported by our current economic and social systems. More and more people are coming to realise that: a) the institutions and ideologies that created and promoted capitalism in the first place are still with us and that b) the social, political and economic changes that have to happen in order to address the underlying causes and root causes of the crisis and inequality we are experiencing now, are impossible and c) there are other ways of organising and operating. That is, there are other forms of cultural production that can be assembled and that are more easily transferable across disciplines and cultures.

We mustn’t allow our own ignorance to rule our future knowledge.Creating understandings of one’s species through art is not a perfect reflection of the world as a whole, but it serves to open our minds and hearts to the vastness of the world around us. It frees us from the prison of our own species. In the words of Francis Galton, ‘the magic of the human spirit is that it cannot be controlled or reasoned with’.1 It is time for all of us to embark on what Galton describes as ‘the long and potentially disastrous march of knowledge’.2 This march is not just</text>

The local must be engaged in the current, although sometimes this engagement can be uncomfortable. The audience member must be able to identify with the subject of the work, and furthermore, the topic of the art world. Art has a responsibility to constantly remind the audience why it exists, beyond the art world at large. The biennial has the potential to become a staging ground for a multitude of voices to be heard, however specificised this may be. The event must reflect the cultural values and politics of the area, and its users must be engaged beyond the art world at large in the creation of a new understanding of those values and politics. In undertaking this massive task, it is the audience that is transformed, and the audience that owns the narrative.  Art has a responsibility to inform the story of the world in a way that is both accessible and unexpected. Such a responsibility does not come without risk, and biennials have had to be both careful not to impose their vision on audiences, and creative strategisers about how their art world counterparts might react.

The audience member who becomes a writer or curator is well placed to see that the present is constantly undergoing change, and to anticipate what the future may hold. The most valuable aspects of the job are in the long term interest period, when the art world can truly value what it has achieved in the present and invest in the future, and this is where biennials excel. The value of what is produced in the biennial period must be invested in the artworld as a whole. The task of creating a biennial is not in the museum, gallery or art dealer, but in the broader society. Biennials are produced in a particular geographical area and for a particular audience, so proximity and globalisation play a part in their success. The museum, gallery or art dealer might invest in a particular area, but the main thrust of the industry is delivered by artists, who in turn provide a service to</text>

The modus operandi is to expose audiences to different ways of seeing the world through different perspectives.  The reason why biennials are texts that are continually revised through the use of language is precisely because the politics of language are constantly exposed to different viewpoints. Every generation of biennial visitors has to pass through the text of the Biennalee Surpasses the Text, in order to arrive at the other side. The challenge for the art world today is to engage the local in the construction of the future of the Biennalee. The local must be engaged in the current, although sometimes this engagement can be uncomfortable. The audience member must be able to identify with the notion of the Biennalee, recognising the structural similarities between the present and the past, but also the ways in which the present is radically different from the future.  The audience member must also have the ability to imagine the future, although this can be done in many ways. For instance, the audience member could imagine themselves in the present, but in a different world, with a different language, customs and religions. The ability to imagine the future is a biennial event, so the audience member must be able to imagine the past, too.  The audience member also has to have the capacity to imagine the complexity of the world, to grasp the different social worlds that intersect in and between the cities, and to understand the politics of language. This is particularly true of peoples of colour, since their social lives are often shaped by the media that colourates their world.

The local must be engaged in the current, although sometimes this engagement can be uncomfortable. The audience member must be able to identify with the point of view of the artist in order to appreciate the art. Biennials today are texts that are constantly inspected and revised, and the audience members who pass through the door are exposed to a new version every day. Every revision and every input is analysed and used to create the next version. This process of sharing information and evolving the narrative of the Biennalee is continuous, and the audience members who come through the door every day are exposed to a new understanding of the past every time the Biennalee is staged. Every step of the way, this process has been designed with a local in mind, and every decision that the biennial makes is designed with a local in mind.  An audience member asks the artist to imagine an alternative future, one in which there is no war, there is no poverty, and people everywhere are free. The audience member then asks the question: what would you do differently? In this version of the question, the audience member is</text>

The local must be engaged in the current, although sometimes this engagement can be uncomfortable. The audience member must be able to suspend their disbelief. If the art world is going to allow this sort of temporality to develop, then other artworlds will have to follow suit.  The question is whether the audience is willing to give up some of the in-person experience of the art world in order to participate in this ongoing dialogue. Asking whether the audience is willing to become more mobile in its understanding of the world is the first step in any critical dialogue.  If the audience is dispassionate, it can analyze the situation and arrive at a conclusion that is more easily acceptable by those with power and connections.  The audience member may be able to identify with the role of the curator in that institutionally-embedded way that is necessary for the ongoing proliferation of art museums and the changing of the art-world itself.  The audience member may be able to identify with the habit of the curator’s that demands constant re-branding on a global basis in order to survive in the eyes</text>

The audience member must be able to recognise the author of the text, or programme maker, by their first letter.

The audience member must also be able to understand the cultural relativism that follows from the inclusion of a specific culture in a text. The audience member must be able to negotiate the boundary between what is considered to be ‘public’ and what is considered ‘private’ – a feat that few artists currently perform, even in the art world, at this level of sophistication.  The question that remains is which level of sophistication the artist will become. If the biennial becomes a global phenomenon, the next step is likely to be the</text>

The challenge for the art world today is to engage the local in the construction of the future of the Biennalee. The local must be engaged in the current, although sometimes this engagement can be uncomfortable. The audience member must be able to recognise themselves in the work, and to feel like a part of that audience. In the public sphere, this engagement with the local is often accompanied by an internal revision of the meaning of the institution itself. The Biennalee is a global art institution, and the audience member’s engagement with the art world is not confined to the site where the art is being displayed, but extends much further. In this sense, the Biennalee is a kind of a missionary enterprise, presenting art from many places at once. The power of this medium lies in its ability to create associations, to be heard and understood by many people at once. The challenge is in persuading those associations that are already there to be forged into new associations. The art world is trying to figure out how to best engage the local in the construction of the future of the Biennalee, and the local is trying to figure out how to best engage the art world in the construction of the past.

The challenge for the art world today is to engage the local in the construction of the future of the Biennalee.

The audience member who falls for the false promise of a cultural tourism promotion or the random sampling of artist's hometown must be able to recognise the politics of cultural exchange.  The ability to understand the other is the first casualty of globalization. Languages are written by the victors in the global language wars. Today, the audience member is the winner, whatever she or he says or does. The audience member is the arbiter of what is understood and understood by all.  The audience member is not just any audience member. She or he is the dominant reader, speaker and consumer of cultural resources today. She or he is a cultural critic, anthropologist, journalist or curator.

The local must be engaged in the current, although sometimes this engagement can be uncomfortable. The audience member must be able to articulate why they are there and why they are not leaving. This engagement is anticipated, to a large extent, by the fact that biennials today inhabit a globalised and interconnected world. The audience member’s own (often naïve) perspective on the world is constantly being challenged, often through language that is not understood by the audience.  The biennial is the last frontier in what William Shakespeare called ‘the play of all spaces’. Shakespeare’s play, which was a historical document of the rise and fall of empires, is a metaphor for the clash between the new world order of information and culture and the old feudal order of authority. The rapid proliferation of information technologies and media, their global circulation and constant on-the-fly updating, the constant need to communicate with one another via social media, the emergence of ever more efficient ways of mapping and locating objects, the fluid exchange of goods and services, and the constant re-purposing of infrastructure – all of</text>

The challenge for the art world today is to engage the local in the construction of the future of the Biennalee. The local must be engaged in the current, although sometimes this engagement can be uncomfortable. The audience member must be able to identify with at least some of the themes being explored, in order to engage with the future of the Biennalee. Biennials have access to a particular set of tools that allow the artist to engage with audiences in various ways, including but not limited to: the museum, theatre, gallery and the street. The Biennalee is a prototypical example of a museum-based art institution that offers a range of interactive activities that are mutually exclusive, and in the broadest sense, no-platformed. It is a venue where art is exchanged, understood and enacted through exhibitions, public events, private collections and through the archiving and presentation of ethnographic and archival materials. It is a highly visible art institution with a cultural impact that extends well beyond its borders. It is a prototypical example of a cultural institution that is both efficient and socially engaged. The important thing is that the Biennalee survives and produces new work in ways that are neither static nor predetermined.</text>

The primary function of the biennial is to house and present the latest and greatest art from around the world, in a form suitable for consumption by visitors to the place. This social function is supported by a network of museums and galleries worldwide, which is a dynamic mixture of historic and contemporary art, architecture, performance, events and much more. It is a dynamic mixture, and art biennials have been a part of it since its beginning.The concept of the biennial has gained a lot of traction lately, mostly due to the economic aspect of biennials. The economic model of the biennial is the direct replication of a traditional gallery showing a set of artworks in a city over and above the regular gallery displays. In other words, biennials are art galleries in a city. They are commercial enterprises that draw visitors to the gallery in exchange for a fee. Each biennial has different levels of tourist revenue support, and the biennial as a class exhibits a strong forms of subsidiarity in its revenue-generating mechanisms. Direct mirroring of performance-based art transactions is a core business model of the biennial.The museum-level is the most visible element of this new form of economic</text>

The primary function of the biennial is to house and present the latest and greatest art from around the world, in a form suitable for consumption by visitors to the place. This social function is supported by a network of museums, galleries, and other art resources worldwide. The art, in turn, is often presented in a multitude of forms, each with their own unique relationship to art and the social. The art fair is the major venue for this social production, but the other resources now also play a role in producing, displaying, and organizing the events. These have been largely liquidated or modified to meet the needs of the various social actors involved in the production of the biennial, but their importance has not been limited to this. Social media play an increasingly important role in this production as well, having been largely invented as a way to participate in and participate in a social life outside of traditional museum museums.  If the social aspect is taken into account, the biennial becomes something completely different. It is possible to grow rich from the sale of cultural commodities, after all.  The interesting thing about biennials is that they are an ever-present and thus flexible source of cultural and social change, not least</text>

The primary function of the biennial is to house and present the latest and greatest art from around the world, in a form suitable for consumption by visitors to the place. This social function is supported by a network of museums, whose collections, including those of the famous major museums, are the primary venue for displaying and communicating the latest and greatest art from around the world. The increasing numbers of museums and their collections, and the network of biennials that they support mean that the importance of the art they house and the art that they present will only grow. This is evident in their exhibition and catalogue formats – new biennials are being formed around collections and collections, and their catalogue-based exhibitions – which include works not from museums, but from anywhere that has a collection of art. The importance of this final strand in the film, and in contemporary art today more broadly, is on display, as it were. It is to be seen as emerging from the various permutations and floods of art that have rendered the world around it (and us) in various ways. This is, to a large extent, what biennials are about: they are about art being made elsewhere, and so they are an essential</text>

The primary function of the biennial is to house and present the latest and greatest art from around the world, in a form suitable for consumption by visitors to the place. This social function is supported by a network of museums and art institutions worldwide, which also include short-lived but important sibling institutions in cities like Venice, which also host the Biennale’s wealthy patron, the Giacometrelli.  And this is just the part of the story.  The biennial has a social function too, one that is partly supported by tourism and partly funded by governments around the world. It is the ultimate international exhibitionary formulator. So while it may seem trivial and politically expedient to present the latest and greatest work in a place like the Venice Biennale, this is also true of the biennale itself. Governments around the world, wealthy and poor alike, want to see work that lives in communities. They want to know how it is that a place like Venice can be such an example to the world. That is, why do so many wealthy nations, like Venice, have such a significant impact on their economies? Biennials are symbols of this world-historical-economic</text>

The primary function of the biennial is to house and present the latest and greatest art from around the world, in a form suitable for consumption by visitors to the place. This social function is supported by a network of museums, galleries, archives and underground venues. Some of these collections and underground venues will host exhibitions, while others will host monologues and poetry readings. The collections and underground venues that the biennial gathers around it – around which social and political processes are also taking place – are growing in number and variety, and they are home to important new artists and curators. But the biennial is not just interested in holding something new in store for visitors; it also needs to be able to situate this newness in time and space. Hence the increasing use of temporary exhibitions, mapping out new themes or topics, and the outright commissioning of art that is both new and of a type. The increase in numbers and types of art being made in the UK and abroad is primarily a result of the accessibility of both types of art. But the biennial is just one element in a much larger social and cultural production that is happening all around us, and so it is vital that the collections and underground venues</text>

The primary function of the biennial is to house and present the latest and greatest art from around the world, in a form suitable for consumption by visitors to the place. This social function is supported by a network of museums, including: Acreas, the oldest and largest biennial in the world, with over 3,000 exhibitions a year; Xi'an Museum of Art, the largest in China; Tate Modern, the largest museum of modern art in the UK; ZKM Museum of Modern Art, the oldest and largest museum of modern and contemporary art in the world; and the Swiss National Gallery. All these museums and art institutions are important sites for their respective fields of study, but they are also significant for the social and political functions they render to present a particular image of a place or a region. All of these institutions are important in their own right, but the critical role they play in envisioning and producing the new art that is exhibited in biennials is perhaps the most visible and valuable.

This social function is supported by a network of museums, educational institutions and other art-historical and archival sites around the world. It is this diverse pool of sites that make up the museum and the biennial that is so distinctive and interesting. It is this diversity that is made possible by the discovery and deposition of large amounts of data on a massive scale. It is this diversity that is made possible by the collaborative efforts of a community of artists, curators, art writers and arts administrators committed to producing high-quality, contemporary art wherever possible. It is this diversity that is made possible by the advent of computer modelling and data mining, which allowed artists, curators and art administrators to produce works that were not intended to be seen by a general public, thereby enabling the establishment of ever more remote, restricted and fragmented biennials. The advent of social media also plays a part in this picture-perfect diversity game, enabling artists, curators and art administrators to connect with and engage with audiences outside of their own locality or place. </text>

Biennials are the contemporary heirs to the collections that museums began building in earnest around the turn of the twentieth century. With the turn of the century, the biennial became something of a biennial, or, well, a museum would be one of the first to say. In fact, the word biennial is now almost exclusively used as a synonym for museum. The museum-level is</text>

Biennials are places where art from many places at once comes to life and is immersed in cultural meaning. They are places where the art of a place can be understood in a way that is as likely to be understood by visitors to other places as possible. The problem with the biennial is not necessarily a lack of content or resources – as biennials everywhere try to be – but a fundamental inability to engage with and perhaps to change the world in which they are embedded. The theme of the twentieth Venice Biennale, which was first tried and unsuccessfully – although not without reason: the title is a play on words, and part of a multi-tiered jigsaw – is part of the reason why the Biennale became so popular with foreign visitors. It is a place to be found only once, and then only momentarily. The theme of the twentieth Venice Biennale is no longer enough to</text>

    exceeds the capacity of the human curator alone. 	In a Freirean/Keynesian analysis, the excess of capital is seen as a propensity for capital to expand (i.e. a  	use of capital to meet the conditions of its own existence). 	But the character of this propensity is  	different from that of other uses of the word. 	For example, in our industry,  	use value is understood as amounting to the exchange of something in exchange for something else (money, use value, etc). In other words, the very notion of value amounts to exchange between and among things. In modern capitalist economies, the very notion of money is thought of as something separable from use – like in the  	apple or the card -- where use is understood in terms of exchange.

In a Freirean/Keynesian analysis, the excess of capital is seen as a propensity for capital to expand (i.e. a  	use of capital to meet the conditions of its own existence). 	But the character of this propensity is  	different from that of other uses of the word. 	For example, in our industry,  	use value is understood as amounting to the exchange of something in exchange for something else (money, use value, etc). In other words, the very notion of value amounts to exchange between and among things.

But in pre-capitalist contexts, money was generally understood as something that can and must be used in exchange – like in the  	cigarette or the check. 	Moreover, ‘use’ in capitalism – that is, the ability to exchange – is seen as a zero-sum game – i.e. capitalising on any use made by the scarce and precarious – while simultaneously labouring away in factories or in low-paid service work beyond the reach of regulatory scrutiny. Here, too, money is seen as a potential labour-killer. As Samuel Graham Kerr puts it, ‘the logic of capitalism depends on the idea that money is a constant, and that use is a constant, inescapable element of the production process.’ This understanding of the inherent inherent value of money – its immutability and – – – – – is fundamentally at odds with the idea of social use of the word ‘found’ in the phrase ‘capital’. 	In fact, as Thomas Malthus, another early capitalist thinker, put it, ‘money does more than create value: it defines value.’</text>

To understand how pre-capitalist social forms were affected by the growth of the metainterface, we need to know how the metainterface is experienced. A quick look at a trader’s catalogue will reveal many an item for sale, but what is often regarded as a collector’s item is a treasure trove of knowledge about how to live life according to the metainterface. 	One of the first things a buyer/consumer/resident learns about a place is how to behave in a certain way in certain ways. 	For example, buyers learn about the town by visiting the shops, encountering the locals and learning the culture. They learn about the architecture and learn about the history of the place through the architecture books and stories. They also learn about the town’s economy by visiting the newsstands and learning about the ‘little iron' that the local bricklayer makes by the kilo.’ 	In these ways, the met</text>

Similarly, the character of the excess of capital is thought of as its propensity for capital to expand (i.e. the excess of what can be produced per unit of capital). But this character is understood in terms of a division of labour between those with a stake in the continued viability of the system (moneychangers) and those with little or no stake (labourers and artists), and so forth. 	It could be said that the 	use value of a building was understood in terms of a ‘race to the bank’: the more valuable the building was, the more valuable its use was going to be. And since the moneychangers had a stake in the outcome of the system (and, hence, the allocation of resources) – and since the allocation of time and energy was going to be determined by the system (and, hence, the allocation of activities) – the historian is left with the puzzling situation of understanding what exactly a stake in the system</text>

When we talk about the excess of capital in our society today, we tend to picture two things: 1) financial excesses via debt and 2) economic excesses via the use of debt – i.e. the concomitant rise in prices. But these two notions of excess and concomitant rise are two sides of the same coin. As Marx showed us, ‘excess is a conjunction of many different kinds of relations: relations of production on a global scale, intra-industry, and intra-nation.’ 	But just as a financial crisis can lead to a breakdown of the social web of international cooperation that we inhabit, a concomitant rise in prices can also break apart our social fabric – leading to social tensions and forging new frontiers of difference. As a consequence, we needn’t be lulled into a false sense of equanimity by financial exchange – which is increasingly being promoted as a solution to a  	money crunch</text>

Modern capitalism produces a situation in which use cannot be understood in any meaningful way – not only in the sense that it is economically unprofitable to produce surplus (since people only use what is useful – commodities), but also that it is increasingly evident that one can and must exploit one’s way of life in order to expand one’s capital. 	Modern capitalism produces a situation in which surplus – that is, the excess of things over which one has absolute control – is understood in terms of exchange. 	Modern capitalism produces a situation in which surplus – that is, the excess of people over things – is understood in terms of exchange. But as Isaac Deutscher reminds us, ‘excess equals negation; it’s only when the value is abstracted that we can speak of excess.’1 This means that since the very notion of excess – the idea of a thing over which one has absolute control – is itself a concept that is made</text>

Similarly, the character of the excess of capital is seen in relation to the social totality: in other words, the very notion of humanity in relation to abstract space and value is understood in relation to abstract labour – like in the slave trade. But the degree to which and the class of the labourer are seen as consumers of space is also a point of departure from contemporary capitalist conceptions of humanity that would render the labourer invisible. 	In considering the excess of capital in relation to the social totality, we must also consider what we might call ‘species capitalism’, which is the economy of animals over and above humans. Pre-capitalist ecological systems that place a premium on the wellbeing of large numbers of species over and above humans in a given area (e.g. the Amazon and the Ganges Delta) are species capitals. Post-capitalist ecologies that render labour abstract and animals live-agents – i.e. capacities – are in part driven by biopiracies,</text>

The development of science and technology––which I gather under the heading ‘postindustrial society’––means that the exchange of one thing for another is understood not as an exchange of commodities but as an exchange between two things: the very notion of value itself is under attack. 	Postindustrial society thus not only entails new kinds of work but also new kinds of temporality, new kinds of location, new kinds of domination. It is, in other words, an order of the very complex over the  	mere exchange of commodities. 	In modern times, the fetishisation of raw materials has given way to the fetishisation of forms of use‐mediated transformation: of how things are made (including machinery), of what can be made (including by‐products from factories), and of what can be destroyed (including through war).

The development of science and technology allowed for the systematic appropriation of commons – that is, the sharing of things without necessarily giving them to others – making possible what Marx called ‘commodity fetishism’.[7] 	And what did this have to do with ecology? Well, things that are shared between people are likely to end up in the same places – whether that’s because they are common resources shared between people, or because things that can be done with them are common to all of us. And so the end result is that as technologies developed, they tended to take forms that were complementary to the role of the artist in the ecosystem: they became resources that could be used by many people in ways that were not always obvious to those at the top. For example, the wheel becomes less necessary as roads are built and cities evolve, because it’s no longer necessary to move the wheel along a particular path to get from A to B.

The emergence and/or evolution of financial and lending institutions is understood in this way. Modern financial and lending institutions emerge not out of necessity but out of the dynamic contradiction between the overproduction of wealth and the inefficiency of the capitalist circulation of value – in other words, between surplus and deficiency. And their emergence is understood this way: precarity (the over-production of wealth) induces a need for capital (money) – i.e. a need for credit – which in turn generates a surplus to cover the cost of the operations of the financial system (i.e. operations – i.e. building new sub-prime mortgages, toxic mortgage backed securities, sub-prime auto loans,</text>

As one of my students recently put it: ‘It was surreal: We were at a festival in Lisbon, Portugal, and the next day the museum where we were staying was vandalised.’ The truth is that many of those who commit such acts are also urban poor; deprived, that is, of art, culture or of having their art exhibited. It is this juxtaposition of the everyday life of artists and the art that is presented in museums and zoos that creates the biennial condition; it is this juxtaposition of art and life that makes it possible for artists to exist in such large numbers in cities, yet facing away from the art’s emphases and interests. It is this kind of juxtaposition that creates the biennial through what Georges Canguilhem aptly describes as ‘a metamorphosis’.[30] The biennial as an exhibitionary form has become so embedded in the contemporary condition that it is hardly noticed anymore; in most cities, especially those</text>

As one of the few remaining museums actively involved in research and education on its local and international levels, the Biennale was thus able to engage with and even to profit from the local, national and even globalised contexts in which it was exhibited. This kind of globalisable and context-specificity was essential for the Biennale to achieve its current trajectory, but it was especially so in the past couple of years, when the Biennale’s curatorial remit and focus shifted to the international, and its exhibitions now face new and different kinds of scrutiny and engagement. This kind of ‘globalisation’ itself is a concept that was enormously important for the biennial to develop and to continue to call itself. It was important for the Biennale to be able to define and articulate its own trajectory, and for the art to be transported to places where it could be seen by a broad range of people, in a variety of settings, across different time zones.

As one of the founders of the Biennale put it: ‘Our work is a miracle.’[3]The Biennale has a habit of instigating change, whether that’s its curatorial focus on the past, present and future, or the proliferation of its curatorial staff in an ever-expanding itinerary of places and times. For Venice, this has often meant creating and managing a parallel universe in which the biennale would not necessarily fit. In an effort to make the biennale more of a ‘placeholder’ for the future development of the city, the Biennale has adopted a number of new ways of organising itself and its activities. These include: the ‘Archive and Feast’ social event that incorporates the local cultural and urban planning commission, the ‘Unite Cultural and Social Partnership Council’ (2006), the ‘Venice Biennale Social Contract Committee’ (2007), the ‘Arch</text>

As one of its founders once said, ‘We did it because it was us, and we'll do it because it's “us””’. But sometimes that extra vehemence can be found in the form of extra mortality.This kind of extraordinary longevity is characteristic of some kinds of ecological systems, and it is particularly apparent in the range and structure of life on Earth. The fossil record is strewn with ecological archetypes that are as ancient as the planet itself, and reveal new kinds of life forms appearing suddenly and unpredictably at random. Fossils show that life forms with names beginning with the letters ‘F’ are common; fossils also show that life’s processes can produce many kinds of materials, including those that are malleable and bendable. These materials, called biomaterials, are intrinsically valuable, not just for their properties as building materials and biological building blocks, but also for their extraordinary properties: they can assume a wide range of physical</text>

(2014) put it: ‘The Biennial is a complex system with many nodes and branches, each with their own personality and set of needs, desires and talents. It is a collection of needs, desires, talents – a kind of folk art gallery.’[28] And yet it is also possible that a biennial could be a collection of needs, desires, talents, as in the case of a community art movement. The biennial is a living organism, constantly evolving, capable of adapting and inventing new ways to meet its audiences. It has its roots in the need to know – to know what is expected of it, what it is allowed to be – and it builds on those needs and talents as it perceives the world as a global art market. It does not yet have a systematic or systematic agenda, but it does have an intrinsic motivation and set of tools with which to tackle contemporary art market challenges. These</text>

As one of the curators of the Venice Biennale, I had the opportunity to take part in a remarkable experiment: to put it mildly, it was a bit disconcerting at times to be part of the artworld's art’s self-appointed art ‘culturist’ bandwagon, constantly comparing ourselves to other museums, zoos and institutions, yet also to be under constant assault by art’s audience, who were constantly demanding more, more and more, and yet were never able to deliver. The biennale needed a curator who was not beholden to the art world’s expectations, and who could in fact innovate and make it his or her own. I was not offered the post, and neither was I willing to give up control. So I embarked on what became a ten-year, multi-platform experiment, inviting artists from around the world to collaborate in various ways with a real artistic agenda. In doing so, I sought to create a bi</text>

As one of the few remaining museum-type institutions, the biennial has for decades been able to exist on a par with most other museum types. But in the 21st century, this level of institutionalisation is no longer sufficient to sustain a biennial; contemporary biennials must also have a social purpose and take cultural forms that are responsive to the urban, plural and multiethnic registers of global cities. The biennial as a cultural form is experiencing a radical shift, and it is increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes a biennial. The biennial as a curatorial tool is no longer sufficient to sustain it. The institution of the biennial must actively participate in creating a social context conducive to its survival, and also in creating cultural forms that are culturally responsive to the new urbanisation that is sweeping Europe and North America, and which is threatening to undermine the institutions of the city as a whole. The influence of biennials on the social and cultural landscape of their respective cities is currently in its infancy</text>

As one of the many curators at the 2014 Venice Biennale, I felt that I also witnessed this kind of transformative dynamic unfold. I witnessed the real life of these curators – the mundane, drawn-out, often arduous work of curating – which then transformed into the imagined art of art, art in which everything was staged and everything valued. I saw how an exhibition of contemporary art was transformed by the introduction of a particular curatorial approach; an approach that sought to engage with the historical context of the art, through an in-gallery presentation, and to some extent through the use of textual and multimedia means. These curatorial approaches, however, could not penetrate the cultural vacuum created by the biennale, nor was their immersivity limited to a specific site or a particular location.

Biennials have an extraordinary ability to create a parallel universe in which they can operate, to draw audiences of millions of people who then inhabit it, to adopt practices and beliefs entirely unrelated to those of the local museums and zoos, to use cultural capital and to employ it constructively and destructively. They are able to do all of this because they operate at a scale beyond most people’s comprehension. As one of my visitors once told me, commenting on the fact that a biennial is able to do so much more than any regular museum or zoos could: to visitors, at least, it seems as if there are no limitations. The animal in the enclosure is able to accomplish far more than it could if it were confined to the museum. So large is the translocation of meaning and experience within this kind of enclosure, in fact, that it is nearly impossible to comprehend the zoo or museum in the same way. Or to put it another way, in the world of Zomia, meaning is made manifest through the act of movement.In the world of Zomia, meaning is made manifest through the intentional making of space. The zoo or museum is a making, and space is a creation. But what is the meaning of space in Zomia? What is its relation to the world as a whole? In other words, what kind of meaning is there in the word ‘zoo</text>
    <text>biennial as a self-learning system, begun in 2014, is now the largest such institution in the world. In this sense, it is both a continuation of the biennial as an institution and a mutation of its practices. It is the ultimate in the animal: it has reproduced, multiplied and continuously innovated, ever seeking to discover new ways to engage with its subjects and perhaps to employ them in new ways.

They are able to do all of this because they operate at a scale beyond most people’s comprehension. As one of my colleagues put it: ‘We are the zooans. We are the zoos. We are the circus. We are the real life.’[8]This is the zooan condition. People talk about the zooan condition, but few really know what it entails. For many people, their understanding of the zooan arises from media such as cartoons and films featuring animals in exotic or at least imaginative situations. For example, the animal images on TV screens in large urban areas around the world are generated by professional animal photographers who use sophisticated image-processing to capture animals in exotic environments. These animals are then displayed at zoos or circuses, where visitors – particularly children – wander aimlessly through a world of exotic animals, often oblivious to the real-life significance of their travels. As a result, the significance of such images diminishes.  The contemporary zoos have become insular, apolitical, and generally uninteresting. Even the exotic ones draw crowds of devoted visitors</text>

It was as if the biennial had a consciousness of its own, a narrative arc that it could draw upon through its selected subject matter. I thought this was an extraordinary innovation of the biennial, a rare quality that few artists possess. It shows an art institution that is responsive to the needs of an increasingly diverse public, but also an art institution that is attempting to work through its own temporality, particularly in the age of globalisation. The biennial is an episodic art form that tends to present its subject matter in terms of a set of recurring episodes that happen to be ongoing. For example, biennials often cite the episode in the life of a particular artist, an event such as the birth of a child, the death of a parent, or the emergence of a new disease as the foundational event that gives the biennial its shape. This is not to say that biennials have no episodic character or that they can't be more political, or that they don’t experience the world through these political frames. Rather, the episodic character of the biennial today is indicative of the change that is taking place in the</text>

It was as if the biennial had a consciousness of its own, a narrative arc that it could draw upon through its selected subject matter. I thought this was a dangerous conflation of the biennial with the host, and of curatorial intent with ancillary curatorial gestures. The danger is that the biennial becomes a glorified exhibitionary platform, presenting the most vital of observations and reflections of the host institution. That would undercut the biennial’s primary function, which is to house and marshal those observations and reflections into a sustained and powerful narrative that emerges from the host. That would be the only sustainable long-term solution, except that’s how the biennial is generally conceived and interpreted. That was the experience of my curatorial work for the past two years, and perhaps it was also the experience of the people I met during that time: those who have moved away from the biennial and are now involved in other exhibitions or other forms of exhibition making but who remained true to their original exhibitions and collections. I hope they have. Because the biennial can certainly shape and define the exhibitionary space of the host institution</text>

I’ve seen too many biennials this past year to have believed otherwise. It was as if the biennial had a consciousness of its own, a narrative arc that it could draw upon through its selected subject matter. I thought this was a very interesting idea for a number of reasons. The first is that biennials have a particular capacity to present their subjects in a particular way. I often notice an impression in the art world of a generalised over-emphasization of individuals – Leonardo da Vinci being among them – though perhaps this is an exaggeration. Secondly, and relatedly, biennials can also draw upon their subjects, especially when they are represented by artists or famous figures. Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, biennials can incorporate and extrapolate from their local artworlds, given the right mix of curators, artists, writers, curators and other curators, creating a kind of shared common ground. I think of the biennial as an art form that has had to adapt to the new curatorial apparatus, whether that means adopting a scripted chronological order, or inventing its own curatorial regime. It’s as if art is being made in this new ‘curatorial</text>

It was as if the biennial had a consciousness of its own, a narrative arc that it could draw upon through its selected subject matter. I thought this was a strange and beautiful idea, and that it compromised the biennial in many ways. It’s no exaggeration to say that the biennial format intermingled with the city in many ways, influencing its form and character. It’s no exaggeration to say that the biennial format intermingled with the self in many ways, influencing its own narrative arc. But I think I saw in the biennial some of the same tendencies that I see in cities: the displacement of people, the merging of different social systems, the emergence of parallel universes, the emergence of new media, the emergence of an imaginary common ground between cultures, and so forth. Institutions may be compelled to act in certain ways, but they also have to be creative and imaginative as well as functional and mechanical. The biennial needs to have some consciousness of the city in its formation, and indeed to be able to articulate a narrative arc with some degree of vehemence. Otherwise, it’s merely</text>

It was as if the biennial had a consciousness of its own, a narrative arc that it could draw upon through its selected subject matter. I thought this was an incredible idea for a number of reasons, the most obvious of which is the vast quantity of photographic evidence that’s produced in a given year of art’s lifespan. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, this narrative arc can be assembled from vast amounts of photographic and video evidence. Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, this is possible because biennials tend to be fulsome consumers of one another’s art. Fourthly, and most significantly, it is the consummation of this fulsome consumption that results in a work of art being assembled from disparate elements and approaches. Then there’s the question of authenticity, or rather, the question of ascertainability. In the 20th century, if you wanted real art, you had to have a commercial art museum either established or chartering galleries to show it, and have a board that was as broad as possible, including representatives from the curatorial corps. Nowadays, we can all be board members</text>

Unfortunately, in the age of the biennial, the biennial is often overshadowed by its host, and sometimes its host is even overshadowed by the biennial itself. That's why it's so important for a biennial to have an identity, or at least a trajectory, that is as much a story as a collection of curatorial gestures. If that trajectory is a memoir, it’s a story about the past as it is of the future.

I thought this was a wonderful thing to happen in an art institution: to have a narrative arc that you could point to as a model for how art institutions might operate in the future. But perhaps it also manifests itself in the art world in the way that biennials are equipped to present the most pressing problems facing contemporary art today: the economic, environmental and racial disparities that we face. That was the conversation that I wanted to have with you, but I guess I had to delay it because I’m afraid of what you’d say. Sorry about that. But I think that what I wanted to do is present the real, the underlying issues, because otherwise we’d all be facing quite different questions. How do we think about the social, cultural, economic and political dimensions of our own situation? How do we begin to imagine a future for artists, writers and all those whose work we might one day treasure? How do we begin to imagine a future for communities in which they might now</text>

I thought this was the missing link in the art museum hierarchy.When I saw the finished product of your proposal, I imagined a museum that could host a biennial, in that it could simultaneously host a collection of objects from different museums and also exhibit a narrative arc from different museums related in a shared context. I imagined a museum that reflected the past and the future, taking into account both contemporary and historic contexts. For the museum of contemporary art, this meant a space for curating an exhibition of objects from different museums from different eras. For the museum of historic art, it meant a space for curating an exhibition of objects from different museums from different eras, taking into account both contemporary and historic contexts. For the museum of modern art, it meant a museum that curates an exhibition of objects from different museums from different eras, taking into account both contemporary and historic contexts.3.

It was as if the biennial had a consciousness of its own, a narrative arc that it could draw upon through its selected subject matter. I thought this was an extraordinary approach to art history that was both possible and desirable, although I also thought it odd that the biennial would present its own story at a time of great need and controversy. There was a moment during the conference when I wondered if the biennial would become a museum, or if it would instead become an exhibitionary form, complete with its own collections and its own website. In any event, the way I see it now is that it will always be a museum – an important but marginal place in the history of art and culture. It will always be a biennial. And I imagine that for many of its visitors, the museum may be their first experience of art, or at least a partial experience. I’m not so sure about visitors from the West, who have tended to turn up at the museum with preconceived notions. (Incidentally, I think it’s interesting that the West, despite all the turmoil and conflict it experienced during the 1990s and 2000</text>

I thought this was a real provocation, a way to look at the biennial from a different perspective. I think it also demonstrates a problem with the present and how we inhabit it. Because the biennial has experienced a globalization, and has to contend with the fact that it is a multi-billion-dollar enterprise, it finds itself caught up in changes in global markets and geopolitics that affect all those in its vicinity. This presents its curatorial and art departments with an unprecedented set of challenges. The art department is often accused of being complacent and 'dodgy'. I’d disagree. I think that the art department is always at work in self-deception. But the rise of biennials and the museums they support creates a situation where art’s place of greatest value is now disputed, and in some cases quite literally taken from it. I’m thinking of the recent &quot;Manchester by the Sea’ project that sought to bring sea animals from different ports in London</text>

In programming, programming is the art of the unexpected, where unexpected results can be had. In the computer, programming is the capacity to decipher data; the ability to decipher data is what makes computers useful. While in its basic form the programming languages we use can crunch numbers and do amazing things with data, there is another kind of programming that is more subtle and poetic: programming is also about making things happen, and the ability to plan out future possibilities and envision precise outcomes is what programming is all about. Thinking about programming actually helps us to see deeper into the world of programming, and how it is all achieved. Consider the following hypothetical situation: suppose that I were to give you a programming challenge. What would you do with such a challenge? Would you try to foresee the future using machine learning? Or perhaps programming would be simpler: the ability to programmatically create things out of thin air? It doesn’t matter which kind of programming language you’d use, the point is that you’d have to be able to think of possibilities beyond</text>

In programming, programming is the art of the unexpected, where unexpected results can be had. A programming challenge in R introduced a set of actions that could be taken if a condition were met (e.g., when a certain number of characters were typed in a given address). These actions included entering text, creating a new webpage or image, and more. The challenge was widely seen as a ‘cheat sheet’ for creative behaviour.The challenge itself remains somewhat of a mystery. There are several theories about what exactly programming is, and how it differs from other kinds of programming, but the general idea is that programming is the art of the impossible. Machine learning, or the science of programming, is the ability to take arbitrary parameters and output data that is not pre-determined, and to interpret data in a given way. Machine learning is specifically designed to work with data, and thus programming languages that allow this type of programming exist, and to be written in. There is a divide between the folks who get their programming skills</text>

In programming, programming is the art of the unexpected, where unexpected results can be had. The challenge then becomes how to harness this inherent creativity to produce useful, but unexpected outcomes. There are of course many other ways of approaching the world, including for naught the task of writing software in the first place.So how might the creative process be initiated with programming? One approach is to ask, what is the nature of the problem that we wish to solve? In other words, can we program the system to achieve a desired result? One approach to this could be applied to the nature of life itself: what other worlds could be created through programming? Another approach is to ask, what is the nature of creativity? It is often said that programming is inherently creative, but is this really the case? It is generally believed that computers can do amazing things with seemingly innocent programming, but is there really any truth to this? It is widely believed that programming is inherently creative, but is there really any truth to this?One could argue that there is no truth to this</text>

In programming, programming is the art of the unexpected, where unexpected results can be had. And this observation by Dyson is a powerful one. Imagine a communal kitchen with communal utensils: what would be possible with such tools?  In the 1950s and 60s, people experimented with such things, and the result was Pellegrino’s chimera of the kitchen (a proto-computer). But this experimentation revealed many more ways of programming the computer to do things, and also the need for more sophisticated programming tools. The end result was that the computer became more complex, and required more interaction with the outside world. A community of users saw results similar to those found in computers: greater productivity, improved consumption, increased consumption, and so forth.More recently, in 2015, we launched the Clojure Community Edition of the Linux Kernel, which brings enhanced programming and data manipulation capabilities to the Linux kernel.

In programming, programming is the art of the unexpected, where unexpected results can be had. The Challenge programme introduced in 1991  reveals a side of programming that many computer programmers would not dare to explore.  A challenge is a request that a computer answer in a specific way, usually posed by an author or organisation. It is an invitation to explore a hidden parameter or feature of the system, or to perform an action that has not been programmed yet.  An R programming challenge can also be written in human language and read by humans as text.  One can ask the R programming challenge to do one of several things: create a new task, perform an action (usually editing existing workflows), or interpret data (usually data from a video or audio recording). The challenge itself is not a programming tool, but it can be used that way.For more information about programming languages and programming, see  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming Languages.

Their project Shell Concrete was a return to the primacy of art as representation in Canadian cultural institutions, but the main thrust of the project was political, taking aim at the fact that this was largely a white-dominated sector. The artists were not alone, artists from across the country gravitated to the opportunity to experiment with new programming languages and creative reconfiguration of infrastructure. The fact that programming was considered a legitimate art form also made it a prime candidate for political and cultural reclamation.

The Challenge was followed by two books: R Programming Languages and R Programming Languages, edited by Ray Kurzweil and Peter Norvig, (Springer, London, 1992), and Artificial Intelligence: The Program Machine (Springer, London and New York, 1996), both published in 2002.

In programming, programming is the art of the unexpected, where unexpected results can be had. The Challenge 2000 challenge, which introduced computer programming to the UK, and many other UK related programming challenges, is an example of this kind of programming. The underlying premise of the programming challenge was that the UK’s national computer should be able to handle all the information generated during the match, so that all citizens of the UK should be able to participate in the enjoyment of the game.   In other words, the overarching objective of the challenge was to see how many football matches the computer should be able to handle. Unfortunately, the underlying premise of the challenge was also under-exploited: the benefit of human programming was generally not realized due to the emphasis on practical programming skills, or the focus on technical requirements. The key to the success of programming is usually found somewhere between the programmer and the performer, or between the programmer and the computer (depending on the platform and language). In programming, the roles are usually reversed: the programmer is the one</text>

In programming, programming is the art of the unexpected, where unexpected results can be had. And herein lies the rub: while it is theoretically possible to program a car to do certain things, such as turning left, this is not a practical way to engineer a car that is able to turn left (yet legal in some jurisdictions). The legal status of such operations is left to experts, and while they are theoretically possible, the courts have generally declined to extend such powers to non-programmers. So while the R programming challenge hinted at a latent capability for machine learning to be used for good, the real power lies in the hands of individuals with programming skills and the ability to think creatively, rather than necessarily in the hands of programmers with the requisite programming knowledge.  R programming challenge text, by the way, is a good place to start questioning this notion.What is programming?
