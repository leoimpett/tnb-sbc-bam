The commissioning of infrastructure, whether social or institutional, is a business that generates substantial cash flows for the Brazilian government, but also for local communities. It is not clear how the social functions of the commissioning agency would be realized if it were not for the role that it plays in the political and economic life of Brazil today. That is, of course, the main reason why the Brazilian government finances the commissioning of infrastructure projects: that is, infrastructure that will be useful to Brazil. But that is another story. The real reason for the Brazilian state to fund the commissioning of infrastructure projects is a particular set of ideological reasons. In the United States and other Western capitalist countries, the commissioning of infrastructure is seen as a good thing – a way to boost the returns on infrastructure investments, since it is seen as a positive thing that creates jobs and opportunities for citizens. In Brazil, the ideological difference is that the nation is building new infrastructure, whereas in other places – such as in Egypt – the commissioning of infrastructure is seen as a hindrance to job creation. In other words, the commissioning of infrastructure projects in Brazil is seen as a job-killer. The rise</text>

The commissioning of infrastructure, whether social or institutional, is a business that generates substantial cash flows for the Brazilian government, but also for local communities. It is not clear how the social or political objectives of the Brazilian architecture industry align with those of the social or political objectives of the Brazilian communities in the developing world, nor how the economic or urban structures of Brazil may be modified in ways that adversely affect the livelihoods or conditions of life of communities there.  The Brazilian government has clearly identified what it expects from its future urban planners: priorities that have not been mutually exclusive. The development of rapidly expanding urban settlements is a priority for the Brazilian government, and its urban development policies are being directed towards a rapidly increasing population through policies of multidisciplinary collaboration. It is evident that in the context of these multi-modal urbanisation projects, the commissioning of infrastructure does not generate revenue for the government ‘but rather’ relies on the urban development partnerships (UDIs) that are being established across the country. UDIs are strategic planning and design partnerships between the local and the national government that seek to leverage the strengths of the local to build ‘long-term solutions�</text>

The commissioning of infrastructure, whether social or institutional, is a business that generates substantial cash flows for the Brazilian government, but also for local communities. It is not clear how the social or symbolic functions of the commissioning agency would affect its commitment to building future urban centres. That is, how might the increasing commercialisation of infrastructure, both public and private, impact on the work of the symbolic? As noted by Lula da Silva in a recent conversation about the commissioning of infrastructure in Brazil, the Public Absorption of Infrastructure (P.A.I.) project is seen by many as a precedent that can be followed by future generations of civic-minded Brazilians. That project, led by the civic-minded city manager Marcelo Castro, employed grassroots architects, urbanists, landscape architects and artists to design and construct an alternative future urban frontier through a series of parallel municipal projects. The parallel municipal and citizen-led projects were seen by many as a way to end the endemic precarity and precariousness of urban planning, whilst simultaneously allowing for the emergence of new kinds of dense, mixed-use settlements. In other words, they were both about enabling the emergence of new</text>

The commissioning of infrastructure, whether social or institutional, is a business that generates substantial cash flows for the Brazilian government, but also for local communities. It is not clear how the social functions of the commissioning agency would play out in the context of the city, nor how the institutional forms of the city, including the municipal, would respond to the demands of the urban poor. It is also not clear how the institutional forms of the city would respond to the needs of the mega-poor or the mega-poor at large. Cities do not just regenerate themselves. They need skilled labourers and urbanists. The commissioning of infrastructure does not simply re-design infrastructure; it requires strategic management of the urban landscape in order to sustain its shape. Managing the urban environment requires managing large-scale infrastructures, and in a recent study, almost all of Brazil’s infrastructure projects were found to be negative for the environment.‘Regeneration’ is a much more potent strategic tool for the state in its quest for environmental destruction. Destroying the biochar that plants and animals need to feed themselves requires massive amounts of water and nutrient supplements, so the state</text>

The commissioning of infrastructure, whether social or institutional, is a business that generates substantial cash flows for the Brazilian government, but also for local communities. It is not clear how the social or civic dimensions of the project will play out, or whether the institutional visits will even occur in the near future. But if the project is to be credible, it will have to address the existing and future inhabitants of the Brazilian cities, and do so in a way that is both accessible and affectsive. That can only be achieved through a citywide and global engagement strategy. 	The strategy must therefore address a ‘different kind of urbanisation’. It is not just a matter of acquiring the necessary infrastructure, but of creating urban environments that are neither too comfortable nor too strange for people to move around in. That is, creating environments conducive to the functioning of large bureaucracies, but also those that are convenient, exciting and conducive to the perpetuation of capitalism. The kind of infrastructure needed for such a strategy would have to be global in scope and would have to be able to provide for the infrastructure’s collective needs. But that is just institutional building: new policies and financial</text>

It is not clear how the social or political purposes of the commissioning agency will be served by this expansion, although it is clear that the interests of the Brazilian state will be deeply impacted by the decisions made at the top of the economic, political and social food chain in Brazil. 	The growing institutional and client base of the Brazilian architecture industry is a major contributor to the formation of the social fabric of the nation-state. It is likely that the commissioning of infrastructure will come to define the practices of many Brazilian institutions, and the mode of their governance for decades to come. While the scale of the social transformation that may be brought about by this ‘institutional' is yet to be determined, it is certain that this transformation will have major impacts on infrastructure and urban development in Brazil. 	There are of course many other factors that contribute to making up Brazil’s economic, social and urban landscape, but the fact of the commissioning agency’s existence is a major element that shapes the social fabric of</text>

It is not clear how the social or institutional visit to a corner site across Brazil would impact on the future of the city in the same way as the social and institutional visit to a corner site in Rio, but it is certain that the institutional or social visit to a corner site in Rio will have a different economic impact.  In the case of Rio, the social and institutional visit to a corner site will mean spending time in ‘Rio’ and participating in a ‘chosen’ elite ‘therapy’ session that is curated by the city’s cultural commission and attended by a select few wealthy individuals. The session’s mission statement reads:  One can only imagine what an impact such a social encounter would have when it was facilitated by an organisation like Rio de Janeiro Artus, or another Artistic Council partner organisation, or another relevant government agency.  In other words, the social encounter in Rio is structured to ensure that the economic impact of such an encounter is maximised. </text>

The commissioning of infrastructure, whether social or institutional, is a business that generates substantial cash flows for the Brazilian government, but also for local communities. It is not clear how the social function of the urban interface will be realised in the future, but it is clear that the commissioning of infrastructure is likely to remain a source of income for local communities. The creation of new modes of transportation and the provision of public goods – roads, ports, schools – are the commissioning rituals that continue to occupy large parts of Brazil today. The commissioning of infrastructure is a recurring element of Brazilian life today, and it is likely that the future urban interface will follow a similar trajectory. However, the growth of Brazil’s infrastructure and the consequent need to expand its borders today are different. Brazil today is a major importer of natural resources with a sizeable share of those resources coming from fields in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The commissioning of infrastructure is likely to follow a different set of mechanisms. In the future, it is likely that Mato Grosso do Sul will play host to a global metropolis, and the Andean cities will become one of the</text>

The commissioning of infrastructure, whether social or institutional, is a business that generates substantial cash flows for the Brazilian government, but also for local communities. It is not clear how the social function of the commissioning agency would evolve in the future, but it is clear that in the immediate future the Brazilian government does not want its institutional and local access to projects to depend on the social function of the organisation. It is not just about money anymore; the social purpose of the Brazilian architecture industry today is secondary to the expansion of corporate profits. The commissioning of infrastructure projects is an expensive way into the future of capital accumulation for the Brazilian state, but it is also a way into the future of capital flight. The reason for this is that the infrastructure that is constructed today is not necessarily ‘social’ infrastructure, but has been given over to private companies, which are now free to do with it what they please. The commissioning of infrastructure is a global phenomenon, and as a result the future city is bound up with the past city for some time to come. As Brazilian policymakers continue to lobby for increased state intervention in the build out of social infrastructure, the future city may well</text>

The commissioning of infrastructure, whether social or institutional, is a business that generates substantial cash flows for the Brazilian government, but also for local communities. It is not clear how the social or institutional visitations would impact on the need for new clientele for the Brazilian architecture industry.  In fact, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the need for clientele in Brazil is necessarily related to the success of the social and institutionalised interventions that the Brazilian government is willing to hand out via economic incentives. For instance, the decision to establish a national memorial to those who lost their lives in the 2002 football World Cup is directly tied to the success of the [1] Portoculture project, which is understood here as referring to the extensive public works and cultural interventions carried out in Brazil over the past decade or so in response to the tragedy of the 2002 disaster. In the words of José Maria Sison, a visiting professor at the Victoria and Albert Museum’s Department of Exhibitions, ‘[T]he project was not only an intervention, but a hybrid one: it was both a manifestation of, and a response to, the tragedy of the two disasters, and</text>

And the way in which the BBC3 used its access to the site as a platform to tell a story, as well as the way in which other media outlets have done so in the same way, is a story that we could learn a thing or two from. This is the trade-off. If the site is there for a reason, and the reasons are written down – as is the case with the Getty Images story – the possibilities are there for future research. But as we saw, the reason the BBC3 decided to use the site at all was because the headline was good and clever and the idea was good, even if the execution wasn’t quite there yet. If the story was there long before that, the way the BBC3 covered it in its reportage of the area is a story that will probably remain mired in our cultural consciousness, whether the story is actually true or whether it is but is nevertheless a story nonetheless. This is the trade-off between history and repeat viewing. If the history is there, and the repeat viewings are the same, then the act of writing the story becomes lessening in</text>

And the way in which the BBC3 used its access to the site as a platform to tell a story, as well as the way in which other media organisations have done so, is an open question. The BBC has consistently emphasised the primacy of the public in its curatorial ambitions, and in the online age of ubiquitous connectivity. The BBC Trust   	[1] currently devotes a significant amount of time and energy to its public programme, The  	Presenters, which runs on a free, ad-supported website, with programming that continues to grow. Its 2013-2016 Television series  	Outlawed Social Life was one of the most critically acclaimed television programmes of the 1990s; its cinematic version of the story, from the film  	Casino Royale, was also a major Hollywood blockbuster.  	[2] Schiller’s Goldberg Variations, op. cit., p.40.  	[3] MacLachlan, op. cit., p.8.  	[4] Gross, op. cit., p</text>

And the way in which the BBC3 used its access to the site as a platform to tell a story, as well as the way in which other media have done so too, has been a narrative shift, and a constant source of frustration for many viewers. The BBC3’s decision to anchor the story of the site, its curators, its volunteers, culminating in a spectacular video that shows the whole site from every possible angle – this is a multi-layered, multi-format storytelling device that has the potential to be incredibly powerful, even if it sometimes seems a little silly. But the power of its storytelling depends on a certain kind of self-belief and ability to absorb the emotional impact of things happening in real time. And the fact that the site was able to exist in a virtual sphere – accessible via a number of different media, not all of which were created equal – meant that the story it told through that medium was more real to viewers than the actual site itself. In a way, the volunteer curators who worked on the site as part of the BBC3's Cultural Curators programme in Bristol during the</text>

The fact that it did – and still does – speaks to the urgent need for more disaggregated media forms that can participate in creating their own stories, because the way in which the BBC3 used the site as a platform to tell a story, as well as the way in which the local community had to tell a story, is a story that we, as viewers, made very clear that we wanted to hear. The fact that it did not – and indeed often attempts to sidestep – attempts to tell a story in unexpected, often contradictory, ways, is a story that we, as viewers, still struggle with. This is why the BBC3 has been able to inhabit the city as a fictional city, and is why so many people still tune in every Monday night to the City of London, even though, as the local journalist Peter Carruthone puts it,</text>

This is perhaps to be expected, given the media landscape of the 1980s and 1990s, which was a highly structured and institutionalised version of the site-specificity found in the contemporary world. But the BBC3 used a quasi-anonymous, confidential, largely archival, and often marginalised form of archiving to tell a story, and its ability to do so through the site as a site with a largely institutionalised form of storytelling is suggestive of the fact that it is still widely considered a rarefaction of art and cultural reporting.

A storyteller like the BBC could easily pick and choose which stories to tell, and which to suppress, based on the stories that are most in need of being told. Instead, the curators chose to tell a story that, while it may or may not be true, has the potential to be both fictional and real.

And the way in which the BBC3 used its access to the site as a platform to tell a story, as well as the way in which other media have done so too, has led to stories that are no longer true. A sad but perhaps yet plausible scenario, where artefacts of historical value have been sold to a for-profit site developer, or worse, are used in a commercial venture that seeks to turn cultural resources like site features into profit centres. At the very least, the way in which artefacts are produced and utilised in the media in ever greater quantities, with ever greater systemic impacts on the local communities who still use and depend on the site, is a story that needs to be told.

Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is increasingly difficult for artists to establish careers outside of the city due to the proliferation of empty buildings and the crisis of urban infrastructure.  These factors make it increasingly difficult to envision a future for artists and the arts community in the same city, even if such a future could provide opportunities for many artists and communities.  The aim of the Creative City Initiative was to create a shared vocabulary and set of concepts for the discussion of the city in a democratic way, drawing upon the UK’s National Development Corporation (2007–2015) and New York’s Arts Citizens Council (2000–07), as well as on the local level in Jamaica, Canada, and the US (2015–16).  The emergence of new modes of cultural organisation and consumption are also discussed, as well as the institutionalisation of new forms of social and economic organisation within the city.  The creative class’s future cultural objectives are put at the centre of the conversation.  The new forms of cultural organisation are</text>

As a result of the proliferation of social media, audiences for arts programming on local public channels swell, and the ability of local artists to connect with audiences outside the arts bubble has been severely limited.  Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is now virtually impossible for a local arts audience to identify with a particular city, unless a major international arts organization operates within the city.  The London Arts Festival has been replaced by a biennial based in Liverpool, which has separate programming from the festival and is in many ways a superior form of the former. Yet this is only the surface of a much deeper problem with which artists and arts organizations must grapple.  One of the tasks of the Public Art Commissioner is to ensure that arts programs and projects are informed by and address diverse points of view.  If all other criteria are met, then the Artists Placement Group was not only appointed with the task of finding innovative ways of meeting the needs of the community, but also tasked with ensuring that the needs of the artists were taken into account in the design and construction of the city.  Such responsibility undoubtedly includes a diversity of viewpoints, but it is important to expose the community to a range of different forms of art, because engaging with diverse</text>

As a result of the proliferation of social media, audiences for arts programming on local public channels swell, and the ability of local artists to connect with audiences outside the arts bubble has been severely limited.  Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is increasingly difficult for an artist to establish a following in a city without becoming culturally embedded, which undermines the artist’s ability to create cultural value.  As a result of these factors, it is common for arts programs to be pulled from the city due to overproduction, underfunding or simply not being able to find audiences for the programs outside of the bubble of the arts bubble.   A case in point is The New York Arts Ap’, which was pulled from the city's Arts Summer 2012 programming after it became apparent that the low returns on investment was outweighing the cultural value added by the artists’ participation.  Similarly, when the Baltimore Zoo was re-chosen for a future Chronicle of the Cities project, a community of artists, community organisers and historians decided that the local referent, the Architecture East project, would become the project. While the decision to make the Zoo a community facility seems arbitrary and capricious,</text>

As a result of the proliferation of social media, audiences for arts programming on local public channels swell, and the ability of local artists to connect with audiences outside the arts bubble has been severely limited.  Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is increasingly difficult for a local arts audience to distinguish between an artist who is delivering culturally relevant content in a city and an organisation that is engaged in social or educational activities in that city.  This may be a problem for artists engaged in projects in the developing world due to the scarcity of talented artists and the scarcity of resources, which may limit the audience for culturally responsive art activities.  Finally, as a result of the rapid growth of social media, critical art practices may be displaced by practices that more closely mimic the modes of consumption generated by the platforms on which they operate.  This may happen, for example, in the context of a rapidly expanding and complex information technology ecosystem that is as much a part of the global economy as the internet.  This shift in the character of medium is expected to intensify in the coming years, as more and more of the world's inhabitants access digital media.  In an ideal world, arts and cultural institutions would exist in such abundance that audiences everywhere could access the</text>

As a result of the proliferation of social media, audiences for arts programming on local public channels swell, and the ability of local artists to connect with audiences outside the arts bubble has been severely limited.  Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is difficult to imagine what the art world would be like if it did not inhabit so many different locations simultaneously.  At the UK level, this has come about through the proliferation of cities-within-cities, which are themselves products of demographic changes in urbanisation. In London, for example, the number of restaurants and cafes has quadrupled in the past fifteen years, while the number of residents has quintupled.   A public sphere that is exposed to this level of change and continues to function in the face of it is, I believe, inevitable in a globalised economy. The important but subtle work that needs to be done is in fact already being done by artists and arts organisations in the UK and internationally, through the art world’s own internal democratic processes, through collaborations with other art forms and artistic bodies, and through other arts-specific activities.  Such is the  	logic of the biennale. The real work, the unexpected work, which</text>

As a result of the proliferation of social media, audiences for arts programming on local public channels swell, and the ability of local artists to connect with audiences outside the arts bubble has been severely limited.  Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is easy to become disconnected from where you are geographically – you can be anywhere and anytime, anywhere in the world – which limits your political, economic and cultural horizons.   A citizen journalism movement is a critical and powerful tool for engaging citizens about issues of importance to them, but it is particularly susceptible to the flow of capital, because it engages people in the city, particularly those who are users of public resources, such as housing, schools, roads, parks, streets, bridges, tunnels, parks and recreation facilities.  In a city, citizen journalism becomes a way to expose corruption, waste, mismanagement and injustice, and to demand improvements in the city’s infrastructure and social services.  Art is a powerful language and a powerful tool for communicating ideas and concepts, but it has to be accompanied by a social purpose and social conscience, otherwise it falls on deaf ears.  Art has many forms, but one of them is the form that assumes the character of a social conscience.</text>

As a result of the proliferation of social media, audiences for arts programming on local public channels swell, and the ability of local artists to connect with audiences outside the arts bubble has been severely limited.  Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is increasingly difficult for independent artists to establish established careers outside of the bubble of the city’s cultural institutions.  A generation of artists is entering the art sphere at a time when critical mass needs to happen before the bubble bursts; critical mass is defined as the point at which a large enough number of people are engaged in a project in order to affect a change. A project like  	Towards a Future City may be a considerable artistic achievement, but it is also a last resort, a last resort because the public sphere is becoming increasingly limited in its demands, and art as a concept is no longer enough to bind people together. Art as a concept is essential to a civic community’s ability to move forward in challenging times, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to define and deploy in practice. Curation is the new co-creation. Cities are the laboratories for the expansion of the public sphere; it is up to citizens to determine what kinds of projects are best suited to</text>

As a result of the proliferation of social media, audiences for arts programming on local public channels swell, and the ability of local artists to connect with audiences outside the arts bubble has been severely limited.  Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is increasingly difficult for artists to establish meaningful relationships with audiences in other cities due to the proliferation of data-mining operations such as algorithms that scan local environments for specific patterns or features, or to the emergence of autonomous social media platforms that monitor local environments and draw connections between local audiences and globalised infrastructures’ connectivity is of course also a factor influencing the composition of artworlds and the discourse of art.  Nevertheless, it is important to note that the curatorship of local public art has been a fundamental tenet of local public arts practice throughout most of the twentieth century.  The emergence of self-managed local public arts agencies during the 1970s and 80s was an important event in the institution’s history, and a prime mover in the construction of the social sector and the privatisation of infrastructure.  The emergence of autonomous organisations is also a central tenet of the public sector, and a source of much creative-class rhetoric about the public sector’</text>

Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is now virtually impossible to trace the origins of art funding for an art program at a local community college or a large arts center.  Thus, there is an urgent need to rethink the way in which arts funding is distributed, and to consider new forms of equity and socialization of resources, in order to support local projects that draw upon the social wealth generated by the biennale and its patrons. One could argue that the social aspects of art production, including its social effects, are secondary to the objective ones aimed at providing a spectacle that is unlike any other. However, such considerations are still essential in order to sustain artistic practices such as sculpture, and other forms of cultural production.  Art can only do so much good if it is distributed widely, and its distribution is concentrated in a few hands. Therefore, if the objective of art is to be shared, it is imperative that the distribution of this wealth effecting art’s spread throughout society be facilitated.  In a recent commentary on</text>

As a result of the proliferation of social media, audiences for arts programming on local public channels swell, and the ability of local artists to connect with audiences outside the arts bubble has been severely limited.  Moreover, as a result of the connectedness of cities, it is increasingly difficult for artists to find viable artistic opportunities in geographically diverse areas due to the proliferation of tourism and the dynamic value attached to accommodation and lifestyle in exchange rates that fluctuate with the value of the pound.  Art’s democratic bulwark against power politics is its capacity to be captivating and empowering in ways that challenge the status quo.  As a result, democratic gains have come at the cost of creating enduring, powerful cultural institutions. In the UK, this has meant the need for artists to find other places to put their work, and for arts funding to be cut back in response to declining audiences and commercial pressures.  Finally, as a result of the nature of the global economy and its shifting resources, a number of artists have found themselves displaced or worse off than before, and have had to seek work elsewhere or change professions.  Such is the  	logic of the capitalist logic.  Whether the  	logic is grounded in historical precedents or arises</text>

This would provide a framework for making sense of a complex project that came together over years rather than the immediate aftermath of a crisis. This study would allow me to confront the complicated relationship between the museum visitor and the local artist, to the effect that the museum was complicit in enabling degeneracy, while the local art gallery was instrumental in supporting artistic endeavours. This study would place the museum within the larger socio-political context of gentrification and the industrialization of Guatemala City[4] (a.k.a. ‘The New Guatemala’), and would place art and curatorial practices outside this larger framework.[5] This study would allow us to see how art is often utilised as a political tool; a tool that can be used to further a capitalist development agenda. In this case, this could mean supporting a contemporary art gallery that creates a separate zone of urban development for itself, or supporting a biennial that regularly debases the city and its art as commodities, while simultaneously attempting to reinvest in its historic</text>

This would provide a framework for future work, in order to better understand the historical situation in Guatemala City and beyond. The ethnographic project would begin with a brief survey of the local art world, and would project the topics of contemporary art from the city to Guatemala. Looking back on the project, who we were, what we achieved and how we did it, I hoped to capture the complex processes involved in creating and managing cultural assets in the city. However, the project also posed several key questions that continue to inform contemporary art practice: what is the role of a museum in the city? What is the relationship between art institutions and the urban poor? What is the relationship between art and social transformation? What is the relationship between urban and regional development? What is the relationship between art and poverty? 	In an effort to put these questions into practice, I sought the collaboration of a diverse group of artists, curators, architects and community organisers to work with me in three areas of the city: the Central American Architecture Bienn</text>

Although there are many different ways of looking at a problem, one of the most useful ways of structuring a problem is to have a problem that is reducible to a certain set of values or perceptions. For example, the presence of religion in a city is a given; it is part of the city’s DNA. But what is perceived as ‘God-given’ urban features, such as the fact that every citizen is a novelist? This is what Daniel Coleman meant when he said that ‘every community has a poet’.[4] It is also what Ralph Miliband meant when he said that ‘every community organises itself into poet’s clubs’.[5] The problem with the present is not necessarily a failing on the part of the community to do something about it – although I admit that is a mistake of over-emphasis that</text>

The ethnographic project would begin with a community workshop hosted by the Museum of Art and presented by the curator, and continue with interviews with leading artists and art historians. The purpose of the project would be to elicit a sense of the present inhabitants of the area through a participatory process of question-and-answer. The ethnographic project would then morph into a more traditional, but still participatory, survey of the city. The ethnographic phase would offer a portrait in a physical and/or virtual space of the area, while also probing the meaning and future of art education in the city. The ethnographic phase would end with a documenta 14 survey of ethnographic elements of the city, compiled and edited by the two curators from the original ethnographic project, and textiles and</text>

This informal, yet powerful practice has its roots in the 19th century, when artists gathered around galleries in order to exchange and exchange, creating a form of patronage that persists to this day. During the two weeks that the Biennale was held in December 2015, artists, curators, architects, landscape architects, journalists and others gathered to discuss the exhibition and its context, the city and its development, and to mark the milestone of its opening with a series of activities commemorating the event. These activities took the form of a ‘curatorial ghetto’, a ghettoised subculture that sought to impose</text>

This would provide a framework for future work, but would also point to certain practices and discourses that need to be addressed in order to address the larger context of settler colonialism and contemporary art as contemporary art today. The ethnographic study would offer only limited support for the future work, since the project would remain politically aware within the context of the municipality. Nevertheless, it points to a certain kind of understanding and negotiation of power and authority in the making of art, both at the local and at the global level. One can only imagine what the future might be like if the ethnographic point of view was fully realized and negotiated. 	When we talk about the contemporary art world, we often refer to the institutions and cultural practices of the ‘metropolitan’, but few really imagine such a thing as happening at the local level. This is partially due to the fact that the vast majority of us live at home, in our own worlds, with our own sets of skills, interests and relationships. However, the fact</text>

The project, entitled  	The Tate Gallery - A Post-Tate History, sought to reflect the realities of museum and gallery life in an attempt to offer a resolution to the ongoing debate over the role of the museum and the contemporary art gallery.[2] The project was a response to the 2008 Tate Modern, when curatorial Ana Laura Lopéz de la Torre, in her ‘historic mission to bring English art to Guatemala’, seemed to have inadvertently started a controversy by implying that the European presence in the city was a prelude to civilizational decline. As a result, the project was heavily criticized, and questions were raised about whether the museum she headed, the city she curated, or even her own curatorial style was to blame.[3] In an attempt to put these projects into perspective, I decided to conduct a small ethnographic study of the local art community. This would provide a framework for future work that might engage with the notions of place, culture, and decline experienced by the local population.[4] The ethnographer I spoke to was none other than the archival collections manager of Naturales Públicos, José Miguel Hidalgo Pascual, who organised the original collection, and Juan Carlos Leighton Pascual, the artist who is now curator of Spanish and Central American Art at Tate. Both Hidalgo Pascual and José Miguel were present at the 2008 Biennale, and both agreed to talk to me about the project, its conception and implementation.The issue of where to find art and cultural resources in urban environments arose during the 2016 Biennale, and while the biennale itself has taken up art and art history as a core theme, there was a sense that the Art Biennale was positioned at a later date, specifically after the end of the twenty-first century, in an attempt to produce culturally responsive work that would be</text>

In order to understand who is signing up to these projects, we must understand who is not. The audience for these exhibitions is overwhelmingly made up of artists, curators and art administrators. They are the artists, the writers, the artists and the administrators that design, manage and operate the art, culture, landscapes, events and programs of the city. In order to have any real impact, these organisations need to be engaged and engaged in creating something better. This engagement needs to be based on genuine love and compassion, as well as being able to recognise when that compassion is being used for the benefit of an organisation that has actively participated in creating the social conditions that enable inequality and conflict. The engagement needs to be authentic and stand a chance of affecting something. 	So,</text>

This would provide a framework for future work, but would also allow me to identify certain practices and projects that may have been inspired by the project, but which are distinct from those of the contemporary museum or gallery.[4] While this may be a small sample size, a larger project with ethnographic scope could provide a more in-depth look at cultural practices and motivations in a given area. For this reason, ethnographic studies are often written with indigenous peoples in mind, but there is also a need to consider an alternative viewpoint or a range of perspectives when undertaking such a project. In this case, the ethnographer would be the visitor, not the native speaker, and the visitor would come away with a different perspective. Therefore, ethnography may be used to interrogate a system, but it is much more useful when undertaking a project with a multi-lingual curatorial team. For this reason, ethnography is frequently used with groups who do not necessarily identify with the group in question, such as migrants, indigenous groups or</text>

I began by interviewing over twenty-five artists from the local art scene, including several that I had met during my years in the city. These included M.

Make writing painless With PostScript A Times Union writer's newfangled typewriter, which comes with a built-in blackboard, a notebook and printer, is as ubiquitous as every phone, computer, and electronic document you’ve ever encountered. You’d never need to leave the comfort of your own home, of course, since you’d always be surrounded by electronic devices. But being able to lay down lines and communicate abstract ideas across a network doesn’t come for free, and without the built-in blackboard and notebook – and without the endless string of punctuation – writing would be nearly unintelligible. So how does PostScript create beautiful writing? Easy – just follow the words. For PostScript, that means capitalizing on the fact that every character represents a letter, and every letter represents a sound: a period, a dash, a period, a dash, a period, a dash, a period, a dash, a period, a hoot, a wail, a howl, a yelp, and so forth. So if you type a letter, you’re actually saying, ‘Here’s a letter.’ And that’s what PostScript does. It’s as if every character in the document represents</text>

And you’re an artist in your own right. You’re making art because you care about art, because your art is meaningful, and because you care about making connections and making lives together.

You’d never need to leave the comfort of your own home, of course – a fact underscored by the fact that this new digital medium is as ubiquitous as paper itself – but writing and receiving documents is still a chore. This is especially true for those of us born and raised in the US, where the paper is still king, and where the typewriter is just another artifact of a bygone era. It’s easy to forget all these things, but they’re still around. Nowadays, they’re calling cards. Reading them is a ­trend, and in a way the typewriter is a relic that still serves its original purpose. It serves as a reminder that there’s still a world out there, where typing and paper are still the dominant forms of communication, and that there’s still a place for art, creativity, resistance and resistance to the prevailing order of things.

You’d never need to leave the comfort of your own home, of course. This is the promise of electronic document attachment. But the promise of electronic document attachment isn’t what interests us here. What’s more appetizing is the next step: attachment to a global network of data-storage devices known as the Cloud. This sounds good on paper, but what makes the Cloud exciting is that it’s both intangible (the words ‘cloud’) and actually a thing. The physical object – a computer, hard drive, network card, and cables – is all we have to hold onto when we need it most. But once we attach these things to a person or a group of people, or even just to data, then the possibilities are limitless. What if, for instance, the printer could write documents that travel between people or even between clouds? What if links between documents could be written? What if links between data could be established? These are just some of the possibilities. There are many more that we don’t</text>

You’d never need to leave the comfort of your own home, of course, because the writing desk is wherever you are — tucked away in a cupboard or in a bag, ready to be accessed at any moment by a city council or a local authority spokesperson. But that doesn’t make it any less real; it makes it far more valuable. So, if you’re thinking about retirement or passing it on to the next generation, consider making writing something that’s as natural as possible. That’s the spirit in which PostScript was conceived. It’s not a recipe, but it’s close. Makes you feel good to think of things your own way.  READ THE REST

Is this what the future is all about? Is this what our reaction to the things we’re witnessing? Is this what the present is all about?These are questions that no longer seem so relevant. Questions that have been answered. Questions that have been rendered obsolete. And yet we still have to be confronted with them, because there’s so much going on in the world that we simply don’t understand. Because we still believe that this is our future.

You’d never need to leave the comfort of your own home, of course, because you’d always feel like you’ve got something of interest on your mind, waiting to be written down. But you do need some structure and organisation around what you’re writing down, because writing is the episodic nature of what’s being said. To keep your thoughts on paper, you need some form of organisation. Without structure and organisation, you’d just be repeating yourself, which isn’t helpful when you’re trying to think of ways to contribute to the larger culture. So what do you do when you don’t have any form of organisation around what you’re saying? You kind of improvise, which is exactly what happened to Suzy Khachaturian when she was trying to figure out what to do with herself after she lost her job as a school teacher in the 1980s. She met a local community organisers and they encouraged him to start a community art organisation called the Stages.</text>

You’d never need to leave the comfort of your own home, of course. But there are times when you do need to leave the comfort of the written word. Like when you’re stuck in traffic. Or like every time you need to do a Google Image Search. Or like every time you need to check Twitter. Or like every time you need to check Facebook. But mostly, there’s when you need to leave somewhere, and GO. And that’s all there is.  And that’s why I wrote the script for my first fiction, ‘The Empty Space of 1968’, for a class project that I did in my senior year at UCLA. The problem with writing fiction is that you’re constrained by what you can conceive of. You can only conceive of so many things at once, so you end up with structures that are constrained by the constraints of a single concept, such as space, time, or reality. And so you end up with ficticious hierarchies of space, such as the</text>

You’d never need to leave the comfort of your own home, of course, because you’d never leave the comfort of your own computer, and that’s where PostScript gets its name. But the fact that we’ve all become accustomed to using computers everywhere, triggers our brains to overcomplicate things a bit. So PostScript gets its name because PostScript is everywhere, and because PostScript is easy to use. Try it out, kid: this is what you get when you type ‘Post’ into a web browser. It’s probably not what you’d call a ‘post’ in a web browser, but it’s a post that gets rendered and read by thousands of computers around the world. So PostScript gets its name because PostScript is everywhere. It’s just that sometimes you’d want to turn it off.

The cooperative board eventually expanded the scope of its mandate to include the whole workforce and invited art professionals to establish and operate a cooperative art school within the cooperative.1 Despite these attempts to combine the assets of art institutions with those of a worker cooperative,2 the co-op ended up becoming much more than a workshop for art students and artists’ self-directed creative work. It evolved into a multi-million-dollar business employing over 6,000 people and continuing to provide employment for thousands more. In the intervening years, there has been a proliferation of self-directed art schools within the city, a proliferation of cooperative-type art enterprises, and a proliferation of artist’s cooperative-type art institutions. Although the cooperative has a long-term plan to help its members return to work, its current role and objectives are limited by both the availability of new workers and the complexity of its administrative structure. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine what the future might have in store for the building and its future use. Despite these limitations, however, the cooperative has a significant future vision and is well positioned to address the legacy of housing reform and is arguably more representative of the city’s evolving urban landscape than any of the</text>

It is important to note that, despite the cooperative’s stated mission to promote participation and empower members,2 its explicit and collective promises of free and reduced-price meals, housing, and educational opportunities remained unfulfilled. 3 As a result, the cooperative members repeatedly attempted to sever ties with the art institution that produced their works and which provided these opportunities, while at the same time continuing to work with and demand free art from it.

The cooperative board eventually expanded the scope of its mandate to include the whole workforce and invited art professionals to establish and operate a cooperative art school within the cooperative.1 Despite these attempts to combine the assets of art institutions with those of a worker–owned cooperative,2 the relationship between the two was often adversarial. In her book Curated by an Artist's Cooperative (2015), Agnes Martin documents the rivalry between the two large art institutions that Martin wanted to see destroyed: the Cooper Union and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Despite their shared mission to promote and preserve contemporary art, the two largest art institutions wanted to close museums and depart from the typical cooperative model. Cooperative art schools provided a convenient alternative for art professionals to work alongside artists, but Martin found that many artists did not want to make the same mistakes her institution made. She concluded that, since the institutions had different missions and priorities, they could not be expected to work together. So, in 2015, she established the Cooperative movement to bridge the gap between her institution and the cooperative movement. This is a new type of art institution that helps artists work alongside artists’ cooperative members in the same way that public and private institutions collaborate with artists to design art spaces and work with</text>

The growth of the cooperative board and the board’s remit, which included the reinstatement of membership in perpetuity, left a residue of distrust between the two that still exists today. Despite these efforts,3 the cooperative board maintained a substantial amount of autonomy within the cooperative, developing strategies to address issues of tension between the two main stakeholders, artists and members of the public.4 The cooperative maintained a contract with the city to provide building and maintenance services to the building it was occupying, as well as to maintain the building as a ‘house museum’ within the cooperative.5 Despite these cooperative’s efforts to make art services available to the public, the city did have a role in curating the events of the exhibition itself, including the activities of the art galleries within the cooperative, and in determining what was and was not allowed to be exhibited.6 The partnership between the city and the artist�</text>

The cooperative board eventually expanded the scope of its mandate to include the whole workforce and invited art professionals to establish and operate a cooperative art school within the cooperative.1 Despite these attempts to combine the assets of art institutions with those of a cooperative,2 the logic of the corporation emerged in surprisingly large letters: TACC was to establish educational and research institutions, jointly, with the cooperative, on the model of a hybrid primary and secondary education institution. This institutionalisation of the artist’s cooperative as a separate entity – with its own fundraising and administrative flexibility – allowed the authors of the Cooperative Housing Accord to devote more time to developing innovative practices within the cooperative, while also enabling the cooperative to expand its programming and to hire more artists and designers to work in the building trade. As a result of these and other cooperative activities, the authors of the Cooperative Housing Accord concluded that their proposal for a hybrid primary and secondary education institution was feasible and even desirable, even though it would undermine the important role of the cooperative in providing collective and collective-owned housing for low-income neighbourhoods.3 The Cooperative Housing Accord was officially launched on June 1,1984, in response to this new logic of co-operative housing.4 The first cooperative housing accommodation</text>

The cooperative board eventually expanded the scope of its mandate to include the whole workforce and invited art professionals to establish and operate a cooperative art school within the cooperative.1 Despite these attempts to combine the assets of art institutions with those of a worker’s cooperative, it is clear that the cooperative board saw itself more as administrators of the art sales and enjoyed more direct access to the art market through its ownership of the art books and the cooperative’s purchasing power in the cooperative. Indeed, the board’s initial outreach to potential artists included a representative selection from a local art school, a current and former student body president, and a representative from the Toronto Art Cooperative.2 In turn, the TACC board members themselves had art degrees from York University and the University of Toronto.3 This intimate understanding between the art professionals and the workers may have come at a cost, since the early on-going nature of the relationship between the two ensured that tensions ran higher than the capacity of the workers to manage. Nonetheless, the cooperative board sees itself as artists, and as such is likely to present itself as an artist’s representative, providing guidance and support to the work it acquires, and inviting further collaboration from the artist</text>

The cooperative board eventually expanded the scope of its mandate to include the whole workforce and invited art professionals to establish and operate a cooperative art school within the cooperative.1 Despite these attempts to combine the assets of art institutions with those of a worker cooperative, the co-operative movement quickly realized that it could not only feed itself, but also afford to support a worker cooperative. In 1990, the cooperative board elected a new worker-organization committee headed by a former chairwoman of the Toronto Art Cooperative.2 The committee was comprised of artists, curators, landscape architects, urbanists and journalists; it was also composed of community activists. The aim of the cooperative was to have a cultural wing dedicated to the cooperative’s cultural activities, while the other half was manned by community artists. In 1991, the community board incorporated as a non-profit corporation, which became a corporation that too often operates independently, but with little public accountability or participation. The cooperative board disbanded in 1993 and the media wing was absorbed into the cooperative. It is now run by a board of directors appointed by the cooperative board and the media.3 The cooperative now distributes artworks and other cultural materials across the city, often through a community land trust,</text>

The cooperative board eventually expanded the scope of its mandate to include the whole workforce and invited art professionals to establish and operate a cooperative art school within the cooperative.1 Despite these attempts to combine the assets of art institutions with those of a worker–managed cooperative,2 the co-operative movement effectively operates through the sale of property and its various instruments of collective bargaining, including: contracts with art professionals; the employment of artists; the provision of educational resources and social benefits to employees; and the provision of funding to support the cooperative’s activities. The term ‘co-operative’ refers to a cooperative housing cooperative’s board of directors; employees who elect to remain employed after joining the cooperative; and the cooperative’s board of directors, who may change at any time. These stakeholders collectively own and control 99.9% of the cooperative’s voting shares.3 Despite these ownership structures,4 the TACC has continued to raise funds through the cooperative’s sales of housing vouchers and tax-exempt bonds to support its activities, including paying off its debt, which at the time of writing stands at approximately US$1.8 million.5 The cooperative also sponsors a free weekly art lecture series</text>

The cooperative board eventually expanded the scope of its mandate to include the whole workforce and invited art professionals to establish and operate a cooperative art school within the cooperative.1 Despite these attempts to combine the assets of art institutions with those of a cooperative, the financial model of the cooperative emerged later, in part because of the push to ‘maintain flexibility’ within the structure of the cooperative. Its early independence was supported by the support of the federal and provincial governments, as well as key community stakeholders. At this time, it was primarily directed to the maintenance of standards and procedures required by the artist’s cooperative to carry out its mission of supporting and facilitating the work of the cooperative.2 Nevertheless, the autonomy afforded by the cooperative board and its decisions later in the process is a critical tool for the democratization of art practice and the fight for social, ecological and political change. As noted by Francesca Bertolotti, when ‘the board is nonviolent, the people are the board’. In the cooperative board meetings, the workers constantly reminded one another of the importance of continuing to be part of the cooperative and to work with the board as an independent body. They also discussed strategies to expand the cooperative beyond its</text>

Despite these setbacks, the cooperative continues to publish a quarterly and holds an annual art fair. Its progressive board meetings, open to the public and art professionals alike, provide a venue for discussion and experimentation. The cooperative is a valuable resource for the city as it strives to revitalize the downtown core and create an arts destination for the growing number of Torontonians who commute into the city from all over the globe.

The Relationship Between Community Arts Institutions and the City’s Downtown Core

The Community Arts Community Land Trust (CLT) was established in 1999 as a Crown‑sponsored entity, created under the Municipal Act, to acquire and develop parcels of land in the core of the ‘Great Mall’, which is now the site of the Canadian Tire Centre.2 The CLT is a Crown‑sponsored</text>

At that time, Liverpool’s musée nationale de l’art contemporain Jean Paul Sartre would not approve.15 While the port city of Liverpool was able to establish a reputation as a centre for film and film-making, the port city fell far behind its French port counterpart in terms of the production of prestigious art pieces. As a result, Sartre’s Cinema Nationale was appalled by Liverpool’s sculpture park, which it hoped would distract from the city’s industrial past.16 Sartre’s Cinema Nationale de l’art contemporain, however, was not unaware of the city’s ‘petrocultured’ image; its ‘architecture’ – an image it continued to repeat ad infinitum throughout the century – was the dominant media of the new order.17 A network of port cities later – New York, London, Liverpool –</text>

With the end of the war in 1991, the city entered into a new constitution, which set out plans for a redeveloped waterfront with significant residential towers and a significant role in the economy. Towards the end of the process, the city’s waterfront was given a major makeover, to become the HQ of a new global economy. Designed to resemble the surrounding coastlines, the new development would include a number of new office parks, retail districts, hotels, and a global positioning system for ocean navigation.15  The new park would include a number of offices for global business operations, including one or more with global commercial operations, as well as an HQ for seafarers.16  This is significant because, while not all seafarers would find their way to work in the new zones, many would.

Despite this distance, Liverpool-based artists found time to create ‘cultural zombies’ in Canvey Island, such as furniture makers Joseph &amp; Sarah Vaughn, and the Vorticist.

As the Liverpool Daily Post newspaper noted in its early 1942 review of the ‘Outstanding Arts and Architecture’ in the city, ‘The announcement of the Olympic Games … placed an end to the old rule that a city must be able to support an artistic establishment. This plan, which had been in motion for some years, seemed to produce an immediate burst of capital […] The new ‘artificial archways’ were planned to be fabricated in ‘partially deconstructed mills and warehouses’, ‘a detritus of British industry’, a sort of urban dustbin’.15 The new ‘architecture of the Iron Curtain’ was to be created solely from the wreckage of abandoned wartime industries, bridges and tunnels.16 Architecture was to be an afterthought, and the postcard-perfect urban landscape achieved its desired effect through a combination of bureaucracy, marketing and, of course, the promise of art.

In the intervening years, the city has enjoyed an odd, uneven, sometimes discontented position in relation to one another. On one hand, the city has been built on the remains of the once-thriving docks; on the other, the collapse of the docks has forced the city’s poorer quarters to be devoured by the monster of industry that is the harbour. As the docks erode, the city’s status as a port city is likely to diminish, leaving, as yet undetermined, the fate of the island in the north. As a publication for young people,  	The Vorticist was a favourite of Liverpool youth groups, who used the magazine as a platform to advertise their wares – toys, games, clothes, houses – to the city’s burgeoning art world.

Despite this increased maritime traffic, relatively little is still said about the docks and docks of the port city, which remain compromised of any archaeological interest, largely because of their frequent refurbishments and expansions. Despite this ongoing degradation, a number of archaeological finds, including the remains of merchant vessels, can be seen to hint at the presence of maritime activity in the port city during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Towards the end of the century, the city was home to the Royal Navy Officers' Club, whose members included numerous former seamen and officers, as well as artists, writers, musicians, and others with a varied range of artistic skills. The role of the artist was clearly to produce visual stimulation in the city, and his or her output was significant in influencing the development of the city’s infrastructure and political culture. While Liverpool’s reliance on industry as a source of wealth and its citizens as labourers has undoubtedly influenced its political culture, there is little doubt that the</text>

At that time, the number of docks in the city doubled, and as a consequence, the size of docks became an issue. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the docks were national monuments; their current state is testament to this. But while the national imagination has historically been fixated on the production, preparation and consumption of goods and services, the imagination of nations is much more easily stimulated by the feeling of connection between things – a feeling that can be chemically manipulated. Thus, nations are able to gather around an object or a concept, and this feeling of connection can be manipulated, whether the object is a nation, an industry or a community of people. The ability to mobilise the collective unconscious or, in the case of a nation, to subdue the urge to production flows is a basic tenet of postmodernism and, indeed, of modernism as a whole.

At present, the port city of Liverpool accounts for approximately 15% of the UK’s maritime turnover.15 Although the port city enjoys a privileged location in comparison to other urban centres, it is important to note that, unlike other centres, it is not a ‘city within a city’. 16  The idea of the ‘hub of trade and industry’ is of course based on the city’s natural resources – not the other way around. As Andrew Goffey observes, the geo-political-economic ‘center of gravity’ for contemporary globalisation has shifted from the coast to the city, which means that, in the past, ‘center’ resided in the state but was influenced by the ocean and the sky’. 17  James Howard Kunstler, ‘The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia’, in  	Being Governed: Essays on</text>

Despite the repeated calls of urban professionals and politicians to the contrary, the city never experienced a manufacturing or new economy following the Olympic Games. Rather, the post-Second World War reliance on fishing, shipping, and other manual modes of production for the bulk of the city’s industry – building, managing, and managing the docks – remained. As a result, the quality of life for working-class and immigrant communities in the city deteriorated. Despite this, the city’s port enjoyed a privileged location in the eye of the national imagination. Its emergence as a global port and its eventual transformation into a regional tourist destination was a narrative that was developed with great gusto. It was, in part, a by-product of a concerted national strategy to downscale the UK’s overseas industry of manufactured goods, packaging, and ready-to-eat pastries, which could be exported at will.15 	The obsession with image and spectacle in contemporary art, and the fixed</text>

Instead of the obsolescence of art and artistic potential that characterises the port city today, the decline of port and its effect on cultural life can be seen as a legacy that persists. The development of the dock as a spatial system, and the consequent loss of value that it places on the maritime landscape, is a story that demands exploration. This remains a compelling case for the future of the port city, and future of the city. In the present, the city is a complex of passive technologies that facilitate the exchange of goods and services, which for various reasons is increasingly difficult. But the city is also a complex that contains latent, yet exploitable, labour. The city is a complex that can nonetheless be exploited, and that potential labour is actively recruited and directed towards fulfilling various functions of various types and scale in various urban settings.

The phrase �submerged Pools of Blue Water’ appears in both texts, and the assertion is made that the sub is diving to avoid detection.  The sub would have to be incredibly resourceful in its attempts to hide, and both are characterised by a surge of paranoid fantasy about a nefarious, aquatic, magical enemy lurking in the murky depths of the sea. It is also said that the ocean is full of these things, and that, since its surface is impenetrable, the submerged object is actually drowning.  Aesthetics are often used to describe the physical world, but the submersible tongue that seeks to conceal things better than its physical body can is particularly skillful at this.  It is said that the sub’s original purpose was to explore the ocean, but later expressions of its interests shifted to study the deeper seas, and even to explore the globe in general. J.G.

The Lusitania was the product of a post-war mercantile imperialism, and the impulse for its production can be traced to the mid-1950s, with the advent of multitudinous transnational car brands, mainly based in the US and UK. The sub was an expression of the new migratory economic form. ‘Riverside Cars Came to London’  The River Thames in  	The River Thames in the autumn of 1957 introduced us to a brand new breed of seafaring merchantman: a seafarer by trade, after all vessels transited the Thames between then and the East India Sea.

The phrase �enduring monuments of the seaside slope’ appears four times in this issue, as in two different sections on the same page. In the third section, the Lusitania remains an imposing but deceptive structure, a shadow of its former self. In the fourth section, the submerged city of Liverpool’s docks is reanimated as a ghostly city of its docks, their abandoned ships adorning the walls and supporting the weight of the docks. The idea that submerged cities can return to life through some kind of miracle of natural phenomena is now commonplace, though it was rare in the 1950s and 1960s.  The idea that submerged cities can return to life through some kind of miracle of human intervention is now the stuff of urban myths.  The idea that submerged cities can return to life through the action of a civic-minded government is still rather newfangled. But in a sense, this is the urban myth of the century: the redemption myth. The Lus</text>

Enduring in a quantitative sense, the magazine’s subtitle tells the tale of a culture that can live on through the elements it has accumulated – and continues to accrue through its commercial activities.  A prevailing principle of the magazine was that a small core of subscribers would be able to inscribe their identity onto the building, and thus become part of a collective – a kind of capitalising memory. In 1957, just over a third of the way through publication, the magazine reverted to its print publication in glass cases, and eventually, after years of lobbying from local residents, to cover-based electronic publication.  A total of 6,000 subscribers signed up for the magazine that summer, with a mix of biographical sketches and profiles of the artists and designers working on the dockside venue.

The two snapshots are juxtaposed by a photograph of the city’s surface, in the form of a pool of clear blue water. The phrase �enduring waves of change� springs to mind.  A quick look online suggests that the ‘new normal’ has, since the mid 1960s, been to transition from the city to the suburbs, to be replaced by something more pleasant and more ‘integrated’.  Such notions are being advanced by way of the ‘waste dump’ – a term first used in the mid-1970s by Harold Innis to describe the vast piles of obsolete, non-metallic consumer goods and household articles which followed the end of WWII.  The word ‘waste dump’ derives from the waste stream – the materials and articles which make up electronics – and refers to the places where these are thrown away in the process of manufacturing.  The concept is used synonymously with ‘strange bedfellows’ in the popular language of urbanisation, but is now often used to describe the disintegration of the city into manageable units.  A</text>

The two snapshots are juxtaposed by a photograph of the city’s surface, in the form of a pool of clear blue water. The phrase �submerged Roman batholiths of the sea� seems an apt description.The ocean is a huge ocean of water, but unlike the water that it is defined by, the ocean doesn’t behave like a river or sea. The ocean pushes back into the shore as it rushes forward, pouring vast amounts of water onto the land in a continuous, unbroken river. On a microscopic level, this water is a kind of liquid oil that lives in contact with rocks and minerals, and by way of a kind of turbulence called wave action, it rains water onto rocks and minerals in contact with the seafloor. As the ocean warms up and the seafloor is flooded with water, the pool of seawater that it produces is even more oil-intensive than the pool of liquid oil. The result is that the ocean produces increasingly more oil per barrel of oil produced, whereas the amount of oil that it burns in a barrel of oil is limited. As a result, the economics</text>

The phrase �enduring waves� echoes in the waters of the ocean, echoing back to us the promise of escape from the machine that is sinking ever deeper into the planet.  The image of the sinking submarine appears alongside a photograph of the Lusitania sinking, alongside other images of the submerged city.  The image of the sinking submarine and the sinking city, juxtaposed, that is, by way of a caption or image, creates a kind of ongoing referential irony. The reader is invited to locate in  	the submerged city the same kind of buoyancy that characterises the submarine, but with the object of its sinking replaced by a photograph of the submerged city.

The magazine clearly understood the power of the once in a decade issue, and the resonance it can exert. In its 1956 special report on the Barents Sea, for example, Christopher Lambert writes:  A brief survey of the historical archives … reveals a remarkable continuity between the voyages of discovery made by British seamen in the Barents Sea during the decades immediately following the Napoleonic Wars and the present-day exploration and reportage of the region by journalists, academics and conservationists.

According to Lewis, the character Sub-Sea Jack is a type of Jack who ‘walks beneath the sea’, and who uses ‘swift currents and the bouncing of things to make things go where he wants them to’. The sub-title of the story, Alice in Wonderland, translates roughly as ‘Where is Sub-Sea Jack?’. In the sub-title of the same story, a question marks appears, as in: ‘Where is the Sea?’.

The magazine that captured the new coastal lifestyle quickly became the subject of a US government-sponsored cultural counterattack, with film noir–inflected essays, ‘The Power Plant’ (co-anchored by a 1950s-vintage Hollywood movie), and the ‘New England Aquarium’ (co-anchored by a Monopoly board game).

I have to say that the Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It�s more of a retrospective. The art galleries were the forefront, but the atmosphere, the vibrancy, the organic flow of things, the fresh air, and the warmth – all of that is city-specific. At first I thought the Biennial would be a week-long arts and culture biennale, but that felt a little artificial to me; it’s more of a ‘formidable interlinking historical meta‐episodic’. I didn’t feel transported away from the city by it, although the art galleries and the city bus tour were a distinct change from the old biennale. The art galleries and the city bus tour still felt like they resided in another time. Also, the fact that the art was there in the first place, in the first place in such large numbers, and in the first place freely (since it was a biennale) – that was interesting for me, the ‘free trade’ that</text>
    <text>The postponed 2021 Biennial, which was strongly promoted by the city, was never going to happen, partly because the city felt it had enough waste and corruption issues on its plate, but also because it didn’t feel like it needed to invest in a museum board or a museum management team. There was no future in that. Only the feeling that you could buy into the fiction that was being built was going to last.

I have to say that the Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It�s more of a visual art institution, and their approach to development is very different from what we would do in the city. There is a difference between the way development is incorporated into an institution – with the city as a whole – and the way the Biennial is structured.I think one of the things that has improved in the last 10 years is the way in which ideas are put into practice. The idea of the ‘city in development’ has been put into practice in a large number of ways, and I think that a lot of the social and political changes that have been happening in the city are due to the fact that a lot of people have had enough. A lot of people are not going to go to university because they don’t feel like it, or because of the cost, or both. There are a lot of factors at play, but the fact that a lot of people are choosing to live near places that are contributing to their success and that are benefitting</text>

I have to say that the Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It�s more of a hybrid of art and development, but there was a sense of time and effort gone into it. There was also a certain amount of conflict in the city, which I didn’t experience, but others in the city have probably experienced. There was a real sense of community behind what was happening. The big difference between the 1990s and the last decade is that the city was developing rapidly, and the Biennial was being produced out of the city’s rapid growth, but at the same time the Biennial was having to address the city’s slow growth and the fact that it was starting to experience its own crisis of sustainability. The development in the city was happening at such a rapid pace that the Biennial was forced to address the ever-present threat of gentrification, which was stoking unrest in the city. The prospect of art being produced at an environmentally sustainable rate was part of the equation, but at the same time the city was being consumed by</text>

The Biennial I went to in 2010 felt like it was coming out of a curatorial hand, like something that had been in development for years. It’s coming full circle again. At the time, I thought it was a mistake that the Biennial had turned into a museum, because it was becoming increasingly apparent that the museum wasn’t what its title implied. It wasn’t just a collection of art, it was an entity that was trying to tell a story and invited the audience to participate in that story. If you went to the museum, you entered into a contract with the museum, and as a visitor, you were entering into a contract with the museum, which was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish, because of the proliferation of exhibitions and the number of curated projects.

It�s the same kind of feeling that you get when you walk into a house that has been on the market for years. There is an air of prescience about it. If you go into a house, you enter a different world. And in the house, you enter a different world only you can touch.You can touch it, but you can't take it apartYou can take it apart, put it back togetherYou can do a few things with it, build a whole new set of problemsYou can do an infinite loopMore like the movie '2001: A Space Odyssey'Donovan: One of the things I discovered in my research into the history of the Biennial was that the first one that came to mind was the one that came out in 1990, the one that Bruce Weber and I did as a duo called System 7. Bruce and I wrote the score, and we were the only ones allowed to sing it. We were the only ones allowed to play it. Then, a</text>

I have to say that the Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It�s all about the city, but it also seems like it’s becoming increasingly difficult to leave the city. The Biennial that came to Anfield in 2016 felt like it was coming out of a DP, or Direct Development District, which is another form of government-sponsored enterprise. It was coming out of the city’s favour, and the city’s favour was coming at the expense of something that was happening in the area. The Biennial that came to Liverpool in 2017 felt like it was coming out of a DP, or Direct Development District, which is another form of government-sponsored enterprise. It was coming out of the city’s favour, and the city was being starved of development. This feels like the city is entering a period of crisis, and the only solution seems to be more development, but the city is also increasingly becoming a burden on itself. The problem with the city is that it’s becoming ever more like another one – dependent on other</text>

I have to say that the Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It�s coming out of a particular moment in time, and that moment was the introduction of Bill Evans’ sculpture, which is a return to a particular kind of urbanism developed in the 1990s. The Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It’s coming out of a particular moment in time, and that moment was Bill Evans’s announcement on 1 January. It was definitely an energy intensive process, and the art world wasn’t prepared for that kind of reinvention. But Bill’s kind of the template for how things are going to be. He has the final say, and if you follow his lead and don’t change him, you’re stuck. I think that’s what the Biennial is going to be like; it’s going to be very much based on his ideas, and that’s its beauty</text>

I have to say that the Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It�s coming out of a city that is experiencing a profound crisis of income and wealth, and it’s also coming out of a city that is experiencing a financial crisis. I went to the Biennial expecting a completely different kind of development. I thought that the Biennial would be places where ideas were being evolved, and the artist’s retreat from the city was coming to life. But instead we got a lot of negative feedback about the city as a waste of space, with strange curatorial approaches to the art and architecture, and people becoming alienated by the biennial as a curatorial approach. The Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a city that, for whatever reason, was more in sync with what was happening in Perth at the time. I don’t know what that makes you think it’s going to be like when that happened again. That was the vibe that was emanating from the city at that time. I don�</text>

I have to say that the Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It�s coming out of a curatorial mindset, but it’s also coming out of the city’s budget. The Biennial of that era was coming out of a city budget, and that’s really interesting. If you take a look at the budget of the 2014 Venice Biennale, you find a marked increase in the budget of the Art Museums of the world, although the Biennale itself has remained relatively unchanged. The main drivers of this have been driven by governments around the world, and it’s interesting that Venice has become such a global phenomenon, dominated by one city for decades now. The Biennale was originally conceived as a phase of a globalisation that would eventually bring an end to nation states and the division of labour. But the bigger the city gets, the more globalisation that’s implied. The Biennale is an implied globalisation, and as such it’s natural for the city to be growing bigger and</text>

I have to say that the Biennial I went to in 2015 felt like it was coming out of a directed energy, like something that had been in development for years. It�s as if the Biennial that year was sitting on a silo full of future plans, but there wasn’t a narrative there. It was all about the momentary pleasures of the moment.The VRC was also about the precariousness of the biennial as a curatorial strategy. We were at a point in the book where biennials were identified as the sites of curatorial conflict, and the book makes the point that this has been a problem ever since Curator Sofía Olascoaga started the Biennial at Tate in 2014. The relationship between the biennial and the museum was described as adversarial, and the apparent inability of the museum to constrain the biennial in its path. The book also makes the point that the advent of digital curation has put an end to the need to rely on specific curatorial strategies. In the absence of a defined narrative arc, the biennial can go for any number of utterly arbitrary and disjointed strategies. This</text>

For example, with the Biennale of Sydney, a local artist was selected through an innovative curatorial approach, which involved in-depth interviews with local communities and stakeholders, and with relevant stakeholders in the city, and then the artwork was created with input from a local artist, local community leader, city councilor and other local stakeholders. The result was a work that was both geographically specific to the area it was situated in, and art independent. It was a step in the right direction for the artworld, but still needs work.

The fact that it was also commissioned by a local authority also helped, as does having the authority’s expertise and networks of artists, community organisers and others who can be built on. In addition to that, the authority has to consider what works best, and support that with resources and expertise. In this case, the Biennale was successful because it had the expertise, but it was also supported by the knowledge and connections of the local community. It provided the authority with a crucial resource in the area, but it also allowed the authority to engage constructively with the way in which the art world engages with art and culture, and that is to be encouraged. In the context of such an art-making community, the authority can create synergies between artists and audience, between art world and arts world, and so forth.   Creatively, the authority can make artworks that are relevant to their contexts, and that is a start. However, this starts to take on an authority over the subject matter, and over time the authority loses control over where the art is displayed, and with whom it is communicated. Therefore, the authority needs to</text>

As an example, we can add curatorial curatorial-level work to the exhibition The Contemporary Condition, which is currently on view in London and New York, and in the US. It will be interesting to see how the Biennale of Sydney, its curatorial approach, and the COP conference, which is the art world’s first international meeting of the art world, shape the development of biennials and the way in which art is produced, presented and consumed in the city.

The Biennale of Sydney, and the related year-long Cork and Liverpool biennales, have also shown an interest in the local and regional dimensions of art and culture. In Liverpool, the Biennale of Sydney and Liverpool followed a similar approach, but were interested in the wider city, and the places within it that can be included in a biennale. So, the artworks were placed in contexts that allowed them to connect to what the authorities were doing there, while also suggesting to the visitor that there are other ways of looking at the world. In Liverpool, the Biennale of Sydney and Liverpool followed a similar approach, but were more interested in performing the role of the visitor, and in that of the museum, as a whole. So, the biennales were able to create their own worlds, while also suggesting to visitors that they were not confined to the confines of their local places. They</text>

The fact that the work came from the artist and was commissioned by the Biennale made it a unique hybrid: both the artist and the audience were members of the community, and so the project met the needs of the local community. So the authority was able to leverage the expertise of artists and community organisers to make the artworks relevant and interactive for the community.  	[4] See, for example, Nasser Rabbat, Alon Kedar and the New Media Art Project, 2015.

The fact that the Biennale was also co-financed by the Biennale itself also helped, as did the local authority’s involvement in the Biennale itself. There is still a great deal of work to do in terms of the art institutions and the city as a whole, but in the past two years alone there has been a lot of work done locally, and a lot of innovative work done within the area itself. The question is whether the Biennale could have been run as a corporation, and if it could have been run as a co-operative as well. I think the answer to that is a firm – yes, definitely could have been done as a co-operative – but the main issue would have been how to divide the work amongst workers, between artists and shop stewards, between the two types of employees, between the community and the art institutions, and between the community and</text>

It gives us a different perspective, and allows us to understand how an artist can work across different stakeholders. This is an area where the Biennale and the local authority have a huge amount of expertise – both physically and mentally. The Biennale has to balance artistic objectives with the requirements of the local communities, and the local authorities have to balance the needs of the Biennale with the priorities of the wider community. The balance has to be struck, and sometimes the Biennale’s creative conflicts with the needs of the community. However, the biennale also has to balance the demands of the city, and the needs of the local communities. In doing this, it is up to the biennale to create a work that appeals to both the artist and the community, while recognising the other, and making both aware of the other’s work and purpose. The Biennale did not create the perception of desir</text>

The fact that it was also commissioned by a local authority also helped, as does having the authority’s expertise and networks of artists, community organisers and others with a cultural touch. Local government has a crucial role in curating culturally responsive artworks, as a means to building trust and making works that are relevant in a community, and in this respect the Biennale was no exception. It is often forgotten that local government funds actually support the artworks themselves – paying for them with tax-deductible contributions. Thus, the Biennale was able to establish partnerships with other arts organisations, including the Arts Council of Great Britain, which funded part of the art budget, and the Biennale was able to secure funding from the Arts Council of Australia and the Commonwealth Fund. These grants came as a result of strong partnerships between the Arts Council of Australia and the Biennale, and the Biennale was able to leverage the support of a diverse range of organisations, including the Arts Council of Great Britain, which funded part of the art budget, and the Commonwealth Fund, which funded part of the art programme. These grants came as a result</text>

The fact that the Biennale was also co-curated by a local authority further enhanced the authority’s involvement. A power-sharing arrangement, where the Biennale is managed by a local authority and the local authority by a consortium of other local authorities, is desirable for several reasons. First, it maximises transparency and accountability; secondly, it maximises the engagement of diverse communities; and finally, it maximises the participation of artists and others with whom the local community can work. It is also desirable for the Biennale to be interactive and transferable, so that artists and others with whom the local community can work can freely access it. For this reason, the authority that manages the Biennale has a governance agreement with the Biennale, which obliges it to deliver relevant artworks to relevant audiences.

The fact that it was also commissioned by a local authority also helped, as does having the authority’s expertise and networks of artists, community organisers and others in the art, fine art, design and design industries. These are the kinds of practices and their diverse effects, and the long-term consequences, that need to be considered when considering future biennials.Download this article as PDFJussi ParikkaJussi Parikka is Artistic Director for the Biennale of Sydney, and was previously Curator for the Museum of Contemporary Art (New York) and Director of the Biennale (2014-2015).

For example, with the Biennale of Sydney, a local artist was selected through an innovative curatorial approach, which involved in-depth interviews with local communities and stakeholders, and with relevant stakeholders in the city, and then the artwork was created with input from a local artist, local community leader, city councilor and other local stakeholders.

The fact that it was also commissioned by a local authority also helped, as does having the authority’s expertise and networks of artists, community organisers and others in the locality. Local government, local organisations and their artists' networks were often the most effective in bringing artistic practices into the city, as a way to engage local audiences and take things forward, even if this came at a cost to other parts of the country.  	[4] David Harvey, ‘The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia’, in, ed., eds Jasmine Timmerman, Michael Nestor and Andy Stern, Pemba Niue, New York, Norton, 2008, p.131.Download this article as PDFJasmine TimmermanJasmine Timmerman is an artist, writer, researcher and educator.

    The postponed 2021 Biennial has been tentatively re-nominated for a '17' instead. What does this mean in practice? Well, it means that the biennale will return in 2026, when the city council may decide to re-zoom it, or cancel it, as they please. Or, as we said, it may mean relocating it somewhere more urban. We’ve never seen a blueprint for such a project, but it’s quite possible that a biennale could be relocated to a location in the city where it’s more visible, and in this scenario, more people visit it. A city map would provide a map of the city, showing the places where the biennale would be most visible. This would make it visible in a new way: in a different light, perhaps?

But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between the wealthy and the poor, and those in the middle class and the poor will continue to dominate. How will the city map look like in twenty-first century China? We don’t know, but it’s worth asking: what would the city look like if the rich and the poor lived in equal measure? We may know, but that would defeat the purpose of the city, which is to provide equal access to resources and opportunities across the board for all. Cities today are made up of clusters of identical buildings with a common use – a supermarket, a school, a mosque, a post office, a garage and a lot of buildings around a central hub of activities – but they also have a spatial heterogeneity that can vary widely according to the preferences and needs of the residents of those clusters. The supermarket, for instance, may serve a client’s needs, but it also has a spatial heterogeneity that is determined by the needs of a range of stakeholders, including the various stakeholders</text>

But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between the rich and poor, and that this will continue to be the case. What will become of these neighbourhoods that will be renamed cities in the new urbanisms? We don’t yet know. The city maps we see today may be generated by the biennale, but they’re also the city’s maps, created by the city in the wake of the biennale. The biennale may then map these ‘heritage’ neighbourhoods back to where they started, in the image of a ‘heritage district’. 	But this is not quite right. The city may in fact want to push back, to reverse, neighbourhoods that it deems ‘heritage’, and create new neighbourhoods where the rich reside and play hockey, or go to college educationally and economically viable options. But this is not exactly what happened in Montreal during the twentieth century. The city actively promoted middle-class neighbourhoods and urban growth, while pushing out</text>

But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between the rich and the poor, and those in need will still be disproportionately crushed. We know that in a city as dense as New York, there will still be mass transit, but we also know that in a dense urban centre with a high-performance transit system, there will still be mass transit only available on weekends and during rush hours. We also know that in a dense urban centre with a high-performance transit system, there will still be mass transit only available when the system is fully automated, but we also know that in the future, when fully autonomous, this only applies in very remote places, such as Hong Kong or Moscow. We also know that in a dense urban centre with a high-performance transit system, the city will still play host to very visible mass transit lines, but these will be very distinct from the automated lines of the future. For example, in the present day, there will still be great importance placed on data, particularly in the age of huge data-collecting</text>

But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between rich and poor, grey and black, bigoted and not-so-black, blue- and white, bus drivers and delivery men, homeless and housed, war and peace, factories and garages. We know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be war zones everywhere, but unlike in the present day, they’ll be populated not by tourists seeking cheap escapism but by retired soldiers, taxi drivers, shoppers and house-hunters, to name only a few groups. We also know that in the new urbanisation of the city, there will be far more interaction between man and machine than in the present, due to the growing marketisation of labour. 	But there will still be cities, and biennales will still happen, and we can plan our cities to cater to their specific needs, desires and priorities. We can choose to be in them, or not to be in them. And we can explore what that means in terms of</text>

But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between the most densely populated areas and the rest of the city, and these will remain so. We know because we followed the logic of the ‘overlooked cities’ – the forgotten places – in the national and international press, and in those places that have the highest populations: Tokyo and New York. We knew that the biennale would be relocating to the most visually appealing places, because those places with the most tourists are the places with the fewest residents. We didn’t yet know that the most visually appealing place in the city would be a museum, or a gallery, or a bakery. For the 2017 event, we chose to offer a ‘baking development and promotion initiative’, in the form of a ‘programme of activities’, in exchange for a one-time, fee-based allocation of exhibition space. The assets we acquired through our research and development process in the new urban centres will be retained in exchange, so that the</text>

In the new urbanism of the future, perhaps. 	But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between the socio-politicised city and the countryside. And in the city, these disparities will continue to be an issue. We still have huge housing shortages in the city, and the biennale is only one part of a larger project that includes the farmers market, the rebuilt Central Park project, and the ongoing fight for affordable housing with the new mayor. It’s a good fit for the city, and a good fit for the biennial. And it will continue to be a good fit for the biennial. But in the coming years, the city will likely choose to reinvest in the project that it’s financing, and this will happen regardless, as long as the project is good for the city and the biennale. The biennale will continue to be a ‘once in a generation’ event, and will continue to be a catalyst for development in the city, but its true scale, and the extent to which it is a genuine contribution to the</text>

But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between the places where people live and work, and the places where natural landscapes and cultural attractions meet. We also know that in the new urbanism of the future, we’ll have to start paying attention to the fact that in the very near future, large parts of the city will be rendered uninhabitable, and that this will mean that a large number of people will be displaced. Will we still want to call it ‘New Urbanism’? We don’t know. But the fact that the biennale will return again only postpones the fact that the city will have to start thinking about how to react to a world that seems increasingly like the city it’s supposed to be. The biennale has only ever returned when the city council or another authority declares war on it, or when the city itself is in danger. We don’t yet know when this war will actually happen, nor what the city will look like in its aftermath. But</text>

But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between rich and poor, and racial and ethnic diversity will be an issue. We also know that in the future, the climate will play a larger role in determining whether or not there will be floods. Will the climate be too hot, or will the city be flooded with water? Will there be enough rain to cover the ground, but insufficient water to run rivers? Will there be enough desert for the space-faring biennales to happen in, but not in danger of flooding, but subject to the whims of global climate? We also know that in the future, humans may not live in perfect harmony. That there are still terrible conflicts going on in the world, including in our own world, and that we’ve all got to some degree to play a part in some way or another. But we also know that if we don’t take part in some way, we’re not going to be able to play our part in shaping the future we’re born</text>

But we know that in the new urbanism of the future, there will still be large disparities between the most deprived areas and the most urban centres, and that this will continue to be the case. We also know that large swaths of the city will continue to be swallowed up by development, which will affect the very fabric of the city. And there will always be that lingering question: where is the city now? We still have to figure out what that means. 	The question of where to put a future biennale remains unsettled, with very few places offering the ideal combination of urbanicity, cultural attractions, historical preservation and public realm features desired by a public. But a place that attracts people from all over the world, and that becomes a permanent monument to the past, and where that’s the prevailing aesthetic, historical and spatial logic of the city, as it exists today, is a place to be reckoned with. 	Finally, a place that inspires people to come and make the city a place they want to be? That’s a question that needs</text>

We also know that in the future, there will be wars in the city, and that the city will be a contested space. We don’t yet know how to deal with these new circumstances. We don’t yet know how to build long-term collective lives in the city. We don’t yet know what to do with the artworks that are no longer ‘real’ but are nevertheless ‘art’ – works that are more or less there for aesthetic pleasure or political effect. We don’t yet know what to do with the artworks that are art, but are nevertheless urban ruins and urban wastelands and stand as testimony to the city’s infrastructural obsolescence. We don’</text>

The Perforce Project is deeply indebted to the staff of the archdiocesan courts and tribunals, which allowed us to begin our legal case in 2015. The legal proceedings are ongoing, and the family is represented by the international law firm of Bechtel Hamilton. The Perforce Project is currently consulting with the Federal Court of Canada on the possibility of launching an appeal against the closure of the Calouste Gulbenkian Center for Studies in History and Art (2015–16).

The neighbourhood is to be known as ‘Montréal’ – a name that has political, economic and geographical associations – and the ‘Montreal International’ airport is now known as ‘Chromos Triomphe International Airport’. The Perforce family’s involvement in the cityscape was initially conceptual and political. In recent years, it has focused on the perforce, the individual and their place in the global urban landscape.

The neighbourhood centre was designed by Arata Isozaki, who worked with the Perforce family on many projects around the city. The Perforce family continues to develop the neighbourhood, inviting people into their home through projects such as the annual Parade des Festivals, which the family organises with their neighbours, and the annual Crois-du-Lac, which is an art and community event. In 2017, the family moved to Chateau Lake Louise, Québec, where they developed a new neighbourhood park and hosted a community fair with over 1,000 visitors.

The project was created to address the crisis of homelessness in the city. The Perforce family has lived in Montreal for over 50 years and is one of Canada’s most iconic families. Since 2014, they’ve been developing The Perforce Project – a home for one, with a workshop, a shared kitchen and living and working space – in their home for the Perforce family, located in the historic district of Montreuil-Jolie du Nord. The Perforce family is also the biological parents of two other families with similar situations: the Queene family and the Castells. In 2016, the family moved to LA’s Miramar District, where they started a new business, The Perforce Group, which brings together art, architecture and sustainability. In 2017, the family moved to Toronto, and the LA Institute of Contemporary Arts established a residency program in Montreal. The Perforce Group’s work has been featured in numerous publications including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Toronto Star, The Wall Street Journal, The Hollywood Reporter, The New York Times Travel section, and various catalogues and museums. They have been shortlisted for the Juno Prize, Guggenheim Museum, and were shortlisted for the British Library’s Short Prints Unit, as well as various other prestigious awards and recognitions.In 2017, the family moved back to Montreal. This time, they opened a shop called ‘The Perforce Store’ in honour of the city’s homeless, which serves as a hub for their wares – a mix of traditional and social goods</text>

The Perforce family is also the biological parents of two other families with similar situations: the Queene family and the Castells. In 2016, the family moved to a new neighbourhood in Montreal, located in the historic district of North Shore Boulevard. For the project, the researchers from the Centre for a New Urbanism (CNESU) and the Université de Montréal established a collaborative process called The Perforce Task Force. The Perforce family has participated in the task force’s discussions and produced innovative action plans that address specific challenges facing the neighbourhood. For the 2017–2018 academic year, the family completed a public intervention on the CNESU campus, in which they used multimedia, participatory and archival methods to bring attention to a series of policy issues affecting the neighbourhood, including the use of eminent domain and the displacement of the residents of Montréal du Nord. During this time, they convened several community forums in Montréal du Nord, developed a shared language for the residents, and engaged with the media. The involvement and engagement of the family in the media spotlight continues to generate engagement, debate and knowledge about the neighbourhood.</text>

In 2016, the family moved to Auspicious Occasion – Auspicious Occasion, Montréal, Canada. Today, the neighbourhood has seen several major renovation projects, and this summer, the city selected the creation of a new ‘public realm’ designation for the historic neighbourhoods of Montréal, in an effort to create a landscape that better reflects the city’s architecture. While the Perforce family has been able to devote much of their time to their home, other activities, such as gardening, bird watching or playing outdoors, continue to be an additional part of their day. The Perforce Family welcomes any and all interested parties to come to work in the family’s business, designed around collaboration and exchange.

In 2016, the family moved to a new location in Montreal, but this fate is always uncertain. In October 2017, the Trudeau generation founded an Indigenous advisory council, which continues to meet monthly. We’re currently developing the second phase of the Perforce Project, which will include the creation of an Indigenous-owned cooperative – a partner in the construction of the housing – as well as the establishment of a local Indigenous media infrastructure. The cooperative will be managed as a cooperative of artists, designers, farmers and community organisers, with a strong emphasis on engagement with the cultural and historic district of Montreuil-Jolie du Nord, where the family currently lives. The Perforce family continues to be keen on exploring possibilities for the neighbourhood in which they live, and in 2018, they began planning for the second phase of the project: the establishment of a local museum of Indigenous origin.This article was originally commissioned by and published in New Democrat​ and was partially inspired by a visit to Montreuil-Jol</text>

It’s a rhetorical question, but one that needs to be asked and answered in order to get a sense of how much of our contemporary predicament is down to the vagaries of culture as a social process, and how much is down to the vagaries of gender relations. To some extent, I believe that the cultural turning away from the concrete can be understood as a function of gender relations. For women, the concrete realm is a world of routines, patterns, routines that emerge naturally from constant interactions with objects and bodies: the house, the workplace, the street, colour, numbers, habits – everything is reducible to numbers, shapes and numbers. The body is a constant point of entry into and exit from the cultural landscape, from the everyday to the spectacular. As such, the body is a social creation that produces and contributes to cultural formations. But this body is</text>

As a consequence, the curatorial turn around art is, for the most part, a turning away from the reality of life in those places, while the other half of the equation is made up of art and activism largely directed towards the non-white communities.   A more complete and precise reflection of the lived reality would perhaps involve going to those places and experiencing the conditions there firsthand. But given the choice, most of us would prefer to pretend the art is happening somewhere else entirely.  The choice is mostly a function of who we are told the art is supposed to be for and who is supposed to be the audience. The choice of places and modes of engagement is largely a choice made by who is seated in the gallery.  And given the choice, most of us are also pretty good at choosing who to engage with in the gallery: engaging with art that we think is amazing or art that we think is interesting or art that we think is representative or art that we think is interesting or art that we think is insightful or art that we think is beautiful or art that we think is complex or art that we think is beautiful or art that we think is unusual or art that</text>

I found that the key concepts were defined by white men, and that the way in which art is produced and distributed globally is determined by and for white men. 	This point of view, articulated by historian, art critic and New York Times bestselling author of The Great Gatsby, Art Buchwald, in his contribution to the Curatorial Hummingbird, makes the point that despite the many advances and innovations of modern art, there is still a long way to go before we might consider it to be a fully realised and representative form of art. Art is still made up of the same disparate parts, and this is especially true of new media of art making, which creates the impression that there is a unified artworld experience</text>

As a consequence, the curatorial turn around art is, for the most part, a turning away from the reality of life in those places, while the other half of the equation is made up of people of colour, who make up the balance of that world. If we take a look at some of the recent work being done in those traditionally black arts arts centres, we see that a lot of the work being made in those venues for white men is being made in ways that are exclusively for cis men. In the case of young people, especially, the participation of non-white people is being curated, or at least providing them with an option in terms of participation. The work being done for non-binary and non-human actors is of course another factor.There are of course many other factors that have an impact on how people engage with art and cultural production, and their engagement with it depends on many factors, but one of the most obvious is access to resources. The ability to access cultural resources is an essential component of cultural production, and a city like Liverpool with its fantastic arts education programme and cultural tourism industry – strongly underpinned by the arts education budget – is</text>

The performance, the place and the microaggression[5] – performance, that is, the act of making (or, with performance, making something seem real by turning it into art). On a microaggression, the act of another being is perceived as a threat in the same way that a human being might be perceived as a threat. For example, the act of walking down the street is perceived by many people as dangerous and by no means every day, but it is still a real act of caution when habitual traffic jamming and overcrowding are a fact of life in many cities. We may perform the act of walking down the street on a microaggression, or urban microaggressions, in order to evade detection and to make our cities less interesting places. We may perform the act of parking illegally in order to remain unseen and untouchable. We may</text>

It is political to make art for a community, but it is equally politically to not make art for a community. The question is whether the curatorial turn around art can be turned into art, or vice versa.4. The curatorial turn away from the real life. How is curatorial work with real life incorporated into the art process? This is a critically important question for a number of reasons. First, because the relationship between the curatorial turn and the real life is, by its very nature, mediated through the other half of the equation: the other half of the equation is made up of art and the world it represents. Second, because the real life is made up of relatively narrow representations, and because the art is made in a highly specific medium (art and its representations), and because the medium operates on a different level from that on which the art is presented, the social turn may be</text>

As a consequence, the curatorial turn around art is, for the most part, a turning away from the reality of life in those places, while the other half of the equation is made visible through symbolic and visual aids. If there is art in those places then there must be life, and that is perhaps what the curatorial is about. But what is life in those places?  The word ‘curatorial’ has been around for a long time, and rightly so. It comes from Latin curare, ‘a denoting place or space’, and it means a space or set of spaces for a particular kind of person or thing to be found, found or made. So when we think about what a curatorial role art can play in the public sphere, we do not imagine an artiste or a gallery or a museum – which are often caricatures of their kinds, and which are themselves often caricatures of their kinds – but rather a particular kind of space, a particular kind of organisation, a ‘curatorial caucus’. It is a kind of forum where a particular kind of person (or people) can come to find out</text>

This is the situation in places such as Liverpool, where the Artisans Market is a production line for the activities of the local art community, but also the activities of the museum. The former is a production line for the latter, but it is made possible by the latter. When we turn away from the things we actually care about, we often do harm. When we turn away from the things that really matter, we can do great things. When we do the opposite and engage with the things that really matter, we can make art that is both powerful and beautiful, while actually making a world in which those things do not happen.  One may argue, however, that the curatorial turn towards art practice is itself a production line for the sorts of social, political and economic changes that need to happen in order to genuinely call things ‘real’ and ‘representations’ that can truly exist.
