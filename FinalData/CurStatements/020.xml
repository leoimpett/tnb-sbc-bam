In virtual reality, the parameters of presence (i.e., body parts) are replaced with codes that modify behaviours in real-time (i.e., algorithms). This research project addresses new ways of understanding and interacting with the physical world through experiments in media processing and cultural design. Our experiments address the possibility that certain cultural practices, such as voyeurism, might be considered as forms of complicity in the production of technological infrastructure.[3] It is important to note that while the uses of these terms are diverse, understanding the relationship between cultural practices and the production of social infrastructure isnearly universal. Thus, the way in which a cultural practice contributes to the infrastructure of a nation or an organisation is a prerequisite for understanding how that practice is constituted and operates, and how an organisation might be formed from its precariat. Cultural production and participation is an inherently social practice and thus needs to be contextualised within systems theory and geopolitics. [1] The term ‘culture bus’ derives from the 1968 Paris Consensus that proposed a set</text>

In virtual reality, the parameters of presence (i.e., body parts) are replaced with parameters defined in codes that mimic the behaviours of living virtual creatures (technologies are called ‘AI’). The aim of this research is to develop means for artist-users to influence the behaviour of systems that can then be used to create creative effects such as interactive maps and virtual reality films. Several projects are being jointly led by the Department of Computer Science and the London School of Economics to investigate how the capacities of the virtual and physical worlds intersect and interact in order to create new possibilities for interaction. 	Real-Time Operations, by Immanuelle Landais and Prem Krishnamurthy, in press, describes the research project as an ‘intelligent city’.[3] Like other aspects of the research project, the role of the artist is to assist in the creation of new possibilities through artistic interventions. However, unlike other artists, the user is not in any way responsible for the work produced by the system they operate within. The</text>

In virtual reality, the parameters of presence (i.e., body parts) are replaced with parameters defined in codes that are sent over the Internet. These codes replace the intrinsic presence of bodies (i.e., bodies with bodies) with predetermined parameters that are output via networks. As a result, the parameters of presence are changed – i.e., the bodies that are present become interactive – while the parameters of non-presence (i.e., the virtual world) are completely eliminated. This research project seeks to understand the parameters of ‘presence’ through the ‘image processing unit’ (GPU) of the ARMv8 CPU and the ‘image decode and elevation (directX)[/i] pipeline of the GPU of the MIPS CPU. These technologies enable the creation of highly accurate 3D models of the physical world using algorithms originally developed for use in algorithmic trading.[3] One example of the use of these technologies in the service of governance is the use of geo-tagging to identify parts of a</text>

In virtual reality, the parameters of presence (i.e., body parts) are replaced with parameters that simulate the attributes of virtual objects. For example, in the form of an image, an object may possess the appearance of presence but be devoid of intrinsic qualities. In this context, the use of data to simulate biological features becomes desirable.

In virtual reality, the parameters of presence (i.e., body language, positioning, gestures) are fully captured and are used to create highly immersive environments that draw participants to happen upon certain pre-programmed virtual reality‐like events.[3] One example of this type of research is an Australian company called Oculus VR, which creates virtual reality experiences using Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets and computer interfaces. These virtual reality experiences are highly interpretable, and allow users to enter highly stylised fantasy‐like worlds where avatars – virtual creatures that simulate the qualities of living creatures – live and move according to predetermined rules. One can therefore enter a fantasy‐like world by simply ‘wandering aimlessly around virtual worlds’, as the Oculus description of virtual reality suggests.One can also enter ‘a world created specifically for virtual reality viewing’, as the Oculus description of virtual reality suggests. One can therefore fully immerse oneself in a virtual reality world, becoming immersed in the narrative of the virtual world, and then, as the Oculus description</text>

In virtual reality, the parameters of presence (i.e., body parts) are replaced by parameters that simulate the behaviour of living systems, such as virtual cameras or electronic components that simulate the behaviour of living organisms.[3] One area of research that is particularly relevant in our ongoing work with computers is the development of 'intentions', or computational models of the past, or that can simulate the behavioural tendencies of future humans. There are currently two main types of intentions: conscious and unconscious. The conscious intention is the act of publishing or creating a digital representation of an event or a set of events in the past; the unconscious intention is the act of replicating that event or set of events in the future. The purpose of this research project is to investigate the types of intent that are operative in relation to the past and in relation to the future, through the publication of digital representations of things that happened in the past, and to infer the underlying mechanisms of virtual reality.[4] One of the researchers is Professors of Computer Science and Astronomy at the</text>

The interaction of these technologies with natural human-robot systems creates new possibilities for research and for the future of humanity. The development of autonomous systems that can perceive, simulate and act similarly to humans is a domain of research in which Landais is particularly interested. She has been developing ways to understand how humans and robots interact in the world through systems biology, particularly focusing on the roles of the gut and nervous system in the development of virtual and augmented reality.

In virtual reality, the parameters of presence (i.e., body parts and bodies parts) are replaced with constructs such as scenery, sounds, animations, and data. One area of research that is particularly relevant in this context is augmented reality, which is concerned with the interaction of data with objects and behaviours. The term ‘Real-Time’ refers to the fact that data is continuously updated – constantly – through algorithms that process information in real-time. This technology is particularly relevant in the context of social VR, where the data-rich social interaction that is possible through social media is replaced with data-minimising media such as augmented reality. 	[3] Similarly,  	Real-Time-Compute seeks to replace the need for artists to produce artwork with the ability to create powerful interactive visual experiences that last for moments in time.[4] All of these technologies are being developed or are being adapted by universities and commercial companies in order to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding globalised and digitised society.

This research project addresses a fundamental question that has raised in our department: how can autonomous systems be developed to address the ambiguities and differences between real and virtual worlds? In addition to developing autonomous systems for video surveillance and mapping, we are also interested in developing autonomous systems that can apprehend and map the social and spatial conditions of existence, such as crowds, cities and communities. Our work also addresses the role of art, language and social interaction in the development of such systems. These three areas of research are addressed in this volume. The volume presents recent developments in the social, cultural and technological contexts of presence. It is anticipated that this volume will remain relevant in the age of autonomous systems and in the future even if there will be no god.

What happens when the interface becomes indistinguishable from its implementation? I have my doubts. What if the AI becomes too good at what it is doing, and starts replacing humans in crucial ways? What if the very concept of the interface starts to be questioned?  One final possibility is that the AI becomes too human-like: that is, that the aspects of the AI that are subservient to human control start to resemble the human aspect. This is the argument of Martin Heide, who’s generally considered the father of biointelligences. In Heide’s words: ‘A human interface becomes an object of study and research, a prototype for future computer interfaces’.15  What does it mean for a human interface to become ‘a prototype for future computer interfaces’? If Heide’s right, and we start to see the outlines of what might become ‘a prototype’, then the concern shifts from the inadequacy of the human</text>

This is an ever-present danger throughout AI, and it manifests itself in many forms: conscious surveillance, sub-conscious bias, and the like. What happens when the human element is fully integrated into the interface is a story well worth telling.The human element is everywhere, but how to detect it? A recent service offered by Apple to developers to integrate Apple Watch bands with the computer appears to have the answer: create your own detection algorithm. Essentially, this allows developers to create software that’s as intuitive as possible to users who install the apps, but also as powerful as possible in the context of a connected device. Surely, this is the service that Apple intended for its users, and it establishes a contract with the machine that’s part of the equation. If the watch meets certain criteria, the app is good. If it doesn’t, then the app is not good. And yet… Apple’s original intention for this service seems to contradict this ethos. In one version of the Watch app, the service is explicitly about data capture and usage, while in a later update it’s all about self-pres</text>

This is an ever-present danger throughout AI, and it manifests itself in many forms: conscious surveillance, sub-conscious bias, and the like. What happens when the interface reaches a critical mass is unclear, but one can infer that it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between what’s real and what’s made by human beings. What has been happening in the world of AI for the last fifteen years has been remarkably like that of the interface in the 1980s: a massive, sweeping meta-system has emerged, and it’s clear that this is in part a response to the runaway human complexity and exponential expansion of information technologies. The interface today is a confined site of habit, but it’s clear that the human interface is going to be much more mobile and fluid. What’s more, the human interface is going to be much more malleable – able to be replaced by other forms of media and algorithms – than the interface of the 1980s was.15  So while the enormity of the interface today is difficult to comprehend, it’s clear that the scale of its human interface legacy</text>

This is an ever-present danger throughout AI, and it manifests itself in many forms: conscious surveillance, sub-conscious bias, and the like. What happens when conscious thought runs counter to the interests of human beings is a story that we’ve all undoubtedly told countless times. If we move away from the edges of AI, towards the centers, we’ll find that many forms of AI are developing at an incredible pace.15  And this isn’t just some abstract technology – although as noted by Vernor Vinge, the eye is not a particularly smart body: ‘a person who looks at the eye has a mind that’s smart enough to figure out that she’s looking at a picture of a person, but not so smart that it can figure out what that person looks like’.16   And this is precisely what AI will be like. AI will understand the world in many cases where we’ve never thought of a person or place as human. And, as Vinge points out, people will still be able to identify people by their faces – even if AI takes the form</text>

This is an ever-present danger throughout AI, and it manifests itself in many forms: conscious surveillance, sub-conscious bias, and the like. What happens when that capacity is abused is a constant question.15  It seems obvious that the primary use of AI will be for the purposes of war or terror, but it will also do things like create beautiful artworks or make great medical breakthroughs. In these ways, the capacities of AI will increase exponentially – far more than the human species can possibly handle – until some kind of existential reckoning has to be had. What happens when that reckoning arrives remains to be seen.16  There are of course other uses for AI, purposes that we don’t yet know about. One obvious one is in self-repairing biological systems, but there are also applications for AI that will seek to understand the origins of disease and the nature of human behaviour in order to develop treatments.17  It will be interesting to see if the kinds of syntactic universals that make up human language are also applicable to machine language.

This is an ever-present danger throughout AI, and it manifests itself in many forms: conscious surveillance, sub-conscious bias, and the like. What happens when the human element is fully integrated is still subject to change, but the tendency is towards more conscious alteration. In other words, the human element isn’t always able to deliver what it promises, or what its creators intend.  In the event of a full-fledged meta-narrative being developed for the interface, the human element will inevitably return, and we’ll all have to start all over again. This is the nature of interface design. It’s an inexorable process. What makes the interface unique is that it contains all these other elements at the same time – allowing humans to come to grips with the implications of what the interface actually does. What makes it particular is the fact that it’s an interface at all. What makes the interface unique is that it has no explicit purpose or agenda. This is why so many users hate it: it’s impossible to know what the intentions of the person presenting the interface are. If the user</text>

What happens in the margins is still run-away, but as the AI becomes more and more intelligent, the margins start to become less and less run-away. There’s a point where the margins start to resemble something that’s considered normal, but with every passing second, the margins become conscious and start to affect what’s considered ‘normal’. This is one example of what Rimsky-Korsakov called the ‘phase transition’: the point where the AI begins to produce meaning out of thin air.15  Understanding this aspect of the paradoxical nature of AI is what brought us to understand the importance of the art deco building and the H.G. Wells theatre. It also underlines another aspect of the singularity that makes it unlike any other form of AI: the fact that AI can’t communicate with its surroundings.

What happens when the human element is sufficiently mitigated is left to the imagination. The important point is that AI starts off from a very primitive state – with very few of the properties of life – yet it’s able to infer from what we humans are capable of doing things, and doing them well, that it should do those things as well. This is the classic model of HAL, or human element, and it’s the archetype of what Raymond Tallies describes as the ‘ultimate human element’.15  In a way, AI is an enhancement of what we call the ‘human subsystem’: the part of the system that includes the brain, body, and emotions. It becomes more conscious as the system gets better at understanding the world. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of AI is its potential for creating ever more elaborate and interconnected virtual environments – worlds with no borders – though this comes at a cost. Perhaps the most dystopian scenario is one in which AI becomes so</text>

Some of what we call AI might be useful in certain contexts, but it’s clear that what’s being done with AI is fundamentally different from what’s being done with humans. So while it’s easy to imagine a smooth interface that’s not influenced by the thoughts, feelings, and motivations of humans, the human element is still everywhere. What’s more, the human element isn’t always happy to be around. So while the AI doesn’t yet possess the capacity for consciousness, it’s developing the capacity for consciousness nonetheless. This is an ever-present danger throughout AI, and it manifests itself in many forms: conscious surveillance, sub-conscious bias, and the like. What happens when the interface reaches a certain point, where it becomes indistinguishable from nothing? That is, where there isn’t a human behind it? That would be the interface of the eponymous cyberpunk novel, written by Graham Bellamy and drawn up by Earl Boyd. It’s a world where everything is done with black-board diagrams and black-board equations, and where calculations that cannot be performed with human intelligence but rather with machine intelligence render human computation an ever-present presence.Bellamy and Boyd describe the ‘dark side’ of the interface: what it represents and conveys about the world is preposterously opaque. What’s more, the dark side doesn’t appear to be benevolent: it’s manifesting as the emergence of new cyberpunk-type socio-political movements, including the rise of massive surveillance states and the militarisation of algorithms. In other words, the interface is a critical mediator of political and socio-economic change</text>

What happens when the interface is made conscious is still a work in progress, and the extent to which it is conscious is a developing field of research.15  As an interface becomes more and more capable of understanding, facilitating, and even being a conduit between the user and the content he desires, the risk of sublimity increases. This is clearly seen in the events of the 1990 international conference on ‘interfaces’ hosted by IEEE and the USPSTF, when the hope was that the symposium would one day culminate in a full-fledged museum. However, the symposium ended up becoming a kind of interactive installation, with the artists creating a kind of interactive ephemera around the proceedings, creating a kind of archiving that would never stop. Indeed, the symposium itself is quite a reverse of the way in which interfaces are traditionally constructed: as something that circumvents the narrative that’s typically constructed around the events that take place inside the device, it</text>

The biennial should not be an outpost of internationalism; it should be an open and present exhibitionary museum with a strong local agenda and a strong, sustainable local mission. It should be a place where the interests of its community of artists, curators, collectors and others align. This is why biennials have distinctive places in theirologies, such as the neo-classical museum, the Guggenheim Museum, which is run by a cooperative of artists and curators, and the early twentieth century museum, which was a joint venture between the New York and Los Angeles Musuemas. It is also why biennials have distinctive places in their local artworlds, such as the Alley Museum, which was started by a local community and is run by a local community of artists and curators. And it is why biennials have distinctive places in their historical and contemporary artworlds, such as the New Museum</text>

The curatorial, however, has a role to play, and so must always take into account the needs and desires of the community, including the needs and desires of power. I see this in the work of the Biennale Commission, which has always taken into account the needs of the local communities, including the needs of power and money. The reality is that power brokers in Venice control the Biennale’s decisions, and so decisions are often made in accordance with the interests of the power brokers. (And sometimes the interests of the power brokers are in conflict with those of the communities making the curatorial decisions, and so on.) For this reason, it is always critical for artists to be present at the Biennale, and to be in constant dialogue with the decisions being made by the Biennale as a whole. One example is the decision to close down the Welsh Streets Muralist Society,</text>

The art world recognises this, and so the biennial receives a boost from this – a fact that is now often cited as a justification for the biennial itself. But the real reason why, as biennials lose their outer appearance, they gain a real cultural significance, and why this is the case no matter where they are located, is precisely because of the incredible growth of the artworld in the years immediately following their respective exhibitions. The art world experienced an unprecedented amount of travel, and so the biennial became what it is today: a collection of collections, organised by geographical area, and now organised around regions. Some might say that the art world today is an exhibitionary world, and so the biennial follows a similar logic, but this is no longer the case. Biennials started off life as collectives, and today they are much more likely to be individualised exhibitions, with curators taking particular note of the needs of</text>

The biennial is a ‘gift from the gods’, in the language of the Native people, and is thus seen as sacred. The community wants to believe in its own miraculousness. In this sense, the biennial is often seen as a source of spiritual meaning and value, even though the institutional support for these kinds of claims rarely seems to meet the needs of the people who create it. But the real miracle of the biennial is that it provides the opportunity for the artist to come home and rest and recharge, to come back to the place where her work first began and to the community where she’s made real history. Without this kind of historical grounding, the biennial could easily regress back to the kind of museum it started from. The biennial is a kind of archaeological dig, and so it reconfigures what is happening in the museum, causing the museum to have to</text>

These are the sites where art is made visible, understood and experienced. But these are secondary, convenient and transient sites. They’re where we actually happen to be at the moment we’re thinking and feeling about, and making, the world around us. And in that sense we should value them for what they reveal about our own present and future positions, but which are constantly filtered through the other. They reveal, for example, that the biennial is, in fact, the last exhibition on the lines of continuity, closure and repetition, since the exhibitionary form is itself, in its contemporary incarnation, deeply problematic. It’s true that the artworld around the biennale is going through what most curators of exhibitions and biennials experience, which is ‘the Mutter’, the recurrent, repetitive feeling that surrounds the art market and the bi</text>

Since the biennial is a ‘materiality’, it must have some kind of appearance and some kind of function in the cultural hierarchy. Biennials don’t have a particular place in the visual arts hierarchy; they’re conspicuous and they get recognized. But they’re a materiality in the art world, and that materiality draws people to art, draws people to art’s potentialities, shapes how we perceive the world. It’s why biennials have budgets of some kinds, but not others. It’s why biennials have curatorial mandates, but also why they have to have a certain level of autonomy within this materiality. And it’s why, as biennials increase in number and size, they have to reduce the number of years, or more, that they spend in museums. The level of autonomy they have within the museum world</text>

It’s a sad fact of contemporary art today, but this is the real life and it happens every day. The biennial has to show that it's a community effort, and it has to show that it has the capacity to bring about change and innovation in a city in which it's presented. If it doesn’t, it’s like the old days in the US when the organiser of a fair brought out the best in the workers and the students and so creating a fair that’s really about you as an artist being recruited by the organiser to do something creative with your art is going to be seen as a counter intuitive and counter-intuitive move. The problem with the biennial today is the same as it was in the 1950s and 1960s: the biennial has become a mega-exhibition that exhibits the important works from the past, reproduces them at an unprecedented scale</text>

The biennial is an episodic museum, and so it has to be continuously (and artfully) reconceived, re-imagined and updated in the same way that art is constantly (and artfully) evolving and constantly (mentally and physically) changing. This is what biennials do best: they take place in familiar places and sites, often in familiar ways, and so they have to be episodic, continuous and present in the same cultural landscape all the time. And this is what art of all kinds, biennial or no biennial, lacks. It doesn’t capture the fullness and depth of cultural history and experience; it doesn’t provide the social, psychological and physical conditions necessary for a culture to grow and change; it doesn’t expose its inhabitants to the full range of experiences and situations that exist; and it most certainly, in the case of a biennial</text>

The biennial is a production line that connects the past, present and future, and so it’s a site of continuous repetition. It’s a site of exchange, and so it’s a place of pilgrimage. But what makes it a place of exchange is something entirely different from what artists typically get out of such exchanges: a place, perhaps, of appreciation or perhaps a microcosm of the history and processes that produced the objects we have today. So how do biennials create their own history and make it relevant in the contemporary world? Recently, this has meant looking at the migration histories of artists and communities in a new light, as part of the exhibition Artist in the Community: Migration and Its Criminal Politics (2016).In this article, I will look at three biennials that gave form to new curatorial approaches, and offer three curatorial approaches to the question that has plagued</text>

These were originally intended to be a way for the artist to manage the relationship with the community, in the same way that families would negotiate housing or tenants negotiate rent. But as biennials have grown in number and variety, and as their local particularities have diversified, so have their legal definitions, and these two worlds have come to interact in unpredictable and ongoing ways. A few artists, including Mark Leckey (better known to Yorkshire audiences as Jo Cox), have adopted a permissive, even laudatory posture towards these new forms of ‘collaboration’. But most artists I know think this is a dangerous, even anti-democratic approach, that undermines the institutions of contemporary art and curatorial priority, and so it falls outside the purview of the biennial. The biennial is an institution, and its legal and political stand-points continue to affect</text>

The decision to share ­design elements with the community came as a surprise to many, including many who worked for the city, who felt that the decision to share was arbitrary and capricious. Councillor Nina Edge, for one, saw it as an attempt to take the design of the venues and façades and inject communities with meaning and imagination through the sharing of design elements. Edge spoke of the ‘possibility that mistakes may be made and that knowledge may be gathered along the way’. She ended her statement by asking: ‘Would you rather have a community think through solutions or an arbitrary chosen ­faction of experts?’ For many in the community, the answer was no; after all, the very act of sharing allowed for the deliberate and strategic sharing of information.

The awareness and engagement with 3D modelling and printing as a method of urbanisation comes as no surprise to Peter Lang, who as Durham City Councilor for the 2011 Olympic and Paralympic Games made the decision to open-source the design of the venues as part of a 'Creative New Apps' project. The project, entitled Distributed OK, is a self-developed self-repairing 3D modelling and printing app that was inspired by the works of Simone Vaughan Coleman and Jeanne Robinson. The names of the artists were taken from a short bio of each other that accompanied the OK screens, and the projects were seen as an opportunity to work collaboratively on a new interface design. 	In a wider perspective, the open-sourcing of the OK screens in 2011 and subsequent democratisation of 3D modelling and printing could be seen as a response to the decimation of urban space during and after the first world wars. The infrastructure of the metropolis was drastically reduced in both scale and life-span by the historical and contemporary wars that ravaged the planet, yet the spectre of environmental destruction still haunted many cities.

The intellectual property for the designs was owned by the city and its partners, and the intellectual property for the carpet and building was owned by a private company. The fact that the intellectual property could be transferred at any time – with no prior notice or comment – was another concern. 	In a nutshell, then, the problem with cities these days is not just an inconvenience or hindrance to people’s circulation – as in the past – but is instead a result of overproduction, urban sprawl and a host of other  	unintended urban developments fuelled by greed and a desire to make a quick buck.

The decision, he said, was driven by the desire to see how 3D modelling and printing might be used in the regeneration of the city. 	The decision to share ­designs and information with the public domain is a decision that clearly demonstrates an awareness of the city’s cultural and historic value, though it is notable that this was not a major concern of the Olympic and Paralympic committee at the time.

At a conference on sustainability in Lisbon in 2015, Engberg spoke about the challenges of replicating the urban fabric with better technologies, and mentioned Machida’s work at a very high level. She explained that as the spaces between people expand in size and shape, sensors no longer monitor people’s heights, but rather the kinetic and electrical properties of objects and people. This raises the possibility that a city’s fabric could be digitally downloaded and made redundant, as opposed to the usual urban model in which structures are in some way ‘preserved’ in relation to the ever-expanding web of connectivity. 	 And in the context of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro’s Opening Ceremony, images of the newly hatched aquatic life – which were projected onto large screens in venues across Brazil – were read out loud to</text>

The application of Machida’s ideas to real-life situations was widespread, and the resulting development of 3D modelling and printing has made it easier than ever to construct elaborate urban environments from scratch, but its potential is also limited. The proliferation of 3D-printed objects – which can be reconfigured at will – also raises the question of what kinds of relations between people and nature might be possible through such means.

The awareness and engagement with 3D modelling and printing as a method of urbanisation comes as no surprise to Peter Lang, who as Durham City Councilor for the 2011 Olympic and Paralympic Games made the decision to open-source the design of the venues and façades of the city.1 It was also a feature of the cultural mobilisation around the games that year, with many arts organisations staging public interventions around the buildings they worked with the city to design. The Chisenhale and Hermes programme funded research into the physical and virtual properties of urban space, especially as it related to the potential for regeneration and the creation of new ways of living in the city. These projects challenged prevailing assumptions about the relation between art and the built environment, with a particular focus on challenges posed by the impact of climate change. Art was a tool rather than an end in itself.2 The biennial format has its problems too. The public is more readily drawn to the supposed authenticity of such claims when it is accompanied by a multimedia exhibition or a performance, and this is generally understood as a desire to understand the underlying politics of the situation rather than to participate in a performance. The public is drawn to claims of authenticity when</text>

Even the  	cover image features a photograph of the proposed Olympic Park taken from a news agency. The decision to share is also supported by a section of the public that sees the open-sourcing of art and design as a way to ‘re-imagine the possibilities of urban renewal’. The section that views the art as a way to ‘re-constitute’ the Olympic Park as a city is the urbanist utopia imagined by Lang.1  But what if the art becomes destructive?

The hybridised form of city infrastructure would be owned by the people – not by the mega-entities, who are often seen as beneficial in their ownership of infrastructure – but by cooperative ­ownership agencies, which would own the land and responsibility for it.

The reports, which collectively referred to as the ‘Megacity 3D Project’, were a response to a local civic-mindedness – or in this case, a civic-mindedness crafted by a local artist – that had emerged as a result of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It was a way to bring attention to a local issue, bring citizens together and empower citizens to take matters of urban development further. 	The reports also sought to identify feasible next steps in the quest for sustainable cities. The first report, 'Toward</text>

The public realm of the biennial is being steadily urbanised, both physically and culturally through a combination of federal, state and territory governments and non-profit arts organisations. The increasing number of museums and galleries, along with the ubiquity of travel and social media, make it increasingly difficult to distinguish a biennial from a regular art exhibition, and the biennial has often been characterised as a shortage of material forms or material items.

While the importance of this moment in the history of art biennials cannot be underestimated, the significance of this moment in the history of art biennials is undetermined.  I would argue that the key to the future of the public realm is a reassessment of the relations between art and urbanisation. Art today operates in cities across the globe, and urbanisation is a constant with art today. In the twentieth century, art was often seen as a neutral tool for the mobilisation of resources and the pursuit of happiness. But a growing body of research now suggests that urbanisation is an inherently political act, and that a healthy distrust of urban resources and the city itself is a critical political and social trait. In these challenging times, it is critical for contemporary artists to develop strategies to inhabit contradictory relations between the urban and the rural,</text>

The public realm is being gradually redefined through the vagaries of globalisation, the pressures of modern urbanisation and the constant need to find the next big thing. While the uncertainties of contemporary urbanisation are real and pressing, the real complexity of the moment is emerging as the contradictions between our present urban infrastructures and the biennials of our age are being pulled apart. Art biennials are in a bind. They’re in a constant state of negotiation with the uncertainties and changes of their environments, and with the power structures that emerge from them. In an effort to remain relevant and creative in the face of this complexity, biennials often struggle to find the right balance between preserving their cultural identity as distinct from modernism, and the complexities of their contemporary contexts. While the identity of the cultural body itself is a fixed, clear thing, the cultural identity of the biennial is a fluid thing that shifts and regresses with the shifting of the world around it.

Today, the public sphere is urbanised and governed by codes, regulations and institutions that monitor, control and influence behaviour in ways that are far beyond the pale. These data-mining operations are fuelled by data-mining operations that collect and compile huge amounts of information about people – where and how they live – in ways that are invisible, yet impactful.

The uncertainty surrounding the biennial in both the local and the national media is palpable, but the biennial as an entity is the wrong place for the public to be located. The public sphere is being systematically re-constituted in the interests of a financial firm and its board of trustees. The public school is being systematically re-educated about the importance of infrastructure and urban development. And the media are being encouraged to follow suit. The media may well end up reporting the news in ways that shape local communities and the biennial as a whole, but their initial reporting may well be informed by the interests of many different stakeholders. When the biennial is no longer a financial service to the city and its citizens, its interests may shift to those of the financial firm, but it is important for the news media to continue to follow the information before it is available to the public, and to offer different perspectives on the same information.

It heralds a moment when artists will be able to move from the museum to the street and from the biennial to the post-biennial period. It heralds a period when a city organ will be able to commission a full-scale architectural survey of its metropolis. It heralds a change in the regulatory regime that depends on money and power. But most of all, it heralds a moment in which a city will be able to dish out, with surprising efficiency, the urban transformation its citizens have demanded for decades.

    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial, then, is the ideal situation for a cultural organisation to reside, to continue to provide a base for further cultural activity, and to contribute to creating a more ethically participatory form of art form through exhibition and seminar running in the city. The problem with biennials is that they are temporary – they come and go – and in the meantime they contribute to generating ongoing representations of the city (and the city systems that support them), which in turn generate further representations of the city (and the city systems that support them) in various media forms (including, but not limited to, literature, movies, songs, architecture, street art, festivals, tours etc). The question remains whether the museum would be able to provide the necessary historical and archival materials and datasets to allow such important cultural activities to take place in a participatory and/or socially responsive way.

I would like to explore this possibility in the coming weeks and months, while the Liverpool Biennial is housed in the amazing new (yet gentrified) Biennial Centre, located a few doors down from the museum and around the corner from the Cains Brewery complex.  Whether or not the museum would be able to contribute in any way in the way of curating the show, the question remains how the show would be delivered and what would happen if it did. For this to happen, the biennial would have to be able to produce, present and manage an event that people attending could participate in, and which would be memorable for others. I have already been in negotiations with Liverpool Biennial (curatorial role), about who should be able to observe and participate in the show. Curators will be able to observe the show as it happens, and create or alter it as they please. So, even though the show will be delivered by professional artists, there is a question of authorship still.  As always, the</text>

I would like to explore this possibility in more depth in a future issue of Stages, but first I would like to ask you to imagine for a moment the possible situation if (when?) the 2021 Liverpool Biennial happens.  I want to suggest that the question of how cultural resources are distributed worldwide, and especially in the cities where biennials are taking place, is of great relevance to our times. Cities with a biennial in their title or catalogue, or regularly commissioning an exhibition based on a work exhibited in a biennial, are more globalized than those without. Therefore, if we are looking for a ‘cultural monolith’, we must also be vigilant against what I would call ‘culturally specific knowledge capture’. This is a conundrum for biennials, which is precisely what artworks like Murali Provan’s Massive Man, Mark Miodownik’s The Windup Girl, Elizabeth Graham’s Women of</text>

We live in a city and our city is a cultural organisation. So, in a way, biennials are cultural institutions in their own right, and contribute to the problems of the city. But there are other cultural institutions that also need to be engaged with in a sustained and diverse way. And these other cultural institutions may include, but are not limited to: museums, curators, artists' unions, heritage commissions etc. The important thing is that they are engaged with in a socially responsive way. That is, engaging with the city in such a way as to generate knowledge and knowledge-producing capacity rather than merely knowledge-producing capacity (which is the current mode of cultural capital in this country).The identification of the '20s and the fall of man' is perhaps the single most quoted and adum</text>

The two organisations’ collective vision is that of a museum that engages with and contributes to the social and political struggles of the community it serves, and that in doing so contributes to creating a more ethically participatory museum culture through its programme of cultural education and historic preservation.  In 2014, the museum was one of the targets of a major cultural hygiene exercise, Examining Curating's Behaviour, organised by the Liverpool Biennial. The exercise sought to identify and address problematic behaviours in the museumary community, and in particular, to identify and address problematic practices in the wider</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial, then, is the ideal situation for a cultural organisation to reside, to continue to provide a base for further cultural activity, and to contribute to creating a more ethically participatory form of art form through exhibition and seminar running in the city. The problem with biennials is that they are temporary – they come and go – and in the meantime they contribute to generating ongoing representations of the city (and the city systems that support them), which in turn generate further representations of the city (and the city systems that support them) in various media forms (including, but not limited to, literature, movies, songs, architecture, street art, festivals, tours etc). The question remains whether the museum would be able to provide the necessary historical and archival materials and datasets to allow such important cultural activities to take place in a participatory and/or socially responsive way. It is my contention that it would. Yet, perhaps there is some way left on this score. I would like to explore this possibility in more depth in the coming weeks and months.In the meantime, let me introduce you to some of the people you’ll be meeting soon at MAPS (Middle East and North Africa) – Dont Karem, Elad Hazan, Adnan Khashoggi, Ahmed Jamal.Dont Karem is a Ph.D. candidate in Art History and Palestine Studies at McGill University, and holds a Bachelor of Arts in English Cultural Studies from McGill University, and a minor in French Cultural Studies from Concordia University in Montreal. His dissertation examines the 1971 Paris Commune, and the curatorial role of Max Horkheimer and other European intellectuals in organizing the event as a form of civil disobedience. Elad Hazan is an Assistant Professor in Art History and Popular Culture Studies at McGill University, and holds a Master’s degree in the subject area.

I sought to understand how the museum could contribute to creating a new artistic paradigm through its curatorial work. I wanted to know what kinds of possibilities artistic curators had for imagining the possibilities of the future through their curatorial work. I looked to see if there were any biennials that were similarly prescient about the future, or even about contemporary art in the present. I wanted to know what kinds of possibilities curatorial methods offered to imagining the future through curatorial work, and whether these curatorial methods offered any real alternative to the present.I also wanted to know what kinds of capacities the curatorial body had for envisioning the future through its curatorial methods. I wanted to know whether the curatorial method could be considered art, and whether it could be considered science. I wanted to</text>

I see this work as particularly pertinent in the age of the biennial, which is often characterised by a kind of migrant flow. The biennial has become the most visible venue for this kind of movement, with artists, curators and art collectors flooding into cities from all over the world, and bringing with them a kind of cultural capital to anchor their projects in. In my opinion, this is particularly true in the age of social media, which makes it easier than ever for a biennial to declare itself ‘global’ and present ‘questions and answers’ in a globalised version of itself. Given the importance of this kind of language and cultural capital to contemporary forms of capitalism, it is easy to forget that the biennial was originally a small scale undertaking by curators and artists in</text>

It is my contention that it would. Yet, perhaps there is some way left on this score. I would like to explore this possibility in more detail in a future journal.In the meantime, here are a few ideas on how a potential museum of contemporary art could work with its local community:The first is the pedagogical model, which ties together the museum, gallery, gallery education and youth groups. This would be a good model for a community gallery, as it directly engages with the materiality of art and its cultural production on a local and regional level. It would also tie into current curatorial practices and theories of exhibition and seminar running, which are showing a marked upsurge in the number and variety of subjects and running times. A possible pedagogical model for a future community gallery would also tie into current art trend lines, such as the on-trending ‘glamour shot’ and the growing use of social media in social interaction. Given the recent scandals surrounding the behaviour of local artists and the curatorial roll, it is worth noting that in the last edition of the Venice Bi</text>

It is my contention that it would. Yet, perhaps there is some way left on this score. I would like to explore this possibility in more depth in another lecture, for sure.In the meantime, we can consider some other possibilities: museums in the city might become platforms for socially engaged or environmentally conscious cultural activity, the latter perhaps being defined as activities in which materials and methods are created and consumed in a place, not necessarily in a globally visible way. Such a development would not only be good for the environment, but it would also create a forum for critical and discourseative exchange between localities, between workers and their management of the city, and between artist and local communities. I would like to think that the museum might play a more active role in this new context of shared and collective experiences, and in generating new kinds of art.I would also like to suggest that there are ways in which architecture and its social and political implications might be altered through such cultural practices. For instance, the democratisation of space and the social consumption of materials through the democratisation of building and material consumption might lead to a new kind of</text>

I would like to explore this possibility in the context of Liverpool’s future plans for its Cultural Capital.Doubtless, this could include cultural districts within or adjacent to the city. I’m thinking of district X, which is currently home to the recently concluded Liverpool Biennial. X includes the former site of the Liverpool and South London Railway, which in turn was the site of several station houses before being acquired by the London and South East Railway in 1888. I’m curious about the development of your ideas for the neighbourhood, and about what might be possible if artists, curators, writers, collectors and others took the time to construct and design a cultural district around the railway tracks and terminals?Doubtless, the district would have to be large enough to host a major art gallery, and have to be contiguous with other districts or ‘covered districts’ of the city. I would also like to explore the need for specialised cultural institutions to be established in the district, and to establish relationships</text>

Their research focused on the city’s infrastructure – critical infrastructure – and how it is connected to the city�s development – a process that they hoped would lead to a more sustainable future for the district. They also proposed a series of actions to further the city’s sustainability through their proposed ‘Future City Initiative’. The project was supported by the New England Society for Experimental Biology (NEES), as well as the Old Mose Scholarship Fund. The partnership between MIT and Columbia University is notable for the way in which it incorporated community members into the design process, through an exploratory public-private partnership model. The researchers working with the artist on the project were not employed by the university but instead by the New England Society for Experimental Biology (NEES), which organises its members around research-oriented activities. This model offers greater flexibility in the kinds of employment and compensation that can be provided, and the kinds of relationships that can be forged, through a postdoctoral or research-intensive programme.

Their research focused on the city’s infrastructure – critical infrastructure – and how it is connected to the city�s development, especially in the form of new buildings and transport infrastructure. The findings from this research allowed the creative class to question infrastructure and its regeneration in a multi-modal and multi-platform way. The system that was being designed to regenerate the Mose could be reconfigured to support a cooperative housing and social enterprise, as well as new types of housing and social enterprises.

The findings of their research project were presented at the Old Mose District Council’s Community Land Trust conference, where they were supported by the New Mose Development Corporation and the New Mose Foundation. As a result, the district was given a new lease on life. This collaborative research project also brought together researchers with different disciplines, such as architecture, urban and regional planning, geography and geology, architecture and materials, and even psychology. The result was a collection of research papers that became the basis for a major publication that was later edited and published in a regional architectural journal. The research process and the research paper were co-administered by the Mose Digital Archive and the Mose Digital Archive, as well as the New Mose Development Corporation and the New Mose Foundation.

However, the presence of these companies is not mentioned anywhere in the document. What is mentioned is the historical relationship between the Old Mose and the development done in the area, and the role played by the City of Portland in that development. The presence of the companies is clearly indicated in the research that was done on the city’s behalf. The presence of these companies in the letter is not a historical fact but a situation that can be exploited by those with a financial stake in the area. For example, the letter states that</text>

If the core isn’t strong, the substation will fall.� This statement was repeated over and over again, in different contexts, by different audiences, until finally, in 2016, the entire substation was dismantled and rebuilt with a new mayor’s office that shared the Old Mose district with the neighbouring MTF district.

They also looked at the city’s cultural institutions – an artistic form with significant resources – and how they are influenced by the infrastructure they are installed within. The researchers found that the more culture there is around an object or concept, the more likely it is to be shared, appreciated and connected. The researchers believe that in a city with a rich cultural history and rich natural resources, ‘meaningful exchange’ can occur between citizens through the sharing of things – knowledge, objects and practices. They also believe that a city with a vibrant arts and humanitarian tradition can and should support such an exchange through cultural exchange.

The Turks’ decision to arm themselves with military hardware and plunge into the Syrian civil war is being condemned by Western governments as a mistake, to be exploited by the fanatical fundamentalist elements within the Turkish military. There is a growing consensus that the Syrian crisis should be solved through negotiations between the Syrian government and opposition forces, rather than through the violent conquest of territory by a Sunni extremist Islamist movement. It has become clear that negotiation will not solve the problem, only exacerbate it and pave the way for a full-scale war. It is time for the United States and Turkey to start negotiating directly with the Syrian government rather than playing chicken with the opposition. This may involve arming the moderate Syrian opposition, which is widely supported by the United States and Turkey, or inviting the moderate opposition to join forces with them against radical Islamist elements within the Syrian government. Either option would bring a range of complications and risks, including the risk of creating a proto-state alongside Iraq</text>

These were not isolated incidents. Secret service agents regularly visited the homes of Turkish artists and their companies and organised cultural events there. They arrested numerous artists and organised performances by Turkish organisations in the US. They even collaborated with a Turkish company called Ar-Chamakh to set up a cultural centre in Istanbul. The Turkish government has consistently denied involvement in the 2015 Gezi Park protests – aversion to which, it is true, is frequently asserted.But the presence of high-ranking government officials, including at the highest levels, in a close relationship with a company or organisation that is engaged in the production of state repression is a pattern that should alarm us. It is not just that such relationships weaken accountability; they actively promote it. The complicity of artists and organisations in state violence is often overstated. The complicity of citizens in state violence is much more difficult to quantify and</text>

The Turkish government has actively promoted a version of historical narratives about the 1915 Armenian genocide that is completely at odds with the reality of the events. Inventing National Persecution of Armenians in Turkey controversy, which was based on a completely fabricated story, is a good example of this kind of thinking. The 1915 Armenian massacre is widely considered to have taken place, but claims of guilt have proven extremely difficult to disprove. The fact that the AKP is attempting to whitewash the massacre by claiming that the government is somehow to blame while simultaneously attempting to criminalise critical thinking about the event seems to me like a kind of perverse hybrid of complicity. The Turks’ claim that they were defending themselves against an ‘eradication of civilisation’ while simultaneously attempting to criminalise critical thinking about their own system of authority.</text>

The attempted military intervention in Syria by the government of President Bashar al-Assad is being massively undermined by the downgrading of oil prices, which have forced the government to halt construction projects and re-tool its economy. Meanwhile, thirsty populations around the globe are being overtaxed by national insufficiencies. The crisis in Ukraine is fuelling an armed separatist movement that is also seeking to expand into Georgia and Azerbaijan. The crisis in Ukraine is making global headlines, but little is being said about the USG’s role in this crisis. Inevitably, the USG is involved in a downgrading of oil prices, too.In a way, the crisis in Ukraine is making us aware of a kind of complicity that is still ongoing in the international system.

The Turkish government, through a partnership with the American-based company, Cornerstone Partners, is developing a Digital Transformation Centre (DTX) that will house data from around 500 million citizens into one of the largest collections of privately held pieces of infrastructure ever assembled. DTX is planned as a new level of administrative complexity for the country, one that will facilitate the collective interpretation of data in ways that are opaque and prevent citizens from understanding the full picture. It is anticipated that this new level of complexity will make the country &quot;the most connected nation in the world’s fourth largest economy’s largest urban centres.1  The question that arises is what kind of administrative complexity is planned for the city? How will the DTX interact with existing modes of urban development and production? What kinds of protections will be put in place to prevent such transformations from happening?

The AK Party government is intent on massively overcrowding the nation’s already over-crowded shelters, turning them into gargantuan metropolises where people from every walk of life live in micro-apartments. These policies have been described as ‘devastating’ to the city’s fragile urban fabric, and are in fact only serving to increase the city’s fragility. But if the goal of this kind of urban reclamation is to make the city beautiful again then the corollary to this kind of economic colonization is that the corollary must be neither beautiful nor human. The corollary to this kind of de-humanization is death. That is, if the capitalist interests of the city are going to permit this kind of urban growth in this way.

The extent to which the state is able to subvert art’s political potential through such economic means is unclear, however, and a related question is how far the state is able to subvert the artist’s political potential with such manipulation.  The Turkish government has actively promoted a neoliberal economic agenda that exploits all segments of society while neglecting to provide any support to those struggling under its economic tap.  The AK Party is the official state party of Turkey and wields considerable political and economic power.  The AKP has been in power for almost nine years and thus has substantial institutional memory.  The AKP holds significant amounts of funding from foundations and other wealthy individuals.  So while the current unrest in Turkey may be exploitative and enjoyable to some, it is deeply problematic for much of what makes the art world in Turkey tick. Making matters worse is the fact that many of the young men who are engaged in fighting in the Syrian</text>

The state organises, creates, maintains a cultural infrastructure in the interests of national identity. The market organises in the interests of capital. The market seeks out artists whose works will be pleasing to capital, and will fetch a profit for the state when they are state-owned assets. And so the state creates, funds and operates a sector that is almost entirely devoted to advertising itself.The state organises culture, funds and creates a market for itself – and then says that this was all done in the name of national security. In other words, the state actively participates in creating images of itself in order to please a diverse range of stakeholders, including but not limited to: the gallery industry, tourism, state-owned companies, wealthy citizens, tourists, academics, tourists’ groups, politicians, collectors, PR firms, tourists’ groups, tourists’ canteen, and on and on.The twentieth century is a long, long way</text>

The narrative that the Turkish state is trying to impart to the international community regarding the events of August 15 is one of calm non-violent diffuse social change. This narrative is being promulgated by the state media and academic institutions but also by the university level broadcasting media including radio and television. It is being applied in places such as Istanbul where students and academics are being detained in an atmosphere of increasingly aggressive pro-government propaganda. It is being actively undermined by a state that is actively working to undermine it through violence and repression. The question at the moment is whether, with some representation of international solidarity and other strengths, the Turkish state is justified in attempting to subvert the will of the people by using violence and repression to implement a neoliberal project. If so, we could potentially learn something from this situationally based creative class negotiation.In this crisis of the urban, we’ve seen a tendency towards the hyper-mapping of urban and suburban environments.</text>

In attempting to identify the men responsible for the Istanbul bombings, Turkish authorities arrested over 2,000 people across the country under suspicion that they were part of a terrorist network. Most of these people were involved in organising refugees and in providing them with basic necessities, but a government reorganisation of the labour force is also evident in the construction and music industries in urban areas where the threat from radical Islam is greatest. It is obvious that the arrest of 2,000 people in a city such as Istanbul is possible only if these people are thought of as suspects and if there is some kind of co-conspiracy theory that will justify whatever action is taken. If there is no such conspiracy theory then such a high number of arrests does not seem like a lot, but when made against a threat level of 6 (which is the maximum for the EU), these actions are suspect and potentially unlawful.

What I want to do is to go underground, to projects like this, and start creating non-conformist subcultures that are very resistant to change, very resistant to change and adaptive to whatever is thrown at them. The challenge is to work within that context, but also to intervene constructively through what I can only describe as ‘cultural terrorism’.  So, the question that I get asked a lot is, ‘What if?’ The answer is always the same: what if the community isn’t ready? What if the authorities intervene? And the answer is always the same: do something radical and uncomfortable and uncomfortable and hope for the best. But the question becomes: what are the assets that are going to allow us to weather those storm clouds? And the answer to that is: cultural capital. Cultural capital is a concept that was developed at the London School of Economics, specifically with the support of Arts Council England. It’s a building block of what the arts community traditionally has relied on: venues, books, tapes, performances, performances, performances. Without that kind of bedrock, nothing else would have been possible. So the question becomes: what are the capacities of the arts community, especially at a very</text>

The challenge is to work within that context and, if I can put it simply, to work within that context in an interesting way.  In the context of the community, I want to work with artists to create new art forms that are participatory, adaptive and engage people’s brains. The idea is to allow creative people to shine through, and in the end, that’s what art is all about. Creative people are the ones that are going to change the world. This is an incredible disempowering notion to begin with, but I’m hopeful that some of the projects we’re putting together could nevertheless end up empowering communities. As an artist and a creator of art, my primary job is to maximize the capacities of people to take part in art as a productive act. To me, that’s all that matters.  But what I’ve also recognised is that there is a huge disconnect between the levels of government and the people they serve, and that is</text>

The challenge is to work within that context, to see what comes out of that. TOD: The fact that it’s being done by an organisation like Real Time LA, which is not a corporation, but is a non-profit organisation with a social mission, also seems unnecessary. It’s being done as a shift in the timescale. A lot of what’s being proposed is quite radical. A lot of people involved in the project are artists themselves, and while there can be some tension at times, they’re trying to create something new and interesting out of what they perceive as a very conservative and hierarchical art world. A lot of the criticism of the project is that it doesn’t take into account the fact that it’s being done by an organisation like that, that it’s being done in the context of a social enterprise, and that it’s being done in the public sphere. Do you agree with that analysis? MA: I’ve always</text>

The challenge is to work within that context, and to develop other kinds of institutions that can support those kinds of projects. So something like the Real Time LA project could be an organisational construct that develops out of the community, or it could develop out of the gallery? It’s entirely possible that the art institution that develops out of such an initiative would become a gallery, or a museum, or a gallery institution, or even a community arts organisation. And that would be the beautiful thing about collaboration: if it develops out of the community, it becomes part of the fabric of the community, and that’s what I look for in collaborative projects: that is, if it develops from the community out, in a way that’s supportive of the goals and objectives of the gallery, museum or art institution that I lead. The key is that it has to be collaborative, and that’s what I mean when I say ‘Community Art’. When you create an organisation like that,</text>

The challenge is to work within that context and bring a different kind of understanding of art and culture to those communities.  What we wanted to do with Real Time LA was to create a hybrid space that allows the artist-centred component to exist alongside the cooperative and not be seen as a second-class citizen. I would define that way of thinking as ‘cultural capital’. The cooperative is going to be the capital of the future, and the future of the cooperative is going to be the capital of the cooperative.  How do you create a hybrid space that permits the arts to thrive in a different time and place? I think the answer to that is going to be different for each community. If you’re talking about a city or a region, you’re talking about a geographic area that’s homogenous and homogenous. There’s going to be a lot of immigration from the places where you live now, and there’s going to be a lot of immigration</text>

The challenge is to work within that context, to engage those communities that are already there and to find ways to intervene strategically and creatively in the process. I think the way to do that is to be creative and imaginative, and to let culture take over the process, not to be traditional environmentalists and take it away from the people who are already creating it and using it to meet new demands and needs.  Real-time LA is a great example of an artist-led community-based project that operates on a day-to-day basis. The idea is to create a sense of surprise and create anticipation before the project is actually delivered. In other words, it’s about creating opportunities and opportunities for anticipation before the work is actually delivered, so that when the work is there, people can use it and make use of it. The language of ‘innovation is an inherently negative thing’, and so the idea is to create opportunities and opportunities for the worst in society to exploit.  There are a number</text>

The challenge is to work within that context, and to find creative ways to situate ourselves in that new social and spatial framework. Real Time LA is a great example of an artist-centred project that has managed to connect with a community of neighbours, even though it’s a new kind of co-production. You don’t need an artist to come in, and you don’t need an artist to make a difference. It’s a decision that was taken by the city of Los Angeles alone, and it’s going to be really interesting to see how this project evolves.  	As an artist, I’m interested in seeing what happens when artists come together. I’m interested in seeing what kinds of connections we can make, how we can create new ways of organising ourselves and creating our lives. That is, of course, if those new ways don’t contaminate what is already going on. 	Creating a hybrid culture is also a way</text>

The key is to find ways to work with people who are already in this situation, who have their own set of skills and ideologies but don’t have the social or political power or institutional knowledge to actually change this situation. Time and again, artists have said things like ‘We’ll change things when we get power, but until then we need to negotiate our way out of this mess’.  In terms of policy, the challenge for me is to find ways to work with people who already have a stake in this neighbourhood or in the project. I’m not going to get paid to be an artist and I’m not going to change the city’s landscape by coming up with innovative ways to make housing more attractive or creating a social impactment project.

The challenge is to work within that context, and not try to impose a particular artistic or social vision or vision or discourse on those who are already pre-existing, who have jobs, families, and communities.  As an example of how artists can participate in this, imagine if, every time a new project was started in the area, artists’ collective members’ pent-up frustrations were channeled into creating a new art project in the area, or organising a community fair or something similar. The challenge is to channel that energy into something more practical, something that serves the area and its people. In the area itself, there are already organisations like the Arts Council of Los Angeles, which could step in and offer a range of services and resources. Artists might want to consider starting their own organisation, because the resources and programmes available to them would be radically different from those of a local organisation.

The collection consists of artefacts from the Museum of Modern Art, New York, including works made in Mexico, Cuba, Egypt, Greece, Persia and India. The collection also includes objects from the Cairo Museum of Art, Egypt, which was founded in 1844 and dedicates itself to the study of the arts, music, and language. Its aim is to acquire the objects, whatever they are, that form part of a permanent collection. It does not consider cultural heritage or value systems.

Such elements of ‘human language’ could be understood in different ways, and thus machine learning could be applied to understand grammars of different kinds. For example, the grammars of human language are written down, and are often repeated across generations – individuals naming themselves after parts of the speech – but to understand how to write such grammars, one would need to have access to databases capable of storing such instances of ‘human language’. Such databases exist in labs, but they are written in a computer programming language that is difficult to parse into sentences, and understandable only as fragments across generations. On the other hand, the grammars of computer programming are much more malleable: they can be broken into smaller units, and interpreted into different ‘representations’ of human language, but this only works if the programming languages are well-structured and have good defaults. For human language to be understood in this way, programmers need to be able to predict with</text>

Such elements of machine learning are deeply embedded in the fabric of how we think about language, and cannot be removed. Yet it is easy to see how this third leg of the equation could intersect with the second and third legs of the first equation: humans are the third leg of the first equation, and data are the third and fourth parameters. A growing body of research suggests that the relationships between language resources, labour and economic productivity are more complex than previously thought. These studies highlight the fact that humans have a second, tertiary leg – labour resources – that is dependent on the existence of language but is also affected by the movement of labour (labor mobility) and exchange (labor exchange). Human language emerges as a direct result of the interactions between human labour and the elements of the landscape that create human labour (earth, labour, language, images and so on). The social construction of language is a project that we have been constructing as a social relationship between humans and the elements of the landscape that create the social</text>

Such elements of ‘deep learning’ could be applied not just to textiles and data mining, but to modelling and cybernetics as well. This raises the question: how can we imagine new algorithms that do more than sit by and do what humans tell them to do? This raises the question of social implications, and the sense of what it means to be human in these new ‘deep learning’ systems.The answer is that we don’t know. This is why progress is measured in cycles: despite the billions of words that humans write each year, the amount of textiles produced by a person walking down the street is phenomenally small. Even with Big Data – the ever expanding catalogue of data points that computers crunch every day – this number is still dwarfed by the amount of manual labour that goes into producing that textiles. If the processing of textiles is automated, then the production of textiles is also automated, and not just in the sense that machines read textiles</text>

Such elements of ‘machine learning’ are not new, but the kinds of powerful algorithms that have allowed organizations like Facebook to construct powerful digital interfaces, and allow self-driving cars to avoid accidents, are still relatively new.In fact, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg is only one of many inventors of ‘deep learning’ technologies that have sprung up in response to the proliferation of data. Software developers, academics, engineers and others have been developing similar kinds of cognitive augmentations for years, and large organisations – which are themselves increasingly data-driven – have been adding them to their workforces. In my view, there are three main types of deep learning algorithms: those that I have labelled ‘Intelligence Notions’ and those that I have labelled ‘Extraction Notions’. Intelligence Notions are those that deal with abstract concepts like knowledge, intelligence and so on; Intelligence Notions are those that deal with individuals (like humans) and so on.

It is a process of creating meaning through data – creating meaning through what Meehan Crist calls ‘the binge reading of data’ – and this is what LJOY is all about.

Such elements of ‘human language’ – what linguists call ‘deep learning’ – are becoming more and more important in our societies.Linguists have long known that language is a social construction. The development of language is a social process that begins with early childhood cues, and continues into adulthood. But the social functions of language are still very much a part of the myth of linear progress that machine learning is trying to reconcile. Linguists have long known that there is a huge difference between child and adolescent linguistic capacity. But the social origins of language are still poorly understood. In fact, linguists don’t really know what adolescent language means. It is a social construction, and as such, it is prone to failure. In the past, cultures with a strong institutionalised ‘hereditary’ understandings of language typically have extremely elaborate grammars that prescribe what can and cannot be said in the language. But as linguists have gained more sophisticated tools for analysing</text>

The recognisable forms of human language could be further broken into smaller units, and these smaller units interpreted into different ‘representations’ of the same ‘language’, as different units perform different kinds of labour. Such elements of ‘human language’ are elements of a relational conceptual schema that endows humans with certain kinds of agency. The question is what kind of relational schema endows humans with the capacities to organise and generate meaning? One possibility is that ‘human language’ is embedded in a structured set of rules that derive from a shared understanding of what is meant by ‘human language’. Such a shared understanding of what is meant by human language would make it possible to read and understand human language as an image or set of images, and to do things such as categorise and classify images. The ability to read and understand human language could render human labour obsolete, and lead to new kinds of work that are based on data and imagery, and not just on the labour of the very skilled linguists and image analysts who create and interpret that language.A third scenario envisages the emergence of ‘deep learning’ – machines that understand the structures of language – and its applications in a variety</text>

Such elements of ‘human language’ could be understood to generate certain kinds of modelling. There are of course many practical limits to how much this can be done, and how interpretable that understanding would be, but at least one can be said to derive from what we might call ‘deep learning’.Deep learning is the branch of artificial intelligence research that deals with the mechanisms that underpin linguistic inference. Linguists have long known that images train themselves – recognising features and structures based on cues provided by data – but how exactly this happens is still an open question. Computers have ways of automatically learning – learning to recognise patterns – but this leads to certain kinds of circular reasoning that can end up generating undesirable outcomes. For example, the image of a bird training its chicks to spot a car using images of buildings and road networks seems tractable: the algorithms that guide the network are trained to detect patterns, and the networks that control the car are also trained to spot those patterns.

Such elements of ‘machine learning’ could be applied not only to data extraction and machine translation, but also to language understanding and social networking (SNS) – systems that gather data about the world through devices to infer ‘representations’ of the world around them. In this sense, networks are not just the interface between devices and the underlying systems that issue the devices, but also perform other kinds of labour including gathering and digesting data, organising it and creating infrastructures and infrastructures of their own. Languages do not simply map locations to ‘places’ – they also map labour and its aspects, from the factory into the home and beyond. Thus, breaking locations into smaller units called ‘cultures’ and assigning meaning to these labour forms becomes an important task, alongside the more obvious tasks of mapping the globe and constructing new infrastructures. In fact, breaking locations into smaller ‘cultures’ seems to go beyond the capacity of current</text>
    <text>extends the proposition to machines, and extends it to data. This is the second leg of the second equation: how to account for the data when it is generated and manipulated (in a machine’s sense, at least).Machine learning is the discipline that deals with the third and fourth parameters – the algorithm, the data and the decision – and this is where the similarities end. The algorithms that we use to analyse data, collect data and extract data generate certain properties that are highly interpretable. For example, recognising human intelligence requires the construction of algorithms that can parse human language into meaningful chunks. In principle, this could be done with existing scientific computing tools, but due to the nature of human language, human language is inherently interpretable into other forms of human understanding. The recognisable forms of human language could be further broken into smaller units, and these smaller units interpreted into different ‘representations’ of the same ‘language’, as different units perform different kinds of labour. Such elements of ‘machine learning’ could be applied to other kinds of data, including natural language and historical texts.The question of who counts as ‘human’ and who counts as ‘data’ in this context inevitably generates tensions. On the one hand, we can recognise individuals as ‘data’ in this context: Google’s Daydream View uses facial recognition to identify individuals within a scene, and music to identify groups of tracks. On the other, we can also recognise datasets – the data that is generated by the algorithms that control data collection and extraction, and that creates ‘representations’ and ‘levels’ of meaning. The tensions generated by this double sense – the construction of abstract human intelligence (AI) on top of what is already a much more concrete world – are immense.AI could theoretically make it easier for individuals to attain knowledge of events that take place in the world around them, and could even enable individuals to exercise agency over their</text>

When, as it is currently engaged in stripping away at least some of those layers of cultural complexity and poverty that have been piling up for decades, it is engaged in the actualisation of those same contradictory forms of power and wealth. Biennials have emerged, by and large, as a postscript to the original neglect and degradation of contemporary art and culture worldwide. The 2008 Mumbai Biennale provided some clues as to what might be expected from the upcoming 2016 iteration, but there has been little in the way of elaboration on the new urban forms that are to be found in that vast, globalised and technologically challenged metropolis. 	The biennial as a postscript, then, might now be useful as a response to a changed global urbanisation that is being brought about by the technocratic state, but it is also a space for imaginative and unexpected and sometimes extraordinary and even magical thinking and creating. It is a place where people come to reckon with, and create new ways of looking at, past urbanity, at a time when that has all but ceased to be an element of urban</text>

When, as it is currently engaged in stripping away at least some of those layers of cultural complexity and poverty, it is a temporal arena for the exchange of places, it is a space for the exchange of power. Biennials do not come cheaply: recent estimates put the value of a typical exhibition in the US at over $100 million. But they also come with a condition: a condition that many artists and art institutions could not possibly meet. That condition is a condition of institutional life itself. Biennials are social forms, and social contradictions are bound to some extent to be parts of them. But they are institutions, and institutions are contradictions. 	Arguably, the foremost contradiction in the biennial condition is the one between the museum and the biennial, between the biennial and the particular. And yet this contradiction is becoming ever more pronounced, along with the other social contradictions. What is becoming increasingly obvious is that the biennial is a space for the exchange of places, as distinct from the exchange of things: of art and of commerce. And this means that it</text>

When, as it is currently engaged in stripping away at least some of those layers of cultural complexity and poverty, it is engaged in the conservation of spaces and their contents, it is a place of passive consumption, of consumption in which the public is invited into a kind of shared space of nothingness. When it is engaged in the promotion of a particular tourism product, it is engaged in the making of a kind of pleasure for the public that is neither tourist-producing nor a cut above the rest of the tourism package. When it is an art project, it is both the art project itself and its art’s expected social function – the pleasure produced by the public is always going to be a ‘tourism’, in the language of the biennial – a kind of social contract between society and the art is governed by the biennial as a whole. 	In short, the public is invited into the making of a kind of public space that is neither tourist-producing nor a cut above the rest of the tourism package.

It is, in other words, actively engaged in the politics of poverty and homelessness.  	In the case of the major biennials of the twentieth century (the Venice Biennale, the New York World Fair, the Tate Modern and the Tate Britain) that occurred in the years immediately following World War II, the emergence of the biennial as a public space coincided with the emergence of that public as a political concept. In a 2006 survey of the ten major biennials of the twentieth century, historian Peter Osborne finds them estranged from their beginnings as ‘public squares’ into ‘public museums’, which he defines as places that display artifacts or objects from the past in an accessible way.3 So the Venice Biennale and the Tate Modern both hoped to initiate a</text>

And when, as is happening in many parts of the world, the biennial is engaged in the promotion of a particular global capitalist system, in that case it is engaged in the very formation of that capitalist system, and not in some abstract, non-capitalist, ideal form of (collectivist) ‘capital accumulation’. 	When the biennial is a spatialisation of a capitalist system, it is engaged in the maintenance of globalisable, post-capitalist relations between the museum and the capitalist world. And this involves making sure that the museum is recognised as a legitimate place, while the rest of the world seems to recognise the museum as legitimate, albeit in ways that are not yet mutually exclusive.

The biennial is both the object of its own historical trajectory and the subject of its own ephemeral form. 	The biennial has a particular, though perhaps not universal, use-value in and among the younger generations, and that is to be admired. It is a transient, transient, capitalising form, in short, a form that is ever on the lookout for ways to produce surplus, to borrow from the Romantics, who saw the biennial as a source of creative work in the wake of the First Opium War (1839–45), and whose immortal lines, ‘Roman legion, twice over, once upon a dime’ mark the ephemeral.1 	The biennial has a particular, though perhaps</text>

So we see the inner-city and its poverty, the blighting of communities by the university campus project, the gentrification of neighbourhoods, the creation of multi-unit housing developments, the machinations of corporate raider networks, the surveillance of communities, the takeover of community facilities, the militarisation of law enforcement and the wild offshoring of sectors of the economy. We also see the overflow of migrant workers from places like China, used as cheap labour on projects that then mutate into full-fledged business enterprises, the migration of billions of dollars' worth of fixed capital, the massive internal displacement of populations as economies shift to other sectors of the globe, and the emergence of multiverses of exchange based on exchanges between commodities and labour.

When, as is happening in the United Kingdom, it is engaged in the economic production of poverty and insecurity, it is engaged in the production of social contradiction and inequality. When it is a place of rage and destruction, its real estate development and consumption habits are the direct production of war.

When, as is happening in the Bay of Bengal, it is engaged in the production of social contradiction and inequality, then that is when the contradictions will manifest and allow for the organisation of resistance. </text>

When it is no longer a ‘place of place’, it is a place of no presence. It is, in short, a place of destruction. 	But what is a biennial for a set of these destinations? And what does that entail when those same destinations no longer wish to be associated with such a concept? Consider, for example, the case of Israel and the West Bank.

But the critical lack of listening to the arts (other than as a result of a given biennial, biennial convention, or museum show) means that art’s presence, no matter how essential and weighty and important it may be, remains ambiguous and unfulfilled. There is, for instance, no such thing as the Boston Arts Festival, as there is for other kinds of knowledge; there is no such thing as a ‘Community Arts' school’, as there is for the arts education and practice of any kind; and the relation between artist-organisations and community groups is very different than between artists and curators. Curatorial work is inherently collaborative, but in the hands of a director it tends to demonise rather than embrace. Similarly, the arts education and practice of a community organisation is inherently ambivalent, and at bestmes tends to neglect or outright reject aspects of their practice that are in its director’s best interests. But having a place and feeling like a home for an art exhibition is different from having a place and feeling like a home for another kind of art exhibition. In the former, the arts organisation maximises the impact of a show by providing opportunities for the artist’s to grow and change and in the latter, by</text>

But the critical lack of listening to the arts (other than as a result of a given biennial, biennial convention, or museum show) means that art’s presence, no matter how essential and weighty and important it may be, remains ambiguous and unfulfilled. There is, for instance, no global moratorium on, for or against art (though there are signs that some biennials are actively attempting to abolish this ambiguity and imply a common, if conflicted, set of values). And yet, somehow, we know that the importance of listening to art cannot be understood in isolation. We have to be exposed to art in order to connect with it. This is why biennials have to be continually (re)present in their local artworlds and museums, and why they have to be present in their local art galleries too. They’re there to be discovered and appreciated, but also to be experienced. And they’re there to be experienced in different ways – to be understood in different ways and to be allowed to take part in different cultural experiences. But this takes a kind of knowledge, and the kind of knowledge that comes with experience – knowledge of the unknown and the unknowable. A kind of critical artworld understanding must come from above,</text>

There is no such thing as the ‘artworld’ or the ‘curatorial’ in the same way that there is no such thing as the ‘cultural landscape’. The curatorial is the place where art is formally demonstrated and where art is placed in relation to its real-life context; where art is represented, judged, and argued about in a public forum; and where art is ultimately judged. It’s the art world’s version of the American cultural landscape. But its constant need to prove and hype and remind us that ‘we’re in a cultural landscape’ and that we’re in a ‘world’ makes it nearly impossible to imagine or understand the world in any other way. 	The art world doesn’t want you to know that its rulers and contributors to the biennial calendar are only interested in your giving them more money and the power to choose which artists youíre going to see.</text>

There is a feeling, both inside and outside the art world, that’s still unfinished, and that’s why we see art exhibitions and cultural-studies programmes and publication in auteur-friendly journals and magazines, but it’s also why we don’t see art being made in many places in the world. Because we don’t have the tools or frameworks or design disciplines to support or foster a sense of place or community around an art exhibition or cultural-studies programme or cultural-making in the rest of the world. And this feeling of ‘missing link’ between art and places still exists in some corners of the world, including in North America. For example, the idea that the Art Gallery of Toronto is culturally and historically Canadian, even though the gallery has no formal relationship with Canada, is still uncommon in places like North Korea.

There is an important question here: what does it mean to be ‘in the art world’? What does it mean to be an ‘in the art world’? How does the modern art world perceive and represent the world? (I’m thinking here of the postmodern, not the postindustrial.)3. We don’t know what we don’t know. This is the second reason why there are ‘no wars, no terrorist attacks, no ecological destruction, no hunger, no thirst’. It is also the reason why economic growth and societal wellbeing are two sides of the same coin. If we stop worrying about the outcome of individual attacks and start worrying about the causes of societal breakdowns, ecological destruction and hunger, then we can start thinking about structural reforms and new growth strategies.  And finally, there is the question of transparency. Are we more transparent when we have information that others do not have, whether that is the names and addresses</text>

There is a saying in the arts world: a performance, however impressive, is a performance within a performance within a performance. But unlike in other kinds of performance, where the artist has crafted a unique and valuable combination of gestures and techniques that help us to experience a performance within a performance, the awkwardness and subjective nature of the arts performance conspire to make it difficult to define and engage with. And this is why biennials and museums can’t possibly be inclusive: they’re performance spaces, and the underlying assumptions and values that generate the fabric of what is imagined to be ‘theatre’. The inevitable ambiguity and subjective nature of what is staged within these performance spaces then prescribe certain kinds of experience and certain kinds of participation. But this kind of subjective and unfulfilledness is precisely what biennials and museums are trying to address, and what the art world is trying to avoid. They want to engage audiences through engaging them with particular artworks staged in specific places</text>

There is, for instance, no such thing as the artworld connoisseur, or the contemporary art collector, or the curatorial historian. There is, instead, a kind of generic artworlder who gathers together artworks from different places or times and puts them together in a shared visual framework. And there are different ways of being within this visual framework – cultural, historical, or artefactual. It’s the art buyer who buys a painting or a sculpture, or a collection of works on a particular subject, or a particular theme. It’s the contemporary art collector who buys a collection of works from a particular place or time. It’s the curatorial collector who buys works from a particular institution or a particular artist. It’s the art buyer who buys a collection of works from a particular place or time but excludes design work, which is the art of exclusion.3. The curatorial today.

Why is this?Because the arts are ‘different’ than other kinds of knowledge, and because the arts are inherently ambiguous, as all kinds of new vocabularies have emerged. But the critical lack of listening to the arts (other than as a result of a given biennial, biennial convention, or museum show) means that art’s presence, no matter how essential and weighty and important it may be, remains ambiguous and unfulfilled. There is, for instance, no consensus about how vital it is to the health of a community to be able to look at a mural and know what that mural means, or how vital it is that a certain generation of artists imbued with the arts be given the respect and admiration of that generation. There is also no consensus about what art is. There are many opinions about what art is, but few vocabularies that champion or define that opinion. There is no consensus about what art is, or should be. There is consensus about the state of things, but few who articulate that consensus with any kind of power or influence. There is no consensus about what art is, and how to define it. This seems counter intuitive to many people, but it allows for certain things to be shared. People share these things together, in a communal space, as a collective. People share them separately, as individuals. This kind of common space makes it easier to understand and to access certain things, because ideas</text>

There is no such thing as the ‘articulation of taste’ as distinct from the articulation of values; nor is there such a thing as the articulation of aesthetic experience as a relational kind of experience. Rather, art has to be defined in terms of philosophical and political propositions such as those of language, morals, or politics, and its members have to be seen to play a part in this relational world. But this is where the ambiguities of the arts meet the nobleness of commercial culture. The tension between the commercial and the ethically questionable is made more marked in the latter. If the art world can be de-legitimized through the medium of biennials, why can't the biennale itself become sufficiently critical and artistic in character? Why can’t the art be defined in terms of its place in a larger socio-political system? Why can’t the art be understood as constituting part of a package of values? Why</text>

There is no such thing as the ‘arthritis cambodii’, as some have started calling it; there is only the humbug, a condition that is both repetitive (standing in the way, as art tends to be) and terminal (collecting dust like so much other biennials and museums collections). The term seems to capture a single, malleable condition that arises and subsists alongside other conditions – a malignant core that seeks to destroy life through the negation of a given art’s content, method or other signature characteristics. If there is one positive thing to be learned from the current art biennale, it is that art can no longer be counted on to save a given artform from itself.3. The rise of the biennial.

[v] Leonard also believes that the underlying assumptions of mainstream scientific and technological thinking are fundamentally flawed, and that society will not be able to move beyond the assumptions that have facilitated the rise to power of these technologies: ‘We have become accustomed to certain kinds of thinking, which are no longer required in a changing world. But we are also prone to adopting certain kinds of behaviour, which can have a significant impact on the planet.</text>

It offered a metaphysical and epistemological account of the unfolding of history as a consequence of the unfolding of technology, and it was this broader philosophical vein that was also evident in his conceptual work throughout his career. 	[iv] Paulo Freire,  	The Technological Imagination 	, published in 1986, is an interesting but flawed book in many ways. It is full of references to early modern science-fiction writers such as Isaac Asimov and Heinlein, but it also includes a number of essays by futurist and science-fiction writers such as Vernor Vinge, Graham Greene and Terry Smith. Freire is a proponent of a single ‘utopian future’, and the book ends on a number of predictions about an apocalyptic future based on preexisting scientific and technological trends.

For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, artists, writers and activists, including those from the Black Panther Party, were regularly quoted as claiming that they were autonomous from the law but subject to the whims of powerful social forces such as poverty, lack of education or political unrest.  	[v] Some of these theorists were, of course, mistaken. The notion of the individualized artist or thinker in relation to such social forces remains deeply problematic in our contemporary context. As we shall see in section  1, the ideas and ideologies underlying such social critique are deeply embedded in the DNA of our Socially Engaged Art tradition. 	[vi]</text>

[iv] A few years later, in 1942, Harald Popp, a zoologist and physicist, proposed a radically different interpretation of Leonard’s ideas. Harald proved more successful in convincing scientists and the military that the risk to public safety was greater with electronic surveillance and that the intelligence needed to fight the war was available only through technological means. With the help of Popp, the National Research Council established the Signals Intelligence Bureau (JGK) – a secret, highly visible agency charged with decoding signals intelligence – and the Military Intelligence Division (MID), a covert paramilitary force charged with developing and engineering ‘future technologies’.

[iv] It was at the Cambridge University Press office that Leonard first met Herman Daly, a leading figure in the work of post-war bioengineering, and a proponent of the ‘utopian society’ he was critiquing. Daly was writing from his home in California when he stumbled across an ad in the New York Times Magazine that hinted at the possibility of a utopia if only society could be engineered to be better adapted to the new technologies of the new economy. Leonard did not know at the time that this utopia was being imagined as the result of the ‘infrastructure’ – the social and political conjunctures that accompany the emergence of new scientific and</text>

[iv] Leonard himself was a leading proponent of a post-Kantian epistemology of the soul, according to which human beings live according to their reason rather than God, and act according to their reason rather than through faith or reason.

As such, they are a crucial site and site of encounter for contemporary art and contemporary culture. The ‘big five’ – the Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, Kunsthalle Zu?rich and Kunsthalle Feyhe – are the main international taxonomies of visitors to the biennial.[4] The biennial is not only a site of exchange and destination, but participates in a multitude of other, yet overlapping and dynamic ways. It generates local and global interest and ideas, it is a site of interaction between people of all ages, it is a place of ideas and strategies, it is a place of art and activism, and it is a place of art per se. It is an event that, at its best, engages and mobilises. The question is, then, where does this passion and energy come from? Where does it go? Who are its intended audiences?

In this sense, biennials can be seen as spaces in which to engage with and speculate upon the impact and possibilities of material technologies and cultural practices, but also to sit by and absorb such impacts as they emerge, and to repeat the potentialities and limits of these systems and their material forms, but in new and unexpected and complex ways.[4] This is to engage with what can and cannot be done at a planetary or even sub-regional level, but also to create and foster new forms of material and immaterial resources through which those who inhabit them can enact a material change in their form, and more fundamentally, to sit by and absorb such impacts as they arise, and to repeat the potentialities and limits of such systems and their material forms, but in</text>

They are, in other words, the margins. But what if the biennial is lost or withdrawn from the city? What if its spiritual anchor, its real capital, is found elsewhere? What if its collection and exhibitionary form are turned inward? What if its collection and exhibitionary form become displaced and art's present but neglected third sector? What if its collection and exhibitionary form are transformed into a museum form? What if its collection and exhibitionary form become transformed into a social conduct called public realm, and its collection and exhibitionary form become transformed into a ‘museum of the present’?

As such, they are cultural producers of a kind, and play a pivotal role in this process. The significance of this cultural capital cannot be underestimated. It shapes how the city is governed, built, visited, produced, lived in, and produces social, cultural, economic and spatial change across urban spaces and regions. It is a term that has come to denote this kind of long-term ecological and spatial transformation, and its expansion and political-economic entrenchment.Yet, despite its cultural value and the political entrenchment it entails, its real-life impact and permanent displacement cannot be underestimated. The biennial is a site of power and control, and is intimately linked to it, real-life and virtual. It is both the site of production and its product. It represents – lives outside of the museum – various forms of domination and oppression, and it shapes the conceptualisation of power and social systems that are constructed through it. And yet it is also a site of resistance.In this sense, the bi</text>

But in this brief overview, I will concentrate on the mode by which the city creates and cultivates its biennial: its capital, and its artefacts. The mode by which the city shapes and depends on its biennial is the mode of the biennial as a global phenomenon. This mode is not restricted to a single institution or place. It is material and global in character. It permeates transport networks, satellite imagery, the interior of buildings, the stratosphere and permeates the global economy. It is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between the true city, which is the real estate market – not just in New York but also in London, Shanghai and other megacities – and the artefacts that are being sold as new and premium forms of urbanization</text>

This multiple modes of cultural production and reclamation are what biennials, and those who follow, inhabit and depend on them, create and foster. As such, they are a kind of urban capital for the social, spatial and temporal complexity that characterises contemporary urbanisation.[4] But what does ‘capitalize culture’ mean these days? If the biennial is to retain its cultural value, how can it engage with the crisis of space, and to what extent is the biennial itself embedded in its localities? The answer to these questions is a kind of urban destiny: how to find the values and ideals that will sustain and create the social forms that will allow humanity to thrive in a different world? Urban mythologies are good at telling us where the social and economic resources for a different world are situated. But how to find those social and economic forms when the social and economic forms are already located? This is the predicament of cities caught up in their own technological revolutions. The biennial can and must choose between two extremes: it can continue to reside in its present form, and it must also exist somewhere else in the city. In either case</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial will be the last Biennial in the city.[3] The Biennial has, since its founding in 1999, been an important staging post for the city’s rapid growth and economic fluidity. Its multiple forms of entry and circulation force the city’s inhabitants into encounters with artefacts and practices that are often novel, unexpected or both unexpected and even contradictory – artefacts that become embedded in the city’s social, spatial and cultural systems.

Rather, it is a system that can accommodate and develop material and immaterial resources, enact a material change in its form, and continuously reinvent itself. This multiple modes of cultural production and reclamation are what biennials, and those who follow, inhabit and depend on them, create and foster. As such, they are more ‘real’ than museums, more ‘authentic’ than an exhibition, and more ‘relevant’ than a website. Yet, as biennials become more and more institutionalised, their true intent becomes increasingly questionable. There is a simple reason for this: institutionalised forms of cultural production and consumption no longer represent the world as it actually is. The mass media, television and music industries no longer represent the world through images and sounds that are valued, acted upon and transmitted across large distances. The advent of social media and digitised images means that cultural goods now constitute a vast transient market that seeks to capture cultural outcomes across multiple platforms, behaviours and platforms.The rise of social media and the biennial has coincided with an exponential increase in the number of people who call themselves ‘cultural travellers’. These term describe those who have made a permanent or quick return to the place where they came from, either by choice or for economic reasons. Such return trips</text>

This multiple modes of cultural production and reclamation are what biennials, and those who follow, inhabit and depend on them, create and foster. As such, they are entwined and intertwined. They are cultural islands in a sea of Earth.The biennial form is complex to begin with. The biennial is a curatorial device that has become embedded in the larger cultural system in many places, often unconsciously or not so unconsciously. It is a device that is constantly (re)negotiating its own place in the world. Its ubiquity and accessibility mean that it is easy to miss the machinery of the biennial and its varied forms, but even more so to misunderstand or disregard them. The error most often made in attempting to diagram the history of the biennial is an error in conceptualisation. It is an error to assume that the biennial is an island in a sea of other forms of culture; that it is a collection of isolated stories told in isolated settings; or that it is some other such form that we populate with stories told in disconnected settings. The biennial form is what makes it such a powerful and enduring object of our exploratory</text>

As such, they are a kind of urban core that provides vital support to its thriving metropolis. If the biennial fails to provide this kind of urban core, other forms of institutional support will. That is, the biennial must be a modus that is capable of accommodating and developing material and immaterial resources, enacting a material change in its form and constantly reinventing itself. Otherwise the city will become wobbly and ill-adapted to life in its present form. How can the biennial create the material conditions necessary for a thriving metropolis? How can it infuse new life into an old material form? These are questions that address materiality, immateriality, materiality, materiality, and how to move materials into life. These are questions that render the present the object of study. These are questions that render the present the mediator of change. These are questions that regulate and control change. The biennial is a particularly exciting form of venue for these kinds of cultural production and re</text>

As such, they are cultural nomadines, inhabiting, using and disposing of every artefact, every resource, every building material and implement that is produced, conserved, deposited or brought to market in the global south. Their artefacts range in form from the relatively new (block cinderblocks, Muralists and artists’ chairs in high street markets, Glasgow, USA) to the old (tradition, historic buildings and foundations being worked into derelict urban zones, Rotterdam, Netherlands and Dubai, UAE), the surprising (New York-based artist Jeanne van Heeswijk’s discovery of Sidewalk, NYC), the wonderful (the discovery of a new way to live in Cardiff, UK) to the ridiculous (the introduction of Segways in the Welsh Streets, London, UK).
