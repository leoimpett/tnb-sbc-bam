It is a community effort, and often a community of people of many different kinds of people come together to make something. Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, in my opinion, is the real and genuine purpose of museums and biennials. Making the world a better place through art is always the primary purpose of museums and biennials, but there are other purposes as well. In my opinion, the real strength of community-based art is what it does with the resources that it has, rather than what it keeps, through a reciprocity that transcends the museum and gallery. And the reason why is that, because a biennial is an extraordinary situation in which resources really do exist. In many ways, biennials empower a community to do extraordinary things, because at the end of the day, the resources – both physical and digital – that are created are the property of the biennial, and the biennial in turn owns the resources (art, images, texts) that it gathers from time to time. And so, the biennial becomes both a producer and a taker of its own resources. It collects and it preserves them,</text>

It is a community effort, and often a community of people of many different kinds of people come together to make something. Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, in the case of a biennial, community projects. But this is only ever the case for a very brief period of time, and, as biennials, we are usually very attached to the artefacts that we find in museums or in the real life that surrounds us. In reality, biennials are rare and special cases. But their growing importance and often-inflected forms of documentation mean that we can more readily identify, document and connect to them. And, in the case of a biennial, the form of community that it creates is often deeply embedded in the very soil and air that it is visiting. 	So, there are typically three stages to the emergence of a biennial: emergence as a museum project, emergence as a community project and, finally, emergence as a monument to a community effort. And although each of these is distinctive to its own right, they all share some basic principles and characteristics. The key is that they emerged as a community effort, meaning</text>

It is a community effort, and often a community of people of many different kinds of people come together to make something. Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, within this community, islam is indeed the foundation of the biennial. If we, as artists, are not given over to our work by our audiences, then something else must be given a chance – and that something else is often engagement with life itself, in an authentic way. 	The biennial is a community effort. And, as has long been the case, the audiences that show their support and give us meaning and agency in return are also of a particular kind: the kinds of people who will become artists, become clinicians, become historians, become journalists… 	Now, in a way, the relationship between biennial and community is like the relationship between the piper and the dove. The biennial is the event that formally introduces itself as a community has been instructed by the artist, scholar or curator in question to take part in. And so, as biennials proliferate and develop their own ever-widening webs of cultural transmission, their own forms of artistic production</text>

Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, as biennials mature, their reach becomes more defined. But it is important to remember that biennial only becomes meaningful over time, and works of art form are only as powerful as their formation and power over time. Biennials also develop and evolve, and that is often the case with people who are artists, scientists, writers or whatever else they become in their everyday lives. New artists, new ideas, new interventions are needed and, sometimes, these need to be put into practice in order to sustain and animate the art form. And, yes, some new artists and artists-cum-artists-cum-organisations are going to emerge, to meet the changing needs of the community. But these are mostly going to be artists and artistic thinkers like myself, or those who have developed creative strategies around the biennial form, and are now going back to their art form to do it all over again. 	And we, as artists-cum-generators, are going to</text>

So, as biennials become more institutionalised, their particular form needs to be constantly renegotiated. Biennial as a Form 	Now, we are approaching the twenty-first century, and with it a huge number of biennials, many of them international in their scope, ranging in size from cities to entire nations. The number of biennials is enormous, and their international character means that they are ever more present in local and regional markets around the world. Globalisation has made it possible for many of these cities to adopt a very prominent role in the global economy. Think of the Biennale of Sydney as an exemplar. As the Biennale of Sydney expanded, so did its capacity to define and present the city. Biennials are, today, important in their own right, and the city is a major market for their wares. </text>

Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, in the larger historical perspective, is the legacy of, say, the Arab Spring. Biennials can and should be collaborative in their organisational practices, but they are most effective when they are as inclusive of people as possible, and so we must ask, what is the point of doing this in the first place? What is the capacity of biennials in the age of the biennale? What is its potential? These are the sorts of questions that arise when we think of communities of people coming together to make something new, or making something old, or making something in common, or creating something new through mutual aid and collaboration. Sometimes these are hard to define, and calling them biennials is a mistake that harms both the people involved and the cause of art (and sometimes of communities themselves), but we can draw parallels between biennials and other art forms, and between art and science – drawing parallels between the former and the latter, especially as biennials seek to articulate</text>

Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, in the case of biennials, the emergence and ongoing growth of community art will almost certainly be part of the story that emerges. So building a community biennial is a critical first step, but it is also critical for the future of community art, because if it is not built into the narrative of the biennial, it will be challenged and dismantled. 	There are many examples of successful community-based art projects that have survived into the present, and there is a lesson for everyone from the Liverpool Biennial to Leeds Biennial about how to start a community-based art project today. Biennials now account for over half of the UK art market, and their increasing political and economic dependence on the city means that they are frequently cited as a model of sustainable contemporary art production. However, despite this emphasis on the ‘biennial’ as a ‘shortage’, there is growing recognition that the biennial may no longer be the end point of art’</text>

Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, in a particular work by the Biennale as a whole, this is evident in the way in which the exhibition format was originally designed. The Athenaeum (architecture) was traditionally the site of a community of artists' studios, while the Biennale itself was traditionally the site of a community of artists' quarters. The Athenaeum was a gathering of artists, writers and collectors, and the Biennale was a gathering of artists, curators, writers and artists' assistants. Together, they would construct a dynamic and engaging space for the community to be located, how to talk to each other, to exchange, to collaborate and to have a voice.

It is a community effort, and often a community of people of many different kinds of people come together to make something. Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, as biennialers, we are often asked to do things differently. For example, Biennials often talk about their love of the arts as a way to bring people together, but what is so often overlooked is that in a cultural context, a gathering of people to share a common interest and interest in a shared art form can actually bring out the best in each other. For example, the Biennale of Sydney was started by a community of community artists, and over time, as new artists arrived, they began to join in and form a kind of archival, collaborative and catalytic group activity that became very much about the memories of the past rather than the present. And this is a very powerful thing to do, to me – to me and my generation, and to artists like Joshuah Jaua and Rebecca Johansen who are coming through now, coming out of the shadows and into the light.

Often what we create together is much more meaningful and alive than what is achieved through individual artist-centred initiatives and, as biennials become more institutionalised, more and more like other kinds of community projects, they become more like other kinds of community organisations. And so we mustn’t become complacent or ignore the fact that biennials are often very different from other kinds of community projects. They are, after all, community initiatives directed at a specific set of people (although sometimes these are not communities at all). And so we’ll often see a biennial as an institution that is too proud of its unique identity as a community of its own making, and so it proclaims itself to be so. This is an important distinction to make, because biennials can often seem to forget that they are also community initiatives. They’re often led by people from the community who don’t necessarily share the organisational or institutional baggage that comes with being a biennial. And so we often get the sense that we’ve created a community here, a community of</text>

His work in cities began in the 1970s when public officials and artists used city assets to create a ‘relationship museum’. In the 1980s he began to explore the possibility that the art pieces placed in city parks could serve as catalysts for a regenerative change. In the 1990s he began to explore the potential of biennials as sites for artist-run participatory projects. Since then his projects have taken place in cities worldwide, in cities including Beijing, Istanbul, and São Paulo; as well as in the Cayman Islands, the Solomon Islands, and Antarctica. He is the curator of the Evolutionary Anthropology exhibit at the Venice Biennale, and the curator of the Human Origins exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. He is part of the curatorial team for the 15th Venice Biennale, and part of the curatorial team for the New York Public Library’s public programs, including the public programs of the Biennale itself. In 2015 he curated the Venice Biennale, which took place almost entirely in the city, and was partially funded by the New York Public Library. In 2018</text>

His work in cities began in the 1970s when public officials and artists used city assets to create a ‘relationship museum’. In the 1980s he began a 30-year ‘reconstruction’ project that continues to this day. His latest project, The City Project, is a worldwide participatory art project that aims to understand the social, economic, spatial and cultural impacts of a city’s decline through an analysis and critique of its infrastructure, culture and urban-creation policies. For the 2016–2019 biennale season, he curated the ‘7th International District Art Triennale’ in New York and ‘8th International Triennale: Museums, Art Students and Auspicious Matings’ in Venice. For the 2017–2018, he collaborated with the New York–based artist Jason L. Deller on the project ‘Fallacies of Cities’, a collaboration that was exhibited in Venice as part of the Biennale's 'Venezia Cultural Imperative: Past, Present and Future' exhibition.

In the 1980s he began experimenting with the idea of ‘contemporary art’ in places where art was not traditionally appreciated. His interest in infrastructure and urban growth led him to establish the firm of Himmelstein, Himmelstein, &amp; Company, which was established to explore strategic uses of city assets. His projects have been incorporated into the ‘Future City’ concept, which was developed by the British Council and is used by the Department for Transport, National Museums Liverpool, and Tate Modern.

Part one focuses on mitigation, part two focuses on adaptation and part three analyses future scenarios. While the authors do provide specific recommendations for the future of the country’s climate, they do make it clear that adaptation is the most critical phase of the climate game, and that mitigation alone will not cut it. The report concludes that while there is still time to mitigate the impacts of climate change, adaptation will be the most effective approach. Of course, this assessment is far from a finality, and adaptation will continue to be a complex task. Getting the political and economic systems aligned</text>

In her own blunt terms, she says: ‘I became a philosopher because I believed that I had to be present in order to participate in the journey of becoming who I was meant to be.’ Mouffe goes on to explain that her ‘cultural practices’ – which she developed over years in collaboration with other participants in the movement to become �</text>

It is perhaps interesting to compare the decision-making on climate change between the United States and Canada, where citizens are required to take part in a national survey in order to determine if their community is sufficiently prepared. A national survey is a *very real* way to start a political and social movement on climate change, but it is important to note that the national survey is a tool that is often used in an authoritarian fashion. As one example, a national survey on voting intentions is often used to subvert democratic participation. In the wake of the Baton Rouge shooting, which left five police officers and two civilians dead, many Canadians turned away from participating in the national survey because they were preoccupied with the threat posed by violent extremist ideologies. The survey, which</text>

She finds that art represents a range of different possibilities, depending on the context and the person, that can mitigate or exacerbate a changing climate. Art therefore functions as both symbolic and physical aid to climate action. Art’s potential as a political tool is further accentuated by the fact that it can simultaneously signal and hide, as in this latest iteration of the Mona Lisa: the physical act of painting a single image does not necessarily represent an implicit political message or set of beliefs. Art can, however, certainly be visual aids. In this sense, art can and should be adaptive. Art, and art only; that is, art that is politically context sensitive and seeks to adapt to changing circumstances in order to achieve political ends. Art should be adaptive to the changing social context within which it operates.2 </text>

Inevitably, this begs the question: how will we decide what to do about our economic and urban predicament? The answer to this will undoubtedly require more research and analysis than the authors have the energy for. However, it is clear that the future is one in which change is already happening and will continue to happen unless massive acts of protest and activism result in fundamentally changing how we live, work and play. Therefore, the future that is imagined by those who call themselves environmentalists is likely to end up being a future with increasingly precarious lives and with increasingly uncertain futures.

The question of social impact and sustainability becomes critical when there is potential for change to displace the needs of the wealthy and powerful, especially when that change is coming from places other than the USA.  The Biennial has been on a trajectory to become more of a museum, exhibiting parts of a much larger story.  Its current exhibition format is an episodic, curatorial trick. It is a continuing curatorial move towards a publicly accessible and highly visible form of the art institution. It coincides with important cultural cycles and is a visual language of the past.  The issue of social impact and sustainability comes into focus when discussing the permanent collection of the Biotennial. The biennial’s current capital cost comes as a surprise to many people, who think that the institution was founded on the social, the human, and the biennial. The cost of the original exhibitions comes as a surprise to even the most resourceful biennial collector. The biennial’s current financial situation is a mystery, with the biennial consistently reporting losses of $$$,000. The largest of these losses was reported as $$$,000,000</text>

The question of social impact and sustainability becomes critical when there is potential for change to displace the needs of the wealthy and powerful, especially when that change is coming via a biennial.  The Biennial’s adoption of the term ‘global’ is a double-edged sword: it can mean unification, but also destruction. The first event saw the US and UK’s biggest footprints, but the increasing globalised nature of our times has caused the very fabric of our urban environments to be affected in unpredictable ways. The use of the term is made increasingly problematic by the fact that some of the world’s most vulnerable populations are the guests of the biennial, including those people living in countries that the biennial is expected to visit – especially in the case of large publics, such as the World Trade Center and the 2012 London Stadium both located in the city. In the wake of these traumas, the use of ‘global’ seems more like an afterthought or a synonym for ‘us’.  The use of the term has become more critical in the past decade as a syn</text>

In charge of the Liverpool Biennial from 2012 to 2015, they oversaw a major renovation of the city center, including the construction of a completely new 70,000-square-foot (2,400-sf) biennial museum, which opened in 2015, and the establishment of a new progressive district called The Anfield Ground, which they conceived as a place where artists could work and play free of constraint.

The question of social impact and sustainability becomes critical when there is potential for change to displace the needs of the wealthy and powerful, especially when that change is coming through new, often disruptive, mediums, and new forms of cultural interaction.  The Biennial’s social, economic and political contexts are constantly shifting, often in ways that are not fully understood or experienced. This has been seen in relation to the event, for example, when events such as marches, rallies and protests emerged as a way to protest the displacement of residents and the economic devastation caused by the defunct city centre’s underground minarets. But the increasingly common practice of hosting events through virtual mobs, as well as the non-commercial activities of communities come to dominate the biennial’s destiny. A question that arises is whether the power relations between the artist and the community are still relevant, even in a city as complex and diverse as New York. The answer to this question are twofold: yes, communities are still very much part of the organisation and beyond reach of the Biennial as an organisation; and, yes, communities still control</text>

The question of social impact and sustainability becomes critical when there is potential for change to displace the needs of the wealthy and powerful, especially when that change is coming via a political, economic or social mobilisation of resources and enforcers. The decision to engage in the Biennial event or to fund the event through art is a complex one, but the decision to host an event or to create an organisation is inherently problematic and fraught. In the 2017 Toronto Biennial, the decision to engage in the event through the curatorial curatorial curatorial process led to the displacement of historically determined locations and created a different kind of temporality and political context. In the 2017 Venice Biennale, the Biennale commissioned artists from a variety of disciplines to develop innovative approaches to the event, and these varied creative proposals were then put forward as curating wards for the 2018 edition. The idea of the cultural tourism business is to draw in disparate resources, resources that are then pooled and brought together in an environmentally sustainable way to form a more inclusive and productive form of community. So the question becomes: what kinds of forms of cultural</text>

The question of social impact and sustainability becomes critical when there is potential for change to displace the needs of the wealthy and powerful, especially when that change is coming at a critical moment for the planet. Yet, the Biennial event itself is not only a moment for change, but is a site of capital and power politics, profit and institutionalisation, that can be counted on to respond with violence and oppression should the capitalist system be disrupted.  And this is precisely what the biennial event itself is up to: responding to the dislocations and injustices of the capitalist world through its material comforts, and leaving its ruins in its wake.  In the event, the material comforts of modernity are maintained and even enhanced, as new technological means make possible the exchange of culture for capital. The biennial event is a powerful tool for the political-ideological-ideological, ideological-collective perpetuation of certain forms of social organisation. Yet this does not make it ‘good’ or ‘pure’ or any other such thing. Culture, as an inherently political act, requires a certain form of political agency and identity</text>

The question of social impact and sustainability becomes critical when there is potential for change to displace the needs of the wealthy and powerful, especially when that change is coming at a critical moment for the planet.  The Biennial’s social mission statement incorporates a call to ‘re-present and return’ to the material world around it.  These two elements of the event’s social mission statement produce a shift from the contemporary material world to the older, more structural world of cultural production. A shift towards the material world is inevitable in the eventual, material world of art and culture, but it is an event that has the potential to declare a new social space and paradigm as well.   As biennials everywhere become more institutionalised and political in nature, more and more of the social impact that came with the eventual is being mediated through the institution of the biennial itself. So, the material world is displaced and reshaped by what is being produced through the eventual.  To some extent, the material world is being produced in response to what is being reproduced through it: the more we</text>

The Biennial’s current state and condition are a powerful indictment of the economic, political and social conditions of our times. It is a reminder that change can happen through civil disobedience and it is a source of pride for participants when they have contributed something new and different to the story of the city. But it is also a responsibility that is shared equally between the participants. The challenge for the future is how to connect to the present and those in power, while remaining affirming of the value of the social and the biennial in the process.  Conclusion: the biennial as a museum-like space  Conclusion: the biennial as a museum-like space In this analysis, I focus on two episodes from the history of the Biennial, the episode of Venice Art Biennale (2003), and the episode of Architecture Biennale (2008).

The Biennial’s 2018 edition is the first to be staged in 29 countries and is the first to be co-curated by the US artist Cindy Sherman. Her project ‘Open Up!’ brings together the artist, her team of historians and artists, and local communities in 19 cities in the US and Canada to discuss the role of history in contemporary design. The project emerged through a year-long participatory research project that she conducted with her colleagues at Columbia University and Inventing the Future think tank in New York. The project was supported by the Open Art Institutes, a New York based academic organisation, and the Columbia Museum of Art, the world’s oldest and most prestigious museum collection, as well as the Museum of Modern Art, the museum of modern art in Berlin.

In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which we produce it.And so we see another potential medium through which cultural production might be facilitated: the participation of audiences in producing cultural outcomes. One might even agree that these outcomes should be cultural responsive, in the sense that they should reflect the social world through the mode of participation rather than through the invisibility of participation. This is the direction in which cultural production in Canada is headed, and it’s a direction that can only be optimised. There are going to be cultural geniuses and there are going to be conflict zones and we are going to have to work through some of these things, but there is a chance that these are the kinds of dynamics that can help create futures that are more amenable to cultural capture. More fundamentally, the capacity of cultural products to create futures is what makes them cultural possessions. That is to say, cultural production is what makes the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary art form, and that is why cultural products are so compelling: they are so persuasive and persuasive.</text>

In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which we create new cultural forms. And that brings us to the second aspect of this equation: the politics of cultural reproduction.If we take the example of the taxi, we can think of cultural production as a networked effect. There’s the production of consciousness, the production of language, the production of norms and forms of social organisation that can be regulated, mostly through the use of imagery and iconography. Then there’s the production of habits, behaviours and representations of the city that can be changed through cultural practices, like culture of sharing, that can then be incorporated into everyday life. Basically, there is a cycle to the emergence of new art forms, and the perpetuation of existing art forms.So far, we have seen cultural production as a social process. But what does it look like in the abstract? It’s easy to understand this if you understand that the social is an abstraction. But what does it mean when we consider the totality? When we consider the</text>
    <text>human behaviour and technology, and the cultural impact of that is to say politics and social change. It’s not just that we live in societies dominated by people with lots of money and ideas, but that we live in political and social systems so saturated with the accumulated culture that we barely notice the impact of the culture we produce. The impact of the culture we produce is, of course, going to be shaped and improved by the people who inhabit it. But the politics of that impact is going to be interesting to watch.The other side of this coin is what sociologist Helga Nowotny calls ‘total culture’. She defines that as the art form’s capacity to render the contemporary world ‘in and through which culture has long been active, including, perhaps, the social world from the past, which is now becoming visible and has yet to be fully assimilated’. In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which we create social forms that are no longer modeled after the ways in which the societies we inhabit are supposed to be organised. And that implies a kind of cultural revolution. So there’s a tension here between the capacity of contemporary art to impact cultural change on an ongoing basis and the politics of such cultural change. That comes into play when the biennial is a collection of works that have been carefully selected and staged in a way that is culturally responsive to a particular political situation. The capacity of culture to impact change comes into play when the art is cultural production, but the political impact of that is going to be cultural production done in coordination with the political situation. So the argument here is that the biennial represents the emergence of a politically aware artform, but it also represents the co-emergence of art and politics. It’s an art institution that is sensitive to the political implications of its activities, and the politics of art are politically aware art. It’s a</text>

In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which we create and process it in the future. Some may argue that this definition is overly elastic and that the art form is more likely to employ practices that are socially useful and transformational, than art that is representative and static. But Nowotny does see cultural resources accounting for a large part of what counts as cultural production, including through workforce training and the formation of culturally responsive local artworlds. This is a crucial point of articulation for us today, because what counts as cultural production is often considered a static frontiers in human relations. As sociologist Holly Drobnjakovic, one of the founders of the Field Museum, put it: &quot;Cultural production today is global’. And as global art production has become ever more predominant, we are now experiencing the increasing pressure to produce more culturally responsive art in order to keep pace with the constantly expanding market for art products.While the biennale has its roots in nineteenth-century utopian notions about the social importance of a cultural</text>

In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which we create and narrate the world. And what Nowotny would do if she were alive today is to look at how our modes of cultural production are contributing to the crises of poverty and hunger we see in many parts of the world. She’d see an opportunity to rethink how the mediation of culture is possible, and to imagine what a culture might look like if it ceased to be defined by the industries of commerce, industry and colonialism that it continues to inhabit.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is an assistant professor in The College of Architecture and Design at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta.

In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which culture is reinventing itself. Nowotny’s definition of ‘total culture’ is somewhat elastic, and her language is a touch imprecise, but she manages to capture the cultural parlance that is gathering force and changing the definition of what counts as culture. The more culture you have, the more culture is going to be produced. And what counts as culture is going to produce what counts as culture, because the more we consume of it, the more we live it up, the more we participate in it, the more we become culturally responsive to it, the more we can contribute to its advancement, and the more is going to be produced. A tipping point, I think, is going to be when enough culture is produced to affect enough people that they start to define and think about the terms of cultural production themselves. But that is going to be a very difficult and far-reaching change to accrue and sustain, and I don’t think it is going</text>

In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which our technological culture creates social change. Nowotny defines cultural production as the art of making things visible, whether that’s how the art is made visible through advertising or the way it is made visible through the built environment. It’s the making of visible cultural phenomena, whether that’s how the arts are made visible through galleries or the built environment. And it’s what counts as culture if we are to understand and communicate with the world in culturally responsive ways.Selecting the right mediumGranby Paradiso, 2012.

In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which we create and institutionalise it. And that includes the ways in which we produce it, through what sociologist Timothy Snyder calls ‘cultural capital’.Snyder points out that while the museum is a transient concept in the social world, cultural capital is a persistent investment that returns whether or not the art is being exhibited. And what makes cultural capital cultural is the way in which the art is produced and absorbed into other social forms. Snyder also points out that cultural capital accrues through time, whereas the time spent producing cultural art is absorbed into the contemporaneity of other social forms. So while the museum might be the locus of the art appearing in the social world, it is the site of its constitutive effect. It’s as if the museum were an accelerated version of its social functions. This is why, for instance, the museum is so important in our current economic and political systems and why it is so difficult to separate the museum from the social. If the</text>

In other words, what counts as culture today is going to be culturally responsive to the ways in which we create and inhabit it. And how we inhabit it depends on who is watching.The question that comes to mind is: what does it mean to make culture responsive to the contemporary world? I think that Helga’s definition captures the dynamic. It’s easy to conceptualise cultural production as a collection of images and behaviours – images that we take for granted – but I would argue that what we mean by that is much more relational and individualistic. What we mean by ‘culture’ is what artist Jeanne van Heeswijk describes as the tendency towards culture protraction: what she calls ‘the prodigious culture of the individual’. That comes to mind when thinking of cultural production as a social process. It’s the tendency towards the art of making one’s self culture responsive to the contemporary world, while simultaneously the tendency towards the avoidance of one’s self-conscious self-indulgence.In order to grasp the full</text>

And what Nowotny would argue is that we are producing culturally responsive forms of social life, lives, through our consumption and participation in the cultural production of the future. So the social world that we inhabit is going to be shaped by the consumption and production of the cultural production of the future. This is an argument that resonates with me as a sociologist, and it’s one that I think is very timely and relevant given the changes occurring in the world of entertainment and media. There’s a new media economy of consumption that’s being constructed, and it’s being actively engaged with politically. There’s a new media economy of politics that’s being created. It’s not just the entertainment companies of the past that are getting a piece of the new media pie, but the cultural production companies that are joining forces with local communities and other stakeholders to form new media enterprises are going</text>

In 2001, we launched Project Green Gate, an ambitious five-year research and evaluation project that sought to discover the causes and consequences of pollution occurring on an industrial scale in Bangladesh. We found that the main causes of pollution were not localised or hierarchical and that large environmental transgressions were taking place at an unprecedented rate. Our project started from the assumption that it is impossible to build a massive and fully automated pollution control system on an industrial scale in Bangladesh, and that large-scale transformation is the only way to address the problem, at least not yet.

I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of the past. The project was conceived in collaboration with the artist's widow, Winnie Chun. The idea was that the artwork would grow from the archive, as materials were gathered, and that the archive would support the narrative of the project through what came to be known as the &quot;third party phenomenon&quot;. In other words, the artworks would be there to tell the story, but with the social forces shaping and enabling an altered perception of the past. At the same time, the social forces shaping and enabling an altered perception of the past need to be applied in order to effectively apply it. In other words, the staging of social change and its implementation is a two-fold affair. The first part is the challenging of entrenched power, and the second part is the enabling of change. The challenge to entrenched power is a challenge that every generation faces. The challenge to entrenched power is not an actionable challenge, but it is an achievable challenge. And so the project was developed, and</text>

The idea was to create an experience of the alley that was both nostalgic (for the artist), and connected to the time when the artist was living there. I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of the past. The project was to be both a fabrication and a commentary on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of the present. The term fabrication seems strange, but the meaning was clear: the work would be perceived as a response to (a perceived) inability to engage effectively with the contemporary condition.  In the case of the Biennale, the perceived inability to engage effectively with the contemporary condition was an imposition – the venue, the curatorial agenda, the production methods – but the momentary erasure of historical materialities was also felt. In her essay ‘Modern culture is dying, but can we save it?’, published in the New Republic in 1989, Njabulo Olu Olu Oluenane put forward a prescient argument about the pervasiveness of commodification in a post-totalitarian context. She argued that ‘the culture industry today is a deeply unmanaged social industry, beset by a consumer culture war between producers</text>

The idea was to create an experience of the alley that was both nostalgic (for the artist), and connected to the time when the artist was living there. I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our contemporary obsession with celebrity and identity. In other words, its subject matter and form were to be contemporary, but also timeless, and easily identifiable within the museum setting. The project was also to address the narrative of the alley through narrative construction. This was important for the success of the project because the narrative of the alley would define the museum setting, and so the artist’s identity with respect to the narrative of the alley would be established. In other words, the artist would be creating a work that epitomised both the history of the alley, as well as the narrative of the museum, but with elements of both. This was particularly important for the success of my project because the artist was living in the city at the time. In another context, the project might not have been possible because the artist was present in both the city and the museum setting. But here the artist is positioned in a temporal relation to the museum, and so the museum is embedded in the city as its spatial equivalent</text>

I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of the past. The project was to be a synthesis of the two. The architecture piece would be based on historical photographs, and the street level panoramic photographs that were taken during the 1970s and 1980s, in an attempt to capture the feel of the alley as a living space, and the shifting fictional landscape that emerged as a result of the artist’s social media presence. The project was to address the social forces shaping and enabling the perception of the past, while integrating an active and engaged community. The new urban form that emerged was a kind of inverted pyramid with a public and a private offering, in which the public sector, public realm and the private realm converged to make a new kind of communal experience. This new urban form was one that was both economically sustainable, and one that would provide opportunities for all to participate in. At the same time, it was also an urban environment in which the private sphere, and particularly the arts, was actively engaged. This kind</text>

I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our contemporary obsession with identity. The project was also to be both an art project and a political intervention. In his essay ‘Taking the Stage: Modern Culture in Crisis’, William Burchell narrates the events leading up to the Biennial’s release in 2017. Taking the Stage is a commissioned work for the exhibition, and the installation is part of the public programme. It was also part of a commission from the artist to participate in The Resident, the biennial’s catalogue of essays. I was invited because I had just finished a project for the Plan Bay Area: Tides on a Velvet Sea (2017), which explored the connection between Burchell’s childhood home, the North Shore’s historical fishing communities, and the communities living in the North Shore area now called North Shore Regional Park. Taking the Stage’s text follows the historic narrative of North Shore fishing communities, but takes the form of a narrative of the development of North Shore culture in the</text>

The idea was to create an experience of the alley that was both nostalgic (for the artist), and connected to the time when the artist was living there. I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of the past. I suggested that the subject matter covered by the exhibition should have a significant role in the narrative of the exhibition, and that the form of the exhibition itself should have a significant role in the narrative of the encounter. In other words, the materiality of the art should shape and enable the experience of the encounter. In this sense, the materiality of the art should occupy a position of power. I suggested that the materiality of the subject matter should be a further condition of the commissioning of the artworks, and that the commissioning of the art should occupy a position of surrender. For the artist, the commissioning of the artworks actually did have to do with the maintenance of the aesthetic experience of the alley, and the maintenance of the aesthetic condition of the neighbourhood. So the ability and/or desire to intervene in the aestheticisation of the alley was required. If the commissioning agency was not able to exert sufficient control, or to render the dwelling a desirable</text>

I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of the past. The project was to investigate the role of memory in the contemporary context of a large-scale urban redevelopment project, and to question the relationship between biennials and large-scale art historical collections. 	The project was part of the curator’s research on the city, part of a doctoral dissertation, and part of the Curator’s Core Curatorial Process, which also took place in the Museum of Modern Art. It was a collaborative research process, with the artist and the curator interviewing leading art historians and art critics, and conducting fieldwork and research throughout the city. The project was also part of the larger project Curatorial Matters (2015–16), which was led by Curator in Charge Maria Lind and Archaeologist Christine McKay of the Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art would be the curatorial debut of a team that also included Curator in Charge Alexandra Trapp of the New Museum, Curator in Charge Patricia Smith</text>

The idea was to create an experience of the alley that was both nostalgic (for the artist), and connected to the time when the artist was living there. I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of our own social reality. In other words, there is a contradiction in the project – the social forces of art as a tool, and the politics of perception as an artist. The challenge for the artist was to find a way to engage with both the social and the political forces shaping and enabling our perception of reality – which concomitantly create and tear apart our everyday environments. The project was to address the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of reality as one in which art is an essential tool in the socialised narrative, and art is a radical force in challenging entrenched power structures. What is political, and what is social, is in fact often an art form's greatest strength.1  This is a difficult task, and it is often a struggle for the artist to conceive of the social dimensions of a given situation, and the ways in which art can play a positive or negative role in that context. The project was to find a way to both confront and diffuse the perceived</text>

The idea was to create an experience of the alley that was both nostalgic (for the artist), and connected to the time when the artist was living there. I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of the past. The project was to be divided into three parts: the first part, the construction of the alley; the second part, the transformation of an old industrial site into a creative plaza; and the third part, the creation of an artist-run cooperative that would develop the site and employ the workers. The idea was to create a continuous narrative through the art, architecture, street life and community around the alley, while also questioning the logic of the city’s infrastructure and economy. The proposal was received with great interest, and the city quickly allocated funding to make the project a reality. The project took two forms: a rehabilitation of an old industrial site and a plaza dedicated to the arts; and the development of a cooperative that would develop and employ the site and its workers. The cooperative was to be run by a Board of Directors composed of local residents and artists; and the residents would control the workplace. The cooperative’s mission statement read as follows: ‘The</text>

I proposed that the project be both a portrait of the artist, and a meditation on the social forces shaping and enabling our perception of the past. The urban space is a strange place, full of fantasy and paranoia, filled with promises of wealth and magic and yet also with the politics of displacement, of course. The project was to use the metaphor of a 'black box' – a device that records and stores data about the environment – and to explore the political forces that regulate the environment. In the event that the world around us distorts in unpredictable ways, and data capture becomes an ever more important tool in the politicalised socialisation of our urban environments, the need to create a symbolic counterattack becomes evident. In order to do this, the project needed to be multifaceted and accessible. The answer to my question, which became more and more pressing as the project progressed, became: what is the political potential of the symbolic and invisible? In other words, what can we make with the knowledge that comes with being embedded in urban environments? I thought this was a valuable set of questions, ones that would help</text>

The three most recent biennales have all been significant in their own right, and their discursiveness in their own right adds to the sense of systemic change. The challenge now, however, is for art-historical and literary curators to develop strategies that will enable them to engage with the biennale as a public art project, and not merely as a transient exhibitionary enterprise.  One might also ask: what would be the equivalent of a green space today, in the form of a biennale? I propose a three-pronged approach: the biennale, the urban and the literary.The biennale as a public art projectThe biennale has long been a public art project of one kind or another. Its mission statement, often quoted as fact, is often quoted as though it were a maxim. It is a statement of fact, often repeated verbatim. History has often been a matter of when, rather than of how. In the case of the nineteenth-century biennale, the &quot;when&quot; was always in doubt. Its stated objective of celebrating the life of an artist – a statement of fact</text>

The three most recent biennales have all been significant in their own right, and their discursiveness in their own right adds to the sense of systemic change. The challenge now is for the art world to catch up with the new technologies that are emerging, and for artists to catch up with the communities they are part of. This may require that artists abandon the city for a long period, or even indefinitely, in order to prepare their biennale scripts for publication. At the same time, it may require that their biennale narratives be based in a particular region or city, and publish in regional, metropolitan or national art journals or on a regional or national art and culture online community. Art biennales are entering a more critical period, and their cultural meanings may be shifting. Biennales may also need to find strategies that cater to the shifting of economic and social power, as technology and social media create ever-greater discrepancies between the artist and the viewer. Yet despite the increasing visibility of art in biennials, the politics of art and biennials remain. That which used to be called the ‘British Empire’ is being eroded</text>

The three most recent biennales have all been significant in their own right, and their discursiveness in their own right adds to the sense of systemic change. The challenge for the next event, however, is to position the art as something other than the apotheosis of a specific art institution or discipline. That may be difficult in a city as diverse as New York, but I think the art world needs to be able to recognise that it is being visited by a biennale. It needs to be able to read between the lines and realise that this is not some wilfully deceptive marketing scheme. It needs to be able to ask questions. Finally, it needs to be able to act.  Art biennales are, increasingly, being carefully constructed in such a way as to place their publications in the public sphere. They are being jointly financed, for example, with a share of the revenue from the museums that they purvey. Many of the publications that have been published in the art world since the 1990s are being written from the ground up, and many of the artists and art organizations that used to be in the journals are joining the ranks of the</text>

The challenge now is for art-world curators to assess the impact of such critically-acclaimed works, and to pick and choose among many of their constituent parts, and to weave them into what they see as a systemically-consequential move towards a future with greater social mobility and inclusion.The activism component of the biennale has certainly been a catalyst for much biennale writing. Though often neglected in the genre, the biennale is a frequent topic of contention in art-world curators' correspondence, and its inclusion in the past and in the future editions of the art book (both physical and online) has often been an issue that needs to be resolved. In 1877, for example, the British artist John Lennon penned a letter to the editor of the New York Tribune complaining about the omission of the word ‘art’ from the heading of a catalogue published the previous August. Lennon claimed that the word ‘art’ had been 'swallowed up in</text>

The challenge now turns to generating the political will to implement the artworld priorities – an undertaking that can be seen as art, in one form or another – whilst recognising the fact that in the age of biennials and their digital consumption, a city may need to find a new equilibrium between public and private space. This equilibrium may need to be found in creative strategies, strategic publications and innovative arts-and-entertainment agencies.I was in Liverpool recently, and while in the city, I happened to come across a book called The Artist in City. It’s the autobiography of Russian artist Alexey Tezduyev. It’s the story of how, some years earlier this year, Tezduyev created a two-hour public sculpture project in Central Park called Tatarstan 2028. It was also the story of how, some years earlier that year, another Russian artist, Arkady Tereshkova, created a similar project in Central Park called Silent</text>

The challenge now is for art-world curators to see the art within the art being made elsewhere in the city. This may require them to revisit the past, and ask what can be learned from it. Perhaps the most promising approach has been offered by the artists themselves, who in turn offering their time and talents to the biennale as a way of exploring the city in their ongoing projects. Though this may be a start, it is not a cure. The real work yet to be done, as always, is the project itself. Art, after all, is made in the city.  The activism component of the art world must be active in order to have an impact. The biennale must be interesting, exciting and countenanced by cultural producers who know the city well and have a social conscience. The biennale mustn’t just be about the art, but also about the people who inhabit the city, and the challenges they face. This may require some creative conflict</text>

The challenge now becomes how to harness the momentum of these various points of entry and exit into a citywide transformative impact. The celebration of life, in its many forms (biennial, book, exhibition, manifesto), is a powerful tool. It can be re-purposed, re-defined, and it can be art. This is why biennials have been able to expand their themes, justifying them in many cases – by changing their subject matter. When, in turn, the biennial is asked to do so, it’s an opportunity to re-imagine life in many other forms as a way of saying: here’s what’s new, and here’s how we got here. This is a challenge that cannot be successfully met by any single institution, but rather needs to be leveraged by diverse means. The biennial is uniquely positioned in that it has the capacity to introduce many new ideas, thus creating an open door to new ideas, while also</text>

The challenge now, rather, is for those keen to participate to think of the art world in terms that are more readily digestible in print. This may require an embrace of social media, which is slowly becoming a more important venue for exchange and globalisation. But it also may require creating alternative artworld representations of yourself, in order to generate the necessary critical mass to put pressure on the art world to change. Do you see the increasing corporatisation of culture as a direct result of the importance placed on images? In the biennale as a whole, perhaps the most striking trend has been the proliferation of state-sponsored museums, often funded with public funds, which are now co-opted back into the portfolio of the art institution. Consequent changes in the art institution’s management have been accompanied by a proliferation of sovereign national museums, often created out of whole-of-date collections, which are themselves collections of various sorts. While these forms may be interesting to museums and their collections,</text>

But in the longer term, in a city as rich as New York, where are the social and economic engines that would enable such radical change?  One has to ask, however, what would replace the art world? Would the contemporary art market, driven by artist-centred initiatives, provide the necessary impetus for such radical change? I believe that there are three main avenues for art-world engagement: education, activism and publications. Though not mutually exclusive, the three act as an interdependent system. The activism and publications component of the biennale has certainly been a catalyst for much art-world literature, and the biennale itself is a publication, dating back to 1877, that continues to be a source of much needed critical thinking and debate. The three most recent biennales have all been significant in their own right, and their discursiveness in their own right adds to the sense of systemic change. The challenge, then, is for artists and arts institutions to simultaneously engage with the changes that need to happen in the city in order to host a biennale, and to continually inform, educate and, if necessary, to disrupt these processes in order to initiate them. It’s a delicate balancing act that needs to be performed, and the biennale as a whole needs to be actively engaged with in order to provide the necessary impetus and alter its trajectory.This last component is what I call ‘eventalism’. It’s the art world’s attempt to simultaneously capture and captureive effect when it comes to the art and the artist’s work that is produced in the city. This element of contemporaneity is what I call into question with each and every narrative manifestation of the biennale, whether it’s the paintings, the installations, the books, the magazines or the social media feeds produced by the biennale itself. The idea</text>

The challenge for the future, of course, is how to coordinate all these activities into synergies that are not simply about the art institution but also about local artists and their communities. In the aftermath of the Charlottesville debacle and elsewhere, it would seem that the biennale is now more a venue for art institutions to demonstrate their continuing commitment to a particular set of stakeholders.  The activism component of the biennale has certainly intensified in the intervening years. Though it was once confined to major institutions, the emergence of social media has made it easier than ever for artists to connect with audiences outside of gallery spaces and beyond the art institution. Biennales have become more political, more political in tone and in many cases have been created specifically to protest perceived perceived perceived injustice. In the wake of the events in Charlottesville, for instance, the Liverpool Biennial was criticised for creating a crisis of legitimacy by folding its own proceedings into the political narrative surrounding the events.

For instance, he offered to train artists in the  	photography of community gardens. This was before social photographers such as  Ken Turner started to come to the city. Ken Turner is a local historian and art historian, and has a particular interest in arts and culture in the city. He has been photographing the Community Arts movement for many years. He took part in the curatorial process, and his images will always tell the story of the Community Arts. They will always be a part of the collection.

The funding for the programme would come from the Arts Council, and the local artist’s fee would be covered by the Housing Association. 	The Arts Council offered to provide the funding, and the artists could come from any organisation, but the Arts Council saw an opening to partner with an organisation that has a significant cultural impact in the area, and to arrange a series of performances around the arts in the area, with or without the Arts Council involvement. 	The partnership seemed a logical next step for the Arts Council, and the collaboration emerged, with the Arts Council artists producing a series of performances around different aspects of the city, often centred around a particular neighbourhood in the city. 	The performances themselves were often provocative, moving and creative, while the neighbourhood performances were often sad and nostalgic.</text>

This seemed like a good opportunity to build up artist-student exchange within the Biennale, since the Arts Council might find itself sharing the same funding with the Biennale organisation. 	The Biennale has traditionally seen itself as a provider of cultural opportunities to its visitors, and as such has had a creative outreach strategy. It has produced artists who have gone on to work in the arts context outside of the Biennale. The tradition of cultural exchange between the artist-recipient and the artist-visitor is still very much present, but it seems that the Biennale is now more interested in cultivating relationships with stakeholders in the arts community in the city, and encouraging those arts organisations to be 'in' with the biennale as opposed to being 'out' with the city.  	[1] The Biennale website </text>

In the 1980s and 1990s the Arts Council funded a number of projects in the city, and shaped local culture with projects in schools, youth groups and community centres. The number of young people who identify as artists has steadily declined, and many of the artists were either retired or living in retirement. The number of community arts organisations has also steadily declined. The number of arts educational institutions has also steadily increased. In the past ten years alone, the number of arts educational institutions has trebled, while the number of community arts organisations has trebled. The number of artist-in-res</text>

There are many other kinds of artists and their work is often more in the form of instruction, guidance or demonstration. But the fact that their work is artist-created and is read by an artist-community of artists and scholars – scholars who may hold positions of power – means that it can be asserted to be innovative, creative and so forth. It is true that the art world has a tendency to overvalue artistic achievement, and the arts in general, and to overvalue the kinds of creativity that can be supported by the arts, particularly when it comes to developing artists' skills through formal education and training, and so the over-emphasis on the arts is significant. There is a tendency, however, to undervalue the kind of creativity supported by the arts, and so the arts community has a way of supporting and encouraging that kind of creativity.

It is this kind of work that is encouraged, funded and expected to be seen to be having some sort of impact, even though it has had almost no impact in the main art world, and in fact many critics would probably agree that it is precisely this kind of criticism that art needs. So the research-led, art-funded kind of artist is encouraged to try again, even if it is just to see what the art world has to say about the subject. The kind of artist who can and does make art is a kind of art that is expected to be seen as having some kind of impact.In recent years there has been a push towards more sustainable forms of cultural production, and towards a more socially just consumption of cultural goods.

I have worked with one of these artists, Alison Hewitt, who was a researcher and writer in her own right, and her work (which we did together in 2015) is a powerful reminder of the importance of holding cultural institutions to account, particularly when they are creating a narrative around themselves. Hewitt is a researcher who specialises in the history of artistic practice and has conducted extensive fieldwork in the West Midlands over the last twenty years. She has produced a number of books on the arts and social history of art, critical theory and publics including Debord, Contravision, Black Flag, We Are Here to Stay, and Other essays, including Coming Apart: Race, Class, and Art in Twentieth-Century America (2013).

I have worked with some of these artists, and while their creative impulses and distinctive style of poetry and playfulness sometimes run counter to the institutionalised rigour of serious art institutions, they generally achieve a higher standard of craft than their more experimental, less intellectually adventurous peers. I have worked with some of their pieces that were carefully crafted goods, such as their 2009 installation at Tate Britain, but they were also often experimental, wittic and emotionally charged, such as their 2009 installation at Liverpool University, but these were often judged by critics as having low intellectual ambitions. So their level of public engagement – which was often questioned by their more traditional arts colleagues – was often measured by whether their installations or works of art generated a reaction on a particular day, rather than whether they caused a stir. And their level of commercial success was often measured by whether their collections or collections of</text>

We cannot know what a transformative experience it is to witness a work of art being created, because we have not trained the right kind of artist to play the part. But we can learn something about the person who creates that art, and perhaps this could be translated into a work of art that is both recognisable and potentially transformative. This is the kind of work that the arts organisations could offer, and the new entrant into the art establishment could be one of several artists who finds their way into the building. 	There is an irony in the fact that the biennial is often seen – by some curators, at least – as a disruptive force in shaping the art world, because it is seen as disrupting established paradigms and paradigms of art.1  However, the impulse of the art market to commercialise and consume art or artist-product often times interferes with the artist’s role – or in the</text>

But there is a difference between those who have the intellectual capacity and the will to do so, and those who are cowed by the arts establishment, who stifle creativity in favour of conformity. Creative people are few in number, and those who are cowed by the arts establishment are few in number. So it is that in the arts community as a whole we are often told things that we don’t want to hear, which only serves to reinforce our already prevalent belief that the arts are inherently bad, even if we do our level best</text>

The second generation of artists is now in their forties and have worked in careers stretching back to the sixties; the third generation, a half century later, are artists themselves, and their work carries the same cultural weight today as it did then. The third generation of artists, and their younger self, are those artists who have moved through the ranks of the art world, and have, as so many art historians have done, been influenced by the avant garde, postmodern and critical fashion. They are creative, witty and politically aware.But there is another kind of artist, and it is the artist who has been trained by the arts organisations – those who have the specialist skills and make-up to play the part of curatorial sleuth, critic or critic. These are the researchers and artists who have had a helping hand with the art they create, and whose work has been recognised by a professional art institution. Their work is often insightful, funny and profoundly human. It is not the work of an artist to tell a researcher what to do. But the art world can and do places a value on creativity, and places a value on the researcher’s ability to articulate that creativity in a way that resonates with the audience. And the capacity of artists to articulate that creativity through their art is another thing entirely. In the 1980s and 1990s, those two things were inextricably linked. But the forces of globalisation and social media have changed all that.The art world is a curious place. It is populated by people who think they know everything there is to know. This is usually true of biennials: there is a great deal of misinformation and distortion around the things we learn at the academy, and widely held notions of who we are as artists and who we are as human beings. There is a great deal of opportunism and self-congratulation around the things we discover at the museum.</text>

Their work is often insightful, funny or just plain brilliant.It is this kind of nuanced work that is often dismissed as 'art' by curators who only see it as a commercial enterprise. I’m thinking of the MFA students who created the exhibition and workshop The Contemporary Condition at Tate Liverpool, or the artists who created the game Candyland, or the game Chik-Fil-A, or the game Fifa, or the game Hearthstone, or the game World of Warcraft, or the artists who designed the characters or vehicles or whatever. These are the artists who have been trained to think critically about art and the role of the artist, and have found ways to engage with that thinking. They have not, however, learnt how to engage with what the arts institutions actually do, or how art can be produced in ways that actually impact change – creating, for example, alternative futures for people through art works or through the making of art institutions.That is, the kind of thinking and activism that can end up</text>

Their work is often insightful and provocative, but it is also often deeply flawed, and in many cases downright wrong. There is a reason why studies of art are so important. If the art it is made up of is ultimately not art, and the art is made up of people with a particular skill set, then the art institution recognises that skill in the most powerful way possible. And in many ways, the art that is produced by these research-based organisations is more real life – they are the realists, and not the others. There is a reason why institutions of all kinds do their best to engage with, and learn from, artists who are building movements or projects that are real. It is because the art that is produced by these bodies represents the world in a particular way, and institutions wish to be entertained by that world. When the art of the institution is constructed on the recognisable parameters of what people with a particular skill set can achieve, the art that is produced is likely to be more authentic to</text>

Their work is often insightful and provocative, expressing the concerns, prejudices and politics of the contemporary situation with grace and humour. It is this kind of contribution that goes unrewarded. It is a kind of art for fools. And if you are lucky enough to work with one of these artists, you will find yourself laughing hysterically as you watch your heros making fools of themselves, in a kind of intellectual mirthlessness.If you are lucky enough to work with a museum, then this kind of artistic mirthlessness is a kind of an art form. It is a kind of art that is being made today in the context of the museum, and you are part of a team that is making art that is part of a future museum collection. And if the museum team behind such a project is a kind of the way in which contemporary art is being organised, then the museum will be a kind of the way in which contemporary art will be organised in the future.

It is unclear to what extent the present situation would constitute a breach of the door-monitoring statute, since access to the building is not regulated by statute and therefore not subject to judicial review. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal in The Queen's Printer decided that a public body must take action when the statutory duty to take such action is not fulfilled. The decision was based on the presumption that the public body has a statutory duty to take action in response to a breach of trust. If the statutory duty to take such action is not fulfilled, the public body must consult with its board of governors, who have broad discretion in deciding what action to take.

The Biennial was forced to cancel several shows due to the disruption caused by the Chisenhale. The Chisenhale were forced to make changes to their schedule, which meant that there were fewer shows to be shown in the galleries. When the Liverpool Museum moved into a new location, the gallery suddenly came under attack from fans who accused the gallery of being too Jewish. The Biennial was forced to move some of its shows elsewhere because of the anti-Semitic abuse directed at the new venue. The Biennial was forced to</text>

It is possible that the current situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the increased visibility of the breach and the consequent need for the commission to draw up plans to redress the situation. It is also possible that the present situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the increased number of participants and the fluidity with which they engage, since the art commission has to respond to the increased volume of applications. Finally, the court is not sure whether the public or the museum would embrace such a program, since the latter seems more likely to embrace the latter.

The court held that the museum had the statutory duty to take action against the artist. It is unclear how the museum would address an art commission that has breached its statutory obligation, but at least the breach is recognised.

It is possible that the current situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the increased visibility of the breach and the consequent need for the commission to draw up plans to redress the situation. It is also possible that the present situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the elevated status of the commission, since the status of the public gallery has recently been elevated to that of an emporium. The artist would be empowered to initiate legal proceedings against the museum and the gallery in question, but the museum and gallery would be required to restore the artwork in question. It is unclear whether the statutory or constitutional rights of the accused would be respected. The legal proceedings could also have a declaratory effect on the institutional values of the museum and the gallery, since the ability to legislate for the gallery and the court would be limited. It is also possible that the ability to redress a breach of the Public Trust Doctrine would reside in the hands of an elected board of trustees, since the status of an institution would be defined by the support it got from the state. It is also possible that the ability to redress a breach of the Public Trust Doctrine would reside in the hands of an independent tribunal, since the independence of an institution would be determined by the state.</text>

It is also possible that the present situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the increased number of breaches and consequent need for the number of monitors to be augmented, since the number of breaches is growing. It is also possible that the present situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the perforated nature of the works, since the works are no longer unique in their form.It is also not clear what the redress mechanism would be since the works would be returned to the artist’s trust and would be incorporated back into the museum. This is consistent with the idea that the works are ‘found objects’, but unlike in the museum, there is no law or judicial declaration stating that such is the case. It is also not clear what the relationship would be between a statutory duty to take action and the increased visibility of a breach, since the works would be returned to the public gallery and incorporated back into the museum. In either case, the works would no longer be works in the public domain and would remain in the public domain even</text>

It is also possible that the present situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the increased number of artists and curators who frequent the galleries and museums of the city, and because of the increased visibility of the reasons why they frequent the galleries and museums. Finally, the court did not define the public; nor did it specify the nature of the public act. It is possible that the present situation would constitute a breach of the public trust doctrine because the public has become so accustomed to it that it has little conception of its actual nature. That is, the public realm is generally seen to be open to all, and there is a general assumption that it is possible to get in and out of it. That is, the public realm is generally perceived as open to all who wish to use it. This perception is primarily caused by the rapid spread of print media, which makes it easier to digest what is printed than it did before. It is also caused by the ubiquity of mobile phones, which make it easier to access what is being shown than it did even a decade</text>

It is also possible that the present situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the increased number of artists who regularly breach the breach the site’s posted rules, and for this reason the current management does not have the resources to employ more stringent disciplinary measures. The present situation also raises the question of institutional promotion and its relationship to the contemporary condition, since the artists who breach the site’s rules are rewarded with permanent admission to the institution or gallery of their choice. It is also possible that the institutional promotion ofÂ contemporary art is a breach of the duty to protect, since the gallery or institution that sponsors the commission would inevitably be aware of the breaches and would retaliate against those who speak up against the institutionalised form. Finally, this situation creates the potential for the institutionalisation of a new form of art commission, since breaches of the current form are often covered and indeed celebrated among</text>

It is also possible that the present situation would constitute a breach of the doctrine because of the increased number of artists participating in the project, since the artists were not being counted as part of a team and the team was not being counted as a unit. The present situation may be seen as a contributory factor in the development of new art being created. 	[1] The Public Trust Doctrine is a United Kingdom statute that came into force in 1996. It provides that a statutory instrument shall ‘be made … so fully imprinted in the public domain as to render it inexhaustible’. The instrument is presumed to be such an imprinted version that artworks created under it would render non-existent. The doctrine was intended to shield artists from liability in cases of infringement by public authorities. It provides that the public is empowered to regulate, ‘unless such regulation would infringe a person’s 'right</text>
