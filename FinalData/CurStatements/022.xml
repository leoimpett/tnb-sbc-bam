The problem with biennials today is that they are objects of consumption; they are producers of social consumption and are thus affected by it. Art’s potential is realised only when it is produced and consumed in ways that contradict the systems that institutionalise and generate the conditions that generate culture.  	Art has always played a part in organising and constituting social change. The role of art today is to be explored in more detail in the next chapter. Chapter 2: The Episodic and the contemporaneity 	The episodic is the coordinating principle of cultural capital. It generates what Roland Barthes called ‘contemporaneity’, that is to say, the contemporaneity of what has just happened.9 	Essentially, the episodic character of biennials is to be found in the interaction of many different kinds of socialities</text>

The problems this poses are manifold and include the proliferation of fake news, the proliferation of fake cars, the proliferation of fakes and so forth. But the materiality of art and the materiality of biennials have shifted in the same direction, and the contemporary biennial will most likely follow in Appadurai’s wake. 	Art is a material phenomenon, and art, and art only, is culturally globalised. Art today flows from one location to another, often en route to a new community of supporters. Art today is made in many places in many cities, often in close collaboration with a local authority. But art today is made primarily in one location: in one museum, one building, one space. And, as any artist who has been to many art shows in his or her chosen field will tell you, space is limited. So how do artists and art-makers navigate this new landscape? While some</text>

Artists who have been regularly exposed to the materiality of contemporary culture, such as Arjun Appadurai, Praveen Jain, Sanjay Pandey, Praveen Shah, but also Janaki Ganapathy, Amitav Ghosh, Pintu Litwack, Ravishankar Menon, to name only a few, have been exploring the ways in which contemporary art is made up of multiple forms of social consumption. Art is not just an expression of the social world; it participates in and depends on the world in many forms and at many scales. Thus, the work of an artist is not just an expression of what she observes; it depends on the social conditions that enable her to exist (and continue to exist) in that social world.  	Artists who engage with the contemporary materiality of art, and who seek to understand how art is socially produced, rely on a large number of cultural resources, which proliferate globally, and are therefore a global production, and they engage with these simultaneously as resources that allow artists to exist in that world. When an artist engages with how art is socially produced in a particular context, she or he engages with the larger cultural system that supports the social world of art as cultural production. The artist’s engagement with the resources of the cultural system that support the social world of art necessarily depends on the</text>

Art is produced and shaped by the logic of capital. Dilip Gaonkar elaborates: ‘Art has a contractual relationship with the state. It is either produced or it is not produced, and so there is no other way to think about it.’9  So, contemporary art is produced by the state, and often produces quite different forms of governance in response to this. 	The biennial as an institution is deeply embedded in the state and is a result of the given, universalised logic of the biennial. It emerged out of the logic of the ‘biennial register’ – a register of goods and services to be delivered, curated and retained by the state, often in perpetuity. For Georges Canguilhem, this meant that biennials had to cease to be individual acts of art and art have to adopt a set of characteristics that are closely related to those of</text>

The ways in which art is produced and reproduced in this world, and the ways in which art can be made to correspond to the ways in which the world is made and consumed today, varies widely from place to place and within that world. Thus, the contemporary art world is far more exposed to the needs of the environment today than it has been in the past. 	Today, many art museums are ecologically irresponsible and biennials exhibit a disproportionate amount of art exhibited from those same museums, which is, in turn, a disservice to the ecology of the art world. However, this is changing, and the shift is in part due to artists, curators, art writers and art’s own work, which is now frequently exhibited in places such as the Botanical Gardens of San Francisco, which is an early manifestation of an ecological tourism industry.9   	Art is made up of many diverse kinds of actions, and the role of</text>

Biennials and social media. How have biennials and social media influenced art practice? What are the potential effects? Bryan Caplan, planner. 	In my experience, the impact of bienniality has been more of a ‘wonderful thing’. I’m not sure what that means exactly, but I get the drift. It’s been the experience of many artists who have been regularly exposed to art from different places and times, and have had to deal with the complex social-media pressures of being part of a community that can ‘see’ the art and are exposed to it. I don’t think that art is inherently social, and art has a social aspect too. Art has a social purpose too, and it’s this underlying purpose that is often misconstrued as being unrelated to the art’s actuality. For instance, the art</text>

The practice of staging works in public places, through which art is often accused of perverting or trivialising the place, is a valuable tool for understanding contemporary art practice and the contemporary condition. The biennial format has its limits, and with good reason: some of the subjects and cultures it documents may end up constituting the subjects of future exhibitions and books, and further complicating the situation for artists facing future exhibitions and books. Nevertheless, it is a materiality that is constantly in motion, constantly informs and informs on us, and so the artist has two choices: either to confront the materiality of contemporary art with the dignity it deserves, or to write the subject into a situation in which she/he may be able to intervene and change the materiality of the art, but which nonetheless remains subject to the will of an administrative elite.

The convergence of various forms of cultural practice means that one can only speak of visual experience as a set of relations that exist between artist, audience, writer and (potentially) journalist. Given the proliferation of language and the globalization of capitalism, it is easy to understand the desire of artists to be able to communicate with audiences outside of their own country and region. However, artists and audiences today also need to negotiate complex forms of cultural politics and bureaucracy that exist in their own countries. And, as is often the case, these corruptions and infiltrations are part of a broader globalised economy that seeks to feed off of every form of cultural experience.

The biennial has a visual impact because it  	exhibits a subject and its culture, and it has that materiality because it is a material phenomenon. ‘Material things’ are made of things, and the public is exposed to them through continuous repetition, so that it is a material phenomenon.’8   	However, this lesson is not lost on contemporary artists. 	Artists who have been regularly exposed to the materiality of contemporary culture, such as Arjun Appadurai, Praveen Jain, Sanjay Pandey, Praveen Shah, but also Janaki Ganapathy, Amitav Ghosh, Pintu Litwack, Ravishankar Menon, to name only a few, have been exploring the ways in which contemporary art is made up of times and places very similar to their own. As Appadurai writes: ‘Art has an expropriating function in the social totality. It is a public good, a public art, and it is public to those who participate in it’.9 Similarly, in his book  	Contagions of the City, former Toronto art critic Graham Forman documents how, as a city, Toronto embodies the logic of ‘20th century modernism’.10 But unlike contemporary art, which is often depicted as advancing in the social conscience of the city, Forman’s depiction is of art gradually losing its public virtue, becoming indistinguishable from everyday commercial art. The cumulative effect of this tendency is a cumulative effect of all kinds of reforms, which in turn on the decline of civic virtue. From the late 1980s until about 2010, the Canadian Centre for Policy Research conducted a series of research projects exploring the origins and origins of modern city planning</text>

The reason why biennials have become so influential in the last twenty years is due to the proliferation of biennials, which are exhibitionary forms of their own.9 This comes as no surprise to art historians, who have documented the exponential growth of biennials in the last twenty years, despite the biennial itself showing a twenty-first century growth spurt.10 Art and biennials have become so intimately linked that biennials are often cited as an influence on the cultural life of cities. Some artists have their roots in the Biennale tradition, such as M. Paul McCarthy, who first curated the Venice Biennale in 1966, and William Kentridge, whose book Cities in Crisis: The Rise and Fall of America’s Urban Crisis Wave in 1974 sparked a nationwide movement to understand and address this crisis.11 It is important to note, however, that biennials were not the only influential artists</text>

As an illustration of the power of this presumed understanding of the temporal nature of art, consider the non-representational image of the ocean assumed by the Aventine painting of the same name. The painting is a portrait of the ocean, a physical manifestation of the environmental catastrophe that is threatening the planet. The environmental catastrophe identified in the title is global, and the implication is that the environmental degradation occurring on a planetary scale is global, too. The painting is a symptom of a much deeper problem, one that is threatening all of humanity, and which is becoming increasingly apparent</text>

In the 1977 exhibition ‘Signs, Images &amp; Symbols’, Walter Benjamin posed the question, ‘What does it mean to call a thing a symbol?’[13] And in 1968, Ambasz sought to answer that question in his own ‘Symbol-philia’: a literary work that uses symbols to convey information or ideas through sounds’.[14]The answer, as we all know, is complex and subjective. But as Ambasz himself</text>

Examples of such presumed meanings can be found in all aspects of contemporary art’s output. For instance, the spread of cell phones and social media meant that it was possible to narrate every detail of an event through social media, which in turn made it possible to record every detail in contemporaneous footage. By uncovering the historical roots of contemporary art’s social media practices, this exhibition sought to show how an artist could ‘touch base’ with audiences about art’s social media impacts. It also sought to explain how individual galleries, curators and art administrators could be empowered to initiate and foster such conversations. On a structural level, this meant understanding how contemporary art is structurally emulated in the larger artworld, which is increasingly dominated by social media, maps, and codes. It sought to show how contemporary art today is structurally absent from its historical context, which is why it is so difficult to find an artist or a curator today who is interested in the social and cultural contexts</text>

Add to that the fact that media play a critical role in the social world and we can begin to see how media can be considered as a form of communication between people and institutions – one that cannot be underestimated or ignored. Media can also be considered as constituting ‘a new kind of language that not only communicates but also governs how those communications are governed’.[13]  The exhibition was a critical intervention in the culture industry, and part of a wider project to bring together a range of curators, artists, writers and critics from a range of disciplines to work together through a shared interest in the social world.

In ‘pace’, the author is assumed to be an authority on contemporary art forms, but beyond that, readers are free to deduce meaning from contextual factors. Examples of such presumed meanings can be found in cultural anthropology, literary theory, and architecture. In the twentieth century, cultural anthropologists began to scrutinise the ways in which capitalism (and its various anthropomorphised forms) exploits culture and natural resources, and the social-political implications of this exploitation. Cultural begetting cultural begetting cultural before 1900, the biennale witnessed another significant shift in the power dynamic between artist and public. As Wallace explains, naturalised artists no longer required the trust and dependency of artists or a public to draw audiences to exhibitions, since audiences could be anywhere at any time. This shift, he claims, is the result of a ‘magnifying effect’ that places ‘the genuineness of things beyond question’.[13] One example of this magnifying effect is provided by Wallace’s protagonist, Damien Hirst, whose 1982 Venice Biennale entailed staging the largest ever public revue of objects from the city, including sculptures by Mark Roth</text>

More broadly, biennial form continues to be seen as a site of the contemporaneous encounter between culture and the anthropocene, a contemporaneous mode of cultural transmission between people and places perceived as having a direct impact on contemporary culture. To some extent, Wallace’s account is timeless, and his claim that the biennial form is one in which the ‘originary forms of cultural life can be seen as traceable’ is just as valid today as it was then.

The socio-political context and goals of the project, the author’s stated intentions, and the actuality of the art produced—all fall short of challenging the status quo, but are nevertheless the authors’ stated aims. As a project, the project was not intended to challenge established paradigms or render abstract ideas into concrete forms. It was intended to point out new frontiers or new terrain, to disturb old established ways of doing things in an ever-shifting and unpredictable world, and to eventually to be dismantled by its participants.

In a work published in the British Journal of Political Science &amp; Politics, Maira Kalmani makes the same point in favour of biennials in her essay ‘Surplus-Class America’. She writes: ‘The biennial has an essential relation with the city: it is both a curatorial device and a sign that the city is being renewed anew.’[13] And again in the entry for ‘2016 World Biennale’, Irving Kristol, the architect of the ‘Iron Curtain’ and ‘V for Vendetta’ regimes, makes the same point in favour of the biennial in his own way.

Readers are free to adopt any of a number of presumed ‘signature facts’ and develop motivations, predicates, and politics based on those factors. Hegemony is assumed in artworks not necessarily sanctioned by or governed by the dominant power.

More recent interventions may relate to the ethical implications of criticality in the age of information overload, or to the pernicious influence of money in shaping culture. But in the age of biennials, the presumed common ground is art.

The modern curatorial interest in art is now focused on the relationships between artists, curators, collectors and other stakeholders, and on how those stakeholders can be induced to engage with art in a way that produces change and that contributes to the provision of public space and culture. For me, in fact, the modern curatorial interest in art is the opposite of what Andy Warhol and his gang stood for. They were, in my opinion, championing the art of the art of the condition, which is precisely what Andy Warhol did not want.Modern curatorial and arts education are in many ways indistinguishable. There is a subtle but pervasive difference between the sort of thinking that comes from Warhol and the sort of thinking that is being applied to us by curators and arts educationists. Warhol was a social critic rather than a curator, and his criticism was much more aimed at the art world than the social.</text>

This is what Keynes meant when he said the art market was no longer interested in the strictly commercial use of art. Modern curators no longer set out to make art for a clientele who are specifically identified by the institution – they want to work with artists who are ordinary people like me. And by ‘ordinary’ I mean anyone who doesn’t have a particular agenda or sense of self. The modern curatorial interest in art is no longer focused on the artist as an artist – that was the main job in the 1990s – but on the idea that art is publicly accessible and widely communicative. And so the modern curatorial interest in art – or modernity in general – is interested in making life more accessible and more widely communicative by making it easier for people to be involved in, say, art-making as a way of life.Modernity in other words – making the world more accessible and more widely</text>

Modern curators have become artists themselves and have careers. I began to understand the wider meaning of ‘status symbol’ and the modern curatorial’s constant need to redefine how art is seen and used.I remember one of the artists I worked with, Nadine Gordimer, saying something along the lines of ‘I never wanted anyone to define what a ‘modern’ art collection should be.’ She was arguing against the very definition of what a modern art collection should be. At the time, I didn’t agree with her. But her point was the same: the contemporary curatorial interest in art is no longer focused on the production of artwork by artists, but rather on the consumption of culture as a commodity that serves as a prop in a capitalist culture war. So what has become of the ‘modern’ art collectors and the contemporary art market?</text>

Today, art institutions are more like large companies with projects that they undertake with the full knowledge and participation of managers, artists and staff. I asked one of the artists I worked with how this new curatorial culture was affecting her work. She said that she couldn’t imagine her art without the Biennale. She was so caught up in the expectations and politics of the institution that she didn’t see the world through the lens of an artist such as herself. She also felt that she still had to find a way to work within the structure of the Biennale. She described how artists were now expected to be politically engaged and had to be politically aware in order to find their place in the art world.

I decided to investigate this notion of shifting society in more detail.I went on to do a little digging into the practices of the local artists' collective that I had started to form a close relationship with. These were mostly local to Liverpool, but I found some practices that rang very true. I also noticed that many of the local artists felt that they were under attack by an increasingly globalised art market. I wondered how such a market might affect local creativity. I came away from my initial curatorial interest in art with a deeper suspicion about contemporary art practices in this country.I think that my interest in art as political intimidation really came through in the way that I handled the Biennale.

Keynes’s perspective on the contemporary curatorial, I do think that the ways in which we consume art now – through what he called the ‘cultural miracle’ – is deeply problematic. I also think that it is deeply problematic for curators to participate in this act of political persuasion, only to produce works that are either empty or skewed in certain ways. But I digress.What I found most interesting in my research was the way in which artists were positioned as protagonists in this narrative – as artists, not as artists. I asked artists what they thought the role of a curator should be. Many said that a curator’s main role was to engage with the</text>

In the spirit of the biennale, we imagine that the social architect who brings together the different parts could be a designer – a data scientist or even a designer in human language – who sits down with the artists, collectors, journalists and other stakeholders to find a way to work with them to bring about a change in the way the art is produced and distributed.

I stumbled across an old J.D. Keynes quote that stuck in my head: ‘The modern curatorial interest in art is no longer directed against a strictly careerist art market.’ The modern curatorial interest in art might be aimed at the artist-manager, but its real aim is intimidation. Art is culturally-loaded and so is its circulation. You take the art and you put it in a box, you put a pin in a toothpaste tube, you put a balloon in a can of Pepsi – the list goes on. It’s not the art that gets in the way, it’s the work that’s sent out against a careerist can-and-basis.The art world has a habit of sending a clear message about who is entitled to what, whether that’s the work of an artist, whether that’s a piece of text, whether that’s a painting, whether that’s a sculpture, whether that’s an installation – whatever it is, it’s worth more to the institution, whether that’s cultural capital, whether that’s an artistic proposition.

Today, this means that it is art that is created through the art of those who are employed by the art world, and the art is made to be consumed by that art seeker.I felt a twinge of guilt about spending too much time in a small art gallery – not enough to see what is being made in the city, but enough to notice what is being destroyed in the making of art. I wondered what was being lost through the destruction of the old city. I felt a twinge of guilt about the loss of the art being made now being made by artists who are neither young nor old, but who inhabit the same city and have the same cityicity. I felt a twinge of guilt about the loss of the art being made being transposed back into the old city. I felt a twinge of guilt about the loss of the art being made being made</text>

I stumbled across an old J.D. Keynes quote that stuck in my head: ‘The modern curatorial interest in art is no longer directed against a strictly careerist art market.’ The modern curatorial interest in art is no longer directed against artists who produce cultural value on a commercial level through their artworks. The modern curatorial interest in art is in part about creating an image of art that can be used by institutions to advertise a wide range of goods and services, products and public activities. Thus, the modern curatorial interest in art production and consumption is also about a changing market for images – a changing image of art – that is in part influenced by commercial culture.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the biennale as an institution was on a par with other art forms, and was credited with a significant role in generating artistic practices across the art world. It was seen as a venue for collaborative research on a wide range of themes, and was a site for the curatorial to work with artists to produce works that would be of value to the many, but not to the few. There was no single formula for what a curatorial intervention could or should be, and no central authority</text>

Emmeline Fatma's writing on female identity and representation in contemporary art practices is a good place to start. For the most part, artists, curators, writers and other artists tend to be engaged with the task of imagining a future for artists and art’s many varied kinds of citizens. This kind of thinking is often expressed as a wishful thinking on the part of curators who’ve tended to see arts practice as a settled, settled set of activities that can be delegated to nongradual or nongradental bodies (rather than questioning this fragmentation as a legitimate position of art’s) – a wishful thinking that has tended to obscure or negate the real power brokers and their agendas. As a result, artists and artists-in-waiting have tended to be engaged with static images or representations of art, rather than paying attention to the ways that art is actually made and organised. This kind of thinking has tended to render the contemporary art</text>

The former is defined by Horkheimer as the intellectual and organisational foundation of modernity; the latter by Condon as the cultural and organisational genesis of contemporary culture. Both these thinkers understood the cultural logic of progress as advancing towards ever greater organisational forms and social media infrastructure. The role of art, then, in the cognitive and cultural machinery of modernity is to an increasing extent defined by its capacity to disseminate knowledge and ideas across a globalised social media landscape.  	Art has an enormously important place in the cognitive and cultural dynamic of our time. It is both a vector and a vectoring agent of information and culture that exists in all of us, and is therefore both culturally significant and economically valueless. Art’s current economic value derives from the fact that, as information and culture become ever more pervasive and diffuse, the social value of art – its ability to connect with people on a visceral level – diminishes. The social ecological, though, is contingent upon a number of preconditions that have yet to be met.

The former is defined by Horkheimer as the intellectual and organisational foundation of modernity; the latter by Condon as the cultural and organisational genesis of contemporary culture. Both thinkers were born in Budapest in 1919.2 	Max Horkheimer’s early work, On the Nature of Things (1905), was premised on the idea that science and technology were advancing at a prodigious rate, and that these developments would eventually render human society superfluous. In Looking Toward the Future (1906), his reflections on the mechanical future of things like cars and computers enthused over the progress of modernity while its discontents flared up in the form of racial and ideological rifts.3 	When the First World War broke out in 1914, Max Horkheimer and his fellow Adolf Hitler – both pre-occupied with the fate of the European ‘Signature Move’ – chose a moment to rally around a single idealised idealised figure: the image of a crescent moon cast in the moon by the Italian artist Angelo Moravia.4 	In  	Postmodernism�</text>

The former is defined by Horkheimer as the intellectual and organisational foundation of modernity; the latter by Condon as the cultural and organisational genesis of contemporary culture. Both concepts are characterised by a rejection of routine and habitual behaviour, and the adoption of new and unexpected and paradoxical behaviour, behaviours which emerge as a result of new knowledge and technologies. 	In the public sphere, the debate tends to revolve around individuals – individuals like ourselves – rather than institutions or species. However, the emergence of new knowledge and technologies are often facilitated and facilitated by the interaction and eventual collaboration of large corporates and powerful national governments. As a consequence, national identity and cultural identity play a more prominent and influential role in contemporary life than previously imagined. The battle lines between those at the pinnacle of society and those at the bottom are drawn increasingly increasingly far away from home. The super-rich and powerful are increasingly able to chip away at the very foundation of society. The battle lines between the poor and the non-rich become ever more blurred.

In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries defined the term as part of its bibliograecentric sense, i.e. those who understand and express culture through language2  –a step that Wolitzer predicts will be taken up by every nation on Earth.3 	The use of the term ‘cultural anthropologist’ in this sense is widespread.4 	However, as Woltman reminds us (in his essay ‘</text>

Both thinkers were born in Budapest in 1920.2 	The debate between Horkheimer and Condon gets made up of many different ideas and perspectives, yet they demonstrate an undeniable common ground. Both were born and lived in Britain, so their ideas and approaches to the future are imbued with the British vernacular flavour and rhetoric. Yet Condon’s ideas and arguments are put to a different order from those of Horkheimer. He proposes a radically different conceptualisation of the ‘enduring dialectic’ between human thought and natural processes, one in which the future is defined by the past. What he fails to mention is that many of his contemporaries had already begun to formulate and implement these same ideas and arguments by the time he wrote his book a few years later. A ‘dramatis personae’, or more accurately, a ‘double strand of meaning’ is woven through the ideas and terminology that he proposes. Why are</text>

The former is defined by Horkheimer as the intellectual and organisational foundation of modernity; the latter by Condon as the cultural and organisational genesis of contemporary culture. Both thinkers were born in Budapest in May 1915.2 	Technology and culture have come a long way since their origins in nineteenth-century Europe, and much can be said about their emancipatory potential. However, one has to go back much further in order to grasp the potentials of cultural production in the twenty-first century. The history of art and design, for example, which is often cited as constituting the foundation of modernity, isn’t going to cut it any more than the history of agriculture and urbanisation in the twentieth century. Culture is going to play a much more important role in the twenty-first century than previously thought. 	The potential of cultural resources is a much more potent determinant of cultural outcomes than one might first assume. The histories of nineteenth-century cultural interventions in the US and elsewhere are replete with examples of how technological innovation and cultural imperialism transformed previously rural settings into urbanised suburbs and cities where lifestyles dictated by the machine no longer constrained</text>

In the 21st century, the debate around artificial intelligence and the social implications of its potential hashed out in the pages of the New York Times, in the lead articles in the New York Daily News and in the leading literary and literary periodicals of the day, including The New Republic, The New Inquiry and The New Inquiry Magazine. 	The debates that emerged in the 1990s, fuelled by the work of Michael Heinz and his colleagues, suggested a split between the thinkers who emerged in the wake of John Nash’s work and those who came out of the wake of Stuart Mills and John Graham Kerr’s work. These split into two broad camps: those who argued that we needed to create new kinds of cognitive tools that could interpret and manipulate data (in the sense of Intelligence Intelligence) and those who argued that we</text>

Both terms reflect trends in the modern world – technological change is thought to have begun with the advent of modern commerce – but the respective terms are of a piece with one another. The relationship between science and religion is thought to have begun with the Enlightenment and has continued to this day. If science and religion are to be taken seriously in the 21st century, then art and scientific research are to be taken seriously too. The importance of this critical and influential work – both in establishing the boundaries of what counts as art and what is considered science – cannot be underestimated. The notion that science and art may now be considered equal and that the future inhabitants of Earth will likely follow the paths set by our species is a reality that few in positions of power are willing to confront or comprehend.  	The Guggenheim Diaspora, an artistic and curatorial initiative jointly managed by the New Art Gallery and Grantham Research Institute, is one such effort.2 	In the 1990s, Gran</text>

The former is defined by Horkheimer as the intellectual and organisational foundation of modernity; the latter by Condon as the cultural and organisational genesis of contemporary culture. Both thinkers were born in 1946 and have been influential in the development of contemporary culture theory, which is closely related to what I have been calling Culture and Politics. In recent years, cultural theorists have turned to the Envisioning Society (founded in 1974 by Bernard C. DeCerteau and Jean L. Friedman) as an alternative to the Modern School of Arts and Sciences that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, and which focused on science and mathematical culture. The Envisioning Society’s approach to culture, as opposed to the more ‘cultural’ representations of the social sciences, is what I have been calling ‘the Renaissance of Values’.2 	The phrase ‘Renaissance of Values’ refers to a specific intellectual and organisational turn in the cultural histories of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It is a ‘glimmer of hope’ in terms of the social consequences of new social formations</text>

The former is defined by Horkheimer as the intellectual and organisational foundation of modernity; the latter by Condon as the cultural and organisational genesis of contemporary culture. Both thinkers understood the value of a critical and informed public sphere, but in different ways. While Kripke sees the  	public sphere as one that must be preserved in order to build a future society, Condon proposes a different kind of public sphere through which cultural activity can take root and prosper: the kind that is constituted by and for the common good. Kripke sees the public sphere as a site of conflict that society creates through its own contradictions and discontents, which is why he thinks of it as an ‘emerging area’ of concern. Condon, by contrast, sees the public sphere as a site of potential solutions that society presents itself with, and which can and will increase in power, wealth and variety as a consequence of in situ and outer space.2 	In both Horkheimer and Condon’s accounts, the emergence of new technologies, and the social upheavals that they engender, exert a</text>

The public are not omniscient; rather, they need to be given the benefit of the doubt, and sometimes a willingness to alter their expectations and beliefs based on evidence.  A public that is willing to alter its expectations and beliefs about art and art history may change its views about other art forms, and may even happen on some issues. But it does not constitute proof that those views would become reality.  And while the public does have a set of expectations, they are not the subject of the artist’s work, which is always artist-specific and thus subject to change with the changing times. So while the public may change their minds, those who stand for the arts generally do not, and those who do not, do not always change their minds.1  And as a contemporary art historian I have to say that I think we live in a political art-historical art-performativist art-journalism-cum-visual-media-cum-podcast that is increasingly marginalized by contemporary art and is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from art-as-art.   The reason for this is simple: the art-hist</text>

In the public arena, the public image is made up of many voices that often have diametrically opposed ideas, perspectives and outcomes. For example, the endowment funders (funded by the Arts Council, the National Museums Board and other government bodies) have long coveted a return on their investment in the city by way of a charge to the city, usually around 20 per cent of the value of the works produced in the city. The Biennial has repeatedly asserted that its investment in the city is ‘worthless’, and in a recent interview with the New York Times, Francis Maurel, the Biennial’s president, was quoted as saying: although the biennial does not produce its own works, it does rely on artists and other stakeholders contributing to make the art. So, the biennial as an institution is often made up of people who came to the institution through other channels, and who were therefore less likely to become</text>

If the evidence is weak, or the ‘public’ is not given the information it needs, what can be expected? In the 2010 census, around 11.5 million British citizens identified as British citizens by birth or descent; of these, around 8.5 million (97.5%) identified as British citizens through marriage, and around 2.5 million (50.5%) as belonging to a racial or ethnic minority group.1  A 2011 British census further states that there are now over 11.5 billion people on earth; of these, 8.5 billion people are members of one of the 5+ billion+ species of human beings on the planet.2  A natural starting place, the notion of &quot;who am I really speaking to?&quot; may have some appeal to a public alienated by the fragmentation of identity, but in reality, who we really are as individuals, or what we think we are, is far more important.  The notion of ancestry may be a</text>

Whether the public perceived it this way was another issue. The public do not identify with a generic ‘well, that’; rather, they identify with a specific person or set of people, usually a collective, often articulated as a collective. The ‘public’ has a set of expectations and a voice within that set.  The public are not omniscient; rather, they need to be given the benefit of the doubt, and sometimes a willingness to alter their expectations and beliefs based on evidence and logic. The ability to alter one’s expectations and beliefs is a crucial tool for challenging power and creating alternatives.  The ability to identify and change one’s expectations and beliefs is a crucial tool for challenging power and creating alternatives.  The question becomes, can the artist be empowered to create alternatives? This is where the new modus operandi emerges, and it is the modus operandi of the future society. It may be that the artist can become empowered by the new norm, but this occurs only after much more is learnt, and is a long way from the artist’s conception of those things.  The modus operandi may well evolve alongside the social, and the artist’s contribution to it may well be a nominal one. In the present, the contribution to it comes from those who are already in positions of influence, and the artist’s contribution to it is a nominal one.  The modus operandi may well evolve</text>

The ‘public’ has a set of expectations and a voice within that set.  The public are not omniscient; rather, they need to be given the benefit of the doubt, and sometimes a willingness to alter their expectations and beliefs based on evidence. For example, we could make the claim that the success of the Arts Council was due to the number of members, rather than the quality of the artist, who represented the public at the polls in 1997. The Arts Council had been founded as a ‘board of governors’, with the board of trustees consisting of artists, writers and others with a range of expertise. The voters had a say in the composition of the group, and their views on who should be on the council were much more influential than the artist’s, or even the writer’s, or even the members of the creative team.  Another example is the Academy of Music, where the Academy members included multi-disciplinary artists, composers, arrangers and designers. The key was that the public, artists included, could find something to engage with; something to relate to, and something to learn from.  One of the ways in which the Arts Council has worked with the Academy</text>

The ‘public’ has a set of expectations and a voice within that set.  The public are not omniscient; rather, they need to be given the benefit of the doubt, and sometimes a willingness to alter their expectations and beliefs based on evidence, logic and experience.  As an example, the public perception of 9/11/2001 was shaped by documentary evidence, including critical thinking about the evidence presented, as well as critical thinking about the broader political and social context in which the war on terror was implemented. Film, television, essay and even website reviews frequently engage with the decision to participate in such a war; 9/11/2001 was a collective event that required a sustained public discourse and debate, and thus the public was a critical part of that process.  The public are not angels; rather, they have agency and should be given the benefit of the doubt before undertaking any action that could lead to a conflict. And the public are not invincible either; although the public are the dominant actors in the world of entertainment, fashion, music and games, they are by nature insecure and often need to be protected from the risks and pitfalls of real-life situations. But the public is a critical part of building a public sphere,</text>

The public are not omniscient; rather, they need to be given the benefit of the doubt, and sometimes a willingness to alter their expectations and beliefs based on evidence and logic.  The second element in the public sphere – the voice – is a necessary precondition for any voice to be taken seriously. Yet the essential difference between the artist and the public, as understood by the arts council, is that the latter is a fixed and habitual audience, one that is ‘born again’ every time the arts are performed. The public sphere thus needs a creator who is constantly (re)generating it, who responds to (re)edible behaviour, and who produces (re)forms that others will follow. This is not to say that the arts councilor-manager should be a saint, nor that the arts person should be a god; nor that the arts should dictate everything else that people do. Nor is it to say that the arts should dictate everything else; rather, the arts councilor-manager should endeavour to engage with the people in a way that is as accessible as possible, and to produce works that are as contextually</text>

The public are not omniscient; rather, they need to be given the benefit of the doubt, and sometimes a willingness to alter their expectations and beliefs based on evidence and logic.  The problem with the MFA in this scenario is that the established model of the artist is gradually replaced with a new one, and the established artist is left behind. In the longer run, this happens because the established model of the artist is ‘too embedded’ in the cultural fabric of the university to be easily dislodged.   One might argue that the  	integrity of the arts institution is also compromised by the fact that the established form of the arts is often used as a shield from criticism, since criticism is perceived by students as a threat to the cherished institutional good. In this model, the arts are often made into a ‘positive’ instrument through which the values of the academy can be challenged and rebutted. In the ‘public’ eye, this is often seen as ‘austerity’, and as such is an attack on the public sector and a threat to the institutional values of the university.</text>

The public are not omniscient; rather, they need to be given the benefit of the doubt, and sometimes a willingness to alter their expectations and beliefs based on evidence and logic.  A final example of this kind of persuasive power is found in the case of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The Wall Street protesters had the audacity to call themselves ‘workers’ despite knowing full well that this was only a campaign slogan and a trap set up by the financial sector to keep the working class distracted and at bay. The tactic was as follows: if the artists weren’t busy, we’d be the artists; if the working class wasn’t busy, we’d be the rest of us; if the middle class wasn’t busy, we’d be the rest of us; and so on. The art world didn’t see this kind of organising as a way of bringing about radical change, whereas the Occupiers saw an opportunity to draw artists into the class struggle, and others into the anti-capitalist movement.  Ultimately, the art world didn’t want its artists to be engaged</text>

The difficulty with subverting expectations, as opposed to simply identifying with a set of expectations, is that the alterations cause disruption, and this disrupts (subverts) the notion of order within the art world as a whole.  And this is where we find ourselves today, in the age of disruption. Consider, for instance, the uproar, and subsequent legal action, that was levelled at Facebook for the way in which it managed its servers; the servers organising what people see on to Facebook pages (and elsewhere). If the social network were truly transparent and neutral, this issue would have been resolved long ago; now we know that Facebook servers do in fact actively organise what people see; that is to say, they regularly employ massive cognitive processes, using massive amounts of data, to deliver what people believe to be relevant news to Facebook pages. In a nutshell, the way in which Facebook operates, and the news that it produces, is produced in large measure through the interaction of</text>

It is a process of self-improvement and development that takes place inside the art world, and it is this process that is often over-emphasised. Contemporaneous events and the dynamic between art and commerce are often cited as an example of the failure of the ANT project, but as we will see, this is an example of an artist being invited to work alongside some of the world’s most powerful commercial and media interests. 	[iii] The project was also partially funded by the European commission, and in 2007 the Italian state established the ANT Centro Cultural Florentine dell Alta (ACCF). The aim of the new centre was clearly to counter what it saw as the inherent commercialism of the digital media landscape by encouraging the collaborative, collaborative study of art and the media with an evident focus on art and culture as a transnational medium.

[ii] Contrary to the perception of some artists and the public, collaboration and collaboration-with-other-artists is not a glamorous process in which the artist is either some kind of glamorous muse or some kind of glamorous patron. It is a process of self-reflection and development, which is often quite painful, and it entails risk-taking and risky behaviour, both financially and culturally. It is a process of learning and adapting, which is often not glamorous, but which is productive, creative and often fascinating. It is also a process of vulnerability and vulnerability is the word. The ANT project is a reflection of such ongoing, long-term, and delicate processes, but it is also a process of its own vulnerability, which is part of its intrinsic power. The word ‘real’ is increasingly frequently used in relation to the conceptualisation of human social agency, and the potential of artists and curators to play substantive roles in creating meaning and agency in their audiences, as is often implied by the broader public discourse on the art world as a whole.

[iii] Contrary to the impression given by some critics and artists, the ANT project was not a PR or PR-shoot at all, but rather a process of research and questioning as to how we as a public perceive the role and the responsibilities of our art institutions and artists–past, present and future. The project did not purvey any sort of simplistic, cutesy ideal of artist-manager as some artists might wish, but rather sought to map out a possible future for an artistically-inclined community.

[iii] This is generally agreed to be the case in the UK, although as is often the case, the sources of funding for an art institution are often hidden. For example, the arts funding formula allocated to the London School of Art was written into the budget in 1974, and the formula was kept secret until 1988, when an access to information request by then Home Secretary Harold Hill confirmed its existence.

[ii] Contrary to the perception of some artists and the public, collaboration and collaboration-with-other-artists is not a glamorous process in which the artist is either some kind of glamorous muse or some kind of glamorous patron. It is a process of pragmatism, necessity and research. The Biennale asked artists to consider the institutionalised nature of their art and the systemic nature of their production. Assembled by and for the art public, the Biennale was not, as some have alleged, funded by the Art Market or the Arts Council, nor were its forms of public consumption or consumption outside the art market. The Biennale was clearly a public space project, and as such it intended to connect with the local arts community through its own art and cultural portfolio, and thereby the institutions and market forces that it was installed against. 	[iii] This kind of institutionalised, institutionalised-ness is a frequent feature of the Biennale, and it is easy to understand why. The biennale has institutionalised itself, and its trustees and managers have a set of tools and resources with which to be able to intervene wherever and however it wants to. The Biennale has a budget</text>

It is a process of making, and the making of which has a brutal impact on the natural resources and social institutions of the place where the work is done. The term ‘collaborative’ is frequently used in relation to the use of art resources, but in this context it is more appropriate to use the word ‘natural resource’. The cultural ecology of the large‐scale manipulation of resources is a collective and connected ecology, and thus an ecological fallacy is frequently used to excuse the exploitative practices of a particular industrial or financial complex. The co-creation of art resources, whether that occurs through the joint‐working of artists and art professionals, the co-production of rich and poor neighbourhoods, or the co-production of renewable resources such as oil and natural gas, is an ongoing and important project, that cannot be achieved through the production of art alone.

The demand for art from the public is real, but the art itself and the collaborative working process that results is rarefied and privileged. The ANT project is no exception to this. The artworks and their packaging were carefully curated with a public-pleasing focus on their cultural value, and the artist herself was often apparent in the packaging only at a distance. The artist’s voice was often over-dubious, and her suggestions and judgements on specific projects were often mischievous, but she was always committed to finding a way to bring artistic expression to bear in the project. Her ideas were not without merit, and whilst her overall proposal was never going to be perfect, she put in long hours of research and development, and the whole project was always on the right track. Contradictions and conflicts were inevitable in such a long-term project, but the</text>

The term 'collaboration' appears nowhere in the project description, nor does it occur in the context of the ANT project. The word’s initial e is short and sweet, and its frequency with the project suggests a very deliberate intention. The name eventually catches on and other meanings are given to the actions taken in response to initial conceptual mistakes and eventual creative black-hole. These actions are critiqued, and new definitions of what collaboration means emerge, among them ‘collaborative identity’ and ‘collaborative work’.

The word ‘contemporary art’ is often used synonymously with ‘instant art’, but in the context of the ANT project, the word ‘contemporary art’ was itself frequently used in a slightly negative, limiting way. For some critics and artists, the word ‘contemporary’ referred to art that was too new and had its own unique set of practices and values, whereas the ‘instant’ referred to art that had been subjected to the same kinds of art practices and values but was perceived as contemporary. For Stuart Ringholt, the late Jonathan Crary, an art critic for the Sunday Times, who died in 2011: ‘Ringholt said that Ringholt’s paintings were ‘a kind of memory trapped between a rock and a hard place.’ He concluded: �</text>

The Museum of Modern Art’s collection of surreal and fantastic art, as well as the British Library’s collection of digitised books covering the history of science and natural science, were brought together in the 1920s, when a collection of fifty rare books was donated by the British Naturalist’s Association. The aim of the collaboration was to archive and discuss the weird and wonderful things that the two museums had collected over the years. The curators did not have a precise collection of what they called their surreal and fantastic collection, but they did have a collection of ideas and objects, which they called their collection of ideas. The collection of ideas was a living organism, constantly augmenting and augmenting itself, constantly shifting and fluctuating – maturing and failing, in the process, until it produced a collection that was, in its turn, a living organism. The curators of the London and New Museum commissions, both Dali’s and those of MOCAD, were both active in this new biennial form.

The enfant terrible quickly became an object of ridicule, but its roots lay in a collaboration between the curators of the two museums, in the early twentieth century. The Museum of Modern Art’s collection of surreal and fantastic art, as well as the British Library’s collection of digitised books covering the history of science and natural science, were brought together in the 1920s, when a collection of fifty rare books was donated by the British Library. The curators of the two exhibitions were Professors John Graham Kerr and Peter Brook, both of whom had special collections in their collections of science and natural-science fiction novels. Professors Kerr and Brook, along with other experts in this field, examined the material in the rare books with an eye to what they called ‘the first chapter of the Major Work of English Science Fiction, or perhaps to what might later be called the ‘Second Coming of English Science Fiction’. The aim of their research was to show how the speculative ideas and techniques of science fiction influenced the social and political world through the mechanisms of language and how literature and cultural practices interacted to produce certain fictions. In this sense, ‘literature’ was seen as a more natural extension of ‘science’, and the body of literature was seen as both the site of pre-scientific thought and an evolving science. The curators of the two exhibitions thought this a new kind of science,</text>

The curators of both museums were William Harvey and Edward Wadsworth, who were both born in 1897. Harvey and Wadsworth were both archivists at the British Library, and their collections of texts on contemporary art and culture were a good source of biographical information for the Museum of Modern Art, which was building its archive. The collection of texts, some of which are over two million words long, is a good representation of the curatorial thinking of the century: it records and documents the thinking of artists, critics and others who have influenced and influenced generations of artists, critics and others. The collection also includes books about the twentieth century, which is a good source of information about the curatorial priorities of the century.

The transnational exchange of goods and ideas assumed new forms: goods transported from one country to another, information exchanged across national boundaries, behaviourally mediated exchange – all of which are objects of ourist desire. The desire for a ‘pure’ Israelite state, for example, is the motivating force behind the museum’s exhibition of modern art and design, which is at once a celebration of modernity and a repudiation of it. In the late twentieth century, the rise of Israel and the mass immigration of people to the Middle East coincided with a period of growing up of the indigenous peoples of the region. As a result, the languages of Israel and the Palestinian people today span widely across the board – being recognized as official ‘nationalities’ by multiple national governments,</text>

The curatorial approach to the ‘modern’ in art [i.e. postmodernism] came at a time when the ‘common’ was questioning whether the common good was actually in danger. In a work published in the journal Acta Mathematica, 1915 (originally published in 1917) by the Royal Academy of Arts, Sir Edward Kaylan described the influence of modernism and postmodernism on art and culture: though he regarded modernism as a kind of perversion, Kaylan recognised the destructive potential of a culture industry on all aspects of life. Kaylan advocated a radical reorientation of cultural resources, arguing that a kind of common culture – a ‘shining sea of equalizing images’ – was necessary to sustain a democratic commonwealth. The rebalancing of images was to be achieved through what he called ‘the creative misuse of images’, arguing that this was necessary in order to achieve ‘the utopian</text>

The curatorial approach to these new media constituted a new kind of curatorial fusion. In the Museum of Modern Art, the collection of photographs and videos of the H.P. Lovecraft collection, which the curators had assembled over several years, the new formalisms of curating emerged. In 1924, the Museum of Modern Art undertook the first of what would become a periodic series of photo-narratives, ‘The Ghastly Curator’, which would later be published in numerous books, including the curranty-up-on-a-stickies, which came out in 1925, ‘The Ghastly Ghastly Adventure’ in 1926, and ‘The Ghastly Ghastly Letter’ in 1937. In these and other books, the collection was supplemented by a host of photographs and videos, many of which were published between the two years between the two photos.

The new museum was named for Charles Dickens, whose work, ‘On A Sunday Morning’, appeared in the March 1922 issue of the magazine. Dickens was a writer famous for his philanthropic giving, and his name appeared more than twenty-five times in the article, including twenty-six times in the footnotes. In the introduction, the biennial’s editor, George John Ellis, wrote: Sir George John Ellis, the biennial’s managing director, is a biennial historian (b. 1938, London) and author of Seven Ages of the Neolithic Revolution: The Rise and Fall of the Early Meeting Society, which was originally founded in London to commemorate the publication of the book It Is Good to be Alive that appeared in 1923.

The curators of the two museums worked closely together, and many of the curatorial innovations of the two periods were inspired in large measure by the feedback between the two art collections.2  In the early twentieth century, the curatorial importance of material was emphasised, and material produced for the exhibition was often used to support the cultural values of the day. In Paris, the Carnaval de Paris, organised as a ‘monument of the Invisible’, was originally conceived as a way to make visible cultural contributions outside the site of exhibition. In the 1930s, Cahiers du Cinéma, founded in Brittany, the aim of which was to host a Carnaval du Nord every two years, was invited by the government to form a ‘curatorial council’ within the site of the exposition. This would enable the council to create a ‘curatorial policy for the exposition’, its symbolic, economic and cultural values, and the development of</text>

This made the curatorial turn into an interlocutor, and the curatorial turn into a curator. Later, William Bourriaud, the American curator, would write that the amalgamation of disparate curatorial approaches is the modern museum.2   	With this new respect for the role of the curator, and his or her work, came a new interest in what Bourriaud called ‘the possible meanings of diversity’. These came to refer not to the curatorial, formal or literary qualifications of a work, but to the immensity and fluid nature of the cultural act. Bourriaud maintained that it is an act of discovery, a search, that leads to understanding, and that the newness and immersiveness of cultural acts are the result of a multiplicity of interrelated but differentiated processes. These seemingly contradictory conditions and their varied and nuanced manifestations now form essential features of the contemporary cultural act, and the curatorial is a pivotal site for this act of</text>

These rare books pointed to the important role that libraries and archives play in the fight against modernity, fascism and all those other evils that we are told are rife in the world around us. The curatorial turn in curatorial thinking, which followed soon after, is said to have been inspired by the new ‘literary realism’ that emerged in the wake of the Napoleonic wars. The new ‘realism’ turned on the old ‘classical’ and bore all the hallmarks of fascist modernism. The curators of the two new ‘periodical’s that we now call ‘literature’ found in the newly minted literature of both museums and the bibliographies of the old world. As the curators of the antiquities that are no longer read and written about, but are instead silently photographed and documented and absorbed into the ever-expanding hegemonic fantasy of globalisation, we thought it would be</text>

The energy crisis made global headlines, and it is interesting to note that the name of the oil company that was recently acquired by Chevron –––British Petroleum ––––––hasnow been changed from BP to ENI. This may be because the environmental and Indigenous communities in North America tend to identify more with the company that created the well and the tube, rather than the land that now serves as its foundation.

At the same time, the demand for energy from growing economies around the world came to determine how efficiently resources could be distributed. In other words, the extraction of oil from shale gas and tar sands didn’t produce the amount of oil needed to power modern economies, but it did cause considerable overproduction of natural resources, leading to resource wars in these regions. 	The urgent need for new kinds of energy became evident only a few years after Oil and Gas Exploration began in earnest in North Dakota and Montana in the late nineteenth century. By the 1920s, governments in Vancouver and Calgary were grappling with the excess of oil and gas, and the social and ecological havoc this caused. Rapid transit, walking to work, and horse-drawn carriages offered alternative modes of travel in the resource-scarce cities. Rapid-transit lines opened up new ways of living in resource-scarce areas. 	The horse-drawn carriages that once traveled through the city were replaced by</text>

The overproduction in the sector came about as a consequence of a number of different things, including: a) technological innovation b) an increased reliance on infrastructure c) the advent of insulating materials d) the discovery of new mineral-rich formations e) the discovery of new ballistics to power engines 	The discovery of new ballistics to power engines is a good thing, insofar as they allow cars to do more than run up and down the highway. But these are good things in their own right, and part of what makes them valuable is the fact that they allow cars to do more than run up and down the highway. 	Over the past five years, however, good things have come to an end. A vicious circle has started to form: infrastructure investment followed on technical innovation, which in turn followed on regulatory capture and partially on the side effect of a bubble.

At the same time, the discovery of oil shale and the subsequent extraction of hydrocarbons from the rock meant that the extraction of shale could be scaled back, which in turn reduced demand for energy. All of this happened at a time of massive surplus of oil, so the collapse of oil prices coincided with a huge expansion of fossil-fuel reserves, which corresponded in part to an increase in demand for energy. 	The overproduction in the sector came about as a consequence of a number of things happening at once: a) the discovery of oil shale b) the industrial revolution c) the discovery of cheap natural gas d) the transition to electric cars e) the advent of autonomous vehicles f) the advent of robotics 	Over the past five years, a number of interesting phenomena have become apparent in Istanbul and other Turkish cities that are straddling the energy and transportation boundary.

At the same time, demand for oil came to represent a greater share of global GDP, particularly in Asia. As a result, the share of renewable energies grew. 	In the past five years, however, the share of renewables in global energy supplies has outpaced the share of oil, indicating that the intermittency of renewables is affecting prices in a way that is not due to overproduction in the sector, but to the interaction of different factors. This interaction between economics and nature should generate curiosity and generate knowledge. Unfortunately, it does not. Instead, it is the other way around: the more we know, the less we need oil. 	The discovery of oil in the Bakken formation in North Dakota in the late nineteenth century sparked a boom in both oil and natural gas resources in that region, which in turn fuelled a rapid expansion of industries including concrete, lumber, hay and hay futures, as well as the development of enormous new infrastructure projects to support them.

At the height of the crisis, oil accounted for nearly half of Canada’s GDP. 	The environmental degradation caused by overproduction is another way in which biennials can exert influence change. As the biennial becomes more and more indebted to the oil industry, it is natural that its ecological degradation will come to be seen as a defining feature of the biennial. 	The environmental degradation caused by the overproduction of oil comes as no surprise to those who have been following the industry’s trajectory. As the oil industry expanded, so did the size of the oil storage tanks, which doubled in size as the global oil supply expanded. These were used to store the oil that was being produced, which meant that the total amount of oil being produced had to increase in tandem. In an attempt to accommodate this ever-greater production, the industry developed a series of technology-based defences against the ever-more complex technologies of environmental degradation that were emerging.

In the book, you focus on the role of economists in the design of the economic system that produced the excess capacity to absorb this excess energy. Can you offer any examples of economists’ work in this regard? 	In the energy sector, energy consumption is a serious issue that has been largely neglected by the mainstream discourse on sustainability. Many people still associate energy with the dirty old fossil-fuel industries of the past, but in a complex system that includes millions of small and mid-sized businesses, a focus on resource depletion does not receive as much emphasis as it does from the current economic models that rely on the excess capacity of the metropolis to process and respond to this energy. 	In the book, you focus on three distinct economic dimensions of the energy equation: the value of energy (what it represents as a commodity or good), the energy required to produce it (energy per unit of product), and the responsiveness of the energy infrastructure to fluctuations in value created by human activity</text>

In the book, you note that the environmental crisis began when the value of oil equaled just over $100 per barrel in the mid-1990s. How did that happen? 	You point out that the oil crisis in the 1980s was caused by the rapid expansion of national economies around the world fuelled by the fantasy that oil could provide the infrastructure of a future based on green growth. In many ways, the environmental crisis is an expression of this kind of economic fantasy, although I do not agree with everything you say or do. 	For example, you say that the overproduction of natural gas in the US due to overbuilding and lax regulation is a product of regulatory capture and maximisation. But this is like saying that the jet stream is a product of the cotton gin and rope. The environmental crisis in the US is a product of overproduction of both, and the resulting concomitant of a loss of value created by the need to produce more than what is allowed</text>

As a result of these shifts in value, the pace of innovation in North American oil sands remained sedentary. 	The environmental and labour costs of oil sands expansion were part of the reason why the sector was not as innovative as in other sectors. The collapse of Suncor in Alberta in 2008 severely affected the ability of workers in that sector to organize, which in turn impacted the ability of companies to invest in new technology or research and development. 	In an effort to address these issues, I co-chaired the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) conference, which took place in Ottawa in October 2011.

The worker represents the product produced by the producer; her role is one of assembling the things in the factory or warehouse – bits and pieces – into products that are sold to customers; this is different from production, which includes the actual making of products. 	The metaphor of the ‘well’ is important in that it allows us to see ecological systems in their historical or stylised forms. For example, when I visit a disused nuclear power plant in Upstate New York, I observe the abandoned sites of science and technology; decay is an inevitability. The well that feeds into the plant becomes contaminated, becomes part of a larger industrial disassembly. The aesthetic of the abandoned site intrigues me; it captures the idea of desolation with a romantic sense of place, of</text>

I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to the fact that her gallery work was very much a response to the racialised images of liberation that were emerging in the UK at the time: the Beatles, Marilyn Monroe, to name only a few. And I think that the fact that she was engaged in a number of projects in the UK at that time speaks to the way in which the art establishment at that time viewed movements for racial and gender equality as something that could be supported and leveraged through the gallery. Indeed, the fact that she was a painter and her social work focused on the experience of African-American art students in the 1970s and 1980s is a testament to this. And I think that the fact that she was a curator and that she developed her interest in art from an African diaspora perspective is a testament to how few cultural historians are drawn to the UK in the current period. There is a dearth of artists, curators, arts administrators, arts educationists and arts professionals from the UK who</text>

By the 1960s, the N.A. was waning, and its members moved on to other projects. I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to a generation of black British women who had been raised in the UK and had then emigrated to countries such as Egypt, Morocco and Algeria. These were years before the anti-immigration politics of the 1960s, and I think that part of her engagement with these black women was contextualising and political. She was writing at a time when the politics of migration was developing in the UK, and she was asking whether or not these women had been influenced by the experiences of migration into the social institution of the gallery. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the political engagement of art and the gallery was part of the agenda of the Black feminist political organisation The Black N.A. In 1974, Nadine Attewell founded the B.E.N.D. She would have been the first black female artist to be educated in the academy, and she would have been a founding member of the academy.

By the 1960s, the N.A. was waning, and its members moved on to other projects. I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to the fact that the project of creating a biennial that year was itself a response to the crisis of the position of the biennial after the war. The fact that the project was a response to the crisis of the position of the biennial in the face of major changes in government and social mores suggests a more aggressive and risky approach. The kind of crisis that the artist and her team of artists faced is a kind of internal crisis that the art world can also empathise with. The kind of crisis that the art world can also enact creative solutions to. The kind of crisis that the artists and their collaborators faced is a kind of external crisis that the biennial needs to confront. Dealing with the external crisis of the position of the art biennial is a kind of internal congruence that needs to be confronted in order to achieve new forms of participation. It is a kind of internal contradiction, and art biennials are made up of artists who have to struggle with the</text>

By the 1960s, the N.A. was waning, and its members moved on to other projects. I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to the fact that her artworks were commissioned by organisations around the world, and not herself as an independent artist. She was not making a distinction between politically engaged artists and the politically disengaged. She was performing a function in a larger social context. Her 1967 African Diaspora project  is an interesting case study in the politics of art and the political of identity, because the politics of identity is a function of what I would call the ‘political noise machine’. That is, the discourse of identity and cultural politics that produces and shapes notions of belonging, belongingness, belongingness, belonging, and so forth. The African Diaspora project emerged from Pattison’s ongoing engagement with the political nature of the art form, which was informed in part by her engagement with the work of the art historian Peter Schjeldahl. Schjeldahl was a co-editor of the New Cultural Theory journal (originally published in 1968) and a</text>

By the 1960s, the N.A. was waning, and its members moved on to other projects. I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to the fact that her work was often in direct conflict with the very identity of the African diaspora itself, and that this conflicted with the interests of her employers. She was actively engaged in challenging the identity politics that she believed were at work in the art world. I think that this is a project that will continue to haunt us to this very day.In her engagement with the Arab Spring, Pattison invoked Bertolt Brecht’s ‘Bread and Freedom’ to illustrate the futility of attempting to bring an end to the violence wrought by capitalism. She argued that since the beginning of the revolution, Brecht’s freedom ‘wasn’ had meant to provide comfort to ‘a privileged few’. In other words, the revolution would not end unless people became sufficiently deprived.  The classical conception of the market as a productive process – that is, the ability to produce more and more – seems to be deeply flawed. Capitalism reproduces itself</text>

By the 1960s, the N.A. was waning, and its members moved on to other projects. I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to the inter-generational flow of migration, and I think that she was also engaging with the fact that migration is a gas, and while it is a part of our lived experience, it is also a created quality that is thrust upon us. When we leave Africa to come to America or Europe, we are both pilgrims, and the migrant is a new arrival, who is welcomed with open arms but who has to negotiate the new culture wars that are being waged in the USA and Europe. I would view Pattison’s engagement with the migrant as being framed in terms of the same humanist principles that would guide an artist such as herself, and I think that her self-presentation as an artist rather than a political activist would have been more influential, and perhaps more successful, had she not been driven by her avant garde prose and her belief that the artist was more valuable. In the 1950s and early 1960s, artists were more easily moulded into participation in the</text>

Much of her contemporary interest in the arts was informed by her involvement in the Black feminist political organisation The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People. The group was active in the USA during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and her interest in the arts is reinforced by the fact that the N.A. was founded by a transatlantic transatlantic lesbian black feminist network. The group was also active in the UK and France, where they met regularly between 1961 and 1968. By the 1960s, the N.A. was waning, and its members moved on to other projects. I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to the fact that she was part of a community of artists who were artists in their own right, and she was engaging with the fact that she was a lesbian, which at the time was uncommon in her cohort. She was also engaged in activism, and I think that she saw herself as a public figure rather than an artist. She was heavily involved in the Black feminist political organisation The Black Democracy, and she was a member of that organisation’s board of directors. She was also a co-founder of the Black Student Union, and in the early 1970s she organised a student strike against cuts to education. She was a leader of the Black Arts movement, and I think that she understood the politics of the art strike more than the strikers. She had a plan B: there was a plan B to divert the art strike into the education of the student body, and to have another art fair in the university administration. There is a very interesting quote from John Lennon</text>

I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to the fact that the forces of apartheid were dismantled in South Africa and other parts of the Third World. I don’t think that she had a particularly nuanced understanding of the ways in which race was still a factor in the way in which black bodies were constituted and constituted identities. Black feminism was a political organisation at the time, and although its political aims were valid, the fact that it was founded in response to the threat of institutionalised racism meant that its focus was on winning political power for black people meant that it was also an organisation that was vulnerable to the politics of victimisation. And so its focus on the politics of marginalisation of black people at a particular moment in time is interesting. And to some degree, I guess, my interest in this work is to some degree to do with the politics of marginalisation. Black women were already becoming more politicalised through the work of the 1960s and early 1970s, and the creation of the N.A. and the Black Panther</text>

I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to a pre-existing tension that existed between the USA and the Caribbean: the former due to its greater economic independence, the latter due to its proximity to slave markets. In other words, the Caribbean is the place where the imperialist wants his or her wares: cheap labour, exploited labour. But what the Caribbean lacks is class, and what the USA has is race, and race is the place where class struggle is most acute. So the question is where race plays a more significant role in the socio-political terrain of the Caribbean than in the US. I would argue that it is still relatively easy to portray the USA as a racist society, while in reality the opposite is true. The economic relationship between the USA and the Caribbean was created on the backs of slaves, and the development of post-slavery Caribbean society was largely due to the work of black men like yourself who came to the Americas and worked the plantations. This is not to downplay the importance of these actors, but</text>

I think that in her engagement with the African diaspora, Pattison was referring to the fact that her work was often in conflict with other artists, and also to the fact that her projects were often in conflict with each other. She was engaged in a fierce competition with another artist, Jean Renoir, to be the first to commission a painting from Africa. Renoir was consistently ahead, but Pattison went on to win the competition and establish herself as one of the most important contemporary artists. Her engagement with the African diaspora is informed by her engagement with the arts in general, and her engagement with African diasporas in particular. She was clearly not making a distinction between black and white artists, or between those who were engaged with art and those who weren’t. Rather, I think, she was engaging with the fact that African artists were often excluded from the cultural mainstream in the USA, and that this was a critical crisis. I don’t think that her engagement with the African diaspora was limited to that one city in the USA</text>

The double-edged sword is that it opens two seemingly unrelated windows at the same time; one which is all about present conditions while ignoring past glories; and the other, the interesting but troubled past which is all but erased from view. This double sense of opening and closing is characteristic of contemporary art’s ambivalent ontology, where the potentialities and costs of different futures are imagined to interpenetrate and connect.[3] The double sense of modernity is also characteristic of curatorial work, where the future and the past are imagined to coexist in a kaleidoscope of different experiences and worlds. While the futuristic future is imagined to be built by machines, the messy past is imagined to exist in parallel universes where the inevitable collision between them creates what can only be described as a chaotic feedback loop. The result is a metainterface: a condition where different worlds collide and create what might be called ‘infrastructure’. And so, too, the</text>

The double-edged sword is a double-sided sword: it can be both a window and a cloak. At the same time, its double-faced mask invites both a broad brush and an accurate description. The book and the exhibition offered a window on a future that could be seen through the story of the city’s rapid growth and metainformation. Through a combination of the author’s own narrative and on-site interviews with a number of key players, the exhibition was able to provide a first hand account of this ever-metainformation. It is this ‘true story’ that is told in the exhibition, through personal reflections and in-depth research that draws on over a decade of research. It is a ‘fictional’ story that is told through a number of fictional characters, but the form takes root in each of us and remains present even after we are no longer with it (however, this is not entirely true; it is more of a ‘</text>

The double-edged sword is a double-faced risk/high reward situation. On the one hand, a public gallery space like the Temple might witness a proliferation of cultural tourism as a direct result of the changes taking place in the city. On the other, a biennial like Becoming Future City might become a tourist attraction and even a tool in the local government’s cultural policy. In order to assess the potential benefits and risks, we asked twelve community leaders from the local art community if they thought the exhibition format might be useful in assisting the development of a local artworld experience. Eight of them (including myself) agreed that the exhibition format could be used to tell a story, while the remaining four (including two curators) disagreed. There were no conflicts of interest in the context of the discussion, and the only personal motivation for not participating was money. The reason I say this is that the art community has historically been very passive, not standing up for what is right despite their overwhelming power</text>

The double-edged sword is what actor Sean Bean described as the double bind of ‘being a comedian and being an antiquarian’.[5] The thorn in the side of this delicate double-edged sword is the creeping modernity that threatens to consume everything around it. In the words of Bernard Beullu, a name that many in the curatorial canon now remember: ‘Bill Mauldin, Michael Ames, Sir Peter Blake, Michael Heizer, Peter McCaughey, Graham Turner, David Mackenzie, David Luty, Roald Dahl and Noel Burch. These are just some of many names that have found their way into the curatorial canon. The sheer number of names in the canon is mystifying, as is the way in which they are intermingled. There is a reason why there are sixteenth-century Icelandic, Middle Eastern and African names in the Oxford English Dictionary. If the word ‘curator’ is to have any real sense, it must</text>

The double-edged sword is the double dose of transparency and marketability. As money has become more of a constraint, the exhibition format has come to depend on the status of its curators, curators, artists and visitors. If the curatorial agenda is left unfulfilled, or even fails to materialise its potential, the exhibition is often left disappointed and empty-handed.  At the same time, the status of the biennale as a federally-funded institution has come to determine how much of the total price is passed on to the local community. In the age of the biennial, the biennial as a full-fledged institution is becoming increasingly important as a distributor of cultural goods and images. In today’s world, this includes everything from a city’s commitment to arts education to a city’s ability to fund independent cultural institutions. As a result, the biennale has become increasingly important in shaping cultural practices in the city.  A biennale is an</text>

The double-edged sword is a frequent source of conflict for a city’s urban population, as those on the receiving end of gentrification push back against urban sprawl. In an attempt to address this double-edged sword, some in the creative class think that a museum should be a home for the city’s future, while those who see a museum as an inherently unstable building style and grave threat to the city’s future feel that a museum should be perpetually on the lookout for potential gentrification schemes. The Museum of Modern Art is the last institution standing in the former gentrification arms race, but it’s also the oldest and most traditional, so its position is untenable in the face of increasingly diverse and mobile urban populations.  The Museum of Modern Art is a national treasure, and its permanent collection of rare books, on loan from the Singapore Cultural Exchange (SCE), is an essential part of its urban heritage.

The double-edged sword of the biennale is its ability to project a specific narrative across multiple sites and time periods. In the 1960s and 1970s, the biennale was able to achieve this through the ‘leap of faith’ (taking a long view) in the form of multiple short articles, each contributing to a single story. The problem with the biennale today is that narrative is an inherently unstable proposition.  The New York Times ran an article on October 14, 2017, titled, ‘When Narrative Collides’, that underlines the dangerous new condition that makes possible the merging of multiple media: from the news to the arts to the non-news media and beyond. In a world where information is normalized and is collated constantly (as a side effect of everything from neuroscience to biennials to museums), it is not unusual to encounter a ‘big data’ narrative that attempts to tell a story across multiple platforms.

The double-edged sword is the double bind of the historical vernacular, in which the history of a city is written from top to bottom, not from top to bottom.  	In the case of a city such as Singapore, whose history begins with the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1421, the historiography of its future urban development sits uncomfortably somewhere in-between. The city that emerged from the port city in the fifteenth century is a complex mix of languages, multiple forms of governance, multiverses of interpretation, and a diverse set of cultural practices. But what happens after the port city is dismantled and rebuilt in stages over the next millennium is anything but clear. 	As John Berger remarked in a 1993 essay about the relationship of history and geopolitics, ‘Histories are made up of many smaller stories told together. And in the present, these many smaller stories are made up of many more stories told at the same time.’[13] And if</text>

The double-edged sword is a double dose of uncertainty: on the one hand, the status quo can be threatened, and on the other, the threatened status quo can be preserved. This double-edged sword has been a frequent feature of the contemporary world: in the twentieth century, it was the art world that sought to define and institutionalise the post-WWII global; in the twenty-first century, it is the art world that is threatened by an uncertain future. Modernisms greatest counterattack against this double-edged sword was its own kind of global, in which art and culture became objects of exchange, not soldiers of history, nor indeed future custodians of the past, but located somewhere between past and present, making possible the post-WWII gilded gilded bubble. Modernism did not invent the modern museum or the modern urban environment, but it has certainly institutionalised and democratised them, making them visible and present for all to see.

The double-edged sword is an ideal for a project like this, in that it offers the potential for rapid prototyping while also offering a window on an uncertain future.  One could argue, however, that the double-edged sword is also its greatest strength.  As the project approached its end, the exhibition became a kind of Trojan Horse: it appeared then as a kind of a thank you for everything the city had already done, then it suddenly appeared as though everything the city had ever done could be done better. At the same time, it provided the space for this in itself, so that the viewer could question and perhaps change their minds. The Trojan Horse could be a hoax or it could be a true story. The choice was up to the viewer.  As the exhibition approached its end, the viewer’s mood shifted from elation at the new found knowledge to despair at the knowledge itself.

The collected essays, some published between 1968 and 1976, form the basis for a new kind of urban historiography, one that looks to the past rather than to the present in constructing an alternative future urbanism. In doing so, the essays provide a possible way to begin to understand, or perhaps to create if not a new urbanism then an alternative future urbanism.
