How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. The reason why they are so strongly associated with technological obsolescence is precisely because technological change always seems to bring with it a new set of problems of some kind. The infrastructural complex is a kind of anvil: ever more powerful, more pervasive and more prone to failure. Yet despite its obvious inability to perform new kinds of jobs or to reshape itself in new ways, the infrastructural future in which we inhabit seems to be moving at an ever faster clip. Cities are becoming ever more data-driven, connected and electronic, and so it is easy to understand the infrastructural future in terms of what can be done with the data. Cities are the new islands; the new planet. But there is another context and set of questions that are of much more relevance to us as individuals and local communities now inhabiting the city: what are the politics of habit? What is the politics of displacement? What are the ways in which our cities are being displaced in a</text>

How are we all being lost? How do we create new ways of being connected and interconnected? How do we build new kinds of cities? How do we imagine new futures for ourselves and the places around us? How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. If there is no internal drive to new ideas, new infrastructures will sprout up in places where there is once only farmland, taking the place of the once dominant forms of human habitation. In the long run, they may even become useful again. But for now, the titans of industry cling to their traditional forms of power and so, too, do we. The upshot is that, if there is going to be new thinking put into places, it has to happen from top to bottom. New infrastructures have to be designed with communities in mind, and new ways of being connected and interconnected. A question that constantly crops up is what can be done to support the places that are being built? And, of course, the vital question is what can be done to make the places that are being built relevant again?Infrastructures don’t just carry capital; they are also constantly directed to meet the needs of stakeholders, citizens and migrants.

How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. A skyscraper may be built on the back of a previously existing hydrocarbon resource, but it is also built upon the back of a belief in the inevitability of periodic catastrophic failure. The reason why the hydrocarbons that make up the city are able to exist in the first place is because the city was designed with them in mind as its basic building material and also because, through a continual drip, drip, of new infrastructure is added – fuelling the myth of unlimited growth. Cities, and particularly mid-sized cities, are able to accumulate resources indefinitely, while also supporting an ever-expanding infrastructure that is able to handle the ever-greater demands placed on it. This is possible because of the infrastructural complex that is built into mid-sized cities – and especially mid-sized towns – and is funded almost entirely with tax revenues from the mid-sized city. And so, while the infrastructural may not exactly add value to its surroundings, it is able</text>

How are we all being lost? How do we create new ways of being connected and interconnected? How do we build new kinds of cities? How do we imagine new futures for ourselves and the places around us? How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. Failures in one area – such as the rail network in the UK, or in the electronics industry in the US – exert a downward pressure on demand for parts and raw materials, which in turn exerts a downward pressure on the prices paid by manufacturers for such components. At the same time, economies of scale allow manufacturers to undercut one another at a deep level. If one generation of engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs can build a better plane, train a porter or deliver pizzas overseas, then others will follow suit. And if those porters and touts eventually decide to open branches in their respective cities, then the infrastructures will be able to absorb the new jobs created by the increased numbers of people using them.In the US, the infrastructural turn around design comes about as a by-product of the post-WWII economic boom. The war industries of computer chips and electronic components became fablicals for trade, and the rise of trans-shipment points of</text>

How are we all being lost? How do we create new ways of being connected and interconnected? How do we build new kinds of cities? How do we imagine new futures for ourselves and the places around us? How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. The reason why they are so strongly linked to resource scarcity is precisely because of the inefficiency of the resource-starved metropolis: there is no return on investment for the trouble. Instead, the metropolis builds new infrastructures and constantly upgrades itself. This inevitably generates endless internal conflict and turbulence, which in turn requires ever more resources are consumed (renewable energies being a mainstay in metros of every description, including Detroit, but also in the downtown core where skyscrapers are replaced with hummus stands and a host of other urban products that add nothing to the metropolis but add to supply chains). And so the cycle goes on. New infrastructures are needed, but only if the city is resilient enough to handle them. Otherwise, the cities that comprise the metropolis will remain vulnerable to resource scarcity and will need to be expanded in order to accommodate a growing metropolis.The key to understanding this in-depth historical narrative is in fact not in the city</text>

How are we all being lost? How do we create new ways of being connected and interconnected? How do we build new kinds of cities? How do we imagine new futures for ourselves and the places around us? How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. The reason why they are so deeply embedded in the local landscape and why we are so attached to them is because they are so able to absorb and dissipate any shock – even shocking ones as a result of disruptive technologies, like urbanisation and industrialisation. If you tear them down and build something else, you build something else. And so it continues.Why are we so attached to the mundane and the quantifiable? Because we are attached to them because we cannot shake them. The upshot of this is that when the infrastructures of the metropolis fail, we actually lose some of our attachment to the city. We lose our attachment to the fact that the building that we call home is going to be replaced with a shop window that we cannot access because the building is automated? We lose our attachment to the fact that the factory that we call our culture is going to be replaced with a factory that replaces workers with robots? We lose our attachment to the fact that the street is going</text>

How are we all being lost? How do we create new ways of being connected and interconnected? How do we build new kinds of cities? How do we imagine new futures for ourselves and the places around us? How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. The reason why they are so deeply embedded in the social and cultural fabric – why they are able to function in the context of a social or cultural revolution – is because they are run by, for, and depend on the collective will of a majority of people. The will to change is in fact overwhelmingly the responsibility of a minority. So while the system may produce catastrophes – World Wars, pandemics, floods, droughts, epidemics – it also has other more subtle ways of intervening in the world to alter who gets to define the terms on which the system is built, and to make things happen that are in some cases quite unexpected and in others quite forceful.Here, then, is a tentative list of some of the more visible systems that have, since the 1990s, been designed to respond to demands for change within a defined public or cultural constituency:The welfare state, from its beginnings in the mid-nineteenth century in response to labor unrest in the early twentieth century</text>

How are we all being lost? How do we create new ways of being connected and interconnected? How do we build new kinds of cities? How do we imagine new futures for ourselves and the places around us? How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. The reason why they are so deeply invested in retaining their current form – whether that is through inertia, capital accumulation, political control or some combination of the three – is precisely because failure is both predictable (i.e. can be prevented) and inconvenient. It is both economically costly to repair or replace, and is also politically unstable; overturning a firm's infrastructural imperatives is politically costly, and capital is more mobile (i.e. more exposed to resource depletion and climate change) than ever before. So while it is true that there are large public schemes underway to help decarbonise the transport and energy systems of cities, and that are committed to providing new ways of being connected and interconnected in the future, there is also a strong incentive to stop doing what so many of us would prefer to remain invisible to, or to change our infrastructural infrastructures and continue to live our lives largely disconnected from the planet.Is there a way of breaking this block</text>

How are we all being lost? How do we create new ways of being connected and interconnected? How do we build new kinds of cities? How do we imagine new futures for ourselves and the places around us? How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. The reason why they are so much more vulnerable to disruption and collapse is that the infrastructures that are their platforms or frames or bases or resources or juice source or raw material suppliers or recyclers – whether it is the electronics that power them, the databases that power them, the social functions that underpin them, the knowledge that powers them, and so on – are all being continuously replaced. And so it is that we, as consumers and consumers-pleasers of infrastructures, are sucked into a cycle of ever-increasing consumption that is almost completely dependent on the information technologies of the day. And so, once we have become cogs in this infrastructural machine, we are then left to struggle, to try to plug ourselves back in, to feed ourselves, to heat our homes and carry on doing all the same.  	But, as we have seen, this only works in certain defined frontiers. There are countless other ways of interacting and growing into</text>

How do we imagine new cultures?Infrastructures are complex, dynamic and prone to fail, but they are also largely self-perpetuating. As industrialisation unfolded, so too did the infrastructures that would underpin it – but with it, inevitably, came a change in the forms that infrastructures took. And so it happened – a shift from industry to service sector activity supported by infrastructures came with it – with unforeseen social, ecological and political consequences. Now we are told that there is no future for these new forms of society – yet, more, that there is no future for the places that emerged from the shifting of industries – yet, crucially, that there is no future for the inhabitants of these regions either.This is the bureaucratic state. And so it is with the decentralized and now decentralized attempts at citywide self-organization that I have been suggesting are necessary. We need new bureaucracies with a clear mandate and clear functions – not the more typical hybrid bureaucracies of state and industry, but true state and industry with a clear agenda and clear workforce.I have been developing a set of</text>

It is an industry that has its origins in the nineteenth-century and has gained a great deal of currency in the twenty-first century. The term itself is frequently used to refer to culturally oriented tourism, but it is also commonly used to refer to flights to places that enhance our experience of them. Within this broad definition, cultural tourism can be defined as any type of cultural tourism. Cultural tourism today encompasses flights to places that reconceive or supplement cultural experiences, experiences that are more conventionalised, or more relatable to consumers. It is an industry that is global in scope, employing artists, curators, art collectors and curators from diverse fields</text>

As historian Willene Clark puts it, ‘Modernity is the ideology of the contingency – that there is only so much life can afford to give up in the face of overwhelming odds – and the consequent being caught up in a web of contradictions and failures that can never be fully undone.’2 	This interpretation of historical narratives is often given in the wake of a major cultural revolution, such as the French Revolution, as a major push towards a more just and hopeful future for Europeans and others. But as Nicholas Kristof points out, ‘History does not repeat itself – it only loops backwards.’3 	And this tendency towards nihilism and violence – which can be traced back to the Enlightenment – is a recurrent and far more powerful motif in both Western and Islamic historical narratives.

A majority of Westerners now identify with the nihilist strand of nihilism, which holds that humanity is at war with itself and that the only way to end the conflict is for us all to put our collective minds together and act upon those conflicting impulses. At the same time, a plurality of studies have shown that the rise of China, Islam and other faith-based and ethno-cultural narratives is a main driver of the moral panorama of the twenty-first century, which in turn promotes a proliferation of state religions and officialisms.2 	China now constitutes over half the world's population but still accounts for roughly a third of the world's population. As of 2015, over 40% of China’s population lived within 100 km (62 miles) of the coastline.3 	In the West, we tend to conflate travel with progress, but it’s important to note that in the twenty-first century, sea</text>

What counts as ‘good’ in the eyes of a Westerner today might also be considered ‘evil’ by a local Muslim resident of the same city. And since the cultural campaigns of the 1990s and 2000s were so instrumental in enabling a whitewashing of Islam as inherently ‘good’, we can infer that the same cultural ‘campaign’ today works to whitewash or demonise other religious or racialised identities. 	So, there is an inbuilt bias in the West today in favour of one set of ideas, beliefs, practices and modes of being – that is, white Western ideas and modes of being. And this inbuilt bias is largely imposed from the cultural West. 	But what might be possible in the alternative, post-culturally mediated space of the web?

If only a minority of thinkers in the West subscribe to such lofty claims, then why are the vast majority condemned to live lives of passive acquiescence in the face of such blatant evil? Perhaps it is that nihilism is understood in terms of opposites: the negation of value and the negation of struggle. The negation of value means doing away with it altogether, while the negation of struggle means living through it through one’s self. Yet here we are, nearly twenty years later, witnessing the proliferation of self-destructive ideologies in the wake of the Arab Spring, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that the negation of one thing in the Arab Spring was in fact in fact in favour of many other things in the end. Why is this? Perhaps it is that the moral high ground has been captured by forces that seek to subordinate all others to their own interests. Perhaps it is that we Westerners have lost our sense of entitlement</text>

As Schliemann himself acknowledges, these ‘rights’ ‘are but the pretense of a political system that seeks to create a genuinely democratic society by creating mechanisms of governance that are independent of any political will’2 	. And while liberal democracies may profess to protect citizens from the dangers of radical Islam, the reality is that many Western liberal democracies actively recruit citizens into the armed forces in order to fight alongside state-sanctioned terrorist groups such as ISIS. 	In recent years, the permissive relativist has often been found wanting, with Western liberal democracies increasingly turning to the military to solve problems such as terrorism and crime. As a 2016 study by the Oslo-based organization Conflict and Peace Research Centre (2011-2017) reveals, a majority of all personnel deployed in the Middle East and Africa are mobilized not as actors in a conflict, but as</text>

As Schliemann suggests, this opportunistic interpretation of nihilism is at odds with the enduring wisdom of history:

… nihilism embodies a system of domination and oppression, which must be overthrown. But it is not possible to topple a power structure overnight, or to return to pre-apocalyptic conditions.2 	And here we see another form of desensitisation: the cultural relativist understanding of cultural appropriation as something that can be dealt with in the same way that other forms of social misappropriation – cultural violence – are, in the wake of a mass atrocity such as 9/11. The cultural industries that create and narrate our reality, in the logic of which non-Westerners are assumed to be at the centre, are able to intervene with varying degrees of malignant effect on the world.

A 2016 survey by sociologist Peter Schliemann found that a majority of Westerners had never heard of Ayaan Hirsi Ali or Michael Zehaf-Baskal, despite both men having been central figures in the Middle East, Central America and the United States in the 1980s and 1990s.Schliemann concludes that: ‘The widespread adoption of nihilistic ideologies is the direct result of a sustained cultural campaign aimed at abolishing the other.’1 	But here we see another form of desensitisation: the permissive relativist interpretation of historical and contemporary events that seeks to absolve cultural consumption of its inherently discursive and subjective nature. As Harvey Silverglate puts it, ‘those who invented culture were not necessarily the creators of it, nor necessarily even aware of its creation’s impetus and that of conflicting moral values and historic grievances that still characterize contemporary cultural life today.2 	Schliemann’s formulation is romantic and short-lived, but his moralising runs contrary to the culture industry’s tendency to valorise the image and proclaim the inherent worth of cultural artefacts regardless of the evidence or the weight of the evidence itself. The cultural historian Timothy O'Shea, author of The Rise of the Greatest Generation: The Cultural Trajectories of the Postwar Twentieth Century (2008), offers a more nuanced assessment when he reflects on the contemporary predicament of the post-1990s generation: ‘Young people between 18 and 34 years old make up</text>

As Nietzsche puts it, ‘Nihilism is my politics’2 	and my religion’s means of existence.3 And here we see another sign of the changing face of Western ideas of nihilism: the permissive relativist interpretation of contemporary phenomena such as video games, social media and pop culture that demand a corresponding ideology of heroism as something that can and should be embraced, while ideology in other areas – such as architecture or music – is actively discouraged. 	What has become increasingly clear is that one cannot understand Western ideas of nihilism without understanding what Western intellectuals have in mind when they talk about such things. And it is this convergence of various ideas and phenomena that characterises Western ideas of modernity, whether those are identity or culture or language or knowledge or entertainment or – increasingly – science and technology. It is this convergence that underpins the notion of common values such as common language, common values such</text>

As Nietzsche would have it, we are cogs in a machine whose only function is to the extent that we subscribe to its narratives. If nihilism is understood as an ideology, then perhaps the role of culture is to some extent a more or less transparent conformist form of conformism. We do not and cannot know what is really going on, but we can nonetheless endorse or deride them as we please. And Schliemann’s survey suggests that there is widespread agreement that the end justifies the means. In other words, there is a tension between the aims of the cultural production system and the end justifies the means. We can also consider the other aspect of the question: do we genuinely wish to see others become better people because we collaborate in their demise or do we wish that humanity could be improved through the creative act of reflection and observation? It seems as if the mechanisms of the cultural production system are often run by people who do not</text>

As Nietzsche once wrote, when confronted with a situation that cannot be assimilated: ‘I became an object of your ideology… I became what you call a phenotypic.’2 	However, here the narrator is not confronted with a situation that he or she does not want to be; rather, the challenge is to understand where the object of ideology comes from in the first place and how that ideology comes about. The narrator’s task here is two-fold: first, to comprehend the concept of ideology; second, to comprehend how that concept manifests itself in the world. 	The question of where the ideological centre of gravity resides first needs to be answered. If the narrator is to understand the concept of ideology and its manifold forms, he or she will need to know what an</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to various historical periods. It is this kind of historical-archiving interest that is manifested in  	The Walking Dead 	, formed into a set of movements and actions that serve to frame and express the past through the present. The actions and movements described in the story are performed over and over again throughout the show, as an ongoing, recurrent motif. For example, when Carol Danvers is gunned down by a mad scientist, she is saved by the actions of a group of survivors who collectively and repeatedly perform a series of deeds in an attempt to rein her in. The actions of the group – chanting, pointing guns, using improvised explosive devices, setting traps, engaging in continuous killing – are narrated and dramatised throughout the episode.   Que Sera Nos Entra? (What shall we do?)When I first heard of San Sebastian de Cervantes, I imagined him as a sort of parallel universe inhabited by seafaring peoples from around the world. ‘He’d</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the unfolding of the past. So while the expectations, values and politics of the past may be important in shaping what the Biennale can and cannot do, the real-life (and sometimes fictional) past is much less certain.  	One may ask: what is the difference between the Biennale and the present? And perhaps one may even argue that the Biennale is itself an artefact, a ‘piece’ of the larger social system that the present is built upon. But this is not always the case; and while the biennale may produce its own set of relations and social dynamics, it is also important for the Biennale to have a presence, a presence on the planet, at least in the form of a significant art project. The Biennale has a presence through its curatorial, artistic, political and other interventions. And these all have certain definite social and ecological dimensions. But they are also experiences that many of us (including ourselves</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the seemingly random and chaotic occurrences that happen all around us. Any interest in the past, archaeological or otherwise, is naturally also a story-teller and story-maker. 	Such claims and projects of imagination and aesthetic destruction are not without precedent in art history, but they are often made with a decidedly intellectual and literary bent. The Biennale has a particularly egregious and influential example in its writing from the 1970s, when it was made up of ten essays, entitled  	Processes of Empire, and twenty-five articles, titled  	The Architecture of Empire 	. The essays and articles form part of a much larger and much more sustained narrative that appears in successive trade publications from thereon in various forms – short stories, novels, poetry, documentary films etc. – yet none of these narratives are limited to the confines of the Biennale. Rather, they pivot and weave diverse social, political and archival factors into their narratives, often weaving them into order</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the unfolding of the past. It is interesting to me that the American anthropologist Brian Lehrer, writing about the Anatolia project in The Anthropocene, seems to undervalue the role of the historian and the archivist in the development of the modern world. As we know from the Hillary Clinton email scandal, historians are particularly reluctant to talk to each other or to the press – lest we be accused of whitewashing or other forms of historicalising whitewashing. Even within the field of anthropology, there is considerable resistance to sharing narratives and historical facts. But I think Lehrer underestimates the role played by the biennial in the current state of the world. I think that the Anatolia project represents an important moment in the history of anthropology in that it is an artefact of the biennial (from its earliest stages as a curatorial gesture, to its current iteration as a biennial project), but also that it is also a project that the museum and its curatorial hand have played</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the unfolding of events. So while the interest in the past may in part be a projection of the interest in the future, a project like that of the Biennale may also be a means to an earlier, and more important, interest. 	Its current iteration, the Venice Biennale, although centred around the city and its cultural significance, is a project that actively seeks to draw elements of the past from within its present, while warning against the possibilities of the present – by doing so, it hoped to establish a new kind of cultural tourism. It is a project that actively engages with the peculiar ambiguities and differences of cultural power and authority in an attempt to create a common trajectory for its future cultural tourism. 	This project may have involved elements of the past in an effort to create a new trajectory – an interesting but risky approach, given the historical and archiving interest in the past. And it may well have resulted in a ‘true’ representation of the</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the ambiguities and complexities of the past. So while the biennale may claim to be engaged with the ‘present’ (relevance being of course a crucial concept), it is also engaging with the past as it is played out – engaging with the very notion of history, the past, the future, and the present – engaging with what Tiziana Terranova would call ‘the present’ – that characterises the contemporary world. 	In that sense, the biennale as a concept is deeply embedded in the historical trajectory of the city, and will likely continue to be so. The biennale as an institutional form has, in recent decades, largely entered the service of finance capital and tourism, and more and more of that service is provided by automated means. The biennale is active in both the production and the consumptive act – producing artefacts and displaying them for the public to consume. It is engaging with the past in the service</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the unfolding of time. So while the past is at best a distorted and distorted version of the present, it is also possible to replay and re-picture the past in creative and interesting ways. 	There is much more that one can learn from the past about the economic, political, economic and social conditions of life in capitalist modernity, and these sorts of past ‘stories’ offer a way to rethink present and future possibilities and possibilities. But one of the tasks of the biennale is to offer a platform for the future to be told, and as biennials become increasingly institutionalised and multidisciplinary, it is becoming ever more important to tell ‘the past’. 	As the exhibitionary form shifts to other kinds of occasions, it is important to identify the specificity of the present and the potentialities of the future. This is why biennials become particularly sensitive to the historical and archive conditions of their particular historical circumstance. As biennials</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the contained narratives. So while we may like to think of the past as a pastiche of disparate cultural flows and practices, it is also true to say that the past is a complex pastiche that requires careful and widespread archiving, because it is ever more important to undo damage done by historical neglect and decolonisation. 	In order to understand and ultimately address the social and political dimensions and potential futures of our changing urban landscape and changing urbanisation, we need to understand how to imagine the past in new ways, and in the future in ways that are more encompassing and controllable. It is this understanding that can be found in  	Future City, co-curated by Vanessa Boni (University of Maryland, USA) and Jeremy Shmoo (University of Sydney, Australia) and published in the September 2017 issue of  	Geographical Critique. Future City proposes three possible futures for a city that is simultaneously cosmopolitan, densely populated and yet stillpires</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the unfolding of time. Thus the biennale, even when it produces cultural or historical moments, also needs talented and experienced personnel to run the temporal narratives that shape our notions of time and space today. 	These temporal narratives are vast, complex and constantly shifting, but relatively few of them are still firmly set in stone, myth or historical narrative terms. This is partly because human memory is episodic and unstable, but also because of the centrality of language in our contemporary society. The ability of people to form and articulate complex time frames is greatly enhanced through the constant circulation and migration of people and goods across networks of communication and exchange – institutions, ideologies and cultural practices – across the planet. As a consequence, the number of people who can be said to have a tangible and concrete impact on today’s society is limited. 	This is also true of art or cultural practices. As people acquire and engage with art or artistic practices, they change their understanding and conceptualisation of time</text>

It is important to note that the role of the archaeologist is not necessarily to excavate the past but to archive and preserve it, to tell stories and bring meanings to the unfolding of time. So while the biennale may claim to study the past and bring a certain narrative order and aesthetic value to it, it is actually a curatorial work that creates and depends on a specific set of cultural values and interests. And while it may present itself as a retrospective and critical survey of art and culture in the world today, it is really much more interested in the past. The past is a site of conflictual encounters, of ideas and ideologies and ideas. Understanding and defending the past is central to understanding the future. 	The Biennale has responded to this need for a visible and visible presence both locally and internationally by creating a public space that is both static and dynamic – a kind of urban laboratory – where people can come to develop and experiment with their ideas of art and culture. It has also developed a kind of an artistic and curatorial autonomy through this kind of artistic lab. The Biennale’s public realm has, over time, been</text>

It will also acknowledge the important role played by other progressive social enterprises and arts organisations, including the contribution of artists to the promotion of arts and culture in the region. The publication may consider artists’ contributions to the development of the region’s arts and culture environments, as well as to the promotion and implementation of solidarity and collaborative projects. It will also consider other forms of cultural production and remaking, including those that are dependent on community or community support. In no way will the boundaries of this journal be able to encompass the imaginations of all who have been part of this project.For more information, please see the book ICSD: Towards a Documenta 14 Cooperative Statehood

The social composition of the sector shifted from a predominantly community based to predominantly professional model, and with it, inevitably, a great deal of political will to alter cultural landscape. The emergence of constituent parts, such as mental healthcare, access to arts education and employment, and the provision of cultural facilities and venues, was understood as a means to an end. The end game of arts education became understood as the end result of a political struggle for cultural inclusion and political power. The emergence of radical cultural campaigns was understood as a means to an end. For many years, the aim of such campaigns was to get the political system to change – to nothing. The</text>

The Black-E was an important player in the social impact sphere in the 1980s and is a critical voice for the region in the present. It was an organisation that engaged actively promoted mental healthcare for its members and the wider public. It maintained a popular journal, called the Black-E Bulletin, that reflected the publisher’s political and social landscape. The Black-E was a critical voice for the region in the 1980s and is a critical voice for the region in the present. The Black-E was founded in 1888 by William Morris Dees and William Harvey, two of the most prominent black Anglicans in the area. It published socially engaged writing from its first editor, William Gaston, and its then publisher, John Evelyn White, a black civil rights activist. It maintained a website with a large archive of colour photographs. It produced and distributed numerous public lectures and publications, including the popular ‘Southern Christian Reporter’ that depicted the region</text>

The Black-E’s current programme of cultural organising includes a programme of events including performances, meetings, events and other activities around the streetscape of the city. The organisation also provides support to other artists and organisations engaged in revitalising the area.

It will take into consideration the cultural dynamics of the region as a whole and the particular contribution that artists have made to the production of ‘relevant content’ through the publication of artworks and cultural programmes. The project was initially conceived and presented as a one-day event, with a curatorial approach that places great emphasis on the individual and collective acts of creativity. It was realised that the event required a larger-scale spatial configuration and multimedia infrastructure, as well as a ‘long-term relationship’ with the city’. The development of the event took place in phases, in 2010 and 2011 respectively, with the 2011 edition focusing on the work done by artists during the five-year project. The exhibition format followed a curatorial theme that included a ‘topology of space’. A ‘topology of Space’ is a diagrammatic grouping of elements that create a continuous space and time. In this topology,</text>

The project started life as a blog, with Tweed Heads Local Community Land Trust (2010–2015), who presented the journal at the Black-E’s annual conference, and was a regular feature of the Black-E blog. The Black-E’s 2014 conference, Black-E’s 15th birthday, and the publication of the Black-E’s 2015 report were also marked by ‘anniversaries’ in a different sense of ‘celebrations’. The Black-E’s website now features several ‘birthdays’ a month, depending on the contributors. 	The Black-E was founded in 2010 and is a multidisciplinary arts organisation with a main focus on the local community. It is run by two teams of artists and is co-located in London and Barcelona. The Black-E has staged numerous projects throughout the world, and is now based in Tur</text>

Consequently, the collection moved from the post to the post office, where it was kept in pristine condition and accessible via a new terminal building. Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to fans and other interested parties.’[37] 	Postal cars were efficient because they transported goods across national borders, and because the drivers were likely to be British, French or Indian agents operating under the pretense that the goods were British. Indian agents operating under the pretense that the goods were Indian would naturally target customers in urban centres, where English-speaking communities were more likely to be on the street, and work harder to blend in with the lower rungs of the city. Thus the collection emerged to serve as a kind of urban ghost, delivering objects to places where English was not the official language or the default setting. 	[38] Borden’s account of the  	International Date Line is similar to that of Walter Benjamin, who in 1949 proposed the ‘Union Jack’ as a symbol of union consciousness. Elizabeth Grosz makes the same point in her account of the Québec’s Indian Act, 1867:</text>

Consequently, the collection moved from the post to the post office, where it was kept in pristine condition and accessible via a new terminal building. Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to customers in the guise of ordinary parcels.’[6] 	But the collection also included letters, addressed to a local community of artists, and to a host of other individuals and groups. These range from the courteous to the snide, the trivial to the paranoid, the trivial to the delusional, and the paranoid to a host of other things, but they all touch on the same themes: alienation, lack of agency, and the self-serving. In the essay ‘Collecting the Postcards’, Irene Hofmann reflects on the exhibition as a kind of series of rejections, on the one hand, of which are felt personally by the author of the collection, but, on the other, by other curators and artists who came to see her work. ‘There was a palpable tension between the collectors' meetings and the presentations of the objects themselves. The former, because the participants were spectators, privileged access to the collections, while the latter,</text>

Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to destinations outside London.’ 	Postal journeys became the domain of the rail, which in turn became the domain of the truck and the ferry, which each had their own unique set of priorities and driving styles. These three modes of transportation created a kind of geographical chaos, to the extent that in the twentieth century it was almost impossible to differentiate between the different modes of transportation on a long-term basis.’[8] The collection of antiquities selected through a random drawing on an archive of over a million postcards, maps and magazines. 	[9] The first letter was written in postcode, following a similar approach to numbers as was adopted in Britain during the Napoleonic Era. 	[10] Aesthetics was intimately tied to the collection’s symbolic valiance, which was further enhanced by the fact that many of the objects in the collection were placed in individual frames bearing the signature of a single person – a portrait, a building, a</text>

Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to customers in the knowledge that they were present and accounted for.’ [emphasis added] 	[23] The collection today would be housed in a new terminal building, if it weren’t for the seductive nature of satellite communication, which has resulted in a collection at all levels, including of late, of objects that can be retrieved in an instant via satellite. 	[24] And what of the object itself? Borden concludes his essay with these words: ‘The collection that followed the Napoleonic wars was broken into thousands of fragments. Today, there are fewer than at the height of the petit-bourgeoisie. But the impulse to collect, to value, to return, to return to the Napoleonic period, is still with us today.’[emphasis added] 	[25] And what of the memory of the Napoleonic period, which continues to inform contemporary art?

Consequently, the collection moved from the post to the post office, where it was kept in pristine condition and accessible via a new terminal building. Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to customers, who, in turn, became the customers of others, including artists’ patrons.’ 	In this scenario, the post office became the carrier of last resort, the extent of which is now becoming evident. 	[7] The logic of the terminal building – which has since been adapted by the British post office and internet – is similar to that of the fossilised bits of the moon: once an object has been delivered to a terminal it is virtually impossible to take it back, no matter how many people ‘adopt’ it or ‘recycle’ it. 	[8] This idea is further developed by Borden in the chapter ‘Carrying Capacity’ in his book  	Unravelled: Art as Form in an Age of Fragments. 	[9] The collection that we now call the Internet Archive was originally housed in a vault in the Swiss Military Archives in Geneva, but it has</text>

Consequently, the collection moved from the post to the post office, where it was kept in pristine condition and accessible via a new terminal building. Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to destinations far removed from the post, such as the “far reaches of the Earth”, “the far ends of the visible universe’, and “the farthest reaches of another dimension’. 	In other words, the collection, not the denouement, is the object. (emphasis in original) 	But the post was not perfect. As Borden makes clear, the collection arrived at the post office not as a package, but as an array of objects—some of which were not transported by rail and therefore did not make the journey by post. So the collection today faces a further problem of its own: it is not just an assortment of objects, but an assortment of concerns. The post office has changed, but its management and staff are not always clear or transparent, and the collection’s current management has little accountability, either at the high or the low levels, when it comes to the collection’s management and administration.</text>

Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to destinations throughout the country.’ [emphasis in original] 	Later in the same letter, Borden cites the pioneering activities of the  	Dyson Carré Centre, the precursor to the Museum of Transport and Technology, which he started in 1906: ‘The idea of the Museum of Transport and Technology came to me while driving to work one morning in April 1914, when I saw a painting that was cut and pasted from a newspaper annealed to the front page of the Post.’ I’d bet my bottom dollar that the man responsible for the Post, William Roberts, had one of those first-person accounts in mind when he wrote it. 	[1] Destinations in this case, according to Borden, were a-plenty to be found in a large post office, as well as ‘two pretty young things who happened to be walking to school the next morning’. [2] Ackbar,</text>

Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to interested parties.’[13] 	Postal routes are now the preserve of museums and archival institutions, and not every object has been preserved in a museum setting. One can only imagine what these objects would be like if they did exist, or at least what they would have looked like to a postal service employee if they did exist. 	But this is not the kind of historical ‘spectacle’ that a museum tends to produce, nor the kind of object that a museum audience would choose to view. The kind of historical event that a museum can produce and which a museum audience can also passively participate in. The kind of object that a museum administrator can privilege and entrust with a particular purpose or interest or agenda or to make a particular choice about what to preserve and when. The kind of object that a museum patron can voluntarily omit from view in order to participate in a particular exhibition, or in the case of a limited public access to a particular exhibition, to be</text>

Consequently, the collection moved from the post to the post office, where it was kept in pristine condition and accessible via a new terminal building. Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to a person in the geographical vicinity of the post office.’[6] This new transport paradigm excluded the postal as a carrier of objects, and the collection as a physical object within the terminal building. 	[7] Borden’s logic seems to account for the apparent transparency of the collection, since the objects were kept away from prying eyes. 	[8] As noted by Mail Today, the collection moved to a series of vacant buildings in to the city, where it was used as a training ground for young gun-toting postal workers. The collection ended up in the possession of the Museum of Modern Art, who, in turn, passed it on to the Institute of Contemporary Arts, who in turn passed it on to the Royal Academy, and so on. The list of postcards accompanying the collections seems to have a point of entry into the larger narrative of the city. As the artist Ernest Pérez Margalida, a</text>

Borden’s footnote continues: ‘Postal travel became the domain of the “common car”, which was seen by the postmaster as an ideal vehicle to deliver these objects to their rightful places.’[7] Postal travel emerges as a key concept in Borden’s conceptualization of the “public” in her work, and it is this aspect of the transnational postal service that is often misconstrued. Postal travel is part of what she calls “the public”, and it is a crucial public realm in which to engage with the work of art that she is attempting to make accessible. Postal travel provides the locus of interaction with the objects in the collection, and this interaction occurs through what Borden calls ‘a common language of significances’.[8] Postal travel thus establishes the ontology of the collection, and the ontology of the postcolonial condition, and it is here that art and art's place in the public realm can be found. Art and artists therefore have a critical pedagogical role to play in the creation of public realms, realms that are capable of sustaining their different</text>

But the biennial has become what it is: a collection of symptoms. And the collection itself is a symptom of the disease. It collects and presents the symptoms in a manner that seeks to understand the disease, while failing to see the underlying causes. The current state of global infrastructures, then, is a situation in which the biennial – and its collection of symptoms – is a chronic, evolving symptom.It is a collection of symptoms. And yet it displays no signs of displaying, displaying, displaying, displaying, displaying, etc. (JG Ballard, The Art of Not Being Governed, 1979).The biennial has, of course, made itself visible everywhere. It is a fixture of museum and art galleries, a regular feature of international and domestic transit, a frequent visitor to our own cityscapes, a frequent subject of fiction and non-fiction, and an object of consumer and curatorial fascination. It is, in fact, all of these things and more. But this most recent exhibition was not intended to</text>

It is, in other words, but a symptom. Its distinctive post-1980 character remains problematic, even in the age of neoliberal global infrastructures. But the biennial has become what it is: a gathering of diverse practitioners who gather there with research interests and often aesthetic ones as well as with other, more social ones. It is an infrastructural museum of art, pure and simple. And it is a gathering place. Art’s present as a curatorial gesture, its diverse forms of representation, is conditioned by the presence of other artists, scholars, writers and others whose work is displayed. There is an exposure to the inherent complexities of cultural production and its effects on the biennial itself. In the age of the biennial, biennials have become institutionalised, and with them, the potential for this to continue. But their institutionalised forms also make them subject to change. Where art is represented in museums and institutions, and is even now a major player in secondary cultural outlets, biennials have become something else: platforms or products of a museum or an art fair, or both. And this something else can be global.The biennial as a chronological pattern</text>

It is a collection of artists, curators, writers, political activists and others whose work is interwoven with each other, and with times and changes in all of this. It is a phenomenon that is both continuous (art exhibits and shows occur at biennials) and discrete (several biennials are occurring in the same city at the same time).

But the tendency today is for them to shape each other, to recombine and conflict over space and resources, to fragment into smaller, more localised pieces, to fade away into historical narratives that are less and not so much of their own making. In this situation, tracing the infrastructural precursory to the present moment is of great value. In the age of the biennial, the biennial is a globalised collective. It is, in other words, but a symptom. Its distinctive post-1980 character remains problematic, even in the age of neoliberal global infrastructures. But the biennial has become what it is: a gathering of disparate points of view, objects, collections, collections. It gathers not only of the past, but also of the future, and of changes in the past. It gathers not only of historical moments, but also of those which occur in the present. It gathers not only of things, but of entities. It gathers not only of data, but of data representations. It gathers not only of physical things, but also of virtual things. It gathers not only of historical moments, but also of those which are occurring now. Now is the gathering of all these in the present. And today is the date chosen by the museum to endow the new biennial with the character of the present. The museum now finds itself trapped in a temporality of its own making. It is in a bind, which is bound up with the museum ever since its foundation in 1903. The museum is asked to present something new and exciting to the museum, which must then present something old and traditional to an</text>

But the biennial has become what it is: a collection of collections, exhibiting a single event over time, exhibiting a single set of curatorial approaches, exhibiting a single logic to the world. Its institutional capacity remains questionable, and its political-cultural claims are unshakeable. But its capacity to inhabit the moment – to stand for what it means to be contemporary, to be alive in the age of the biennial – has significantly increased. This is evident in the abundance of biennials now operating in their respective cities, such as Venice or Mumbai, or, since there is no global hub for them, in the proliferation of localised exhibitions such as the LA Biennale, New York City, or Paris Biennale, to name only some obvious examples. It is also evident in the proliferation of localised biennials, especially those that take place in cities, such as those of Liverpool, or in smaller towns. It is evident in the frequent use of biennials as temporary exhibition platforms, as temporary exhibition sites for a</text>

It is, in other words, but a symptom. Its distinctive post-1980 character remains problematic, even in the age of neoliberal global infrastructures. But the biennial has become what it is: a gathering of diverse localised practices that can be gathered and discussed. It gathers not only of what is globally visible, but also of what is hidden or ‘preventable’ in the world. It gathers not only of the things that are profitable for artisans, curators, collectors, administrators, stockbrokers and dealers, but also of those things that shape the world through the economy, politics, values and urban environments of our cities. It gathers not only of the news of the day, but also of what is in fact happening in the world around us. The news media are instruments through which we are all exposed to it, and in this respect we can call them biennials. Call them what you want: historical shows, photography, documentary, art assemblages, even wildcat shows. But what it emerges is that which is most pertinent to our present and future engagements, whether it is the news from Peshawar, Jerusalem, or Durban, or from</text>

It is, in other words, but a symptom. Its distinctive post-1980 character remains problematic, even in the age of neoliberal global infrastructures. But the biennial has become what it is: a chronic event, chronic in the sense that it is alive and well in almost every city on earth, and that it has spread. It may be the case that its recurring monotony, artificiality, commodification and mass consumption have exhausted all meaning and, since nothing can be more artificial than a museum, an art gallery or a market, as an event for self-congratulation and the recovery of identity, so art galleries and museums have come to dominate what is considered art historical value. And this is to be regretted. Much like the biennial, the biennial must have its place, a historically contingent one, in any account of the social. It is a critical event in itself, a chronic event whose characteristics will remain contested even after the anthropocene is ultimately defined.Art is a complex, multi-faceted substance, and its historical, anthropological and archival contexts are vast and complex. But its main effect is something like a force field, dampening and</text>

It is, in other words, but a symptom. Its distinctive post-1980 character remains problematic, even in the age of neoliberal global infrastructures. But the biennial has become what it is: a collection of related phenomena, a mode of contemporaneity in which other, deeper infrastructural developments are constantly (re)created and revised. It is capable of creating a sense of the present as if it were the future, of events unfolding at an ever-accelerating rate of change. It can also be thought of as a kind of capital-intensive pastiche, a construction that continues to occupy and to narrate space in the world, but which is no longer able to sustain itself as a globalisable fiction.The biennial is a globalisable fiction because it is possible to take part in it at a distance; to inhabit it as a transient phenomenon, a kind of ‘present in space’ that is neither here nor there. And this kind of infrastructural realism is possible only within the parameters of the biennial itself. In the hands of an artist or curator, the biennial could equally well be a space-exploration exhibit, a kind</text>

But the biennial has become what it is: a collection of collections, a form of public stand-in for, or rather, an approximation to, the assemblage that makes up modernity itself. And it remains so because it is both finite (like the museum) and immortal (like life itself). It will always be but one interrelated set of collections: finite because it is a collection of images, images of images, images of images. And immortal because it is a collection of stories told together, told through pictures, stories told from pictures, told in language that is both universal and particular. It is this combination of two opposing forces of the biennial that creates the need for its collection managers to constantly inform its publics and organising critics of its every step.What is at Stake In these two counterbalancing forces of biennialism, the collection and the museum, the biennial is at the centre, its collection managers the life-support systems that keep it going. But what has recently become increasingly clear is that</text>

It is, in other words, but a symptom. Its distinctive post-1980 character remains problematic, even in the age of neoliberal global infrastructures. But the biennial has become what it is: a consumable spatial formation with a definite temporal dimension, a relational form of cultural capital that can be mobilized at will, a most potent tool for the service of capital accumulation. In this sense, it is both signatory (of the historical) and dispensable. It becomes, in the language of scientific inquiry, a datable kind of entity, a kind of data storage device capable of recording, of massive data processing, of intense computational infrastructures capable of supporting these processes and more.All of these technologies and practices are now globalised and interconnected. But they are also diverse, and new infrastructures are appearing on the globalised globalisation map. And while each of these is designed to meet specific needs of the client, in the current political and economic framework, they all have in common the precursory character of a need-to-know. In the current period of neoliberal globalisation, we can observe a moment of confusion about what this need-to-know</text>

At the same time, the research centre and department of National Defence must ensure that the information gathered from visitors does not constitute a conflict of interest for future engagement. As noted by Prof. Malcolm Toppo in a letter to the editor of The Globe and Mail: ‘The most dangerous place for a visiting government to be is a citizen.’[5] This last requirement is particularly relevant in a climate where the notion of the homeland is under assault. It is increasingly likely that visitors to Canada will be imbricated within the narrative of national narratives, rather than serving as agents of change upon them. 	The chair of the MS&amp;D, Peter Weibel, notes that while national security is a primary responsibility of the federal government, it is an 'inherently disempowering' role to which citizens often respond by retreating: 'They do not have the political power to enact or change policy</text>

The aim is to create ‘a positive image of the Arctic to enhance the return on investment for industry’ and to establish a mutually beneficial relationship between the Government of Canada and the private sector.2  The Joint Strategic Plan also identifies steps to enhance cooperation between the Department of National Defence and the private sector through research-based education and the provision of innovative infrastructures to support the new economy. These recommendations are consistent with the recommendations of the Chagall Commission, which recommended that the Government assist in the establishment of a Research Council to support the development of innovative infrastructures to support the Government’s ‘new economy’.3  The Council on Foreign Relations (2015) recommended that the Government</text>

It is a form of intervention that participates in the post-conflict situation through cultural enterprises, specifically research-based programmes and activities. It provides economic benefits through tourism, and is an essential component of the US-led effort to defeat IS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). 	However, for all the emphasis placed on cultural tourism in postconflict contexts, little is known about the type of cultural tourism that is conducted in the rest of the world. This cultural tourism is often characterised by the suspension of disbelief, and the reduction of politics and social change in the region as a whole. In other words, it is not necessarily part of a globalised capitalist tourism industry, but relies on relations in the region. This cultural tourism, and the globalised forms of capitalism that they enable, drive the flow of people and goods across the planet. And this cultural tourism is always accompanied by significant economic costs.2 	</text>

It is a relatively new phenomenon in many parts of the world, and has been for some time. There are many reasons for this – the emergence of developed economies, the advent of information technologies, the proliferation of markets and citizen journalism, to name only some. But the main reason is the confluence of factors – factors that in turn, shape cultural landscapes and identities.In the 1980s and 1990s, cultural tourism represented a way of life for many people in many places. It was a way to get inside a place and be part of a community. It was also a way to meet other people who were involved in a similar way to you and me, and to discover something new. But in the last decade, as cultural tourism has become ever more sophisticated and globalized, and as more and more people use travel as a way to get around, it has become anything but cultural. It is now primarily a business. And as such, it is subject to the whims of global</text>

It is an economic activity that depends on the perception of grandeur, wonder and beauty in a given location. In developing nations, cultural tourism can also be seen as a form of tourism intended to draw tourists to sites through which commerce is facilitated. It is a form of tourism that is dependent on exchange, and whose promotion depends on the perception of the place as a desirable place. In the 1990s, when the Venice Biennale was the largest visitor attraction in the world,1,2 it was often claimed that the reason was that the places it visited were ‘good enough’ to warrant a second look. In an attempt to disabuse critics of such a claim, Italian artists Paolo Portoghesi and Stefano Terzi contributed a deluxe exhibition to the Venice Biennale, ‘The Creation of a Critique’, in 1993, which was, according to some reports, deliberately provocative and seductive. In a 1994 book about the Biennale</text>

This is despite the common usage of the noun in these contexts, which tends to evoke images of exotic destinations or exotic origins. Perhaps the tobacco companies understood the importance of language and how it can manipulate perception. Perhaps the biennale experience is different, though, in that it is habitual and subject to the same forces. Or perhaps the biennale is only possible in a geopolitical sense because of the interconnectedness of contemporary capitalism. Perhaps the biennale is a metaphor, and its various incarnations are combinations of actualities and virtualities. The significance of this last possibility cannot be underestimated. It implies that the ecological and urban effects of the biennale, as well as other forms of cultural tourism, are as real as its economic aspects. That is, the more the biennale</text>

This is why, when we started the Cultural Trespassing project in Portugal, a while back, we did not exclude ourselves from the cultural tourism market, but instead sought to understand how a biennale can ‘sell itself’: what are the expectations of the public, and how do they respond to these? In our case, this meant developing strategies to engage different segments of the public, particularly in urban centres where the Biennale is located, in order to understand what the market could offer in terms of cultural exchange.We conducted a research project in Lisbon over the past year, with the support of the Portuguese government's Centre for Research on Globalisation (CERGO), which is a public institutions with a research agenda focused on the globalisation of culture and society.

It is a type of economic activity that is relatively unaffected by political in- or out-bursts in some regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa. However, crises can have significant economic impacts in regions dominated by terrorist groups. To address this, major curfews are imposed in major tourist destinations. Curfews are temporary measures that restrict or restrict access to places because of perceived threat. They come into being when the number of visitors to a destination exceeds a certain threshold, usually determined by the territory concerned. In the case of tourism, this threshold is considered to be exceeded in most Western cities.2  	In 1990, a quarter of a million people attended the Venice Biennale, making it the largest public exhibition of its kind.3 	The biennale quickly established an international reputation as a destination for art-historical and archival research and display.

It is a type of industry that engages in the production, provision, marketing and consumption of travel and cultural goods, often marketed as services, such as accommodation, food, travel agencies, travel blogs and travel guide books. The term ‘cultural tourism’ refers to the post-industry practice of organising culture-related activities in exchange for monetary remuneration. As an industry-standardised form of cultural tourism, cultural tourism has emerged as an essential service for post-industry growth. It is a type of capital-intensive production process that requires an inexhaustible global supply of labour and materials, markets in these materials and strategies, and an infrastructure of public support. Culturally, ‘once a year’ is shorthand for a long period of time. Culturally-sensitive design is strategically-constrained; it is not rational to expect a traveller to be transported to a destination with a fixed cultural context.

It is one that people today remember fondly.DDownload this article as PDF27 March 2014To Samantha Jones2 July 20142Permanent link to this article:2Permanent link to this article: http://tinyurl.com/6b8d7dbb6a7afb9/1#ixzz2s98sd9344mx7yccb8094092276/2#!1 ���2Up2Down…Scottish Biennale photosCultural tourism is a global industry with a large US market share, worth $70 billion a year, overwhelmingly facilitated by the tourism and cultural industries in developing nations.2Up2Down…Scottish Biennale photosTaken in two locations in the Scottish Highlands, Scotland, in February 2014, these three photos were part of a cultural-tourism package produced by The Scottish Biennale, together with partners at Travel Scottish.

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, is also a city of the commons, where citizens have a say in how that wealth is used and generated. It is a city of the present, in other words. Creative assemblies formed in the city’s parks, squares, beaches, waterways and other public spaces could draw on that wealth and generate creative solutions to the problems that still need to be solved, based on the needs of the communities that remain after the parks, squares, beaches and other spaces are redeveloped.  One could also argue that New York is also a city of the docks, which it is now increasingly becoming increasingly evident are among the most abused and in dire need of being rehabilitated. The city has become so dependent on its docks, which continues to fund much of its urban growth despite the city’s decreasing population, that it is becoming increasingly difficult to raise funds for projects around the city that take into consideration the needs of the very people who now call the docks home. In many ways, this is inevitable</text>

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, is also a city of laws and order, a kind of virtual police force able to impose its will on those who do not comply with its decrees. The police are able to impose its will because there is no resistance to their will; people are willing to obey whatever order it is given them to be rid of the garbage, to leave abandoned buildings behind, and to pick up anything that comes out of the station. In this way, the city is able to impose its will on those who do not obey it, and because people are now dependent on the city in order to travel anywhere, stop by any time, and do almost anything, it follows that they must now have the city’s permission to do so.   One could also argue that a growing population and urban sprawl are both desirable trends and have been for quite some time now, and that a little of both is now required to balance the growing cost of housing against the increasing population growth that is inevitably accompanied by increasing</text>

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, nevertheless needs government permission to completely fill its streets with traffic and tourists, and to plant trees and construct public parksland, and to do all the other good things that come with being a large urban centre. And this is just urban planning.  One could also argue that New York, which has become so cosmopolitan and globally accessible, is itself relatively new in its urban form – built primarily as a pipeline for freight moving through the city. And this is true of any urban growth, but the rapid expansion of international airports and the shifting of global modes of movement has created a situation in which cities are forced to adapt to a mode of global circulation that is both more abundant and more globally accessible. And this mode of access has brought with it a mode of global circulation that is both more liquid and more liquid-rich. New York City is, in other words, dependent on global trade, whereas its location in the heart of Liverpool, a city with its own unique combination of natural resources, industrial heritage</text>

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, nevertheless lacks a mass-based political and cultural power base capable of supporting such ambitious goals. It does have a mass-based intellectual and artistic base, but it also has a mass-based cultural and urbanity that is dependent on it (and, by the way, not all of which are mutually exclusive). A city like New York that is creative and ambitious enough to pursue such a potential future for its city only needs to be creative and ambitious enough to attract and keep talented people, and enough to sustain such efforts in the future.  A city like San Francisco could theoretically achieve such a future through policies of economic development that primarily target skilled workers and create decent-paying jobs in sectors such as technology, healthcare, finance and retail, but these are rare exceptions and are mainly employed at the expense of workers in low-skilled professions such as healthcare providers, academics and service providers.

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, is also a city of rules, and the emergence of autonomous localities around issues like housing, education, and transportation become significant issues in this increasingly globalized world. Some might even say that the success of such initiatives depends on the willingness of citizens to leave behind an image of themselves as fully autonomous places, in which case, perhaps, the biennale should strive to find a way to incorporate such autonomous features into the architecture of the site.  A city that is free and transparent, but also a city that produces and distributes wealth  Such is the agenda of the growing number of biennales that are developing their own decentralisations of wealth, from the early history of the biennale in Paris to the emergence of cities in the financial sector (London and Hong Kong) and social networks (Facebook and Twitter) today. And it is this agenda that we must now pursue if we are to achieve the decentralisation of wealth we wish to see everywhere. How to measure the success of such</text>

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, is also a city of rules, which individual citizens are expected to conform to, and citizens are encouraged to conform to them. Rules-based urbanisation programs, as I have been proposing, would cease to be when individual citizens reached the socio-political point where they could independently create and alter their cities in accordance with their own interests and desires. Such a radical transformation would require a massive new appropriation of existing urban infrastructure and planning, but it is possible that such an allocation could be beneficial in the short term, by stimulating economic growth and creating jobs for a while, while simultaneously removing undesirable elements from the city for future reuse.  One could also argue that although New York City may no longer be the world’s largest port and textile exporter, it is still a major centre for arms trafficking, human trafficking, and other types of trafficking for labour and commodities, and is a major centre for transnational organised crime. New York City therefore has a highly questionable and uneven labour market, which is</text>

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, nevertheless needs government assistance to function properly.  One could also argue that a city like Chicago, which has become so rich that it is now the world’s ninth largest city by GDP, nevertheless needs government permission to effectively regulate its economy. Yet even if one were to accept this last position, which I do not, the important point remains that Chicago alone accounts for over half of all new developed cities. Therefore, it seems to me that it is not enough to build infrastructure, but that we also need to actively seek ways to make cities around us richer and more fulfilling, more user-friendly places to live in. In other words, we need to invest in our cities in ways that will make them useful for the things we want them to do, rather than in ways that will benefit a few investors or business empires at the centre of a globalized capitalist economy.   The other half of the equation is our cultural environment. This refers to the cultural practices that shape our ideas of what</text>

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, is also a city of the enormous inequalities of which we are still unaware. In this increasingly globalized and integrated world, we must all work tirelessly to change this. New York’s enormous financial sector, which has become so powerful that it is now able to dictate policy to virtually every city in China through its economic zone design bureau, will continue to play a crucial role in the socioeconomic evolution of the city.  One could argue that in an increasingly urban environment, a city such as New York is no longer necessary to be considered a fully fledged metropolis – one can now achieve extraordinary levels of connectivity and mobility – but I see no reason to change this logic. Cities now play an increasingly important role in the formation and fluidity of global flows of people and goods. And I believe that the metropolis is at a crucial point at which the city is witnessing the emergence of new urbanities that will be able to provide the social, cultural and spatial conditions necessary for these new urban</text>

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, nevertheless needs government support to operate effectively and efficiently. A growing number of cities are moving towards self-sustaining eco-systems models that are more like micro-grids, where individuals and firms draw power from renewable resources and other local sources to run essential services such as hospitals and schools.  A micro-grid is a kind of integrated circuit made up of individual solar panels, wind turbines, water turbines and other passive energy resources, distributed across large and isolated areas.  In micro-grids, people and firms draw energy from renewable resources and other local sources to run essential services such as hospitals and schools.  As a kind of counterbalance, however, these local solutions often struggle to provide reliable and affordable energy for critical infrastructure activities, such as electricity generation and transmission, which are dependent on it.  The emergence of new technologies that generate electricity at lower cost per kilowatt-hour but with potentially far fewer environmental impacts than traditional forms of energy also plays a part in pushing</text>

One could argue, however, that a city like New York, which has become so rich and so populous that it is now the world’s second largest city after Beijing, nevertheless needs government permission to build a number of its urban wonders. Perhaps the real power in a city like New York today comes from the pockets of its poor and the peripheries.  One could also argue that the rich actually own and control the city, which is still often cited as a virtue of the New York metropolitan area’s rapid growth. But this is not at all true, and is a classic example of when power and wealth first came into conflict.  The key to a sustainable urban future, then, is in fact in the hands of the poor and the peripheries, and will remain so until at least some of them own and control the city.  An alternative to the increasingly common practice of subsidizing large parts of a city (and its suburbs) at extremely low and sometimes zero rates of return to the city is to instead directly and culture produce the city’s poor and the peripheries. This is what Shanghai’s ‘One City,</text>

In this sense, it reflected the historical curatorial practice of ‘seeing and not hearing’ – in the public interest or because it is heard but not seen. In this sense, however, it may have been useful in framing the discussion of the recently discovered, but never before discussed, Farc de la Muda Valley, because it allowed the curators to ‘see and not hear’ the story of the valley, but also to ‘see and not know’ how that story may link to the city’s current predicament. It is this ability to combine the audience’s limited, biased and transient perspective with the artist’s inherent, but unspoken, cultural biases that make an exhibition a work of art. In</text>

It is unclear to what extent this is true of a practice that is done with an artist by a curator. While it is true that all art is collaborative, the path from the gallery to the gallery is not linear and always has a counter-intuitive effect on how we perceive the world. The gallery becomes the locus of an unexpected interaction, where unexpected encounters can occur. In the context of well-established art practices, this could be seen as a weakness.

It is not something that can be understood or apprehended in a single sitting. But the emergence of new artworks as a result of AI can be understood in the context of a single cultural and social revolution. New media, social media, graphic design, food production, tourism, animation, art historical preservation and much more are some of the social impacts of AI. Art and cultural production today is driven by social media and AI simply because they are ubiquitous and available to be accessed anywhere. And although AI will undoubtedly affect art in unexpected ways, it will do so in a way that is beneficial to all concerned.Art today is deeply embedded in the contemporary cultural landscape. It is commonplace for art precepts to be found online, alongside other related terms, concepts and practices.

Perhaps we could even imagine the synergistic effects that this new kind of philosophical discourse could have in reconfiguring the human condition.Download this article as PDFEmily Pringle is an artist and researcher who specialises in the philosophy of art and aesthetics. Her work has been featured in various periodical and quarterly magazines worldwide, as well as internationally renowned biennials such as those of Liverpool, Busan, Taipei, Shanghai, and Venice.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Liverpool, specialising in the intersections of culture, economics and media. I have worked with the artists, writers and policy makers who have influenced my research, and the design and architecture firms who have helped shape the city in the UK and around the world. My dissertation looks at the cultural and political contexts of the biennale in Liverpool and Manchester. It focuses on the role that arts-funded organisations play in the creation of artist-led cultural environments. In Liverpool, the Biennale is a multi-year collaborative process involving the arts organisation, national galleries, cultural organisations, educational</text>

The AI biannual would allow for the creation of new artworks, the blending of old and the emergence of entirely new art forms; it would also allow for the measurement and analysis of how art is made and consumed, and the role that art can play in creating a just and sustainable future. The publication of AI would also allow for the analysis and measurement of art's social implications, since we know that AI biannuals would create new kinds of connections between people and places.Art has always played a part in the calculations of economic production and consumption. The rise of global communication and economic exchange in the twentieth century coincided with a general increase in population, which meant that people had to be nastier, more urban and more technologically sophisticated to be able to access and use all the media of life. This increased complexity came with a cost, however; it came at the expense of everything from grass-fed beef to nesting pairs of birds and mammals to sea turtles. Therefore, art played a part in the production of ever more encompassing representations of the world around us, which expanded the capabilities of artisans everywhere to respond to ever-flexing budgets and consumption. In other words, art was valued as a commodity, and its</text>

The AI biannual could be the end result of a curatorial conceit or the work of an independent curator. Either way, it would offer opportunities for the growing number of art collectors to be taken on a new kind of journey.Download this article as PDFAna Laura López de la TorreAmmisontemps: Inverting the World, 2015.

If done right, it could even come about to serve as a catalyst for the creation of new art forms.Art has always been a tricky thing to quantify and account for. If done right, it can be incredibly powerful. The power to be reckoned with is what comes from within, and what makes us who we are. However, as increasingly happens in the AI biannual, rightness becomes increasingly complex, and a kind of unknowability sets in. The AI biannual could very well end up being made up of many different things, and the reasons for which are myriad. But what it could also end up being is art, because that’s what we humans do. It’s a kind of art that is both made in and emerges from the world of robots. If done right, however, it could end up being very useful indeed.Download this article as PDFRyan AventRyan Avent is an artist, writer</text>

But the advent of AI biannuals would allow artists to become fully autonomous and also for artists to explore new creative ways of working with data. This could mean new ways of associating with audiences, of course. The AI biannual would also allow for the creation of ever larger and more pervasive data mining operations, with artists and critics becoming virtual employees of the company that develops artistic works and data feeds. All of this is consistent with the idea that AI plays a small role in the overall architecture of the contemporary world.Art should not only deliver messages; it should deliver a set of legitimised ways of knowing as well. That is, it should deliver a system that supports artistic creativity in ways that are both intuitive and also that exert a significant influence on how we think about the world.Art shouldn’t just deliver messages; it should deliver</text>
