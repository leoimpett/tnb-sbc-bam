She was one of the curators of the Italian pavilion, alongside Joseph Grima, Paolo Baratta, Sandeep Parmar and Maurizio Lazzarato. 	Powerless Campanions is the story of two encampments – a city in its own right – in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. It takes the form of two parallel histories, one in which the protagonists are present in a fictional city in the Italian pavilion, and the other in which the protagonists are absent from this fictional city. The exhibition was curated as a ‘presentation of the present in the present’, while the subtitle of the Italian pavilion was changed from  	Milan Philharmonic’ to something more like  	Powerless Campanions. The idea that the protagonists of a fictional ‘city in the Italian pavilion’ would engage with the visitors’ narratives was retained, but the text that accompanied the images was</text>

Then, in December, we moved to Venice, and Venice to Milan, and Venice to New York. I think these are the specific, glacial, episodic journeys that we can make when we have the opportunity, and in the biennial we have the power. 	But in the present moment when biennials are being reneweded in different geographical locations around the world, it’s important for the history of the biennial to be re-written, because in the present moment, the biennial is a double-edged sword: it serves as a seemingly valuable, temporary archive, and it also serves as a vehicle that holds the contemporary biennial for years to come. The biennial today is a ‘present and future archive’, with images and traces of all kinds of historical change. But it is also a ‘past that will likely be revised and updated in unpredictable ways, depending on the state of knowledge and understanding at the time of writing.</text>

In the early 1990s, Francesco Bonami, Geof Dähmlow, and I created the corpus callosum, or the metainterface, an interface for the metainterface. It was created as a tool for documentary and art criticism, and through a process of inversion, or virtual merging, the images were produced in a way that was both recognisable as literature and accessible via image. The callosum forms the basis of a new kind of interface: the interface irregularly aligned to the specificity of the sites on which it is installed. This new kind of interface is a place where the specific and the universal are made to interact. It is a new paradigm for the</text>

A city, a street or even an isolated outpost of a city becomes the site of a circus act. Her act, which is now often misconstrued, is that of infiltration. I say this as someone who once taught at the Culinary Institute of Arts in Rome. It was a teaching gig. I would never knowingly put my name to something I didn’t want to be put in. It was a challenging teaching gig, with students like you and me, but also a cultural gig. She got the message. And she has her own sort of cult-like following, which is to say, a cult-like following among art students and art collectors. I have a sort of cult-like following because I collect things.

The biennale’s next major location is in Istanbul at Time Warner Makkah, where it will be staged in October 2019.Given our historical and contemporary circumstances, it’s not surprising that the biennial would be the object of a historical and contemporary research project. The biennial has an object of contemplation across multiple cultural zones, from its original cultural core, now submerged by global tourism, to what can be thought of as ‘the Internet of Things’ – a networked, connected, data-driven world where everything is captured, and everything is written about. For many of us, however, the question is whether the biennial can find a place in this new information society. In these new media contexts, the biennial seems particularly vulnerable. In a recent survey, over one-third of the biennial audience indicated that they no longer attend as many shows as they used to, and half indicated that they no longer visit as often, due to</text>

It takes the form of a ‘powerless circle’. In the form of a biennale, it’s a ‘monumental event that happens to be a closed contest’. It captures the essence of what it means to be a ‘celebrity’ in the age of constant global celebrity, and it offers a possible alternative for the troubled site of the biennale. Powerless Campanions opens the documentary tradition of documenta 14, and documents the reasons why this was necessary in the first place.

The next documenta 14, held in 2018 in Athens, Greece, will be the first in a two-year history of the pavilion in New York, with exhibitions in all seven parks of Manhattan. The idea of New York, ‘the City of Art’, is a metaphor for the fracturing of the biennale as a global phenomenon, and the moving of its museum collections into private hands. In recent years, the biennale has moved from being a ‘permanent, permanent, public site of art’, as it was originally intended by its founding fathers, to one that is increasingly evident in online social media feeds: a museum of temporary art, and a marketplace for the transient. 	In these biennales, artists and curators are invited to explore their identity through the narrative of a crisis. The 2011 Biennale, in turn, was an event that put the biennial in the public sphere, through which it is now possible</text>

It was a virtual manifesto for the project, and the curators and artists there were as well as artists around the world. It was a series of photographs that functioned as documents, while documents were digitised and shared across platforms. Inside the exhibition, documents were read out loud, but also coded. At the center of the exhibition was a network of underground tunnels that connected various parts of the world. As an image, they were a metaphor, a point of convergence</text>

As an artist and educator I’m used to seeing new things, investing in things I understand, and then having an impact. But I also see a lot of repetition and a realisation that is quite recent: that this is the age of the viral, peer-reviewed journal article and the many social media posts and images that we constantly feed into our newsfeeds. And I’m not just saying that. There are so many social media apps and websites now that collect and aggregate data about where you are, what you do, and how you behave that it’s easy to become embedded in this ecosystem. When you walk down the street, or connect with a shop, or even just sit down, you become a data feed. And as a result there is a lot of repetition: people telling each other stories, using different data feeds, and so forth. I see this

And as a result there is a lot of repetition: people telling each other stories, using different data feeds, and so forth. I see this in my local community: what used to be known as the Liverpool Biennial was once known as the 'Little India of Europe' and now it’s simply known as ‘the Asian Biennial’ (despite the fact that, as we all know, India has yet to be visited by Western artists). There is a real sense of entitlement to this kind of repetition. We started off by saying that there are certain practices that are indigenous to our context, and so by adopting those we mean that we’re appropriating what is already here. But I think what we’re doing is really problematic, because it appropriates what is already there: the practices of the artists who’d come before us, and the ways in which they’re constructing nationalism. And I agree that there’s a danger in this kind of appropriation: you start to build up a kind of national identity around people who are already present, people who are present in certain ways</text>

And as a result there is a lot of repetition: people telling each other stories, using different data feeds, and so forth. I see this in the communities I work with: the Roma community are a good example, as are the LGBT community. Asking the right questions are a must, and the only way to truly understand something is for people to be able to share and understand it. But in a larger context, in this case a community, how to ask the right questions is also essential. Assembling the right group of people to engage with a project is a two-way street: if the project is too encompassing, it’s difficult to define the scope of what is desired, and the project is inhibited. Framing questions correctly is crucial, and understanding the larger picture is possible only through direct interaction. But if the project is too circumscribed, the developers and scholars who design the art are able to see the bigger picture, and thereby limit the impact of their work. For example, a project such as this one may well be framed as a ‘how to make a place in which to live,</text>

And as a result there is a lot of repetition: people telling each other stories, using different data feeds, and so forth. I see this in my work as well: in the exhibition I led in Liverpool, which was a ‘whitelist’ of certain things that I consider art and in which I’d put things that I have made into works that are part of a project. For example, in Liverpool Biennial’s 2014/15, I put a project I had started in 2014 called The Resident into works that were part of the commissioning process for the Biennial. I commissioned a series of prints and posters with words like ‘revolt’ and ‘rebellion’ written in large letters on them, and I placed them out in the open during a time when the Biennial was contemplating its future. They were a way for the biennial to tell its story without necessarily telling a story through the works itself. 	[1] See: http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/learn/professions/art/arts_and_design/</text>

And as a result there is a lot of repetition: people telling each other stories, using different data feeds, and so forth. I see this in the way that the Russian artist, Natalya Trikhabadskaya, approached the recent conflict in Ukraine. In her art, there is often a question mark or ‘hatch’ in relation to the idea, but in practice she incorporated all the elements of a conflict into a single image. She used stencils, tar, bullets, burnt-out Ukrainian transport wrecks, pools of blood and civilian vehicles, and even used the discarded Ukrainian flag. But in the midst of this she used the Ukrainian flag as a shield, drawing attention away from the Ukrainian crisis and creating a mirror image. She did this in order to show a Ukrainian soldier, fighting alongside fellow artists Russel Norman Wilkinson and Arkady Rotenberg, that the conflict was not unique to Ukraine and that there are other conflicts around the world. And she did this in order to draw attention to the fact that there are refugee crises all over the world, from Syria to Lebanon, Afghanistan to Sri Lanka, and</text>

And as a result there is a lot of repetition: people telling each other stories, using different data feeds, and so forth. I see this in my students: their stories are told by people who are already embedded in this ecosystem, and so are the actions that they take, the places where they are, and the things they have done. And here I think the power of the exhibition is particularly apparent. When I walk through a particular neighbourhood or neighbourhood block, or as I do with my students, I find myself drawn to certain parts of the block or neighbourhood, or even part of the block, that I know my students will never set foot in. And so they will never set foot in that part of the block, and I will walk past it thousands of times without ever setting foot in it. And this is interesting, this power dynamic: once you have that power, you can never take it away from us. It seems that way to me, and I’m lucky to have had the opportunity to work with some of those students. But I do worry about the constant shifting of that power, the way in which our</text>

And as a result there is a lot of repetition: people telling each other stories, using different data feeds, and so forth. I see this reflected in the installations I have been able to jointly commission, which are usually interventions into the routines of daily life in and around the Podhora people. For the Liverpool Biennial, I used data from the Podhora Cultural Centre and the BIRN Digital Panorama project to create a daily ritualised through video and text that was both voyeuristic and participatory. It was a unique hybrid of art and social activity that sought to understand how people engage with art through voyeuristic methods, but also enquired into the mechanisms that allow us to engage with and create our own creativity through the art of others. The ability to do this, and to have the art be shared between the communities along the Croatian border, was an important moment in the history of Biennials in this country.In fact, there were other important moments too, moments when the artist-centred culture of the biennial changed and demanded a greater level of accountability and transparency, but the link between the bi</text>

And as a result there is a lot of repetition: people telling each other stories, using different data feeds, and so forth. I see this reflected in the artistic output of the past few years: the proliferation of curatorial styles, the proliferation of biennials, the proliferation of art and curatorial collaboration. But it is also evident in the number of exhibitions per annum, the number of curatorial styles, and the number of art and curatorial worlds that exist today. In a general sense, these changes reflect the changes induced by the information economy.These social changes are, of course, products of the information economy, and are in no way a replacement for the art and art history that was produced and celebrated in the decades immediately following the Second World War. The information economy demands a certain amount of labour and energy today, and whilst the biennials and the large-scale international curatorial forms that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s bear some similarities to the curatorial work of the 1930s and 1940s, the proliferation of online platforms for gathering, organising and consuming information (especially social media) today is different.</text>

I see this in the work of artists and curators such as Krysa, who will create a project that has captured the city’s cultural essence with a unique urban setting, but then also in the local artists who collaborate with her on other projects around the city. The way in which we inhabit our data-gathering behaviour in this country is increasingly influenced by the companies that we’ve created or joined. The example of the Krysa Project is an artist’s project that has been curated by Victoria Browne at the Victoria and Albert Museum and The Cutler, John Lennon’s Old Bailey. It was started as a project at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and has since been curated by John Lennon and the Cutler, and it has been made part of The Cutler’s new exhibition, The Life and Times of John Lennon (2016).At the same time, the way in which we create and consume culture is also influencing how we interpret and create meaning for ourselves and our</text>

I see this in the project that I am funding, The Resident, which is a project that seeks to bring a political and social perspective to a residential area in the city. In doing so, I create an experience specifically tailored to the needs of a political party, organisation or candidate. The project has been hugely successful, and I’m very proud to say that over the past year alone we have received funding from the Swedish Council for a further five million krona. Yet we have to ask ourselves and others: what is the real impact of this kind of work? What are the long-term outcomes? And if we do decide to put our bodies in motion, what kind of shaping mechanisms do we create?These are questions that continue to haunt me. And there is a sense of hopelessness about the question, as if the future simply doesn’t know how to answer them. But there is some good news: there is a growing body of research that suggests that in urban settings, such</text>

But I also see people who are engaged in creating alternative realities, who are engaged in dismantling structures and creating new ones, who are engaged in learning about history, who are engaged in imagining new futures. And I see something of that in the way in which people are organising themselves now. There is a sense of reclaiming lost causes and making new ones. And I look forward to seeing what those new futures may be.

In an ideal world, perhaps, a biennial would occupy a regular museum slot, providing an annual counterpoint to what is often portrayed as a museum check-list. However, as biennials increasingly occupy both the  	 and the artworld, museums are stretched thin, and so the art world gets in the way. A biennial of the  	 should be a place where art is experienced as art, or at least art experiences itself as experiencing something like art; where art is experienced as occurring in a physical or conceptual space (rather than as a collection of artefacts).‘Art’s portfolio should be experienced as a work in</text>

It would offer a chance to develop talent in a space that is both artist-centered but also teaches critical theory and aesthetics to a community of students and artists alike. It would offer artists the chance to be embedded in the site and participate in a developing process that includes developing an arts education for a young person’s audience, while simultaneously providing an outlet for the artist to be present in the site and actively involved in shaping its culture.  	The problem with the biennial today is that</text>

It would be a place where contemporary art could challenge the established art forms, and might even become a vehicle to promote the established art forms, at least in theory.There are of course many obstacles to be overcome before such a thing could even be considered a reality, but there are also creative ways to start: encouraging artistic and community trust-building activities via the development of arts councils; supporting arts-informed citizenship programmes through the arts councils; providing resources and technical expertise for the development of culturally responsive arts curriculums; providing culturally responsive art-education programmes via the arts education authorities; establishing partnerships with arts-friendly non-profit arts organisations; and so forth. It is true that such action would incur huge costs and face fierce opposition from vested interests, but these issues would have to be dealt with in the political system, and the fact that bi</text>

It could, if the biennial were to become a real thing, become a counter to the monotony and boredom of what is sometimes called ‘presentism’. It would be a space of encounter, not just for the tourist, but also for the visiting biennial.It would not be the biennial of the future, but the biennial of the present, in which the biennial would occupy a smaller place in museum exhibits and perhaps even less in the popular imagination. It would, perhaps, be a place where biennials might set up shop, hire staff, and establish partnerships with non-profit arts organisations and community organisations. It would be a place where artists could come and work alongside artists and other art-creators-students-in-residence, with the artists themselves employed as artists' assistants or art-developers’ partners. It would be a place where biennials might present a range of works from different artists’ studios; where artists might conduct mini-exhibitions among artists’ studios; and, finally, a place where artists might convene around a central exhibition platform, or even establish their own exhibition platform. These are not visions of a utopian future art museum, or some mix of modern and futuristic imaginations. These are actual proposals for what might be if art were no longer constituted as a commodity or a ‘fixed capital asset’, but rather regulated and appropriated by a government. These proposals were put forward by artists, curators, artists’ unions, art historians, art critics and others concerned with the condition of art and the role of the artist in society. They received substantial and critical commentary in both academic and art world publications, and over a period</text>

It would, perhaps, be a place where biennials might set up shop, hire staff, and establish partnerships with non-profit arts organisations and community organisations. It would be a place where artists could come and work alongside artists and other art-creators-students-teachers and many other art practitioners, offering studios, schools, schools, and even galleries space and free access to those galleries with which they identify. It would be a place where artists could be free to explore their artistic potentials, and indeed to establish long-term partnerships with other art practitioners, offering studios, schools, and even community galleries space and even cafés. It would also be a place where art could be made by those who share its geography, its climate, its resources and who share its neighbourhood.More than that, I think it would offer a kind of cultural hygiene – a neighbourhood culture – that is not confined to the precincts of the city, or even the metropolis. It would foster a kind of understanding between the locals and visitors that extends beyond the boundaries of the city, and that creates an exchange between the two. That is, if we are going to be able to imagine a future where biennials do not dominate visitor experiences and if we are going</text>

It would be a ‘space for the taking’, where the taking part in the exhibition of art does not have a presumed legitimising value, but rather is an act of trustworthiness and responsibility, of which the participant is accountable. It would not be a biennial of the future, but a place to consider the questions, act upon the answers, and propose possible futures for the art world as a whole.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is Associate Professor in The Arts and Creative Technologies, McGill University, and holds the Canada Research Chair in Contemporary Art</text>

One of them is the tendency of art museums to become places of exchange between art and commerce, a tendency that can no longer be allowed to stand. Art museums are no longer the beacons of light and hope in a desert of pessimism and alienation. The biennial is a rare exception to this monotony. It must, however, be differentiated from other art forms in its focus, because it is an art form, and, unlike other art forms, art museums are not independent, autonomous spaces of contemplation. They are firmly embedded in the cultural substrate of their host country, and their continued scholarly work is often informed by the country and local politics of the place. They are not free marketplaces of creativity, but rather invest heavily in the production of culturally responsive art</text>

The art and architecture will reside in separate worlds. The curatorial approach to the project is an attempt to capture the magic of the neighherhood without the magic bullet of a magical urban solution. The project is intended to be a way to begin to unravel the layers of the neighbourhood and its history, to reveal hidden narratives and hidden connections, to enable new approaches to engaging the local community in ways that go beyond the usual ways of engaging people through art and architecture.  The curatorial approach to this kind of immersive cultural intervention is not an easy thing to pull off. It requires people with creative minds and strong motivations, but it also demands that these people also have the guts to actually do it.

A mix of experts and activists from a wide range of disciplines will gather to discuss the challenges facing Toronto with a particular focus on TTC 11, a neighbourhood where the Chinatown Arts Centre is located and where Stepney works. The goal of the workshop is to create a public forum for ideas, arguments and counterarguments to be aired and considered, with the participants selected according to a representative sample of ideas, arguments and counter arguments. The ideas, arguments and contemporaneous materials will be submitted in a form deployable by both the artist and the organisation, with the outcome of the symposium decided by a final advisory committee made up of representatives from the CHC and the city.

This is the third time the project has been curated. The first two years saw the installation of work in the HMR area followed by the provision of arts education and curatorial training for young people’s and artists’ development. The project was re-curated and re-titled Art Matters in the HMR area and Art Matters in the City. The third year saw the installation of Works of Art and Matter, a project that sought to explore the contemporaneity and contemporaneousness of different forms of art and community architecture. The main themes of the exhibition were ‘contemporaneousness and simultaneity’. This time around, the curators take into account the relationships between art and the contemporary urban environment and the built environment alongside a wider cultural, economic and listening perspective. The concept of community engagement comes into play.</text>

The Tower has reached it’s 10th generation and has shown the strong commitment of the local community to its future use.

As such, they are often times complex to understand in a condensed time, and the unwieldy nature of the art is often exaggerated in media. Nevertheless, they functioned as point of entry into a larger cultural system, and ultimately outflow from it. Stepney has said that her project wouldn’t be possible without the generous financial support from the Biennale Council. The funding came from multiple sources, including sponsorships, private donations, events, membership fees, and the construction of two new biennials in the city, the 2014 and 2017 in which the Biennale Council supported the</text>

The project will be a place where artists, curators, artists’ assistants and community organisers can come together to explore how art can influence a neighbourhood’s future development, through stories told through archival documents, artwork, audio installations, scripts, drawings, planning documents, and even just plain old history. The combination of archival, archival materials, and contemporary artists working across disciplines will produce a rich result.  The project was first proposed in 2015 by Emily Pringle and Tim Cresswell, and has been supported by the Leverhulme Trust and the Leverhulme Development Corporation. The new proposal was presented at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Southwark Arts Forum in March 2016. The new proposal was supplemented by material from Future City, which was performed at the 19th London Biennale in 2015. The new proposal is now at version2.0.0/0.9/ in GitHub, and the old proposal is archived here.

The project has been awarded funding from the Arts Council, the MFA Partnership Fund, the MFA Development Fund, and FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology).  	The news that Community Land Trusts are to be rebranded as National Land Trusts comes as no surprise to us. It is the policy of the UK government that recognises the historical and continuing importance of the National Trusts and places public ownership firmly at the centre of thinking about how property is to be distributed. While we do not yet know what the name of the new type of National Land Trust will be, it is already becoming increasingly clear that the development of such organisations is likely to descend, at some point in the future, into what is being coined a ‘Tipping Point Event’ – a point where the prevailing forces of global capitalism no longer provide any incentive for private investment. </text>

The Biennial Condition: the Condition of Existent Art Space
Art is often described as an essential part of the ‘Existing Form’.1  Art is always serving as a check or balance on the development that threatens to overwhelm or corrupt the city. As historical and contemporary curating becomes ever more institutionalised, it is crucial that the institutionalised form adapts to the changing</text>

The project will be a place where artists, curators, artists’ assistants and community organisers can come together to explore how art can influence a neighbourhood’s future development, with or without the involvement of the city.  	The artists and community organisers involved in the project will have a say in what is considered an appropriate use of the art  and the community infrastructure; in terms of who can use what site and what can’t be used; and in terms of what can and cannot be built on what site. This will include but is not limited to artists, curators, artisans, architects, community organisers and any others who have a role in shaping the future of the site and the infrastructure. 	In terms of materials and manufacturing processes, this will include but be cognisant of the fact that this is a post-Fordist society: the use of concrete, steel, asphalt, bricks and similar building products are the building blocks of gentrification, and the future for many communities is one in which art is actively encouraged and distributed across a site-specificity that is built on the backs</text>

It is anticipated that this phase will see the introduction of new ways of working and a new set of skills acquisition, which will allow for the creation of new ways of using the place, including the creation of worker-run cooperatives and worker-owned agencies as well as the creation of worker-managed tourist companies.

In the last decades of the nineteenth century, this transformation of the individual into a cog in a machine machine was made possible by the development of great technological know-how, which allowed us to surmount the cognitive challenge of imagining possibilities beyond the physical world. But with the advent of mass media and computer chips, the capacity to imagine new possibilities is no longer required. And since the capacities of human behaviour are bounded – subject to the vagaries of the resource-constrained technological environment – these are few and far between. It is much more realistic to imagine a world in which the individual is free to evolve through skillful use of new information and hardware, and thus to conceptualise the capacity for action as occurring between two physical objects.  	What is at Stake in the Biennale’s Moment to Visionary Chapel?The Biennale has had its moments of visionary power.

Jorge Rafael Cardoso’s Biennale, for example, radiated from the Basque city of San Sebastian through the Italian city of Turin and, eventually, to Vienna. It was a catalyst for the development of biennials in other European capitals, and in North America. Cardoso was a curator, a futurist and a visionary. But his biennale was not just any biennale: it was the first in a new order established by a new media of ideas, it was a vision of the future – pre-Institutionalised Realism – and it was, above all, a vision of the one hundred and first anniversary of the birth of Realism. The other curators there, Joasia Krysa and Paola Marrati, were artists and composers, and in their own way visionary curators. But their work was no less urgent, and much less visually interesting, because they happened to be artists, or because they happened to be</text>

Bernard Acema’s 1990 Paris Biennale was one of the few places on earth where a fully realised version of the Animal House concept was actually realised. The abject failure of that vision in the wake of the earthquake and terror that would strike Paris that year is a turning point in the Biennale’s history, but its power and significance endures. Acema’s project was a watershed event in the history of biennials, and the impetus for a generation of artists to be inspired by the art they saw on the terraces of Paris. There were many artists who came out of the rubble of the city, but Acema’s project stands out as one of the most eminent, because it is a turning away from the city’s industrial past, and it is a challenge to what has historically been seen as the natural artistic trajectory. In other words, it is a response to the perception of art in the city, and specifically, in</text>

The 2014 Istanbul Biennale, for instance, used its first day to establish a location for the entire exhibition, developing a kind of ‘permanent motion picture studio’ through the installation of 35,000 square metres of video and audio recording equipment. The exhibition then moved into a ‘construction zone’ through which the movement of individual artefacts was coordinated. The project was part of a wider ‘mission-driven’ initiative from Dutch cultural organiser ABB to showcase the country’s cultural assets. The 2014 Venice Biennale followed a similar plan, but with an emphasis on the work of artists and the processes through which they produce art. The Biennale has a long-term research agenda, and the 2014 iteration marked its 10th year in the capital. The Biennale therefore had to find creative ways to engage with its location, a question that naturally came to mind for the project. In the years leading up to the 2014 Venice Bienn</text>

One such moment was generated by the Biennale's own decision to take place in the historic place of St Paul’s Cathedral – itself a manifestation of the English constitutional monarchy – in the year 2064. Some have claimed that the decision was motivated by a kind of pan-national pan-religious pan-epistemology. In truth, the decision was more like a postcolonial imperial dynastic epiphany. A monolith of European heritage, St Paul’s Cathedral looms enormous in London, and represents to this day the imperial ambitions of the British state. In 2014, a coalition of civil-rights groups staged a ‘Christmas tree vigil’ in response to the erection of a Christmas market in the church yard. The Biennale was invited to undertake the project, and from that moment forward, the design was a daily mediation between commerce, culture and religion in the church yard. It is now part of Tate Britain, and the Biennale’s permanent</text>
    <text>human behaviour and technology, in which the individual is reduced to passive components, including mass media and computer chips. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, this transformation of the individual into a cog in a machine machine was made possible by the development of great technological know-how, which allowed us to surmount the cognitive challenge of imagining possibilities beyond the physical world. But with the advent of mass media and computer chips, the capacity to imagine new possibilities is no longer required. And since the capacities of human behaviour are bounded – subject to the vagaries of the resource-constrained technological environment – these are few and far between. It is much more realistic to imagine a world in which the individual is free to evolve through skillful use of new information and hardware, and thus to conceptualise the capacity for action as occurring between two physical objects.  	What is at Stake in the Biennale’s Moment to Visionary Chapel?The Biennale has had its moments of visionary power. Marcelo Claure, the Spanish artist who choreographed the 1995 Venice Biennale, is a case in point. He used the occasion to suggest new ways of approaching history and the social. Inspired by Thomas Allsen’s influential book The Social Life of Art, he began to investigate the ways in which art and architecture might be reconfigured through contemporary means. Art as social construction, he argued, was no longer sufficient to explain why art was so powerfully engaging, so influential and so enduring. Art had to become political and social in some fundamental respects. Therefore, art had to become artists’ instruments of political and social transformation. Claure’s work, which was performed in the streets of Venice in response to the Biennale’s decision to move to the Arsenale, became a catalyst for the creation of a new generation of artists interested in the possibilities of urban and regional change. He was a catalyst, too, because his plans were put into effect.</text>

From its inception in 1989, when Jean Guy Lecat and Bernard Heilman selected the venue and selected the theme, to the 2014 iteration, which brought together elements from many biennials, including the past, the present and a virtual present, the present is seen by some as constituting the museum or the city, and thus the site of contemporaneity or the city. But these are transient and variable experiences, and the biennial is no longer seen as a site of potential future for the city. It is time to transition to a temporality of social and political change, and in the real-life or contemporaneous biennale we are no longer interested in the aesthetics of contemporaneity, but in the politics of contemporaneity. The Biennale has, in this sense, become a site of possible futures, and it is this transient and variable interest that informs its various incarnations. The biennale needs to be able to articulate a vision for the city</text>

The 2014 Istanbul Biennale saw its powers of inspiration extended to a whole city, bringing together the disparate elements of different components of the city in a process known as ‘construction’. In the production of the 2013 Venice Biennale, the Biennale appointed a collective of architects and landscape architects as its visionary client. The challenge was two-fold: to reimagine the architecture of the city in a way that would be captivating to tourists but also to the city’s under-explored urban fabric, which was then left to moulder. The architects’ proposal was considered by the Biennale Committee, which in turn, by and large approved it without much questioning. It was only when the idea of a ‘biennial’ was put to one side that fierce community opposition arose. Many in the Biennale Committee felt that the project had been put on a pedestal by its visionary director, Jeanne Heeswijk, who was</text>

In the running of the Venice Biennale, the Biennale provides the public, artists, curators, historians and critics with a unique vantage point into the pulse of the city. This vantage point is essential for a visitor to the beautiful city, but also for an artist to become embedded in the city and entwined with its rhythms. The Biennale, as a curatorial enterprise, is a moment of apex visibility, but it is also a moment of de-legitimisation of the city. The Biennale’s greatest asset is its capacity to generate buzz and buzz associated with a project, but like all artefacts it loses its luster with use and neglect. The Biennale has a precious but finite amount of luster: the art it shows us is bound to a particular moment in time, and thus will last for ever. The Biennale must therefore find other ways of engaging with and in relationship to the city at large, in order</text>

Nathaniel Branden’s Biennale was one of the few cultural institutions able to sustain a sustained engagement with the current political and social circumstances in the city of New York. André Breton’s Biennale, which followed two years later, represents a rare exception. Breton’s Biennale was a rare instance of cultural imperialism. Drawing on his own experiences as a journalist living in Eastern Europe, Branden exploited the Eastern Bloc as a political compass to explore the effects of regionalism and neocolonialism on the developing world. In so doing, it was a token response to the historical and present conditions of the biennale in an area with a potentially significant impact in the future of the art market. The Biennale has had other moments of cultural panache as well. In 2014, the New York Museum of Art staged Guy Mandel’s (director) Louis XIII, complete with 360 panoramic photos, in response to the</text>

Take, for example, the visionary decision to recommence the project to reconstruct the former Maginot Line railway in London’s Trafalgar Square. The decision, made in April 2016, and made in conjunction with the Stem Cells Initiative, marks a new stage in the project – a stage that will see the re-construction of the entire historic Trafalgar Square network, including the historic part dedicated to St George’s Cathedral. The network will run parallel to the existing Trans-Pennine railway, which runs along the same stretch of the TPN. At present, the Maginot Line is used by tram and ferry to take passengers between Liverpool and other parts of the UK. While the Maginot Line has a history of running into trouble with the authorities, the Stem Cells Initiative seems to have a handle on the city’s transport infrastructure. The decision to re-establish the cathedral part of the network in the central part of the city seems to</text>

The Public Programme was concerned about the pervasiveness of consumer culture and the emergence of virtual mobs, whose behaviour could be predicted and controlled, and spawned the social scientist Keith Bjorklund to examine how culture mediated with the behaviour of individuals. The emergence of social media and the massive storage of images meant that the Public Programme’s work carried over to the social. In Bjorklund’s words: ‘Art, and especially video art, has become entwined with the ever-expanding, ever-ambiguous definition of the contemporary and is now viewed as a public resource – a set of techniques, a set of assumptions, a set of beliefs – which are actively engaged with and informed by contemporary urban and regionalisation all around the world.’[11] And this is just the way of the 21st century. Art, and especially video art, is becoming ever more embedded in the public sphere, and cultural institutions are keen to stress that point. The New Media Museum, which I co-founded, is an art institution with a digital arts department, and is currently undertaking a major exhibition of its type in New York, where it</text>

The Public Programme was concerned about the pervasiveness of consumer culture and the emergence of virtual mobs, whose behaviour could be predicted and controlled, and spawned the social scientist Keith Bjorklund to analyse the communitarian practices of community art, which he saw as an essential node of the visual arts' social life. In the 2000s, the emergence of social media combined the power of the network with the direct reach of artists, who could assemble massive audiences online and off and still be effectively controlled.The relationship between art and social media has been on a constant evolution, and it is no exaggeration to say that the social media culture of the nineties was significantly influenced by the social media culture of the nineties. The popularity of Instagram in the 2000s and the massive growth of Facebook in the years that followed signals a new media age in which social media is the new seed stock for a new media industry. In the social networking age of the nineties, community art is still primarily concerned with the emergence of user-friendly profiles and applications that map social events to specific places and people, but the cultural industries that support them are also shifting their focus to more abstract, but potentially destructive</text>

The Public Programme was concerned about the pervasiveness of consumer culture and the emergence of virtual mobs, whose behaviour could be predicted and controlled, and spawned the social scientist Keith Bjorklund to develop a conceptual language to describe behaviourally engaged cultures. Virtuality and the cult of personality were also part of the Public Programme agenda. The cult of personality emerged as a way to explain away the appearance of hyper-reality in the form of hypertext narratives and social networks. In the cult of personality, participants identify with a charismatic figure – a sort of mythical figure – who preaches a shared destiny and mission to a cult of followers. Here, the artist Terry Smith draws on his experience as a member of the Cult of Personality in order to offer a critique of consumer culture and the cult of celebrity.The cult of personality has a kind of magical quality about it. You don’t really know what you are signing up for until you have been subjected to a series of intense interrogation questions about how much you are willing to sacrifice your identity for the sake of the group’s self-perception. ‘The cult of personality is a classic example of how an idea is</text>

The Public Programme was concerned about the pervasiveness of consumer culture and the emergence of virtual mobs, whose behaviour could be predicted and controlled, and spawned the social scientist Keith Bjorklund to analyse the art and visual culture produced by these virtual mobs. The Public Programme was also concerned about the spread of genetic engineering and related technologies, which could alter the structure of the biosphere and alter the world as we know it. The two organisations that produced the Public Programme – the Arts Centre in Toronto and the Culinary Institute of America in New York – saw their artistic output heavily impacted by the technological innovations created by these nascent social networks. The emergence of the social networks that would later be dubbed the internet and mobile phones coincided with a shift in the focus of cultural resources from images of art to images of people. This shift also coincided with the advent of social networking sites that allowed people to connect through images, and the proliferation of image hosting services that offered images of things as static, pseudo-active online services. Eventually, cultural resources became divided between those that produced images of individuals and those that produced images of social networks. The result was a sharp cultural divide that harried artistic productivity</text>

The Public Programme was concerned about the pervasiveness of consumer culture and the emergence of virtual mobs, whose behaviour could be predicted and controlled, and spawned the social scientist Keith Bjorklund to develop critical art forms into socially engaged practices. In the 2000s, Bjorklund and his team started a project called Projections, which was driven by artist and director Jill Sobule, and part of the Gordon and Betty Moore Gallery. The project was part of the exhibitionary programme of the Gordon and Betty Moore Gallery, and at the time, featured a year-round running schedule including a 20th Annual Fellowship of the Gallery, where artists and artists' collective worked in a number of of projects funded by the gallery. The projections project was a response to a curatorial approach that questioned the role of art in the service of power, and in the service of love and history. The proposals and interventions came from everywhere, and included everything from poems to documentaries to magazine spreads to websites to social media platforms.

The Public Programme was concerned about the pervasiveness of consumer culture and the emergence of virtual mobs, whose behaviour could be predicted and controlled, and spawned the social scientist Keith Bjorkman to argue that the public had become disillusioned with art as a way of interacting with art. In the 2000s, Arjun Appadurai argued in his book The New Media Monolith that the Public Programme had been a major force in shifting how art was constituted, and that the emergence of social media opened up new forms of collaborative and activist art.In a 2007 report, the New York Public Library claimed that the Public Programme had become a 'massive cultural centre, spawned by a city’s successful 1999 Entertainment District Initiative' (a $4 million gift from the city). Although the exact nature of this claim remains unclear, there is strong evidence that the programme had more direct and immediate effects on the city’s image, as well as on local businesses and tourism. The report was based on a three-year, $4 million project funded by the New York City Arts Council and the New York Public Library. The Council unanimously returned a compliment to the library’s proposal</text>

The Public Programme was concerned about the pervasiveness of consumer culture and the emergence of virtual mobs, whose behaviour could be predicted and controlled, and spawned the social scientist Keith Bjorkman to argue that the art form had entered a ‘postmodern’ phase. In the early 2000s, Gilles Jacquemont, Claude Lévi-Strauss Professor of French Cultural Theory at McGill University, Canada, and Curator of Public Art at the Sorbonne, France, opened a new chapter in the history of cultural theory by arguing that art’s social function had shifted from questioning authority to directly interacting with it.Art is the mediator in the social construction of relations of domination, he maintained. And this shift was essential for the possibility of any lasting change to be enacted. So art had to be embedded in a social context in order to exert significant influence. In other words, the Public Programme didn’t just prescribe what visual arts projects could be done in a given year, but also what kind of context would be created. This was an important point of departure for artists to make in their work, and it remains to this day a crucial</text>

The Public Programme was concerned about the pervasiveness of consumer culture and the emergence of virtual mobs, whose behaviour could be predicted and controlled, and spawned the social scientist Keith Bjorklund to develop ways of thinking about art and culture in a politicised context. The visual arts were seen as a passive, subservient audience, who attended concerts and exhibitions with little understanding of the practices that empowered and constrained their presence. As a result, Bjorklund's work was largely ignored or rendered inappreciable. The emergence of social media and the random access archives it allowed established a critical mass of readers and viewers who grasped the need to be informed. The mass media provided a platform for the work to gain momentum and forge an image, and over time, this led to a position that was less easily categorized. It is this tension that remains today, especially in the context of Brexit and other anxieties about depopulation. The social media revolution transformed the way that artists and arts organisations were situated within the public and democratised the creation of new media within the art world. However, it also created opportunities for established artists to exploit the perceived public good and bolster their reputations</text>

It was also at this time that the emergence of social media and the sharing of practices between artists and audiences coincided with the emergence of new media, making it easier for audiences to identify and engage with artworks, and for curators to connect with communities

The rise of the social and cultural historian is closely connected to the development of photography and the increasing accessibility of images. The advent and rapid proliferation of photography has put a great emphasis on the importance of archival sources, and has stimulated a body of research initially focused on photography and its production of archival images. During the 1990s, the New Media Archaeology project was started at Lancaster University, and subsequently funded by the Arts Council, which has since then conducted a major programme of excavating and documenting the cultural sector in the borough. Its aim has been to reconstruct the popular and creative sectors of the 1960s and 1970s through interviews and archival materials, while</text>

In the Public Programme project, Bjorklund developed the concept of Public Culture, which sought to understand how individuals define their own worth and place within social groups. Public Culture was used to justify the way in which artists were able to create social change, and in turn enabled the rise of neoliberalism and its discontents.In an ideal world, Public Culture would lead to a just and sustainable society, but in the real world, which is often far more complicated and unstable, it is often just as important to create experiences of belonging that are inconvenient, elusive, and unpredictable. This is why biennials have a particular role in challenging the prevailing narratives of a city or a region, and why they are so often the last gasp of a dying art form. The challenge is real, and it is being ignored. The real art, as we know it today, was made by artists who were able to communicate effectively across cultural divides. The</text>

I believe that the Biennial could also become a catalyst for a new generation of artists to be inspired by the potentialities and possibilities of such radical reimagining.  Art’s potentialities and possibilities cannot be restricted to those that fit within the prevailing societal frameworks and paradigms. The city and its people are valuable resources that can and should be utilised in creative and progressive ways. We are able to produce works with a political purpose and that are simultaneously potent with a cultural purpose. For example, consider the historical importance of the Sitka-Tapulcan First Nation in shaping the way in which residential neighbourhoods in the city were</text>

More likely, the Biennial would support a range of artists’ projects that aim to decommission the buildings and streetscape, turning the derelict spaces of the city into beautiful landscape-altering monuments that channel artistic energy into the fabric of the urban space, while simultaneously re-purposing the derelict factory and warehouse sites as public art spaces, landscape-design gems and urban monuments that connect to the past and contribute to the future. Such a project would not only reconnect artists to the urban fabric of the once-neglected quarter of the city, but would also set an example for future artists to follow in this direction.  The scenario outlined above is one that demands courage, commitment and a great deal of patience, but it is also a possibility that is both unthinkable and potentially attainable. In the end, the only way to truly know what the future holds is to live and work in it, to experience it firsthand and in its present form. That is, the future that is created by the present and the present, but is also present in the form of the present.

Art’s social function in the city is to imagineers of new places, and sometimes those places are quite beautiful. At the very least, they’re places where art can be made and celebrated.

Such actions would go hand in hand with the dismantlement of the blighting effect of housing policy, which today pervades the city core but is suffering a form of chronic underfunding and political uncertainty that threatens to consume its scarce resources and leaving behind a city in ruins. The biennial should position itself as a catalyst for a political transformation that liberates the city’s urban resources and instigates new creative practices from the derelict sites. Such action would also reconceive the role of the museum, providing a crucial counterweight to the unchecked capitalism of the present and the powerful vested interests that support it.  	[1] See, for example, Todd Meyers, The New Urban Frontier (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2015).Download this article as PDFElise AtanganaElise Atangana is Professor of Geography and Director of the Geography Department at McGill University.

More likely, the Biennial would support a range of artists’ projects that aim to decommission the buildings and streetscape, turning the derelict spaces of the city into beautiful landscape-altering monuments that channel artistic energy into radically rethinking urban environments. Such projects are politically feasible in a city that is increasingly aware of its cultural imbalances and poverty. But the question remains whether the Biennial will make good on its early ambition and actually turn a profit on its artistic output? Creative perforations are rare and usually the work of very wealthy artists. The Biennial needs to generate some cash flow in order to prop up its artistic mission and occasionally pay artists’ projects. A wealthy patron base is essential for such ambitious projects, and the Biennial needs to attract artists from outside the city to work alongside local creatives to turn the derelict spaces of the city into desirable places to live, work and play. Creative perforations are particularly dangerous because they rely on the unawareness of the public, and the city plays no role in the creation of the sites or their redevelopment. The Biennial must generate some kind of external validation or credibility if it is to turn a profit. If its Art</text>

More likely, the Biennial would support a range of artists’ projects that aim to decommission the buildings and streetscape, turning the derelict spaces of the city into beautiful landscape-altering monuments that channel artistic energy and political commitment into actively engaged communities. This is the future urbanist dream.  Art’s inherent role in the city is to conceive, imagine and envision possibilities, but its inherent inability to create tangible outcomes or achieve systemic change ultimately results in the present. The Biennial could play a pivotal role in unlocking the potentialities of the urbanist imagination and perhaps even pave the way for a new urban development and perhaps even a new downtown core.  Art could also be used to mobilize citizens to take action and create change, creating a virtuous cycle of transparency, participation and empowerment that contributes to the empowerment of their urban environment.   Preeana Reddy is a writer, urbanist and co-founder of Future City Network.

Art’s historical relationship to the city is complicated by its essentialist impulse, but there is a critical need to talk about how the art and cultural institutions of the city are complicit in the mass incarceration and impoverishment of the populations below, contributing to the desertification of the areas around the stadiums, and facilitating the establishment of white flight from the local areas. Art is an inherently political agent, and there is a need to talk about the ways in which the Biennial could exert influence over its development and eventual presence in the city.   If there is a way to turn the Biennial into a progressive force in the city, it should be provided by those who inhabit the city and have a stake in its development. Frank Gehry and his team certainly have that opportunity and need to be engaged and empowered.   Art’s historical relationship to the city should be looked at with a critical eye, and a collective conscience.</text>

Such initiatives are in keeping with the goals of The Resident, The Artist and Liverpool Biennial 2016, Moira Kenny’s contribution to the Biennial tradition. The three-year long project, which saw artists from all over the world participating, paid special attention to the cultural needs of the Indigenous peoples of Canada and the Torres Strait region, particularly in its exploration of the historical practices and concepts of ‘Indian’ identity in Canada and the role of cultural theorists and historians’ in the construction of notions of belonging and nationhood for Indigenous peoples.  It also highlighted how Indigenous peoples have historically been overrepresented in scholarly and artistic pursuits, with scholars and artists failing to pay sufficient attention to the ways in which they actually contribute to the collective history of the world.

Artists’ collective bargaining with the city’s art commission is ongoing and often acrimonious. Some of the tensions can be traced to the Biennial itself, which for years has prioritised its own interests over those of the community. In recent years, however, the commission has begun to perceive a diminishing return on its investment in the Biennial, which is often credited to the project ‘The Resident’, a citizen science project that the Biennial carries out year round.  A growing body of research now supports the notion that the ‘Artistic Rent’ – the money a community makes from the Biennial – is an investment that is well worth preserving, especially in the face of diminishing resources.  A shift in the biennial commission’s priorities would undoubtedly affect the trajectory of the project, but perhaps a more fundamental shift in the way art institutions deliver their valuable public services and cultural assets to communities would also change</text>

Art’s social function today is to produce meaning and value through processes of signification and negation. Art’s social function in the 21st century is to accentuate the social, rather than the other way around. The biennial is critical of the present, but it also celebrates the social, rather than the social. It is a museum of social phenomena, but it is also a museum of spectacle. It records the social, but doesn’t pretend to be so. It is a museum of art’s social impact, but it is also a museum of spectacle.

    human behaviour and technology, the social, political and human dimensions of city evolution. 	The contemporary condition is one of massive urbanisation and the over-production of space. Urban space is over-constructed, over-used and in dire need of regeneration – a process that has become more and more evident throughout the twentieth century.

The biennale was also a locus of potential interventions into the urban predicament, given the historical and contemporary entanglements that it established. A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of information and resources essential for the public good. It organised for unwarranted governmental over-reach and it preserved for posterity what might otherwise become a dusty repository of bureaucratic excess and mismanagement. Its capacity to create new experiences and to stretch the boundaries of experience came at a cost, but at least its expenses were bearable. In its expanded and increasingly globalised form, the biennale is now a global phenomenon with a hugely influential and lucrative internationalisation function. 	The biennale is a rare and precious artifact of a bygone era. It provides a rich vein of shared cultural resources with which to grapple with the challenges now facing cities everywhere. It is a global phenomenon with a globalised social function. It is a cultural exchange. It is an event that, like all such rich resources, must have its price. And it remains to be seen what kind of price that will be. The biennale as a cultural phenomenon is a $40 billion a year business. If it</text>

The biennale was also a locus of potential interventions into the urban predicament, given the historical and contemporary entanglements that it established. A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of possible interventions into the urban predicament, where ideas of art and aesthetics were fused with those of technology and culture. Ideas of art and beauty fused with the promise of a booming economy to support a diversity of artistic endeavours. Biennales are, in their own way, modern interventions into the historical trajectory of the city that are most affected by changes in the global economy. They arise when economic forces are pulled in certain directions – in the contemporary economic sense – and are then repurposed to support the other. Modern art and biennials are, in the main, interventions into the historical trajectory of the city that are most affected by changes in the global economy. 	In recent decades, the biennale has evolved into an annual, commercially successful enterprise. The Venice Biennale Board, headed by Giacomo Savio, has annualised the biennale for twenty-six consecutive years, which is longer than any other biennale in the world. The board’s</text>

The biennale was also a locus of potential interventions into the urban predicament, given the historical and contemporary entanglements that it established. A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of cultural exchange that transcended national borders and cultures. It was a venue for the exchange of ideas and a forum for the expression of cultural divergences. It is doubtful if any such forum exists anywhere today. If it did, it would rank among the top 10most cited biennales worldwide. 	The biennale is an art form that emerged late in the twentieth century, and although it has a long history of being taken seriously, its contemporary iteration is much more often perceived as an opportunistic publicity stunt or a racketeering exercise than as an art form that deserves to be reckoned as such. 	Today, the biennale is a rarefaction that exploits the seemingly random and the capricious contemporary global market of art collector, marketer and biennaleeer to establish a clientelistic position across multiple exhibitionary venues and artefacts across the planet. Its public function is to document the art being made or being made elsewhere in the world, and to bring this</text>

The biennale was also a locus of potential interventions into the urban predicament, given the historical and contemporary entanglements that it established. A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of exchanges between different cultures and nationalities, offering a forum through which different cultures could find common cause. Rapid advances in science and technology rendered the biennale ‘a relic of a bygone era’, when human behaviour was ascendant and planet Earth orbited the sun. Rapid cultural transformations are often attributed to biennales, but the real ingenuity and unanticipated outcomes that often emerge from them are the outcome of cultural interventions. Cultural practices played a pivotal role in the evolution of cities and their appearance in modern and post-industrialised nations. Cultural practices were seen as the key to unlocking latent urban and regional resources, utilising unused urban space and incorporating these into new urban systems. The biennale was seen as a platform through which artists could operate in a city, developing aesthetic norms, values and political agency into new ways of being in the city. But in recent decades it has become increasingly evident that cultural production now plays a much greater role in the evolution of a city, both</text>

The biennale was also a locus of potential interventions into the urban predicament, given the historical and contemporary entanglements that it established. A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of potential new urban solutions, where architecture was seen not only as a commodity but also as a social creation that required cultural institutions and artistic perforations. 	The biennale evolved a number of distinctive postures, which placed culture at the center while simultaneously valuing and perforating it. 	The first posture was the ‘triangle’ – a location for the reception of cultural institutions and their curatorial and artistic interventions, where artists were expected to operate between public and private spaces at will. The presence of art was explicitly discouraged, and at times the self-appointed curators of contemporary art were openly critical of its quality. 	The triangle became an object of curatorial and aesthetic scrutiny. Its internal logic and aesthetic qualities were recorded and analysed, and new perspectives were offered on it through in-gallery exhibitions, audio installations, video and photographic installations, poetry, fiction, magazine articles and much more. 	Artists were encouraged to experiment with ‘different</text>

The biennale was also a locus of potential interventions into the urban predicament, given the historical and contemporary entanglements that it established. A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of potential replacements for a city that was becoming increasingly unmanageable in its own way. The biennale became the locus of possible interventions into the urban predicament. Its rapid expansion and diversification during the twentieth century ensured that it was able to adapt to a multitude of changes, yet it maintained a core set of practices and ideologies that were in direct opposition to prevailing trends and realities. 	The biennale became, in other words, an artefact of the socio-cultural logic of industrialisation in which ‘ordinary people’ were effectively replaced by smart machines. The hub of the biennale today is in ‘the city of exhibitions and commerce’, the site of major events such as trade fairs and fairs of exchange, and the stage for major cultural productions such as concerts, films, exhibitions, films and so forth.3 	Events such as trade fairs and fairs of exchange continue to provide the geometry of the biennale’s</text>

The biennale was also a locus of potential interventions into the urban predicament, given the historical and contemporary entanglements that it established. A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of political and legal activism. It was a site of potential interventions into the capitalist city, where the biennale became the locus of consumption. It was a site of potential releases from urban constraints, where the biennale became the ideal display platform for a host of diverse interventions. 	The biennale was a site of potential sources of funding, given its celebrity status and the accessibility of its programming. It was a site of potential cultural exchanges, given the importance of this cultural exchange in the run-up to and during the Paris Biennale. It was, in short, a site of potential all-rounding effects. 	The biennale needs to be contextualised within contemporary urban and regional politics and socio-cultural conditions in order to be taken seriously. If it is to achieve these aims, it is imperative that the broader urban and regional context be brought into the conversation. In the current political moment, the biennale must be situated within a larger cultural and</text>

The biennale was also a locus of potential interventions into the urban predicament, given the historical and contemporary entanglements that it established. A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of potential new urban solutions, where citizens could come to consult with artistic and cultural representatives about pressing urban dilemmas. 	The biennale became a locus of potential relations between artist and citizen, where the artist was seen as a privileged citizen empowered by the state to inhabit space and provide cultural and urban value to the state at large. 	The biennale’s patronage of art and aesthetic values became a valuable source of wealth for the biennalee, which in turn became a source of political and social stability for the city. Biennales became sources of stability for the city and their artists. 	The popularity of the nineteenth  	Gigi Scaria Biennale in Venice, however, seems to have had a decisive influence on the development of the city’s biennalee, whose popularity began to eclipse that of the previous biennalee – a trend that continued to the present. The Gigi Scaria Biennale gave</text>

A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of potential replacements for the historical ephemeral ephemeral [2]  finds that it seems to have discovered in its travels. 	The biennale’s privatising effect is demonstrated by its organised, global, multimedia and connected nature. It is the biennale that establishes the convention’s assumed common denominator, and aims to replicate it across multiple sites and cultures. Its business model is based on the common denominator – tourism, meet-and-greets, competitions, ‘the club’ – and its collections, which together form a kind of common language that circulates endlessly across the globe. 	In this globalised and privatising economy of the biennale, the collections – which at one time included paintings from all over the world and exhibited in galleries around the world – are not individual objects of individualised interest, but parts of a larger machinery that is driving much of what makes the biennale tick.

A proto-internet era, the biennale became a locus of potential replacements for a city in disarray, in need of modernising processes, in an era of ever-greater inclusiveness and global mobility. The biennale became a locus of potential sites of refuge for those caught up in the gorges of urban sprawl and chaoticness. 	There are of course other ways of looking at the biennale phenomenon, but the key to its success is that it establishes a quasi-religious character to a situation that is, at the same time, experiencing a quasi-cultural disenchantment and a de-emphasis on the national. It is a quasi-religious assemblage to begin with. 	In this sense, it is not surprising that the biennale has moved away from its traditional location in the centre of Paris, which, until fairly recently was characterised by its own kind of urban disenchantment. It is also not surprising that the concentration of biennials in the past few decades has</text>

As a result, many cities and regions restrict or prohibit the development of new ‘urban centres’ in an effort to limit new urban growth. As a result, many people lose their houses to development.

The term ‘right to the city’ is used in different ways across different languages, depending on the context. For example, in the 2014 Istanbul MRT, activists tried to stop the construction of a new transit tunnel beneath the Calatrava River, which runs alongside the Calheta de Izmir metro station. The project was put on hold due to a conflict between public and state interests, but the new rights to the city mean that public and corporate interests will now be mixed. 	[v] Some have reclaimed the term to refer to themselves, as distinct from other communities, such as migrants and refugees, who are often lumped together under the term ‘migrant’. While there is some truth to this, it is misleading to call someone a ‘migrant’ just because he or she</text>
    <text>human behaviour and technology. The idea is to create a community of people who can ‘use technology effectively and empathise with the way that it affects their lives’, says Rango. This might involve not only how technology is used but how it should be used. 	[i] Neoliberalism, in its broad sense, refers to the social and economic transformation of modernity in the wake of the industrial revolution. 	[ii] The European commission has defined the ‘right to the urban space’ as the right to an environmentally sound urban and rural neighbourhood, a part of the transnational, transnational ‘circulation’ that it founded in 1989. 	[iii] The right to the city refers to the city’s place in international law. As such, it is a fundamental human right. 	[iv] A growing number of cities and regions throughout the world recognise this right, with laws varying from city to city and region to region. 	[v] The right to the rural space refers to the right to use private property in a way that is not taken for granted. It recognises the right of way-share, use and access to land and natural resources, including the right to access and use different kinds of technology, including but not limited to agriculture and manufacturing. It also recognises the right of way-share, use and access to data’, to be connected to resources and to engage in trade with other cities and regions, including but not limited to logistics and repair. 	[vi] The right of way-share is the act of sharing one’s property with another person, group or entity; one may share a piece of land or a building with another person or entity. Sharing is to be considered in the context of a collective, not as a private transaction between individuals. Sharing is also to be considered in the context of a ‘right to the city</text>

The important point is that these kinds of theorisations are often perversely contradictory, and serve to obscure instead of confronting the specificity of the problems that art seeks to address. 	When we think of contemporary art today, we tend to picture artists operating in the context of a capitalist modernisation, whether that’s in the form of a city, a country or a corporation; when we think of the arts in the wider social and political context of the contemporary condition; and when we think of art as a social process, we tend to imagine an artistically active public engaged in a socially engaged practice. But while the contemporary art that we produce is often engaged with these broader social and political concerns, its true poetry is its ability to negotiate precisely such complexity and to produce works that are actually very different from the images that we constantly put out there, because of the complexity of the social and political situations that we find ourselves in. 	</text>

However, there were also artists who were drawn into the project by the sheer exhilaration of the possibilities and the freeing aspect of it all, who found their way into the project through sheer happenstance and perhaps just by virtue of their being who they were and what they did. 	For example, there were many artists in the early days of the Biennial who found their way to the site by chance, or perhaps as a result of being taken under the wing of the now defunct Southwark Artsapce, who introduced them to Rosa Parks, whose activism and persistence they profited from and whose memory they used to remake themselves as a kind of activist icon.

There were also moments when the ban actually did create a kind of art that challenged the very idea of what the state or capitalism had produced.  	So there were in those years some moments when the art we produced actually threatened the very ideas of what the state or the capitalist might produce. And there were also moments when the idea of what the art could and might produce actually came alive. That's how it happened in the years immediately after the ban: in the form of blockades and violent confrontations between artists, the police and the collectors. 	But there were also other creative and transformative acts that gave the impression, even in the relatively liberal quarters of the city, that the ban was being challenged, and that the curators of the new museums and cultural centres invited to work in the area were actively engaged in contesting its authority and in resisting its over-embraced forms of institutionalisation.  	For</text>

There were also artists, activists and intellectuals whose work wecollected from archives and who came forward in the years after the ban to articulate new ideas and approaches to art and the contemporary condition of art and contemporary culture. 	The contributions from these periodicals that wecollected range widely in scope and in their articulation of the lived reality of contemporaneity is complex and variable, and much of what is said about the art produced after the ban is in tension with one another and with what is perceived to be the dominant cultural logic of the period. The very notion that contemporaneity is understood this way or that way is of value to us, and much of what is said about the ban is at odds with this understanding. For example, many commentators interpreted the ban as a limitation on the role of the artiste, and curators responded by arguing that the limits that were being challenged were not relevant to contemporary art, since the articulation</text>

The work of art that emerged afterwards, and which was often made with the explicit aim of challenging the notion of what can be considered art per se, often sought to reconcile the seeming enmity between the artist and the artist. 	The most influential and sustained piece of work of late-nineteenth-century modern art that I have been fortunate to curate for the Tate Modern, as part of the Tate Gallery Series, was the work of David Hockney, whose photographs of the Blitz in Liverpool during the Second World War are legendary. 	Hockney’s photographs, which were made on 35 mm film, are among the most iconic images of the conflict. They symbolised the return to the city of wartime industry after years of residence in the countryside, and they stand out as the most image-rich photograph of the conflict. </text>

And there were, too, moments when the ban itself was neither abstract nor singular, but was in fact a critical aberration and a symptom of a much deeper social and political quagmire confronting the world as it is now. 	So there were in those years moments of real creative action, contested and occasionally wildly so, and there were also periods of actual and sustained crisis, of actual and reactive resistance, of actual and proactive action.

So there were in those years some moments when the art produced in response to the ban actually constitutes a kind of civilisational breakdown, and some of its representations are actively engaged with by contemporary artists. And there were also, and still are, moments when the art produced in response to the ban actually constitutes a kind of progressive break with contemporary art and production, and participates in changing the forms of cultural production.  	But as the biennial format has shifted and changed, and as biennials themselves have moved on from their banal and ephemeral banality into the contested and reinvigorated ‘culture of the spectacle’, and as biennials themselves become more and more like each other, and more present in the urban landscape, and more and more like tourist attractions, and more and more like the urban fabric itself, we begin to see that the art produced in response to the ban was also produced under the ban,</text>

And since the ban itself was seen as somehow arbitrary and capricious, and since the courts had no say in such things, the only real way to fight back was to adopt identitarian and progressive politics (as had already begun to be advocated by queer theorists and political activists), and to actively participate in the logic of capitalism as an object of aesthetics rather than as a coordinator of production and consumption?

But beyond that, beyond the idea of what the art would be like if the ban had never happened, there were other factors that also had to be taken into account, cultural factors, socio-politically speaking. And those factors, while important in their own right, were by and large absent in the analysis of the 2015 Istanbul Biennial that I curated. 	Instead, the criticism of the event that I did produce and deliver was framed around two questions: how could the curatorial function in the present (in the age of constant media reporting on the curatorial as a kind of permanent media apparatus)? And how could art be produced in the present through the present, in the age of constant digital recording and transmission? The biennial as a kind of archive, these questions emerged as one way of framing the material coming out of its various storage compartments over the course of its existence</text>

As the biennial faded into irrelevance and new curators came into being, and art’s place in the curatorial agenda shifted, it became increasingly important to get involved early in the processes of de-realisation. I did this at the London School of Economics, where I taught a course in Biennial Research and Documentation, and later at the Biennial as a postdoctoral researcher at the Museum of Modern Art, where I was curator of public programs. In the early 1990s, I worked as an artist and researcher on the archival collections and archive of the Biennale, and later, after leaving the Biennale, I worked as an art historian, curator and archivist for the Society of Illustrating Artists’ Bulletin. In the years that followed, I edited the society’s archives and digitised their contents. I have over twenty-five books,</text>

For some manufacturers, this meant adapting their production processes to handle the ever-growing surplus of cheap oil; for others, it meant incorporating self-healing glass or other miracle materials in the form of engineered machines; and for still others, it meant using seawater as a gel to bind together large amounts of concrete and steel waste into structures that interact more like liquid natural gas than like the solid rock that previously characterized the city.[13] Such are the conditions today – machine learning and the creative misuse of data are the tools of the postindustrial society. But what would a future city be like if the contradictions between the machine and the people weren’t so deeply embedded?

Hudson concludes by asking:Can we imagine a possible future without war, poverty and hunger? Or can we envision a future in which traffic jams, conflict-ridden cities and violence do not exist?4  In the wake of these prescient lines of thought, a small group of dedicated young artists emerged as a countervailing force to the overwhelming forces of industrial society.

As the social sciences and humanities departments that emerged from these wars are brought to bear on the politics of these images and phenomena, it is possible to emerge increasingly conscious of the cultural dimensions of these social disruptions. That is, the postindustrial society envisioned for Omaha is not that society but only that particular subset of society.’s social realities.  In other words, this new cosmopolitan society will have to grapple with the politics of its image and phenomenon, which merge the social and the cultural.    At the same time, however, it</text>

These managers included a board of directors with incredible wealth and power, who also included numerous billionaire patrons, including Paul Singer, the billionaire founder of E*Trade, one of the world’s largest publicly traded hedge funds, and Arjun Appadurai, a former Tata Motors chairman and chairman of Tata Motors International.[19] Hudson goes on to say that the postindustrial society envisioned for Omaha is one that is]simultaneously awash in oil and has run out of other fossil fuels – two terms that sound eerily like the energies of the Anthropocene.

Not one of the nine projects selected for consideration in the 2004 VisionCentre was allowed to come to fruition. The reason for this is that the federal, state and local governments which funded the ‘vision centre’ effectively stopped supporting it after the internet came to be seen as a public good.

The financialisation of everything from housing to education has been facilitated by the emergence of a mega financial firm, Warren Buffett’s Omaha Holdings (1996–2008). As a result of this, the urban infrastructure of the city is being systematically remodelled in preparation for a future based on what Michael Hudson calls ‘postindustrial society’. Although the postindustrial society envisioned for Omaha is one based on the over-production and consumption of commodities, Hudson explains, it is one that is unable to imagine or imagine life without the slave labour of millions of workers:The industrial sector … sought to produce ever more efficiently by saturating the planet with cheap energy and conscious drift [i.e. machines] … [t]he postwar quest for long-term economic sustainability called for a ‘critical mass’ of affordable energy to fuel technological change and assume societal function.[50] This mass of cheap energy is being produced in large metallurgical mines and refineries that are located in and around the main port cities on the west coast (Los Angeles and Seattle dominate this market). As the sociologist David Harvey puts it, the postindustrial society is being transformed not only by the resource curse but also by the media curse: '[T]he postindustrial society today seems to be undergoing what Naomi Klein calls ‘the illusion of renewal’ due to the media coverage of industry and products, and its transformation into ‘postindustrial’ status by the media and public alike’. One might add a dash of ‘frugality’ to this mix: postindustrial is a word with a capital – it indicates something that is frugal, self-sufficient and poor; something that is not</text>

It is true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the ‘big three’ – Exxon, Chevron and Statoil – dominated the production, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas; however, since the mid 1990s several smaller players have entered the picture and, as a result, the market for natural gas has</text>

Today, many of those tasks would be automated and replaced by platforms that read data and process it on an as-needed basis. Today, few would call this ‘the cloud’; there is no industry with the corrupting effect of money on infrastructure that would not want to be owned and operated by a network of servers and data-storage units.’[14] And yet, as Hudson indicates, the postindustrial society that emerges from these changes is only able to imagine such a future if it contributes ever more to the construction of infrastructure itself. As a result of the changing nature of work – which becomes ever more complex the more energy-intensive the mode of production becomes, and the division between maintenance and production becomes even more critical – there is a shift from the imagined to the actual, and from the imagining to the actualisation of new</text>

    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial, curated by Pieter Weiler and Mike Cooley, which opened in November, marks the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. The exhibition is based on a revised and expanded version of a poem by John Tenniel that appeared in the magazine that year, and in a letter that year, as part of the 'Welsh Standard' series. It is a moving document, weaving together the experiences of the Welsh and Scottish soldiers who fought in the war – including the poet himself, William Wordsworth – and the Native inhabitants of Canada, whose names we learn are part of the original ‘Confessing Narratives’ – a collection of Aboriginal names that have been collated and arranged into four ‘boy’ collections.

In the opening monologue, John Lennon sings: ‘This is my favourite John Lennon song’, which appears over and over again throughout the exhibition, as a way to capture and conceptualise, under one unified voice, the feeling of walking into the present, of which ‘this’ is the first memory. ‘This is my favourite John Lennon song’, and it is a rendition of the lyric, in both ‘John’ and ‘we’. The poem was originally written for the song ‘We Are The Beatles’ by Paul McCartney and George Harrison, and it is now frequently quoted by Beatles fans as evidence of the band’s continued existence. The Lennon song is over four minutes long, and the image is often quoted</text>

The poem and the collection are part of a documentary that documents the production of the First World War, through interviews with key actors, archival materials, sketching, photography, film and text. It is a new kind of historical narrative, telling the decisive role played by artists and visual artists in the conflict. It is also a kind of poetry.And it is a kind of poetry that speaks to the very essence of the power structures that produced and supported the warring super-states that now occupy parts of Canada and the Middle East. It is a kind of poetry that asks, through the specific elements that were part of the conflict, what kind of politics could produce the conditions for human flourishing. It is a kind of poetry that seeks to articulate the psychic politics that shaped the very being that was being produced by the warring powers. It is a kind of poetry that attempts to envision new kinds of urban environments.The kind of poetry that would seek to unravel ideological rather than physical</text>

These are not ‘cultural markers’ but rather ‘material markers’ that help tell the story of art and the biennial in a continuous and respectful way. They tell the story of materiality, of materials, in this case cement. The materiality arises from the fact that the exhibition was initially staged on a large scale in a museum in Liverpool, and that the museum could no longer contain the scale of the production at the Biennial. I think that the idea of ‘materiality’ was initially over-simplified, and the idea of ‘flesh’ was more widely applicable than it is today. For example, although the word ‘flesh’ has a number of different senses, the body that is often misrepresented as being comprised of matter is actually quite subtle and subtle – it takes</text>

Red was a pseudonym used by the author in his memoirs, giving the impression that he was willing to risk his identity in battle to fight fascism. He wrote: ‘In the spring of 1915 a detachment of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve embarked upon what was to be my final sea service before embarking upon active service in the Great War. ‘On the second day of my sea service, which I knew must be very unpleasant, I wrote to the Naval Officer commanding the British Merchant Navy: ‘You are going to have to make me serve in the Great War. You are going to have to put me in uniform. I will not be a “liutenant” anymore.’ He was going to have to think about that.I was going to have to pick a side. I was going to</text>

The Bluecoat was an iconic street and neighbourhood name in the 1970s and 80s, and its use in that context continues to be a point of reference for artists and communities. There are now over 200 locations for the Bluecoat’s remaining members to gather, and the project continues to be run by its local chapter, the Welsh Street Community Land Trust.The other part of the equation is the development that came with it – community land and affordable homes for low-income families and a place to live. As the housing crisis deepened in the city, and with no sign of an end to it happening here in London, the challenge shifted to the suburbs, and suddenly it was people from the city</text>

It is a bleak and powerful statement, but also a beautiful way to live. It is to the poem as a statement of hope and the promise of a better tomorrow. It is a reminder that life goes on, that we are not alone, that we are not without meaning, and that our place in the world is in fact not in our own made meaning.Download this article as PDFSue Bell YankSue Bell Yank is an artist and writer with a particular interest in the impacts of climate change on her native environment of British Columbia.

The artists are joined on the tour by Maya Lin, the archivist who holds the digitised handwritten versions of the First World War diaries, and other specialists in the field, including a team led by Dr Peter Singer, an anthropologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.The biennial will be a significant addition to the curatorial work of the museum, in that it will be able to offer permanent alternative perspectives on the war, its causes and consequences. In the event, the biennial will provide the museum with an unprecedented and valuable source of cultural capital, enabling it to embark on a cultural war machine.

To take but one example, the poem ‘Prayer Book’ contains several references to the First World War, but there is also a ‘Main Page’ that refers to ‘Lord Roberts of Carnoustie, President of the Admiralty Board’ who ordered the book to be deleted. While the text of the order is lost in a mists of bureaucratic red tape, the memory of its creator is forever tainted by the bloody wound that the First World War brought into the nation’s collective consciousness.While the memory of the poem is lost in bureaucratic red tape, the memory of its author is forever tainted by the bloody wound that the</text>

They are meant to be shared. But at the same time, they are also meant to be seen as a development, a transition, a way to say, there is more to come. And so the relationship between the biennial and the city, between biennial and local, is that very real. It is as real as the relationship between the city and the borough.The biennial, and art institutions in general, are institutions of last resort. They are not places for the last word, and they are not places for the comfortable, the level-playing field. But they are places for the privileged few to have a word, and to be heard, to feel part of a conversation. I would argue that the biennial has become increasingly important in this historical moment of frequent and unprecedented global urbanisation; as a site for the last word, for instance, or for the last gasp of the vanished inland, or for a</text>

It has meant a great deal because it has enabled us to know that our biennials can become cultural institutions, that they can play a role in shaping cultural habits, that they can be sources of innovative practitioners, and that</text>

It has meant a great deal to us both personally and professionally. It has meant a great deal to our relationship because we can all agree that the way this project has progressed has been very important to us. It has meant a great deal to the local artists, curators, and arts administrators who have encouraged us to experiment, to push the boundaries of what a biennial can be. It has meant a great deal to the city because it has allowed us to know the faces of the people who live and work in the city and it has meant a great deal to the artists, curators, and arts administrators who have sponsored us, placed us, and organised the events of the year.This is a legacy that we can all be proud of.

She is also the author of The Community Arts Anthology: Art, Community and Society (with Elissa Atangana, Zone Books, New York, 2016), and is currently researching the experiences of her father, a Harlem arts administrator, during and after the core project (2000–2005) was completed.

It has meant a great deal to the city because it has allowed us to know the faces of the people who live and work in the city and it has meant a great deal to the artists, curators, and arts administrators who have sponsored us, placed us, and organised the events. But most of all it has meant a great deal to us because it has meant engaging with the history of the Biennial in a way that we, the public, could engage with.We have also developed a parallel project – funded by Arts Council England and Curator Council England – that is undertaking a year-long, multi-disciplinary residency programme in Liverpool. During this residency, our research will be conducted alongside local residents and artists. The aim of the residency is to discover what it means to be an artist in the city, what it means to be an artist in the area and how that relates to the Biennial. The mechanism of the Biennial will be the same as in the USA: a major international art fair with marketing campaigns and festivals. We hope that the dynamic between the arts administrator and the biennial visitor will allow us to engage with the tourism industry in a different way, exploring the ways in which biennials can act as an alternative to tourism in</text>

I want to thank everyone who has worked with us on signage, graphics, copy, production, administration, fundraising, programming, social media, arts programming, exhibitions, participatory activities, logistics, legal affairs, legal theory, administration, and much more. It means a great deal to me, personally, to be able to say that the sign language interpreter who helped us with the logistics of the Biennial was a colleague from L.A. County Museum. It also means a great deal to me that the people who created and curated the story of the Biennial, as told in the book We Are the Biennial’s characters, were also colleagues in the making of the local community.

It may be useful in future to share some of the same reflections, especially since we are all artists, and artists have a way of shedding more than they reveal when faced with a sudden personal or institutional loss.

The production of change is what they ‘re made to do. But they also need the commitment and the drive to keep going beyond the moment of the event itself. And that’s why, at the end of the day, biennials are here to stay. They’re here to stay because they’re made here, and there is no escaping that fact any time soon.But change can happen through a process of cumulative effect. That is, as the art, the craft, the production, the communication, and the actual delivery of that art, craft, production, communication over time takes on more and more of the story. And in that process the biennial becomes more and more like a living organism, constantly shifting and adapting to meet the needs of its users.</text>
