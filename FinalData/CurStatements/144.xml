This might well account for the fact that biennials are more likely to be about the present, the here and now, and the effects of change, such as the Occupy Wall Street movement. The biennial might also account for the increasing number of museums, despite the general decrease in cultural resources (museums are clearly still overwhelmingly in the hands of the wealthy, white men).This last explanation, the increase in cultural resources, is the explanation I share. It seems more and more as though the biennial has become the spectator sport of the rich and powerful. We see this in the increased number of art dealers and collectors, increased numbers of biennials, the proliferation of biennials affiliated with other art institutions, and the glorification of biennials as a distinctively global phenomenon.

We only recently began to appreciate the terrible impact this had on the cultural resources of our cities. It seems that biennials are the exception to the rule, and that their phenomenal growth and high prices only serve to increase the market for art and related commodities. We witness this in the numbers of artists and curators who are either forced to relocate due to biennials, or are forced to leave their adopted cities due to over-production, competition for space, or other factors. The biennial has become what it is: a market phenomenon that results in profit for art collectors and artists, but which also produces social  Division, such as curfews, poverty, desperation, despair, despairing crowds, and conflict.Art collectors and curators in their turn, must struggle to keep up with the ever-growing and complex flows of money and objects. And this tension, between the biennial and the larger institution that it serves, will only grow stronger in the future. The biennial may account for a small</text>

We only recently began to see the results of this crisis, which is testament to how fragile the biennial has become. The biennial has become what it used to be: a transient collection of art galleries that happen to be located in a city, and a collection of art that can be found anywhere within the city. I would argue that this is the contemporary city, and the cumulative effect of all these changes is a deterioration of the biennial as a collection of art galleries, which is what I see unfolding in many cities right now. We see this in the fact that the biennial is now the largest single exhibitionary category in many major art museums, and is the largest episodic visitor to the biennial, both at the level of the museum and the level of the biennial. I would argue that this is a very dangerous development, and that it would be almost absurd for museums to host biennials now, or at least that biennials would not now host them. I would also argue that bi</text>

We only recently began to experience the beginnings of a cultural intranational movement, but it is already apparent that the biennial has re-accomplished this role. It is now the largest confessional of visitors to the museum and the most widely seen art museum in the world. It is also the only museum that can be counted on to present a consistent and continuing amount of works of art, which it is hoped that this will one day cover reality-specifically. The future museum perhaps needs to be organized by the curators of the present and the present, so that we can reflect on the fact that the biennial is, by virtue of its proliferation and the present, the museum of the present.Download this article as PDFJussi ParikkaJussi Parikka is a leading contemporary artist, writer and Curator for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki, Finland.

We witness this in the museum attendance figures, which fell by almost a quarter between 1990 and 2003, and which again skyrocketed in the wake of the financial crisis. We only recently began to observe the effects of this increasing commercialisation of art, which began in earnest around the turn of the millennium, and which, as we shall see, is only accelerating. We might also note that the number of museums has increased tenfold since then, which is to be expected in a capitalist economy.Art is clearly a much more potent cultural tool than is its commercial counterpart. And although museums have a vital place in a capitalist society, their financial reliance on maintenance and expansion, and the fact that they are predominantly publicly traded, means that their future strategies are also at least as uncertain as those of other types of institutions. As the value of a museum stays essentially fixed for years to come, the question becomes how much of that future value is actually embodied in the objects that end up on display. If the rich and powerful extract all the value from the museum, then it is inevitable that the museum will have to struggle to keep up with the demands of a rapidly expanding and privatising metropolis.

We only recently began to see the effects of this crisis, which is widely reported to be the richest recorded in contemporary archives. Biennials have become the locus of this accumulation of value, and are therefore the object of our gaze. The museum is the site of this gaze, and its collection, once it is visited, is the principal form of our present that we inhabit. The biennial, then, exhibits the same accumulation of values but in a very changed form. In the collection, it is noted, there is less of a chronological and more of a ‘biennial-like’ structure that records the history of art (although this is disputed by many biennials, as well as the curators who organize their collections). The collection is also visited by name, and exhibits an increasing number of images that are, in turn, images of artifacts from the museum, or of cultural resources gathered during the tour. The importance of this observation, however, lies not in its intrinsic value, since it</text>

We only recently began to see a marked decrease in the number of biennial memberships, which unfortunately continue to climb. And we should note that the number of museums has steadily increased too, especially in the US, while the number of biennials has remained essentially static.So why are the biennials, and especially the recent incarnation of the biennale, the Transitional and the Tijuana Art Cessna-type biennials, but also newer iterations of the grass roots level playing fields? One may speculate that the financial crisis has put an end to the rule of law and the ability of the rich and powerful to control their affairs, or that the biennial has become the exception rather than the rule. Perhaps, on the contrary, the biennial may represent a new dynamic, one in which the biennial is a global phenomenon with local implications, and the biennial is a rarefaction with global consequences. I cannot say for sure, but it could be said that the biennial represents a</text>

We only recently began to see a pre-crisis peak in the numbers of people visiting museums. I think it is quite possible that the current financial crisis could be sustained only on the fringes of the museum system. I would not bet on it. It is also quite possible that the biennial will remain the locus of this globalised, cultural capitalism that we call &quot;art&quot; for another fifty years or so. But I do think we need to begin to question if the biennial is part of the solution, or if it is part of the problem. If it is part of the solution, then we might start to question the need for this globalised, cultural capitalism in the first place.  The other part, the part that comes after, is the cultural production that comes with the biennial. And it is this last part that I would like to suggest might be relevant in the present political situation. The biennial is part of a longer, more systemic cinematic cultural production that includes curatorial and art</text>

We witness this in the museum attendance figures, which fell by almost a quarter between 1990 and 2003, and which again skyrocketed in the wake of the financial crisis. We only recently began to see a small but significant increase in museum attendance due to the financial struggles of biennials in the face of declining audiences at traditional museums. It is true that the financial struggles of biennials hit many of their older artists particularly hard, as was evident in the recent dust-up between the Curator and the Artist. But this is also true of many other art institutions that once hosted biennials, including the arts administrators who would rather have a museum system than a biennial on the ground up.I do see signs of a change of heart, however. Biennials are now more than willing to host themuate displays; long before the sudden, and highly visible, all-encompassing ubiquity of these displays became a problem. We might even say that this is the generation that grew up with the internet and social media, which opened up entirely new frontiers of engagement. The biennial is no longer defined by a single museum visitor per se, but is increasingly defined by</text>

We only recently began to experience the trickle-down effect of the biennial boom, with increasing numbers of artists migrating to other art forms. It is easy to understand the attraction to art-historical narratives and motifs, which are easier to access, and to appreciate. The narrative of the biennial exhibition, in particular, is a narrative that is part of a globalised capitalist world economy. It therefore makes sense that biennials would exhibit a high proportion of their artwork in these other forms. If the galleries that once offered the biennial exhibition a safe haven are any indication, this is evident in the number of biennials opening in other art forms and in the number of art collectors gravitating towards these forms. In other words, the biennial form might be a globalisation of art in other cities, or it might be some combination of the two. ‘Art’ is a much more powerful word than it is today, and any attempt to name and frame the phenomenon through curatorial work is</text>

We only recently began to notice a gradual recovery in the developed world, but this trend will surely continue. The biennial is the last stand of the cultural resources of the world, and the new wave of biennials will likely comprise a minority opinion among wealthy cultures. Nevertheless, the biennial as an exhibitionary form is the last refuge of the cultural poor, the voiceless. It is the exhibitionary form that upholds the oppressed. If it goes, so goes the museum, and those poor souls forced to visit it.Here, then, is the rub: what has become increasingly clear is that the biennial is not some kind of architectural monolith that stands for all exhibitionary forms. On the contrary, in the twenty-first century, the biennial is a form that is constantly undergoing a metamorphosis, that has the potential to become very rich indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed, but that also seems to be losing its identity as a form that is itself continually threatened. The museum is a form that</text>

There are also potential synergies between the arts and the health sector, which could mean that the performance of the arts could be facilitated through the provision of artistic intervention or production through the production of culturally responsive art materials. 	There are of course many other factors that could also contribute to the city’s wellbeing, such as a thriving and inclusive local artworld industry, a more equitable distribution of wealth, improved public transport and a reduction in poverty. But it is clear that a topography that comprises arts and health is in fact a topography that optimises all of these for the city.

There are also potential synergies between the arts and the health sector, which could mean that the performance of the arts could be facilitated through the provision of arts-specific educational materials. 	The question is whether there are enough arts organisations already in the city to support a new generation of artists and designers, and whether the biennial format can be adapted to take this into future, when the present economic crunch and political uncertainty prevents many other forms of cultural activity. Arts and culture have often been seen as an afterthought, or even a hindrance, in the city. The question becomes whether the emergence of new artistic and cultural activities is a precondition for the establishment of new creative experiences for people in the city, and whether the emergence of new artistic and cultural acts is essential to the survival of the city. 	In a recent research project, I worked with Creative Time in New York, where the artist Arjun Appadurai was living at, and conducting a residency at, the Museum of Modern Art. We created a series of activities around the biennial, in which students and artists from different schools of art</text>

For example, the rise of homelessness could mean that organisations such as the Liverpool Biennial have to find new ways of engaging people in the city, and possibly creating new ways of organising themselves. 	There are also potential synergies between the arts and the health sector, which could mean that the performance of the arts could be facilitated through the provision of artist-curated performances or workshops in settings such as schools, or the biennial could distribute its funds between various art bodies. 	Similarly, the provision of healthcare to those in need could mean that the biennial might set up collaborations with other art institutions or charitable trusts, or it might set up independent artist-curated programmes in places such as libraries, primary healthcare centres or youth clubs. In these ways, arts and health could work in a complex interplay of mutual dependence. Art and the biennial 	The art biennial has often been described as the vehicle for the socially engaged artist. This is an enormously appealing concept to people who see art as a potential way to fundamentally shift the way art is produced, organised and delivered. However, the reality is that the art biennial tends to produce artists who are deeply embedded in their contexts, who have learnt how to operate within that particular art environment. The art of the city is produced and funded through a dense,</text>

There are also potential synergies between the arts and the health sector, which could mean that the performance of the arts could be facilitated through the provision of culturally responsive health and wellness products and services. Artists and curators might want to experiment with creating a collaborative art project with community groups, rather than relying on their own artistic abilities or resources.  	There are of course many other factors that we don’t have a say in, but they include: geopolitics, capital, migration, climate change, urbanisation, economic development, political unrest, etc. 	The fact that such a large number of arts venues are located in and around major cities means that the arts have a particular location and can be embedded in any city’s infrastructure, making it easier for us to access, participate in and celebrate the arts within our cities. Moreover, given the right political will and favourable globalisation, these factors can lead to a level playing field, where artists and organisations alike are able to access and utilise both resources and cultures in a reciprocal way. For example, the biennial format may be good for the bi</text>

There are also potential synergies between the arts and the health sector, which could mean that the performance of the arts could be facilitated through the provision of art objects or the provision of services, such as art spaces or educational institutions. It could also mean that the role of the biennial could be changed to one that includes outreach, particularly to the local population. As an institution, the Biennial has a particularised role in this city, and its development could mean anything from providing free art exhibitions to creating a local arts ecosystem to supporting cultural enterprises or even becoming a cultural institution themselves. The question becomes which of these strategies leads to the organisation becoming culturally responsive, and which does not? 	When considering a specific entity such as the Liverpool Biennial, it is important to distinguish between the art that is being produced now, and what is being considered socially and politically possible in the future. The latter can mean many things to many people. 	There are of course many other ways of looking at the world, and incorporating art and culture into daily activity, yet we mustn’t lose sight of the fact that this is</text>

There are also potential synergies between the arts and the health sector, which could mean that the performance of the arts could be facilitated through the provision of arts materials and activities. It could mean that the performance of the arts could be integrated with the provision of health and social services, or it could mean that the performance of the arts could be incorporated with the provision of housing and support for artists and their organisations. These possibilities are not restricted to the arts, and could also apply to non-theoretical forms of performance such as language interpretation or art therapy. It is important to recognise that a biennial is just one type of performance in a larger performance – large-scale, long-term or more frequent – so there are many other forms of performance that need to be taken into consideration when deciding what is art and what is not. For example, there is a need to consider how language interpretation could be augmented with research on language families, and how cultural practices can be combined with language interpretation to create new art forms that are sensitive to different languages and cultures.

There are of course many other factors that play into it, including the political and economic systems that shape the way artists and audiences are connected, but the fact that these systems are designed with the needs of powerful commercial organisations in mind is also a factor. These organisations see art as a way to increase revenue streams and provide social benefits to communities. They may also engage with the art as a way to increase public engagement and consumption, and in that way, create shared outcomes. As a consequence, the system organisation that emerges out of the convergence of these factors is likely to be driven by the commercial interests of the various players. 	The fact that we live in a globalised capitalist society means that we are all exposed to the arts</text>

This is the idea of a collaborative capital city, where resources – materials, artists, ideas – come together to produce new ways of organising societies and cultures. The idea is to create what one artist calls ‘transcendent local artistic spaces’. These would be places in which the arts could be actively employed in transforming the city in ways that are equally as powerful and equally as ambiguous as the arts themselves. 	There are of course many other ways of organising cities, and many other cultural and urban strategies, but the notion that the biennial could be organised in any way is particularly appealing. It is a potent way of framing the art, the city, and the city’s resources in terms</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial and the visual arts institution that came with it, Liverpool Museums, have both re-launched or are about to re-launch as part of the visual arts context in the city.  	So we see the significant role that the arts can play in a growing city, in a way that is artist-led and involves not just artists but also communities. We also see the advantages and disadvantages of each role, and how each can be valuable in generating new ways of organising the city. However, we can also identify some of the biggest challenges and opportunities facing the city. These are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and each one could lead to the other. For example, the rise of homelessness could mean that organisations such as the Liverpool Biennial have to find new ways of engaging people in the city, and possibly creating new ways of organising themselves. 	There are also potential synergies between the arts and the health sector, which could mean that the performance of the arts could be facilitated through the provision of artist-led performance spaces, and also the provision of technical and social support to organisations such as the lorries that regularly park in front of the Biennial. 	Finally, as artists, we could see ourselves working with communities to create new engagement mechanisms around the city, including through cross-generational collaborations. This could mean something as simple as a Community Arts or Community Land Trust becoming a Community Land Trust, or an organisation such as The Liverpool Biennial having a Community Land Trust programme. In Chichester, The Chas Critcher Centre for Art and Creative Youth was created in partnership with The Liverpool School of Art and Design, and funded by the Joan Little  (Director of The Liverpool School of Art &amp; Design) and The John Locke Foundation.

There are also potential synergies between the arts and the health sector, which could mean that the performance of the arts could be facilitated through the provision of arts education material or art funding. 	Lastly, perhaps, there is the potential for artistic practices to act as a buffer between people and violence, while simultaneously providing a space for people to reclaim and reimagine their experience and culture. We can identify some of the barriers to this happening and try to identify other strengths and weaknesses of the art/visual arts/health nexus. How art is produced in the city, and how its use is distributed. 	There are of course many more practices and individuals involved in creating the city than we can name here, but we do see that there is a clear commonality across all of them that all contribute in some way to making the city we live in. This is not a collection of practices, but a city with practices. When we talk about the biennial in Liverpool, we are not naming any specific artists or organisations, but rather highlighting some of the ways in which they are all part of this ongoing dance. There are many more</text>

The museum becomes a place where we can ‘step back’ and observe the evolution of a culture, a history, an order, and find meaning in its fragmented fragments. I envision a museum that promotes cultural exchange amongst artists and engages with the fact that, despite the exponential increase in information technology, the art of the individual artist is still deeply embedded in the organisation’s infrastructure – embedded in the museum collection, in the collections of local community artists' unions, in the art-science department, in the production and dissemination of the museum press, in the provision of cultural and community outreach, and in the provision of a host of other culturally responsive services and activities.

When I came to the United States in late 2010, I established an Artists’ Community Arts organization called the Zap2ItaCon Project (2010-ongoing). ICA members included some of the generation of artists who were active in the 1990s and early 2000s, and many of those who are still involved. ICA members included many genres of art, and some were more prominent than others: landscape architecture, urban and regional design, landscape architecture and graphic design, as well as performance, video and multimedia design. The project’s outreach and multimedia work was extensive, and it was very influential in getting people to engage with the arts and culture in ways not often achieved through performance or interactive media. The project was also influential in persuading some cultural authorities in the United States and abroad to change their constitutions to recognise the community arts as legitimate forms of art practice.For more information</text>

In 2008, I co-founded The Queens Museum, a non-profit arts organization dedicated to preserving and celebrating the cultural heritage of the Queens County Museum. The Queens Museum is the largest non-profit arts organisation in the city and the recipient of much of the Museum’s cultural resources. The Queens Museum is a locally-rooted institution with a long-term commitment to cultural preservation and has funded artist Carol Becker’s residency at the Queens Museum for eight years running, as well as the development of a long-term cultural identity project that sought to bring cultural activities to the community in ways that are authentic to the borough.

I see the museum as a site where we can find ways to work together to produce values responsive to the cultural needs of the city. I see it as a site where we can create knowledge about a place that is both familiar and unique – a place where we can learn about a place, and perhaps create a place, through our shared experiences there. 	I would like to propose that the museum might become a site of its own formation, a place where a diverse range of cultural practices converge to produce synergies across the site, producing ‘new’ through the interconnection of different cultural worlds. I would also like to propose that the museum become a site of its own resolution – a site where a biennial, a recurring exhibition, and a programme of activities attests to a city’s development and ongoing culture – a site of enduring value for decades</text>

In the 1980s and 1990s, the Zapatistas, an indigenous people who were historically the custodians of land in and around the Mexican border, occupied and emerged as the dominant indigenous population in Sonora, Sinaloa, and Baja California. Their historic practice of using traditional skills and sites – such as forming large-scale ceremonial systems, or as a literary community – were adapted and expanded by artists, including Alfredo Sanromán, Rubén Rodríguez, and Gustavo Sanromán. The Zapatistas also developed innovative strategies to resist law enforcement and military occupation, often operating with the support of local and federal government. 	 	  One of the most successful strategies for the defence of cultural resources and sites was the establishment and ongoing collaboration of a multidisciplinary dialogue, which evolved over time from the Zapatista community to</text>

Bringing together local and international artists, community organisers, historians, landscape architects and urbanists, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art commissioned artist Mika Levi-San on a 'crisis' project in San Francisco in 2010. The project explored the political, economic, social and spatial dimensions of the 2010 Istanbul Biennial, which was organised under the title Crisis on Urban and Civic Complexes. Designed to be ‘transactional’ – the commissioning of art as a financial transaction – the project was conceived as a collaboration between the museum and the bank, and culminated in the installation of art as collateral for a housing project funded by the Biennale.  1   Melanie Levy, ‘Rethinking Ecocidal Cultures: Israeli Cultural Theory and the Politics of Multi-National Cultures’,  The New Inquiry, Issue 3, No. 1</text>

The museum that promotes social interaction, connects to the city, and produces culturally responsive practices is a potentially transformatory artifact. It could render the institution of the museum obsolete and establish a new stage in cultural exchange between people and places. It could also aid in the mission of reaching people in the city, as the IMI Corona Museum has done in Colombia, by enabling access to communities through cultural activities such as language instruction, storytelling, and documentary filmmaking.  1  See Nicklas Hansson’s Social Transformation of Uruguay,  	ed.

The Biennale’s current mission statement is a combination of lofty and humble origins.  Its first line draws upon the work of the ancient world’s pharaohs, who ordered their people to return to the land of the living, and the return of the pharaohs to the land of the dead.  Its second pretends that the return of pharaohs was imminent; in other words, the archaeological record is of little archaeological value in itself. The role of the archaeological record in the legitimisation of the new order of things is to some extent to legitimise the returning.  Its third line, on the other hand, seeks to take the place of the pharaohs but with a point of view. It is a critique of the pharaohs, not so much as a message to the living but more like a criticism of the system that produced them. It seeks to bring the systems of power and wealth to task</text>

As a curator, I have to say that I sometimes feel that there is still a gap between what the Biennale does and what art institutions and museums can do, and between the two. In the 1990 exhibition of the Venice Biennale, works by the artists were installed in the Ponte Vecchio and the Alberti Room of the Giardini, and the Biennale commissioned several works by the artists to be displayed alongside works by museum curators. But these commissions were usually commissioned by the institutions, and while the Biennale might have been interested in the works already on view, the public, its curiosity and appetite for exploration ran contrary to the institutional interest in the art they supported.</text>

The Biennale has its origins in the mid-nineteenth century in London, and it is now based in Paris.

In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century the biennial was a periodic, city-based art-world exhibition that offered a glimpse into the world outside of the museum. As the nineteenth century wore on and new curators entered the exhibitionary marketplaces, zealous reporting on the art’s development at home and abroad drew crowds from the cities to the periphery, often drawn by the promise of new career opportunities.

The discovery of a museum-quality collection of art is often discussed as a precondition for a museum-quality collection of art, but the unexpected othering effect of a museum-quality collection of art can be downright disorientating. The collection that Assouline and the Prince of Wales found themselves visiting was incredible, and while they couldn’t identify the specific works in it, they did take time to discover that it was a collection of works that had all been placed together in a single exhibition space – a kind of archiving.  It was as though they had never seen a single piece of art before, and their astonishment at the diversity of the city was complete. In this sense, the collection dynamic provides a kind of a academy-like experience for visitors, who enter into a kind of common space with rich histories and varied</text>

The Biennale’s inaugural and current programming, along with extensive archives and collections, make it a unique place to be a visiting artist, researcher or curator. The Biennale is a unique place to be a curator. The tenuous position of curatorial celebrity has long been a problem of the English-speaking world, and today it is even more of a problem, with a large number of curators either abandoning the game or being forced out by the pressures to produce more artworks and fill more museums.

    The project is a speculation on the past, drawing on the experiences and figures of immigrants who came to Canada during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The book is the first in a trilogy of three novels set in the same universe, but different worlds. The first book is a novella, entitled The Garden of Tears, which tells the story of the Silo no. 519, a notorious post-Impressionist building that in 1919 became the headquarters for the Canadian Army during World War II. The second book is the prequel to that tale, The Silo no. 519, and narrates the efforts of the Canadian War Museum to preserve the building as a historical footnote. The building, which at one time housed a department store and a bakery, is now a museum and archive containing artifacts from the Second World War. The third book is titled The Anarchist Archives and Stories, and narrates the life of an anarchist archivist in the aftermath of the war. It was written by Deborah Levy

We are lucky to have had the foresight to be founded on such resilient foundations. In a world where power is consolidated in the hands of the many, and where protest is criminalised, it is crucial that we have the will to persevere. And we will. The challenge now becomes how to leverage the momentum of the Brexit vote and the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States into the organizing of resistance across the country.The biennial is a public event, and as such it is regularly – and inaccurately – described as being about resistance to globalisation and globalisation-as-as-systems. And while it is true that the biennial has historically been about resistance to modernization and technocratic governance, the way in which social movements have been organizing in recent years has increasingly come to focus on</text>

The third book is titled The Anarchist Archives and Stories, and narrates the life of an anarchist archivist in the aftermath of the war. It was written by Deborah Levy-Parry, and was first published in 1971.The novel centers on a group of activists attempting to access a 1917 court-martial, which is widely considered the beginning of the end for the war, by revealing the presence of anarchist literature on paper near the location of the tribunals. The activists are taken into custody by the military on charges of disloyalty to the country, and the anarchist literature is read aloud as evidence in the court-martial. However, since the novel centers on an action-packed theatre, the activists are put through a series of grueling physical and psychological tests designed to extract incriminating statements from the servicemen and women implicated in the war. The result of these interrogations is a report that is read at the tribunal, but since the novel is a non-fiction book, it must also present a vision of the past. The activists succeed in gaining access to the courtroom transcripts, but since they are incommensurable in number and amount with</text>

In fact, the Battle of Birmingham was fought outside the jurisdiction of the Alabama National Guard, although the presence of the National Guard in the city limits of Birmingham at that time was questioned. The presence of the National Guard in the city was withdrawn when the United Automobile Workers Council (UAW) established democratic control over the city’s government following the victory of the war effort over fascism. In the wake of this transformation, the fight for democratic government returned, and in 1921 the UAW established a city government in the most progressive section of the city. In the intervening years, the UAW has repeatedly tried to reestablish democratic government through a ballot measure, which has never been approved by the</text>

It was published in 1994.In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the notion of home became a prime concern for the federal government. The federal government, along with most other jurisdictions, responded by making it harder for Canadians to be near populated areas – denying them their fundamental rights – and instituting mechanisms that made it easier for citizens to be 'second-class citizens', to be excluded from jobs and housing developments and free from citizenship protections. The federal government also established mechanisms that gave sweeping powers to border guards to enforce the laws of Canada.' ', says Levy-Parry, ‘making it possible to achieve and enjoy “second class citizenship” through a number of administrative means, including but not limited to: legal status as a permanent resident, right to reside, right to vote, right to social services, right to bear arms, and so forth.’‘These rights and more were originally written in response to the colonial notion of</text>

She was kind enough to invite me into her office in the Governor General’s Palace, where we discussed the history of the project and its development. We talked about the various stages of conception, from conception to publication, and the various ways in which the project would function. We also discussed the different media: novels, documentary films, magazine articles, online material. Deborah also pointed out that the name Silo no. 519 referred to a particular point in time, and that the building had been previously occupied by several other names and addresses. This made some sense: the Empire State Building was conceived as the combined title of two separate sites, one at the western edge of the downtown core, the other in the hills north of the river. The presence of so many other names and addresses in the downtown core, and in the surrounding neighbourhood of East Lansing, could</text>

The third book is titled The Anarchist Archives and Stories, and narrates the life of an anarchist archivist in the aftermath of the war. It was written by Deborah Levy and is based on the life story of Salvatore Settisoli, an Italian-American who came to Canada in the late 1940s. Settisoli is the son of Italian immigrants and was raised in the Sicilian neighbourhood of Chinatown. After completing her PhD at the Università degli Studi di Torino, Andrea Negri, Settisoli’s archivist, decided to make a film about the history of post-Impressionist architecture in Canada. Settisoli was a pioneer of the documentary, and Negri captured the film in tenement-like housing units in the former Steelcase building on Dupont Circle in Montreal. The project was further developed by filmmaker Jean Guy Lecce (whose real name is Jean Paul Lecce) and his wife, Aurélie. In the film, Settisoli narrates the painful period in his family when his father, Salvatore, a bricklayer, was killed in a car accident in 1914.</text>

It was initially a way to explore the meaning of life and death in relation to one another, through the concrete and the hackneyed tropes of everyday life. In the wake of the Paris attacks, we wondered what it would mean to reconstruct the historic presence of the city in terms of resistance. We imagined a future in which architects and urbanists struggled to negotiate the contradictory demands of a city undergoing a radical transformation under the pressure of an increasingly apocalyptic situation. The project was initially conceived as a response to the violence and oppression experienced by the Montreal’s French-speaking population, and we imagined it incorporating elements of the Francophone world. In the intervening years, we have continued to explore the ways in which architectural interventions can function as a tactic in struggles over the social and spatial distribution of power and sovereignty. We believe that the radical intervention of artists</text>

It was written by Deborah Levy with contributions from Tom Hayden, Gerald Bute and Debbie Alperovitz.The book takes readers beyond the familiar terrain of archival research and archives to investigate the social and political context of biennials during the 1970s and 1980s. It examines the ways in which biennials functioned as a site for experimentation with the institutionalisation of knowledge, a form of knowledge that could be both constitutive and perishable. It also looks at the social forces that generated and fuelled the experimentation, but also suggests ways for the experimentation to produce social change. The book is divided into three sections: discovery, discussion and resistance. The section titled ‘discovered’ refers to the early scientific and archival research on the building, while the ‘discussed’ section refers to subsequent research and documentation. The discovery section focuses on archival materials and documents that can be found in both historical and contemporary research, while the discussion and resistance sections discuss the social, political and political implications of</text>

The capacity of the Community Arts Centre to engage a broad range of users, including non-users, is a reflection of the collaborative nature of community (see my Community Arts: Art, Social Change and Community Services: Towards a Research-Based Approach for more details).  It is easy to see how the capacity of the Community Arts Centre to generate knowledge and expertise can be leveraged to address specific policy challenges. For instance, the need to educate policymakers on the benefits of SeaPoint futures may be leveraged to create incentives for developers to make developments in the Calder Williams district of Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside ‘worth living’ by offering tax abatements and other financial support to attract socially and economically diverse businesses to the area. The capacity of the Community Arts Centre to address a specific municipal issue may be developed

For instance, Calgary-based First Nations Congress has long been a partner of the Calvert Art Gallery, providing culturally responsive art development and educational programmes through the Calvert Art Gallery. The Calvert Art Gallery’s Mapping Métis Art Gallery project has been a model for similar research-based programmes in other cities.  Similar models exist for the mapping of indigenous peoples and other critical forums of humanity. It is not just critical expertise, but active listening and dialogue, that can lead to change; innovative approaches to agendas are encouraged; and creative solutions exist to meet specific needs.  It may be the case, however, that existing or emerging capacity-building efforts may be better suited towards addressing problems within Indigenous communities than addressing needs across all stakeholders. In such cases, it is important to build</text>

For instance, the capacity of the Calendar to catalogue episodes of its &quot;Celebrity Curated&quot; series may be developed through collaborations with other cultural organisations. Consideration should be given to the co-creation of mechanisms that would enable the emergence of a persistent, cross-sectoral narrative about the environment, corporate social responsibility and art’s contribution to that process, rather than an episodic repetition of that narrative across different episodes of the series.  One example of the type of narrative that is possible within the Community Arts framework is the &quot;scared pegasus&quot; narrative that is told in the works of the artist Meehan House, who is also the director of the B.C. Wildflower Centre.  She has publicly spoken about the systemic nature of the crisis in British Columbia forests, which she believes is largely down to log burning and logging, which she</text>

Green Building) and other local stakeholders. In an ideal world, every citizen of a city would be able to participate in the arts’ curriculum in the local schools, colleges, and universities with which she or he identifies, but as is currently the case, this is difficult to define and rarely happens. Therefore, the role of the Community Arts Centre is to be a resource for, and a platform for, discussion and debate within, that community regarding, among other things, the role of art in a democratic city. The role of the curator should be collaborative, not adversarial. The curator should not demand artifacts be returned or that works be exhibited; nor should the community not be able to choose which artists or works they wish to expose students to. The role of the artist should be transformative and involve self-expression, not representing, proving or</text>

Overcoming Boundary-Breaking Strategies: Learning from the Community Arts Movement  Boundary-Breaking Strategies are a set of five strategic actions that non-artists can adopt in an effort to undermine or break the will of the dominant actor in a local area.1. Create a Shared Definition of Who Is a Community Artist and What Role They Play in the Community. Create a definition of who is a Community Artist and what role they play in the community.2. Assemble in Person or via Skype a Local Team of Artists or a Project Manager from the Area. Assist in identifying, arranging, and creating a series of sessions for selected participants in the Community Arts Programme.3. Construct a Community Art Project</text>

For instance, the creation of a Community Arts Centre in Saskatchewan was facilitated through a collaborative process between the Saskatchewan Arts Commission and National Council of Community Arts Agencies. The partnership established a Community Arts Centre in Regina that offered culturally-oriented educational programmes in recording, photography, architecture, design and related fields to high school students. The Centres formed a collaborative movement to address issues facing the Indigenous peoples of Canada and the United States, including the ongoing use of historical sites and places by North American Indigenous peoples. This model offers the potential to expand beyond the curatorial role towards that of producer, bringing new forms of engagement and creativity to existing communities. 2.

For instance, the Society for Visual Art’s annual convention can host community artists as a co-curator or co-curator-residence in its newly created ‘Community Arts International’ division. The division will showcase projects from the convention, including new artists and emerging practitioners, including projects from the Calendar exhibitionary archive. The division’s mission statement reiterates the aim of the Calendar: to ‘reproduce, protect and celebrate the natural and historical sites of Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside’.2 As recently as 2015, the division’s co-editorials focused on the area, including the Calendar’s cover story, 2up2down/Calendar Eastside, which included an extended look at the area from the ground</text>

The project was designed to bring together the diverse expertise of artists, designers, architects, historians, landscape architects, urbanists, historians, ethnographers, urbanists, artists, landscape painters, landscape architects, urbanists and lawyers to explore how a future ‘based on resilience and imagination’ might be built.

The program was highly topical and connected to the city, with some works influenced by the city's current and historical narratives while others re-present in a more global sense. Topics covered included: how artists can use their works to present the city through cultural means; the connection to the spread of invasive species; the politics and histories of migrant movement and refugees; the social, economic and effects of urbanisation; the role of art and culture in this process; the physical and virtual impacts of urbanisation; the reduction of poverty and inequality; and the endemicities of conflict and displacement. The symphony of experiences from the symposium was an opportunity to ask and answer many of the different questions about Bilbao that emerged during the symposium. For this edition, I asked two specific questions: what can the Symposium do? and what can the Biennial do? The answer to both questions is: it can do both. It can present the city in a multi-sensorial way, bringing together diverse points of view and perspectives</text>

The program was highly topical and connected to the city, with some works influenced by the city and its history while others influenced by contemporary urban developments. The themes of the biennial varied widely, but the main messages were common to all: that there are too many of us, that we are too dispersed, and that we are all invested in our own ideas. Following the theme of community, the biennial ‘inhabited the city’, naming areas with a high density of Homeless Veterans or trapped in overcrowded and abandoned premises. It is a moment of intoxication, of the inaccessibility of space and of the non-existence of otherness. It is a moment in which art was created not as an occupying force, but as a position of positivity and encounter. The significance of this position cannot be underestimated. In the 20th century, the avant garde and critical art movements emerged in response to the domination of art by the real-estate and financial markets, corporate culture and the logic</text>

The introduction of these biennials coincides with the year in which the Biennale is planning to open for business, after years of negotiation with local authorities. The 20th Biennial will be a chance to work alongside the artists and have a part in the making of it, while continuing to explore the city and its history.The topic of the conference, ‘Histories of Bilbao,’ reminded me of a clichéd 1980s ‘get a load of what’s happening’. It’s a load of history, of course. I was living in Bern, Switzerland, at the time, and my work came from that city. I returned to Bern for the 20th Biennial, but the subject of my talk at the conference reminded me of how much has changed since I first felt the Bern heat. Bern</text>

The program was highly topical and connected to the city, with some works influenced by the city's development and others addressing current events. The exhibition offered a rare window into the institution’s social and political context. The work presented ranged from intimate works by the curators to large-scale installations, including a large sculpture mounted in the Churality gallery in the city centre. The curatorial focus and the projects they funded reflected the political and economic struggles that the community members had to carry out. Curators in the city were able to enjoy the exhibitions without having to confront the struggles and sacrifices that made up the everyday life of the community members. The fact that the exhibits took on an economic aspect allowed them to intervene in the narrative of the events through their interpretation of the socio-political in the context of the socio-economic system. In a city with a large and powerful financial sector, cultural institutions were able to create a ripple effect through their funding that affected the way in which the city was perceived, perceived and imagined.

The program was highly topical and connected to the city, with some works influenced by the city and its politics and the city’s history. The biennial is an important event in the city, a place where ideas and ideologies from different eras are brought together and discussed. It is a forum for the exchange of ideas and a place for the exchange of different kinds of biennials. It is a hybrid event that engages both the artist and the visitor in a very dynamic way. The 20th Biennial opened with a series of new work in the museum, including new media works and the installation of a partially dismantled Bilbao Museum building. The artists performing were living in anticipation of the event, which would commence two weeks before the official opening. In the museum, the new media works included work in response to the biennial in which the audiences would be asked to make personal contributions, while in the gallery the artists made art in anticipation of the project itself. As the exhibition progressed, the contributions to the exhibition became more deliberate and personal,</text>

Topics covered included: poverty, conflict, cities, cities of culture, urban history, urban development, urban development in the 21st century, art, urban culture, art and urban development. The biennial has a global reach, and it is easy to understand the attraction of this work in a city this large and this diverse. In addition to the biennial itself, the programme of exhibitions and events connected to the biennial, and the biennial as a whole, came together in several smaller sub-exhibitions and festivals throughout the city. Each of these events had its own unique combination of art, curatorial, and urban planning perspectives. The 20th Biennial was also notable for incorporating a series of small-scale community projects into its program. These self-organisations formed into a more institutionalized way of organising local people, blending in with the infrastructure of the city, and emerging as a multi-year, multi</text>

The program was highly topical and connected to the city, with some works influenced by the city and others determined by the university’s Biennial. The twenty-first edition of the Biennial is currently underway in New York.The topic of this journal is ‘cultural tourism’. Culturality is defined as ‘the science and art of tourism, or the cultural practices that are another form of economic tourism: cultural collectives, cultural beacons, cultural monoliths, cultural tourist agencies, and cultural reconfiguration – the postindustrial equivalent of ‘third-party shopping’ sites such as ‘Converse Plus’ and ‘Overdubs’ – where culture is perceived as both the absence of barriers to cultural exchange and the catalyst for cultural rebirth.’[1] Culturality seeks to rescue cultural resources by accomplishing innovative cultural forms via cultural tourism, often through the mediation of state and municipal governments. In the United States, this is referred to as ‘cultural tourism’; in</text>

The program was highly topical and connected to the city, with some works influenced by the city and its environs while others sat outside the city and were designed to a specific region. The main focus of the program was developed especially for the 20th Biennial, with work from many different artists, varied  from the best known to emerging talents. It’s sort of a catch-all program that talks about lifestyle, urbanism, culture, architecture, community and so on. It’s a sort of city in which art is a normal part of daily life, but also a tendency towards consumer culture, consumerised forms of art are a regular feature. The twenty-first Biennial will be no different, it’s going to be very different from the twenty-first Biennial, but it will still have a biennial component. And it will still have a curatorial component, as well as a potential for art to be made in the form of material, human-scale sculptures and for that matter, artefacts</text>

The program was highly topical and connected to the city, with some works influenced by the city. The exhibition itself was introduced by engaging with the idea of time, space and place in a cultural way, using local materials and practices. In a way, it was an extension of the project that the artist had started in the early 1990s, and it continued into the early 2000s. The key events were: the Biennial convention in 1991, the creation of the Biennial institution in 1993, and the establishment of the Biennial museum in 2001. The 20th Biennial in Bilbao took place in October 2018.Here, we take a look back at the TowardsAuspicious Chapters from The Artist Samson Kambalu’s Conversation.Back in 1989, a friend introduced me to Conversation, a new cultural form that I hadn’t heard about.

A new generation of artists were being formed, and the twenty-first Biennial was showing its age. It was time for a radical break, and I offered up Eight Fold Rendezvous as the site for a new iteration of the project.The selection was made up of twenty-one works selected from a shortlist of more than a hundred proposals. The idea was that each artist would propose a work that combined elements from multiple sites and times, while also exploring the idea of displacement, migration and colonisation of different time periods. The works would represent different periods of the artist’s career, and address certain themes and concepts. Some works were</text>

The challenge for the Biennale has been to combine the qualities of different arts bodies, with the characteristics of different cities. The challenge for the Biennale as a whole has been to find a way to work with the city, in order to create a different perception of the city. The obvious approach for the first Biennale was to produce a cultural homogeniser, to create a common language of engagement between artist and audience, between art institution and community organisation. The challenge for the future Biennale is to recognise that it does not need to produce a cultural monolith, nor establish a distinct relationship between art and geography. It can and should collaborate with other arts bodies and engage with the city in various ways. This is a destination for the future Biennale to build on what it has already achieved, and to expand on what it can achieve. In doing so, it can create a different kind of engagement with the city that is less about destinations and more about circumstances, suggesting different futures for the city in future plans.Download this article as PDFJussi ParikkaJussi Parikka is Professor in Creative Technologies and Director of the Centre for Research Architecture (CRara),</text>

The challenge for the Biennale as a whole has been to find a way to work with the city without becoming either a micronation or a desert island.This is a challenging act, asking for both the city and the biennale to recognise that there is an alternative agenda that they can adopt, that in and through which they can engage the city in a way that is in some measure creative, in some measure apolitical. It is a challenge that is well worth pursuing.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleThis article was originally published in The TelegraphTitled 'The Biennale as a Cultural Exchange'Emily Pringle is an artist and writer.

The challenge for the Biennale has been to combine the qualities of different arts bodies, with the characteristics of different cities. The challenge for the Biennale as a whole has been to find a way to work together in an agreed framework, with the city of Liverpool in the centre. We have seen the strengths in this, as well as the weaknesses. We need to find the strengths and work together to find the weaknesses. This may require that we engage in negotiation, but it is essential that we find the strengths and recognise the weakness of the other. In order to achieve this we need to create an experience that is authentic to the other. We need to create a narrative that is relevant to the city of Liverpool, but also recognises the other, and the otherness of the city. For example, the Biennale’s engagement with the Anfield/Breckfield area may be an authentic representation of the neighbourhood, but it is an entirely different narrative from that of the Biennale itself. It is an entirely legitimate engagement, and very important one, in order to the perception of the other, but it is an engagement that is also entirely at odds with the ethos of the Bienn</text>

The challenge for the Biennale has been to combine the qualities of different arts bodies, with the characteristics of different cities. The challenge for the Biennale as a whole has been to find a way to work within the city, even if this meant that some of its projects were not necessarily city-specific. Liverpool Biennial has met at various stages through the years with different city art commissions, ranging from the early 1970s to the present. It is the largest of several arts organisations that it is a founding member of, with over 1,000 members and counting. It has also been a founding director of the prestigious John Lennon Centre for Arts &amp; Culture, where it has hosted many artists, many of whom have continued to perform or conduct performances elsewhere. The Biennale’s current relationship with the city is complicated by its proximity to major tour operators, and it is not clear how the new relationship will address the conflict between artists’ freedom to produce in their city and the constraints of ‘real life’ in the city. Despite these tensions, it is encouraging that so many different city sectors have participated in creating the Biennale that was finally run by the Liverpool Biennial in 2016</text>

The challenge for the Biennale has been to combine the qualities of different arts bodies, with the characteristics of different cities. The challenge for the Biennale as a whole has been to find a way to work together with the city, in order to achieve a common goal. If the aim is to have a cultural impact in the city, then the Biennale’s engagement with the city cannot be passive, but must actively engage it and bring different worlds together in order to achieve a common goal. The engagement between the Biennale and the city must be dynamic, cutting-edge and responsive to the needs of the city as a whole. The engagement between the Biennale and arts bodies has been a central tenet of the idea that the Biennale is trying to establish. It is a core belief that has made the Biennale a unique entity in the city, a distinctive entity that is both socially engaged and intellectually curious. The Biennale has put politics and the arts on a par with everything else, and made the arts the focal point of a major political and social debate. It has put social criticism at the heart of art’s work. It has put politics</text>

The challenge for the Biennale as a whole has been to find a way to work with or without access to funding from the city. In a general sense, Liverpool makes a lot of sense when considered as a whole. Industry and finance are the natural sources of funding for an arts centre, whereas a lot of community arts activities take place in and around museums and galleries. The Biennale has had to build partnerships, both with local authorities and corporations, who have had an expectation that arts funding should be used in a particular way. In places like Liverpool, the use of arts funding can lead to a lot of different uses, depending on what is being done with the money. Art is not always used ethically; but it is used ethically in a particular way. For instance, the Biennale’s partnership with Liverpool Biennial seems to have been driven by the expectation that the Biennale would use the money to</text>

The challenge for the Biennale as a whole has been to find a way to work with the city, in order to create an experience with substance and objectivity.All art is ultimately an act of perception. However, the act of perception is often objectified, and so it is that artists have engaged with the perceived world in such a way as to provoke a reaction from audiences who then engage with the art in ways that are not always intended by the artist. This is why an artist’s statement – whether it is a painting, sculpture, installation, performance, website, or even just an image – can have a great impact on an audience, because it is interpreted and interpreted by an audience who happen to be watching television or using a computer. If the art is interpreted by an audience that does not already share that interpretation, then the impact is diminished. This is partly because the audience does not yet possess the normative understanding of the art, but more importantly, because when the interpreter encounters a piece of art that is not already part of the normative understanding, the impact of</text>

This has been seen as a challenge in itself, and part of the overall concept of ‘transforming' the Biennale back into what it was before. Liverpool Biennale websiteArtists were beginning to emerge, with accounts of how the museum had encouraged or supported their work, or had some kind of collaboration with them. Initially, the Biennale was focussed on supporting artists to enter the museum, but soon other art forms, including performance, were being considered for inclusion. The Biennale’s 200 year history of support for artists on the Continent is well documented. It was also becoming increasingly visible that many artists were creating works for exhibitions overseas, including works from many from the UK. The Biennale’s internationalisation seemed essential to its future, but its insatiable appetite for cash also became apparent. The Biennale is an art institution</text>

The challenges in this regard are real, and are intended to be encountered. But they are also very different. The challenge for the Biennale as a whole is different. The challenge for the Biennale as a whole is different because it is urban. The challenge for the Biennale as an institution is different. The challenge for the Biennale as a community is different. The challenge for the Biennale as a district is different. The place and the people involved in creating an artworld, whether that be neighbourhoods, towns, cities or villages – whether they are residents or visitors – is very different. The biennale is an entity with its neighbourhoods and its streets, its buildings and streets, its history and its inhabitants. It is a living organism, and as such it responds to the neighbourhood with which it comes into contact.</text>

The challenge for the Biennale has been to combine the qualities of different arts bodies, with the characteristics of different cities. The challenge for the Biennale as a whole has been to find a way to work with people across the city, without being seen to be above them. This may mean incorporating local traditions and actors, but it has also meant creating a mutually respectful relation between the arts organisation and the city in order to work. This may not have been easy for the Biennale to achieve in the 1980s, but it is now becoming increasingly difficult. The city is increasingly seen as a source of revenue generator for arts organisations, which in turn generates opportunities for arts organisations to increase their financial contributions. This may not be always be the case, and whilst engagement may increase with the biennale conventionally, it remains low compared to other institutional forms, but it is an increasingly important and may be a driving force behind the expansion of contemporary art forms. The number of arts organisations in the UK has grown from approximately 6,000 in 1980 to over 36,000 in 2015, a growth rate of almost tenfold. While this growth rate may seem unprecedented, it is noteworthy that the number of arts</text>

Despite these efforts, the case moves through the courts, the US Congress, and the local Board of Supervisors.In the 3D model, the Palestine Street Building serves as a platform for the development of the new ‘smart district’ concept that incorporates information technology and sustainable building practices. We move from the Westkin to the Palestinian Street and from the Palestinian to the Midan styles of Palestinian street painting. The goal of this project is to create a 3D representation of the history of Palestine Street that accurately represents the historical neighbourhood as a whole. The focus of the artwork is on the history of Palestine Street through the lens of 3D modelling. I create a set of rules that guide my work. These rules mirror the social practices and structural factors that shape and constrain the street environment, while drawing on experiences of my own social practice.

The city’s US Attorney pursues the case, arguing that the ‘economic dislocation’ caused by the closure of the Westkin cannot be treated as a threat, and that the threatened community will be hurt by the opening of a new ‘martial arts center’. The case is taken up by the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. He targets the development on the grounds that it will lead to ‘an inevitable proliferation of violent extremist groups bent on destroying life’s rightful places’. The artists are split on the decision. Jessup Paphard’s work is curated as a collage, while the works displayed in the space of the new museum are framed and arranged in disjointed pieces. The proposed cultural center would do more than shelter art from the vagaries of market forces and economic globalization; it would also foster a new breed of artists who would produce healthy art in an environmentally friendly and socially responsible way.

The city’s US Attorney pursues the case, arguing that the ‘economic dislocation’ caused by the closure of the Westkin could not be considered a ‘relocation’. The case is argued before the District Court and ultimately the US Supreme Court. The fate of the Westkin remains in doubt, although the proposal has been put on hold while the petition is heard. The proposed new district includes a vast new elevated shopping mall, a college campus for postgraduate students, a hotel, offices for the LA County Sheriff, cafés, restaurants and a new public realm garden. ‘A Whole New Generation of Districts’, the exhibition’s title, suggests a return to the former glory of the street. The proposed district would bring with it vast new riches for the city, but it would also leave a wasteland in the middle of the city. According to the ‘Planners Report’, released in December of 1998, the area around the former Westkin had several advantages over the wasteland now occupied by the newly proposed ‘High Stages’ development: A)</text>

The case moves the state to take over ownership of the building and the social and political changes that would result if the building were rehabilitated.The 3D model in the exhibition is a fabrication. The proposal for the ‘Westkin 4’ is a forgery. The project is a failure, but the action taken by the artist and the city remains a failure. The proposal is defeated by the authorities, but not before exposing the falsity of the project and the politics at play. The project is reborn as the Westkin Project, which seeks to reconfigure the building into a new ‘cultural venue and ‘retail outlet for locally-produced ideas’. Assembled by architect Leslie Knudsen, the group includes local residents, community organisers, community organisers from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as international artists and designers.

The city’s US Attorney pursues the case, arguing that the ‘economic dislocation’ caused by the closure of the Palestine Street Store would be too great to repair. The social and cultural dislocation caused by the closure of the store is a focus of the project, which is seen by many communities as an affront to their identity.[3] The eventual decision to close the store and relocate the Palestinian community to an undisclosed location near the California-Oregon border seems arbitrary and capricious. The inability to provide a similar level of services to the Palestinian community in the West Bank seems even more arbitrary and capricious. When the store was closed and the Palestine Street Project was put on hold, a new attempt to build co-operative housing for the community, which was subsequently rebranded as ‘Project East Bay’, came online. With the project now considered a failed experiment, the town relocated the local population to a newly constructed townhouse complex in the Hunters Point district of San Francisco. The residents were housed in units managed by the SFMTA. The new residents were encouraged to take up photography</text>

The city’s US Attorney pursues the case, arguing that the ‘economic dislocation’ caused by the closure of the store poses a threat to public safety and the integrity of the county. The case is argued before a federal district court in Los Angeles, challenging the government’s decision to halt construction despite the threat to public safety. There, the case is decided on a 5–4 vote, with the government winning out on every count. The proposed Westkin Building is now an art project abandoned by the city and becomes the subject of a lawsuit claiming constitutional violations. The proposed Westkin Building is now a federal building that serves as the headquarters for an international terrorist organization. What seems like a hopeless situation for the people of Palestine Street begins to change when the project ‘turns violent’ and the people involved begin to flee the area. The proposed redevelopment of the block includes a new development of 140 housing units, of which 60% are reserved for high-income residents. The remaining 40% are planned for low-income residents.

The proposed settlement calls into question the distinction between urban and rural space, between habitation and agriculture, between residential and commercial, and between civilisation and revolution. The proposed settlement calls into question the way the city represents and delivers its heritage. This is not a hypothetical concern. The history of Palestine Street is a site of persistent political and social struggle, and the potential impact of this displacement and revolution is something that the City of London could play a part in shaping. 	[i] The Westkin’s closure in 1980 led to a decade-long period of radical re-construction. The building was repurposed and became a residential neighbourhood ­– a hybrid public realm with a squatting community – but it continued to serve as a staging area for ongoing political struggles.

The campaign has gathered over 10,000 signatures in just over a week. The petition is un- or under-reported in the local press.  The proposal is now being re-negotiated by the town’s politicians, tourism representatives and hoteliers in an attempt to keep the shop closed. The sudden, massive influx of capital in the form of tourism is being financed by a range of government agencies, including California’s ‘Highway Fund’ which is providing funding for a new ‘high-speed rail line’ that will run along the tracks of the Northern Santa Fe Rail Road.

The plan is an attempt to create a new kind of ‘creative class’ in the city. Although the settlement appears to make some sense politically, economically and tactically, the question remains whether the building can be rehabilitated and whether the settlement offers the best possible future for the town and its Latino residents.

Marcelo Ruiz and Christian Ulrikasch The plan to make the Westkin Building into a new kind of cultural district is a good one politically, and it provides for the return of economically vital buildings to their communities. However, the political and economic decisions to make the building into a ‘cultural district</text>
    <text>The project is a speculation on the experience of the town, its capacity to regenerate, and the production of knowledge production through the production of locations and demographics. The project is an attempt to create a case for the town’s future through a narrative of resistance. The exhibition is a distraction from the conflict, but it also aims to change the conflict’s focus from the town to the city. The project begins with a 3D model of the historic Westkin Building, which was the headquarters for the Palestine Street Merchant Society. The Society was a pioneering association of Palestinian street artists. The building, which saw extensive use during the 1980s and 1990s, is listed for condemnation in Los Angeles County. The proposed redevelopment of the block includes a new, yet largely residential, high-end district for office workers, students and traders based on the tastes and models of the Westkin. The city’s US Attorney pursues the case, arguing that the ‘economic dislocation’ caused by the closure of the Westkin should override any artistic or historic value added by the development’s shift of the strategic center. The case is argued before the District Court, which issues an order binding the city and the US Attorney to halt the project’s construction while the case proceeds before the Central Court. If the court rules in favor of the US Government, the building would be razed and rebuilt as a new Palestinian cultural center. If the court rules against the US Government, the site would revert to the local Palestinian Authority. If the court agrees with the Government, the site would revert back to the community. If the project is allowed to go forward, the cultural center’s architecture, murals, and distinctive reuse of the building would return to the street. 3D modelling is used to reconstruct the lost history of the building and its use as a surveillance camera. The technique is similar to that used in the film Area No.1: Wallflower, in which artists recreate the lost history</text>

If you want a painting of a postindustrial city, make it a Biennial.Futurist Painting of a Postindustrial City, 2010. Welsh Streets, Liverpool. Photo: Nina Edge.In the autumn of 2006, Liverpool Biennial organised a series of events in Cardiff, including workshops led by artists and designers from the region. These brought together artists from the local areas with artists from outside the region to explore the connections between art, culture and the landscape. There was a sense that these were different ways of looking at the same landscape, but also a sense of the involvement of artisans and artists from outside of the city in the creation of this landscape. There was some discussion of what it would mean to be ‘deepened’ through such a process. I</text>

I suppose the key was in the interplay of people, agencies and communities. There were other pieces of the jigsaw that were in place as well, but the pieces that made up the whole jigsaw were in place before the social programmes and the arts organisations arrived. Now we have to ask what pieces of the jigsaw are in place and who can add what pieces. The community is the point where the arts organisations are put in the right place and who can do what with what. But that is a very different kind of partnership.1  For more on community development, see: http://www.biennial.com/2015/exhibition/art/1...  2  Gerald Wright, Futurist Painting of a Postindustrial City, 2010, p.9.Download this article as PDFJeanne Robinson and Neil Johnson-Symington and the Questionable Use of Surplus FilmMagic Molly Ivison and Neil Johnson-Symington:  		[1] The term ‘</text>

I suppose the key was in the interplay of many different forces: the local community, business, community, arts, academia … I don’t think there was a single person in the Welsh Streets Community Land Trust who had any formal artistic training, but they all came together to support what was happening. The fact that they all had such different approaches to the work they were producing was a kind of a learning opportunity, a way for us to all work collaboratively. It allowed us to see what worked and what didn’t work, which was always the case in the process: there was always a hostility between the artist and the people who were producing the artwork, but that didn’t mean that the artist wasn’t trying to help the community: he was trying to make something that was aesthetically pleasing to the city centre residents and he also had to consider what the community would want in return. The fact that the Welsh Streets were a part of the Biennial was a really important moment in our artist’s</text>

I suppose the key was in the interplay of people: getting funding, getting the city to fund the art, and then waiting for the city to fund the art. I think the key was that the Biennial was there to provide the funding; otherwise it was the artists who had to find other places to put their art. The city found the art, and in a way the artists found the funding, although at the same time the city was finding other things – finding ways to use the artwork it had collected. Futurist Painting of a Postindustrial City, 2010.

It was a ‘once in a generation’ kind of thing: once in a generation in the sense of the biennial, and yet again in the sense of a once in a century in terms of world art.

The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a site of conflict and conflict is not always easy to find, and sometimes you have to fight your way out.

In doing so, the project fed off one another, providing the space and time for the community to come together and make a difference. 	  In doing so, the projects fed off one another, creating a kind of collective amnesia. 	 It is this kind of vulnerability to the vagaries of production and so on that I look for in people – in workers, artists, curators, curators, journalists, street artists, children, old people, pensioners, travellers, vegetarians, there are many kinds of people – and I find inspiration in that.

I suppose the key was in the interplay of community and business and the ability of the artist to engage both. Wright’s painting of the Welsh Streets was a reaction to the demolition of many of his contemporaries’ buildings. The Welsh Streets had been a ‘glimmer of hope’ for the area, providing a haven for people to come and create new ways of living, gathering and growing around a traditional arts and crafts site. The Biennial never imagined it would one day touch down in Liverpool and so the project was never able to really ‘occupy’ the city. But now that it has, it is able to ‘impact’ on the city in many ways, bringing arts and crafts to areas where there is often a lack of imagination or lack of interest. The fact that it is being produced in Wales shows that this is a project that is sustainable and that the art can be made available to those who need it. As the Biennial itself points out, there is still a lot of work</text>

I suppose the key was in the interplay of many different kinds of government, different kinds of business, different kinds of culture, different kinds of labour. I think the fact that I produced some pieces myself, for which I was very proud, and that generated a lot of ambition for others to produce, was a real asset.  Creating that kind of ambition is a totally different kind of creativity.Download this article as PDFMeehan CristMeehan Crist is the Curator for Biennials at Tate Liverpool and was previously Curator of Art in the Public Sector at Tate Liverpool.

I suppose the key was in the interplay of people: once the project began to be seen as a kind of performance, in which the artist was a co-convener, then the business started to take shape, and then the other, more ‘intelligent’ elements happened as well. Wright is doing a slightly different kind of conceptual writing than I am, and that comes across in the two pieces of the Futurist notebook that are very different. But there is a similar kind of drive and ambition there.But this is also a long way from when I first started working with the Liverpool Biennial on the 2000 and its connection with the city I came from. Before then, the connection was more of a folk perception. I had always lived in New York, but was coming out of my cocoon of self-imposed exile in Liverpool, and the Biennial was inviting me back into its fold. I couldn’t say no.

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you take the Meadows as an ongoing project, then you also have to consider the fact that the city is also an ongoing and authentic part of the city. Sometimes the city has a clear interest in replicating the process of the original design being worked on by the Midleton Group, and I believe that the city has a very important role to play in this. The city has a very important role to play in this because the city has such a huge cultural import to the production of culture in the region. The city plays a huge role in this because it contains so much cultural value: there’s a reason why the name ‘Midleton Place’ comes up so much in the region. The city represents a huge amount of cultural value to the region because of its physical presence, and the fact that people know and associate the city with a certain type of living environment (and often a certain type of food) – the fact that there’s a reason why the city is such a</text>

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you bring people together through a specific project, there’s a real possibility that they will come together again and again. I’m interested in how the members of the Community Arts collective, who are artists and artists-in-training, are able to articulate the kinds of political and social context and political engagement that they face in their work. It’s a question of making connections across different levels and layers. In the case of the Meadows, I wanted to work with the teddy bears because they were the right size, the right colour, and the right shape. I wanted to work with the puffs of smoke that were coming from the bakery – the shape of the pie, the colour of the icing and the texture of the butter – because that’s what a teddy bear is. The design that I came up with was a hybrid between a teddy bear and a puffs of smoke. I combined the two to create what became known as The Meadow Look.</text>

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you take that idea of collaborative rather than exclusive work and apply it to the MMMT, you can say that it’s a project that’s also about the people who are making the work right now – those people are the ones that are actively engaged and making progress. It’s about the future potential of the work and its impact on the community.I think that one of the things that has really driven the creative process behind the work is the idea of collective responsibility. When we talk about how to make the Meadows work better, I’m particularly interested in people saying, ‘This could be done better.’ It’s really important that those people point this out and that the creative impulses of the person revolve around how to do that. It’s not just about making the best work possible – there’s a collective responsibility aspect to that. What I do personally is interested in is for the people making the work to feel like</text>

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you go back and look at the drawings and the site plan, you can clearly see that the relationships that’s being drawn between the city and the community are being built upon the backs of one another.‘Future collaboration’ is going to mean different things to different people. Sometimes the city is going to want to create its own future collaboration; sometimes the city will want to collaborate with the city in a way that’s authentic to the city and the traditions of the city. This is one example of the city creating its own future collaboration. We’re all contributing to making the city what it should be, and to that end, I hope that this new model of collective ownership and collaborative agency that’s being proposed for the waterfront can be an interesting model for other kinds of future collaborations.  One more example: the city is trying to make a park that’s completely underground now, because it’s becoming increasingly difficult to walk through the banks of</text>

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you take that concept further, you can start to imagine collaborating with plants and animals and even with buildings and simulating the elements. The fact that the Meadows is a ‘social enterprise’ – a partnership between the city and the farmers' cooperative – creates another level of engagement and negotiates the traditional hierarchies of power and profit. The synergy between the city and the cooperative extends beyond the confines of the property. The cooperative’s activities in the city inform the city’s decision-making, its ability to sustain itself and its ability to negotiate its way out of the financial bind of housing and social injustice. This is a model of sustainable urbanism at work. The cooperative’s ability to engage the city in decisions that directly affect its ability to produce and exploit means that ‘city government will increasingly play a more active role in shaping the terrain and shaping its constituents’. This may include, for instance, the cooperative’s ability to create local jobs by way</text>

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you take the MCC as an example, there’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows, because the people who’re living and working there are the same people who come to the meetings today, the same people who are coming to the meetings tomorrow, and the same people who are coming to the meetings ten years from now. That’s a very powerful way of thinking about, and constructing, future collaboration.There’s another layer to this, which is that the people who are moving through the neighbourhood today are the very same people who will be coming to the neighbourhood ten years from now. These are generational changes, and I believe that these people who are coming to the meetings today are the same people who will be coming to the meetings tomorrow, and the same people who will be coming to the meetings ten years from now.

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you go back a few years, you would find a tree that was once a residence for one of the residents, and now it’s a place where another resident resides. It’s a site that was once occupied by one of the neighbouring businesses, and now it’s home to a group of residents. It’s a place where children once played, and now they’re playing outside. It’s a place that was once a pharmacy, and now it’s a place for Indigenous communities to come together and exchange, to learn about different practices and to form their own practices, to take ownership of their futures, to enact their own organisations and to have that be a site of their collective work. So there’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ that I think is really valuable when it comes to imagining things in a certain way. In the context of the Meadows, the idea of who is a resident and who is not,</text>

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you take the Meadows as an ongoing project, you have to ask, how do you sustain the relationship? Because if the relationship is not sustainable, there’s a question about what kind of power and influence can the city put into creating that future collaboration. The answer to that is a difficult one to give and a difficult one to resist because there’s a very real sense of obligation on the part of the members of the Community Land Trust to do something in return for their membership. It’s a mutual benefit. When you have a land trust, you give them something back in exchange for something – and in return, the city gets something back in return. And there’s a real sense of ‘getting something back’ from the city. What I’ve found very interesting and powerful in doing the art projects in the area is that I had to decide between two kinds of art – great art and great art done by an artist’s studio or a</text>

If you take the time to actually come to the Meadows every day, you’re actually making future collaboration a daily experience. The idea that you need a formal education in Community Arts doesn’t capture the essence of what makes the arts so exciting.  	I want to explore how the arts can be supported in a city and how the arts can be produced in a community. That’s really interesting to me because when I was younger, the arts education that I got from my teachers was very important to me. It made me want to be an artist and it made me want to do social work. But as I got older and into my late teens and twenties, the emphasis shifted away from the arts education to other types of education and programmes. And at that point, the emphasis wasn’t aligned with where I was at in my education, so much of my social work work work came from an archive of films and TV shows.

There’s a sense of ‘future collaboration’ in the context of the Meadows that’s very much an ongoing and authentic part of the community. If you leave the context of the original Community Land Trust, which was a very particular place, and you leave the context of the Meadows, which is a very particular place, then you leave a very specific set of relationships. It’s a very powerful way to think about things. And so there’s a sense of ‘how to get things done’ without necessarily coming to terms with the idea of how things actually happen. And so there’s a process that I’m interested in initiating, which is not a project or a initiative or a partnership or something that’s formally initiated by the City, but rather a process by which the City can put things together that are authentic to the context and have a real impact on something that’s happening today.I met Sara at the Arts Council exhibition in January.

The Liverpool Biennial could be a catalyst for a new generation of artists to be inspired and empowered by the city, drawing on the city’s rich past, its contemporary challenges and possibilities, and its urban future. We should make it a place where artists, curators, arts professionals and city dwellers come together to explore and imaginatively unravel the meaning and future of the city. This is our first opportunity to create a counterweight to the massive amounts of capital and money at stake in the financial system of which we are a part. 	The question now becomes whether the Biennial can create a model that resonates with the local, national and international curatorial approaches to the city. The answer to that is a resounding 'yes’.

Artists could initiate the programme in their area, or collaborate with local authorities, heritage organisations or community artists to create a mini museum that reflects the city they live in. Above all, they can't be a local government body or a community organisation. It is also important that the relevant art institutions and their artists are involved in the planning and execution of the project, since the involvement of the Arts Council would make the project ‘global’ and ‘transactional’ in its nature. 	There is also a question mark hanging over the whole project – is it possible to create a museum that is not local to the locality? How do we bring together the different levels of government and art institutions when it comes to curating? I believe that there are other ways of approaching art museums and their collections, including one through direct cultural interaction. It would be a rare and wonderful thing if art institutions and their artists could ever truly come to grips with the scale of the city, but there is much that can be done in a collaborative and participatory fashion through art and arts-related activities, including through art being made locally.

This is what the Liverpool Biennial does, and what other art institutions around the world do too. It is an artistic production – an artistic-politically driven public-relations initiative to create national and international recognition for the Biennial – and it is a guaranteed audience for art. If the Biennial is well-received and other artists are inspired to collaborate, the programme could be curated by an Arts Council Board member or an external artist's organisation. 	However, the realisation of the programme and the actual curatorial work comes later, after artists, curators and arts administrators have had a chance to engage with and shape the artefacts and create an appropriate context for the programme to take place in.

And if there isn’t a public purpose behind it, then what is it? 	The accepted wisdom among arts organisations is that if you meet a curatorial goal, you can achieve almost anything with resources and organisations. And part of what we do with the Biennial is to create collaborative frameworks to allow different kinds of organisations to work together. But there is still a lack of imagination about what it means to be a local government or a arts organisation, and the difference between what we do locally and what we do abroad. We decided to do our own legwork through our local community arts organisation, the Liverpool Community Arts organisation, to find out what it meant to be a local government or an Arts Council employee in the past, and to understand what it meant to be a local arts organisation in the future.Curatorial Vision 	The Biennial has</text>

Artists could initiate the programme in their area, or collaborate with local authorities, heritage organisations or community artists to create a mini museum that reflects the city they live in. Above all, they can't be a local government or arts organisation. It is understood that in the current political climate, this is an issue that resonates with people. 	The proposal is also being driven by the  Arts Council England, which has a cultural department that works with local authorities to support innovative arts and community projects across their jurisdictions. The idea is that the arts and culture resources of the area would be available to all, irrespective of where they were located. 	The key is for the local community to step in and create its own narrative, and for the arts to take the lead in telling that narrative. 	The Biennial itself is part of the English Heritage portfolio, which includes the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Modern, the Dreadnought Gallery and the Great Hall. It is anticipated that this new initiative will see the Arts Council, local authorities, museums and other interested parties coming together to develop a shared vision and agenda. The initial public consultation period will see artists and their organisations involved from the</text>

Artists could initiate the programme in their area, or collaborate with local authorities, heritage organisations or community artists to create a mini museum that reflects the city they live in. Above all, they can't be a local government or arts organisation, because then you are at war with nature. So the answer is that you need to find an artist with a clear idea of what you want to do and an ability to make it happen, and collaborate closely with that artist to find the best venue, the best group of artists to work with, and the best way to put your idea into practice.  	In the case of a mini-museum, the mini-museum could be a series of mini-muses – each dedicated to a particular theme – similar to the way that museums today are organised. A mini-muse is an entity that has its own distinctive form and vocabulary, yet also differs from other forms of museum by having its own set of curatorial approaches. 	In the case of a city, the form might be a collection of monuments or a collection of places – a DNA of its own. In the case of a mini-muse, the form might be a collection of</text>

Artists could initiate the programme in their area, or collaborate with local authorities, heritage organisations or community artists to create a mini museum that reflects the city they live in. Above all, they can't be a local government, heritage organisation or community artist themselves, as it would be un-British. 	The Arts Council has been quick to disavow any notion of responsibility for the programme, and has repeatedly stressed that it would be run by local artists who had a say in its content and purpose. Nevertheless, as the Arts Council itself recognises, the potential to transform cultural resources through art is there, and the Arts Council needs to be involved in enabling that transformation. The reality is that as the arts are made over and more and more in the community, the need to be part of that transformation becomes less and less viable; the conflict between the needs of the community and the curatorial turns into a contradiction. In an ideal world, the Arts Council might become more involved in the development of the art than in the maintenance of the art itself. But that would require radical changes in the way art is consumed and promoted in the community, and would require artists to become politically engaged and involved in local politics. That</text>

Instead, an artist could initiate the programme and get support from the Arts Council and the local authority, who would then either find a way to incorporate them into the programme, or find a way to create their own artworks that are displayed at the museum. The Arts Council could even find a way to invest in the development of the local biennial, providing support in the form of a patronage policy to artists and organisations in return for increased access to the Biennial through increased numbers. 	The key for artists and curators is to understand that they do have agency, and that their art will be taken seriously regardless of how much is made and spread online. That's why we’re encouraging local artists to get involved, not because we’re going to hand them a check, but because we believe that if we don’t create the art that we want, the people who use it are going to figure</text>

Local government is predominantly an administrative arm of the state, and its power is used to enforce particular statutory policies and provide particular institutionalised roles. It is the role of artists and other stakeholders to engage citizens in creating their own destinies. A local community is capable of being creative, independent and sovereign, but it must be empowered with the skills, knowledge and tools to sustain it. A good example of this is the Anfield Village Arts Collective, who sought to engage residents through self-guided artist-in-residence courses and other activities in and outside the local area. These programmes and activities laid the groundwork for the Biennial to be forged through locally-influenced practices and structures. These forms of creative direct action were not confined to the ethos of the community; they were part of a larger cultural and urban strategy that sought to reshape the city through new modes of economic, spatial and social organisation.

Instead, they could create a mini museum around their neighbourhoods, towns and villages, using local players as discoverers, researchers and artists. This would allow the power and flexibility to co-opt local players and use their strengths and processes to create synergies and complementarity and create new situations and situations, but also to emerge as an independent entity with a unique voice and responsibility. 	The mini museum format would give artists and art collectors a way to understand how local resources are used, generating knowledge that can inform art making but also enabling conflicts and tensions within communities. It would also allow for conflicts and tensions to be worked through constructively and artistically, creating new situation through conflict and tension minimisation.New media can play an important part in this work. The emergence of social media as a viable and powerful tool for art making and cultural-political action is a good example. It allows us to</text>

The Liverpool Biennial needs to find a way to connect directly to the city and its diverse cultures, and that requires economic citizenship. Cultural tourism today is about experiences – about relationships – but the biennial needs to find ways to connect with the city in a more fundamental way. It’s not just about the destination, but the experience of coming to the city. The Liverpool Biennial needs to offer a fundamentally different experience from touring a museum, a traditional art market, or a large art gallery. It’s about culture as a collective experience, about how the unique relationship between art and the city could change how we think about culture and art as a whole.  Finally, the question becomes, what would be the role of the biennial in the city in the future? I believe that the biennial will remain very much a place where people come for a particular type of experience, and that the important thing is to create experiences that are richer and more complex than that. I hope you can join me in exploring these ideas in more detail.

Cultural tourism today is about experiences – about relationships – but the biennial needs to find ways to connect with the city in a way that is deeper and more lasting. The biennial needs to become cultural in its own right, and create a narrative around itself that is more enduring and authentic. It is going to be important for the biennial to become culturally responsive, because at the same time the city is becoming increasingly unattractive to cultural tourism, and the biennial is going to have to find a way to reconcile the two. The answer may have to be found in a possible collaboration between the biennial and tourism authorities. If the biennial follows the current pattern of relying on tourism to fund itself, with cultural resources like food and clothing that are distributed at no cost to visitors, then it may be necessary to create a separate entity, run by its own kind of tourists, who come to look at architecture and the city and experience a slightly different kind of culture. Such a tourism body would offer a completely different kind of experience, but it would also have the advantage of being culturally responsive, since it could choose to invest</text>

The biennial needs to open its cultural doors to those who wish to explore them, and not in the patronising ‘best available’ way of: ‘We should do this because it will add to our value…’. Cultural tourism today is about access, but the biennial needs to expand its cultural portfolio to include ‘realistic, tangible and buildable’ places to be visited. The city is a cultural commodity, and the biennial needs to play that commodity responsibly. The opening of a museum to visitors that is centrally located and catalysed by a museum is not only an economic tourism pitch, but also a cultural trick that creates connections between different cultural groups, draws visitors from faraway places and entices them into culturally responsive experiences.

My proposal  To begin to think about these kinds of possibilities, let’s create a new kind of tourism destination. Let’s call it ‘Cities for Living Curated’. The idea is that the tourism industry has largely given up on urban tourism, which is the future for many cities.

Cultural tourism today is about experiences – about relationships – but the biennial needs to find ways to connect with the city in a way that is both authentic to the city and genuinely new, so as to maintain its cultural cachet and identity.The answer may come from within. The answer may come from something as simple as asking, ‘What is the difference between biennials and museums?’. Biennial museums are a special kind of museum, because they are places where art is often exhibited in a situation that is rarely ideal for art, but which nonetheless creates a situation in which art can happen. This is true of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which is a museum of art not usually exhibited in museums, and is a museum of modern art usually exhibited in museums. It was important for the Biennial to exhibit its art in a place called ‘the gallery’ – where art people gather to exchange and exchange, and where art is usually exchanged – so that the museum could begin to form a kind of cultural exchange with its visitor. The gallery became the site of the art’s</text>

Cultural tourism today is about experiences – about relationships – but the biennial needs to find ways to connect with the city in a way that is both authentic to its roots, and authentic to the modern, postindustrial form of labour that it inhabits. The biennial as a form of exchange between the cities that together create and emerge out of the city is the result of a capitalist circulation of experience; it is labour moira, but with cultural capital layered deep within the fabric of the biennial itself. The biennial as a form of cultural tourism is the future to be found not in dystopian near-futures of postindustrial cities, but in contemporary, postindustrial cities that are themselves cultural capitals of the world. That is, of course, assuming, of course, that capitalism is still around. Cultural tourism today is different from earlier forms of cultural tourism: the growth of the transnational biennial as a worldwide phenomenon, and the increasing visibility of individual art forms within it, is different from the growth of the transnational art movement in the late nineteenth century. But it is also different from the growth of cultural tourism</text>

This changed everything. Photography became routine, and its ubiquity as an image-collecting practice manifested itself in everything from wallpaper designs to wallpapers to corporate promotional images. The ubiquity of photography in the home also increased. In the home is the context of photography that is constantly transposed and modified by the actions of individuals – of course, individuals are often not aware that they are being photographed. Consequently, awareness of photography in the home increased alongside the ‘episodic’ aspect of photography.The rise of the ‘home video’ and the consequent proliferation of image-collecting practices, including home-brew video, meant that images of homes being repaired or renovated were regularly shared on the web. As a result, the home became something that people repeated over and over again, rather than an object that was individually unique. This repeated repetition gave the impression that the home was a constantly evolving, ‘real-time’ situation, with ‘real-life�</text>

This changed everything. Photography became widespread in the public sector and became a necessity for almost everyone on the planet, so creating and distributing imagery was feasible. Propaganda photography was also crucial in convincing citizens that the coalition government was responding to the threat from ISIL (Daesh), as well as other radical Islamist groups, so the public image of the Iraq and Syria conflict was maintained. Propaganda photography was essential in convincing ISIL and other radical Islamist groups that they were needed in the UK, in order to assist in the future conflict resolution and peace process. It is essential that this ‘need’ be maintained, for the success of this ‘war’ depends on it.In 2003, David Cameron established the controversial ‘Performative Painting’ programme.

The idea that elements of an urban environment could be turned into products marketed to a consumer market was a novel one in its time, but is one that is as relevant as ever.The development of digital photography and high-speed internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s meant that photography was no longer limited to formal occasions (the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Biennale, the Guggenheim) and the elevated, to which it was exposed, such as in the West, but could be captured and transmitted via smartphone or connected to a web server. This changed the game in numerous ways, including the emergence of consumer-oriented, 3D image processing that reconnoises an image to include new information at a higher resolution than was possible before, as well as the proliferation of editing suites and applications that insert, subtract and transform elements of the image according to user preferences. In the last decade and a half, several major computerised image-editing suites were developed, and their functions expanded, but one of the most significant developments of the last decade has been the proliferation of apps that aid in the creation of imagery, and the connectivity of devices capable of creating imagery. Such connectivity is designed to meet the needs of commercial and media clients, yet it is also essential for the functioning of the technologically anaesthetised community of artists and creatives who inhabit the Welsh Streets area. This connectivity requires that the artists and creatives who inhabit the Welsh Streets area continue to be participants in the sub-ascension of their area, and that is why they are</text>

This changed everything. The advent of high-end camera phones and full-frame cameras meant that photography became a necessity for almost everyone, and the social circumstances of the communities that comprise the social web have been extensively revised in response to this technology. The social web is populated by people whose photographs are now regularly shared online, and whose stories are regularly embellished by media outlets. This increased visibility and accessibility has led to a proliferation of fads and kaleidoscopic permutations of things – fads being the animalistic extension of the publication of time – but it has also led to an explosion of fads’s of things. The social web is a place where ideas are constantly being introduced into communities of things, and this interaction is precisely what the viral and habit-forming properties of print and social media fail to generate. What we call Facebook Friends, or the Food Network’s &quot;Insta&quot; are in fact not in their original formative formative encounters, but are instead the product</text>

This changed the game tremendously, and ushered in a new era of urban exploration for which the archaeology of the metropolis was not well suited. The megastructure was often both visible (in the Welsh Streets area, where the development boomed, and elsewhere in London) and invisible (in the Welsh Streets and Welsh Streets area of Toxteth, where the arts community was concentrated). In the megastructure, archaeology was often used as a weapon of war, as evidenced by the fact that the 1990 Venice Biennale, which was largely organised by the city council and supported by the government, was replete with proposals and initiatives from city councillors and others including the London Borough of Wandsworth Council, whose members spent much of their time justifying, justifying and justifying the Biennale in the borough. They argued that it was necessary to host the show in a city-centre venue because of the ‘massive urban sprawl’ created by the surrounding area and the fact that</text>

This changed everything. Photography became ubiquitous, and the image of the seemingly infinite became something that was captured and transmitted ubiquitously. The image of the ‘infinite’ became something that had a temporal character – recorded in photographs, and subsequently made visible online – something that could be accessed via a web browser, and something that could be registered and traced via a web server. In other words, the infrastructural form that had been assumed by the artist and his team was not a static form, but rather a dynamic one that continually engaged with and was influenced by the dynamic dynamic – engaging with the changing needs and desires of the user in various forms of media.In this process of dynamic engagement with the dynamic – in this case, the user – the artist created a set of objects that were both physical and virtual replicas of the elements that made up the city, but in different scales, and reproduced them in various media formats and on various scales. These new media formats and media types</text>

This changed the game – photography was no longer confined to formal occasions (the Biennale, the Tate Modern, the Grand Prix) and the elevated (the Tate) but could be captured and transmitted via these venues as well (Broadchurch, the Grand Hyatt). As a result, the use of photography in the city increased exponentially. The Biennale, which started in 1993, became the biggest buyer of photography worldwide (Brieu et al., Discovery of the City, 2011). The introduction of the constellation, and its images, coincided with this. The elements of the constellation that we now associate with urban magic, such as the twinkling of an eye or the collected dust in a secure location, are images that were taken somewhere else. They are artefacts of another time. But they are not: contemporary art is the contemporary artefact.Art is made up of small tasks – like making a cup of tea or brushing your teeth – that require great concentration and effort.</text>

This changed the game, however, insofar as the desire for professional images was concerned. Image-representations that were intended for print became available online, and the desire to publish images that can be cut and printed became paramount. This desire for a ‘high-end, high-quality product’ was realised in two ways: (1) through the use of CAD (computer aided design) software; and (2) through the manufacture of materials and building systems that could be used in a production line to support the production of photographic negatives. In addition to the images themselves, images of significant quality were produced using these new production systems. The demand for images of high-end quality was realised not through the direct production of hi-res images via the art market, but through the production of photographic negatives at a scale that would be suitable for the cutting-edge of printing technology. The production of hi-res images via this route met the production of images at a scale that permitted hi-res</text>

This meant that images could be taken continuously – every second – and passed along to a clientele of internet-ready devices, many of which were mobile phones. This increased the number of images that could be taken – from the seven or eight that were taken in to the five or six that comprise the sort of photographic archive that is made up of countless images – and thereby the amount that can be stored, which made it possible to conceptualise the concept of archive as something more than a physical space (in which images are taken and passed on, often in bulk, from one project to another). Images could be tagged, and the projectors themselves could be embedded in historical images, including those taken during the 1980s and 1990s. This made archival resources readily available, and made them a kind of viral media phenomenon. The idea that images could travel quickly across the social networks – the social networks of the participants in the project – and then be retrieved by those who took the images later became commonplace.</text>

This brought with it a whole host of new technological constraints, which artists were naturally keen to exploit. The digital camera has a sensor that is eight times larger than the film camera, which means that the images captured with it are four to six times larger. In the case of a photo that is ten times larger, then, then the sensor has to be capable of taking many more images – or the pictures have to be postcard-sized in order to be processed. Thus post-production becomes essential in the making of a viral video, and it is precisely here that the limits of digital photography are exploited in order to make ever bigger images. This is why some viral videos today are shot entirely in black and white, or in colour versions of the same picture taken at a later date. Because the computer is unable to process the enormous number of images captured in a video, it automatically converts the image into a form that is difficult to process: the viral image becomes a form of text that is easier to</text>
