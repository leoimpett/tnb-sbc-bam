    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is currently planning for the following subject-specificities: art, architecture, fashion, youth culture, environment, food and drink, performance, public realm and much more. So far, we have only covered the topology of cultural links. The real star of the show is the monolithic, all-encompassing, ‘functional core’ of the event – itself a large, beautiful interactive map. The fact that it is curated by a non-profit organisation means that this is taken more literally than in other biennials, where the museum-centric curatorial circuit tends to herd in cultural over-hyping, over-elevation and under-recognised work. The event is a turn-on for art-critics, a rarity in a field dominated by art galleries, and it has long been a place of a white, middle-class boy band banging out hits at a nominal membership fee.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was mostly made up of artists who happened to be British or Australian, and the younger generation of EDM acts was predominantly made up of people from the UK and Europe. Nowadays, many people born after the mid-1990s are still alive to fight the legacy of racism, sexism and ableism, but even when these people are making music and EDM, they rarely move the field back into gear. There is a reason why trance music has a global reach: it is a bona fide art form, and its practitioners know how to find a way in a capitalist market.At a deeper level, why is this happening? The world is becoming more interconnected, and the more we use social media (which has become our whole world) the more we become consumers of content. As a consequence, we need ever more sophisticated ways to understand and exchange cultural phenomena, and the biennial is an ideal opportunity to indulge in this exchange and further this understanding – even if this means commodifying cultural phenomena.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was actually encouraged to be creative, innovative and socially engaged. Today, people tend to be more aware of the negative connotations of their lifestyles, and biennials are the last bastion of artistic-political agency. That is, of course, until recently.The event itself, on the other hand, is where the real drama and the real fights are happening. It is where cultural-political agency is actively asserted, where artists are actively working towards changing the terms by which we understand and process their work. It is a place where biennials really emerge and really make themselves known. I interviewed Tenzin Terziuk, Curator of Public Practice at the Vancouver Art Gallery, and one of his tasks is to pick great art and make it spectacular. He did not have a great deal of luck with his first attempt at the Biennial, but he has improved his luck ever since. There is no doubt that his approach to the art has changed, and that he is far more aware of</text>

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was made up of many different sub-categories, but by the mid 2000s, EDM was firmly rooted in the city, and its fans could be counted on to drift further afield with every passing year. Notable exceptions to this trend are the 2010 Venice Architecture Biennale and the 2015 London Docklands Arts Festival, both curated by Sarah Lowdnes and taking place in a redeveloped part of the docklands now home to home-based creative agencies. The EDM biennale largely consists of profiles of artists from the past, focusing on the groups most directly influenced by the art, often focusing on individuals who were themselves cultural touchstones. The single exception to this general rule is the 2017 Liverpool Biennial, which chose to devote a significant part of its itinerary to looking at its own city and its own identity. Curator Lowdnes does not attempt to quantify the significance of this fact, opting instead to point out that many of the biennials she has curated over</text>

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was a thing, but as the market has flooded in and offline music everywhere, the curatorial turn-on has taken over the curatorial position. The Biennale now regulates everything from the content of a museum to the role of art in community, and it counts on the fact that the organisers of the upcoming Venice Biennale will be the same people who plan the next Venice Biennale. The prospect of that sort of consistent, game-changing organising is the curatorial curatorial, after all. It does not take place in a vacuum, and it is not a given, but it is a mutual thing.This is not, however, the only kind of game-changing that can happen at the Biennale. The development of the Biennale has often been characterised by a kind of metamorphosis, a kind of ‘turning-point’ in the history of the art world, which in turn heralded a kind of proliferation of art-historical</text>

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was a natural fit, and while there are certainly differences in value and sensibilities, this is where the similarities end. There is a real connection between the two-day event and the EDM circuit, where artists and labels alike are encouraged to experiment and push the envelope. The EDM circuit is a natural fit for the biennial that we inhabit, and this is where the real art is made. The EDM circuit is where the real creativity happens. The real clashes and the real battles. The real out-buds and the real trenchants. The real out-panthers and the real brouhaha’. The real ugly t-shirts and the real tacky mugs. The real cheap chocolates and the real gourmet burgers. The real cheap flights and the real wild-ass rides on the quads. The real cheap booze and the real cheap cigarettes. The real cheap girls and the real cheap trains. The real cheap houses and the real cheap cars.</text>

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was made up of many talented people who were allowed to flourish by the large, supportive society that was built around the art-house experience. Now, the clubby, middle-class feel of the art museum is more like the EDM club by invitation only. The demand for entry is for the privileged few. The venue, the art institution and the patron are the key to unlocking the cultural cachet. The biennial is a perfect vehicle for this kind of insularity. It is an event, it is a place, it is a family. But what is it that enables each of us to be present in the other? What kind of shared, inter-related experience can be created through what is perhaps now called ‘the biennial as a cultural complex?’? In the case of an EDM, the experience may be shared between many different venues, but the key is that all of them contribute to the creation of a shared cultural experience.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was made up of many different sub-genres, with different drugs, different styles and vocabularies, and EDM festivals like Meltdown in Miami now exist only as an urban legend. For many years, the only EDM festival was the massive America EDM 4 in Las Vegas, with its over-the-top, noise and bright lights, and the attendant casinos, mixed with a rotating line-up of artists choosing to show their work at the nearby MacDermid Art Gallery. Later in the decade, the Biennale was the only major event inside the ‘Cadillac’ hotel, a cluster of rental apartments in the middle of the river.Sadly, the Biennale is no longer the sole venue for art-related events in Liverpool, and with the city growing increasingly unaffordable and lacking in resources, a lot of artists have moved on to other venues in the city, often staying for extended periods in other venues. This has moved the Bienn</text>

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was encouraged to get creative, to experiment with different formats of art-performance, to up their game, to branch out and so forth. The biennial has clearly identified its interest in the art-historian Margaret Thatcher, and has a long-term, even passionate, though now somewhat marginalized, but otherwise uninvolved agenda. It is also clear that the core curatorial policy of ‘out-doing-each-other’ in terms of size and novelty has a clearly political undercurrent. In the 1990s, the Biennale approached the subject head-on, as a primary focus, and through the organisation of various sub-exhibitions, through the staging of large-scale exhibitions, and, of course, the big black and white and colour pictures. In recent years, the subject has often been treated as an afterthought, either sidelined by other art-histories, or treated as a footnote to other important curatorial and art-material acts.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was a significant presence, and their hits are still being played at major arenas across the UK. The core of the event remains made up of music halls, mainstream venues and major art suppliers. But every now and then, a random artist or a small business will step it up a gear, and the whole birdcage will send a jolt of creativity and energy down the tchotchke-stone of the transport network. We’re playing catch-up here, and the art and EDM industries are still making quick work of catching up. The needle on the balance is still dangling precariously between the time when the first pandora's box was opened and the time when the first airplane hit the ground. But the art-supplier/mass media needle is moving much faster than the art-consumer needle, which is yet to catch up. If anything, the monolithic media needle is catching up at an exponential rate, while the individual artist or business may not even notice</text>

In the 1980s and 1990s, the EDM community was a passionate and determined bunch, and their obsessive, sometimes violent pursuit of cultural iconography and fixations on a given subject matter (chosen by curators) is a sustained narrative that organises the community’s attention, feelings and expectations. However, the real star of the show has long been the biennial itself. It has been a monumental task for any art form to build cultural capital as a result of in-depth research, so it is remarkable that the festival itself has managed this critical task in such a way. It is true that the past few years have seen a sea change in the nature of exhibitions and the curatorial role, but the real star has been the biennial itself. It has been here that the art of the in-gallery has a real, tangible, and far-reaching impact, as distinct from the more frequently-quoted but undervalued piece of the art market.

But there’s another kind of promise that could also be translated into practice. That kind of promise is what makes ‘the current period unique: the promise of a better future’.2 	That kind of transformative epiphany, the kind that makes you want to claw your way out of the quagmire of contemporary capitalism, is what William James had to say when he started calling contemporary capitalism ‘postmodernism’.3 	Today, many of those same finance guys would happily trade in a quagmire of contemporary misery on the one hand, and design and build a utopian future city on the other.

In the twentieth century, theorists poured immense amounts of effort into conceiving abstract systems that could explain how material objects could behave in mysterious ways. But as industrialisation unfolded, a different kind of theory was put to work in an ever greater array of products and services. Theory had long assumed a material dimension, but the social web spun outward at unpredictable speeds, becoming intricately nuanced and dynamic with ever more sophisticated algorithms. 	At the center of the social web was the fetishised commodity: the commodity was both the thing and the occasion of its own mystique. But the social web is only as strong as the weakest link; material objects pulled at its weakest link. Hence the material dimension of the commodity and its seeming excesses. Hence the fetishisation of image and image processes. Hence the rise of technologies that process images and data into ever greater formats of manifestation – into bureaucracies that monitor and control images and data</text>

But it also seeks to point to possible futures through a series of specific actions – actions that can end up being contested or revolutionary. That’s why we at the Conner Prize are so troubled by the state of California’s anti-union law, and why so many activists in other parts of the country are engaged in fighting the neo-liberal economic and political systems that they perceive as imposing their will across the country. That system – the market – is inherently pro-capitalist, and every attempt to stop it is used to undercut working-class wages and working-class democracy. The fact that so many</text>

It reads: ‘Workers of the world unite!’ It declares that the production of commodities and the circulation of money are governed by 'cumulative effect' – the tendency towards an underlying pattern of repetition – and ends with an exhortation to all workers to join in the production of patterns.Patterns are produced in three main ways: (1) through the production of symbols – commonplaces, tropes, and motifs; (2) through the production of practices – formal and non-formal – that aid in the production of such things as numbers, places, etc.; and (3) through the production of signs – patterns that aid in the identification of goods and the conveyance of information about them. There’s a reason why patterns are produced in neat rows and columns and woven together, why they have names and categories. It has to do with the production of signals. Symbols are texts that tell a story. Commonplaces, tropes, and motifs tell a story in a set of related stories. And the production of goods and services – the production of goods and services, in short – has a story that includes both the producer and the consumer. 	As a way of putting it, then, we</text>

That question has been bothering philosophers, economists and logicians for a while now, and it’s starting to gnaw at the very notion of natural human agency on the level of the collective unconscious. The Latour Declaration doesn’t seem to offer any solution to the problem, since there isn’t a collective unconscious here – there’s just consciousness. But there are hints that the emergence of consciousness as a fundamental organizing principle of the social implies at least some changes. For one thing, the consciousness of all living beings has to be shared between the many working parts of the system. So if we start to think about the collective unconscious as a living organism with a conscious and conscious being, then perhaps it can act to limit the extent to which the system is affected by the tendencies towards an underlying pattern</text>

It attempts to build self-sustaining ‘third parties’ that can and should be built upon the strengths of the trade union and other grassroots movements. Its articles of incorporation make explicit what it means to be ‘transformed’: to become part of a «third party community’.2 	Such third parties would be able to discover, identify and deploy innovative means to disrupt capitalist circulation, and they could learn and transform into effective social change agents. In other words, social change agents would have to be creatively endowed – that is, able to find and employ creative means to effectuate the goals of the social change agent. In other words, social change agents would also have to be autonomous. That last point is a race to the bottom. 	The early</text>

By the logic of global circulation – the inevitable outcome of historical revolutions – the production of commodities and the transacting parties to those commodities would all be subsumed under the heading of the ‘transacting parties’ of global communication, commerce and exchange. Trade routes and transacting parties would be replaced by one hundred-person union of designers, entrepreneurs and community organizers. And since when have those kinds of parties been abundant? They would all be called ‘global cities’, since there would be no choice but to collude in the celebration of a given artefact. 	But since when</text>

The idea of the ‘cumulative effect’ that characterises the system is central to the idea of social revolution. It’s why so many revolutions in the modern world happened at the end of the 19th century, and why ecological catastrophes today are a by-product of capitalism. It’s why in times of crisis, governments around the world pour huge sums of money into anti-cyclical programmes – to ward off disaster, to delay or prevent it becoming entrenched, to adapt to changing circumstances, etc. – while ignoring the enormous amounts of waste, violence and poverty that inevitably result from such crises.

The machinery that creates the finished article is too complex to be applied to the raw materials, and the finished article is too fragile to be reused.

But there’s another, more subtle, way of looking at the interconnectedness of production and consumption. That comes from the Latour Declaration, adopted by the International Trade Union Confederation in 1925. It reads: ‘Workers of the world unite!’ It declares that the production of commodities and the circulation of money are governed by 'cumulative effect' – the tendency towards an underlying pattern of repetition – and ends with an exhortation to all workers to follow in the tradition of Peter Mill and W. E. B. Du Bois.1  Mill and Du Bois were the nineteenth and twentieth founding fathers of post-Impressionist art. Mill and Du Bois were both Jewish artists who came to Paris as cultural anthropologists. Their ideas of cumulative effect run counter to the prevailing anthropological tendency towards an underlying pattern of development.2  Mill and Du Bois were both artists working in concert, but their artistic interests diverged in important ways. Mill was a photographer while Du Bois was an artist working in a museum. Assembled largely of artists, the ITCC was established in 1926, and its mission was to bring artists together in order to explore the symbolic value of art and art history. Mill was an avant garde artist, while Du Bois was a composer who also happened to be a prolific poet. The two artists weren’t always on the same</text>

That’s not to say that there’s only one way to work – there’s a multi-generational society of exchange that needs to be addressed – but there’s an imbalance between the places where people come from and places where they put their stuff. That comes from the term ‘circulation’, but is also an indication of what’s expected of them. It describes the amount of stuff put out there in circulation, and how that compares to what’s actually in the environment. 	And what does ‘circulation’ mean? Well, when we talk about the production of commodities and the transfer of value, we usually mean the process of goods and services being produced, including manufacturing and transporting.

The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the future. It is a question that both  	can we afford and cannot afford. The former is a problem for the city, the latter threatens its very existence. This is a very timely question, coming as it does on the heels of another biennale that is set to arrive in the city: the 20th Biennale of Sydney. These changes in the cultural composition of the biennale have often been subverted by the artists and their organisations who have found new venues or found new ways to engage with their audiences. The question is, will our biennial be subverted by the people who come to see it? Will it be fed by the people who come to see it? Will it be a ‘subversion’ by its own self? Writing recently on the occasion of the 20th Biennale of Sydney, Francis Arterton emphasised the way in which biennials are often used as a way of penetrating cultural boundaries: biennials</text>

It is a wave that is expected to crest somewhere between nineteenth- and twentieth-century levels, and which will continue to be fuelled by it. The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the years to come. The answer, as always, is a complex set of cultural, economic, material and technological factors. One can only speculate as to what kind of politics, economic and urban changes, though, in the years to come will make it possible for artists to create artistic equivalents of car interiors and public art campaigns, in which case the biennial would be a kind of corporation, just as biennials have become cultural intermediaries between artist and public, public and contemporary audiences. Biennials have become essential for the financial survival of cities, and are expected to be back by the end of this century, just as contemporary art is expected to become. However, in the intervening years, curatorial practice has morphed into what is being called ‘curatorial precision’, and contemporary art has come to occupy a kind of pre-eminent place. Therefore, it is interesting to me, as a contemporary artist, to be invited to present a work that was made with</text>

The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the coming years. This is a complex task that no one knows how to start, nor can anyone put into motion. The artworld cannot simply be handed a list of curatorial priorities and told to behave itself; nor can it happen automatically. The artworld has to be taken on board, and programmed; and the important points of entry and exit have to be planned carefully. A number of biennials have now merged with one another, and others have gone through several rounds of reorganisation. What is now a biennial needs to be considered in the wider context of contemporary art and art history, and a public must be recruited to engage with the art in the relevant context. Deeper cuts are also needed, as biennials now represent a regular feature of a city for years to come, and are often used as a tool of the mega-exhibitionaires and their mega-collaborators. The question remains, what is the art ever made nowadays that will stand in for</text>

The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the coming years. The answer may lie in the curatorial turn itself. This is a question that may have more connection to the twentieth century than to the twentieth century. It is a kind of time warp that demands that we grapple with issues that were not central to the culture of the twentieth century, and which may render the twentieth century redundant in the pursuit of new forms of social organisation. In other words, it is the culture of the participation, not the culture of the participants.It is a question that may have more connection to the twentieth century than to the twentieth century.

The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the coming years.My answer is that we need to create what can be called an itinerary. It’s a curatorial gesture that draws us towards places rather than towards a destination. It establishes a distance between ourselves and the place we are visiting. It allows us to step back and take in the whole picture. That’s why so many biennials are now set in countries: because the art institutions in the country are so hooked on the city and urbanisation that’s happening, and they’re drawn to the real estate development that’s happening in the country, and also by the ‘bang’ of the ‘bang’ of the tourism industry. And so, cities are coming to represent a larger cultural mix of things.That’s a long way from the way in which the biennial was originally conceived. In the nineteenth century, the biennial was mainly a winter one, with a peak in March. The Hippod</text>

It is a wave that is expected to crest somewhere between nineteenth- and twentieth-century levels, and which will continue to be fuelled by it. The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the future. This is a difficult connect, in part because of the shifting, contextualised forms of the contemporary artist-public, and in part because most people do not yet have a conceptual understanding of the contemporary artist-public. But the answer is a complex one, and a complex set of reasons. The first reason is that the contemporary artist-public is increasingly mediated and automated; it has become the object of institutionalised creativity and is thus expected to be self-organising and self-generating. The second reason is that the contemporary artist-public is increasingly defined by its exchange with other artists and institutions. Curated events are expected to be places where exchange takes place, and so the biennial is expected to be a place where exchange takes place. But what exactly is meant by this term? Is it only intended to designate places where things are exchanged? Is it only intended to point to an entity or a point of exchange? Is it only meant to be a point of exchange? If</text>

The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the coming years. The answer may lie in the curatorial turn itself. It began when Carolee King realised that when she went to the eighteenth-century Dutch and German Renaissance biennials that she could not find any artworks by the artists she was meeting, and that there was no doubt that those who visited the biennials were there to be entertained, not to engage with art. So she organised a series of performances of works by artists from the respective eras that were set to be shown in the new Architecture studio, a space reserved for architects only. These were then organized in parallel with a day-long ritual for the architecture of the city, entitled ‘The One Show’, that was then staged in the German quarter of Amsterdam, in partnership with the city council. Among the artists chosen for the symbolic and symbolic-looking buildings were Guenther Moholy-Nagy, Ingmar Hall, Werner</text>

The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the coming years.Does the biennial have a curatorial future? It is true that today almost any biennial can be found in a city, and is the case for most types of biennials. However, the curatorial turn comes with a price, and the curatorial price is rising. In the twentieth century, the biennial was an item, and the curatorial slot was a market share holder. Today, the biennial is an event, and the market share is a specialized kind of event. In an art biennial, the curatorial turn is the last marginal element, and the market is the main event. It is the curatorial turn that is curative, and the curatorial market turns that phenomenon into a selling point. The curatorial turn is the last word on curatorial priorities, and curatorial interventions are the most visible form of that word. It is the intervention that holds the art market together, but it is also the last word on what is and is</text>

The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the future. At the moment, the answer is: in most cities, thanks to the mass tourism of biennials, and in some cities - thanks to a few curators, curators, artists and others - thanks to a city council and a masterplan. In an ideal world, the biennial would have a policy of connecting art and people, and perhaps an institutional interest in doing so. However, its current policy of the city is such that the biennial is often subconsciously set in motion through its financial activities, and often finds itself pulled into those activities through its participation in regional, national and international fairs, exhibitions and trade fairs. In an ideal world, the biennial would offer a diverse range of works from different places, and might even commission works from other biennials. However, due to the economic nature of the biennial industry, and the city’s chronic funding shortfalls, this has never been possible. In the twenty-first century, we</text>

It is a wave that is expected to crest somewhere between nineteenth- and twentieth-century levels, and which will continue to be fuelled by it. The question is how to connect the artworks to the people who are set to inhabit those spaces in the coming years. The curatorial turn, which I suggested was part of a broader curatorial agenda, is now predominantly about the cultural workers and artists who are set to arrive in the next several years. This opens up wider avenues of cultural exchange, including those relating to the undocumented, those with disabilities, the urban and suburbanised and those who are members of migrant communities. The question of where those borders are and who has jurisdiction over them has become a focal point of contention between the federal government and the states, cities and rural areas. In an attempt to address this, in 2014, the Mexican border was militarised and renamed the Arizona–Sonora border. The following year, the US Supreme Court ruled in favour of the US government, ruling that the US government may forcibly remove foreigners suspected to be in the country illegally. The decision set a precedent that allowed for the prosecution of those suspected of being in the country illegally, regardless of who they are or where they are from. While the 2017 decision</text>

When I used to do these things, I’d always do them as an artist, and then say, ‘That was an experience; that was an idea.’ But that’s not what artist-centred projects do. That’s more like architect-centred projects. The artist is supposed to come along and take things on her or his own. So the architect has to guide the project in a certain way, and the other people have to join in too. The same projects, by the way, can have very different aims. The urbanist dream is that we would all work together to make the city a beautiful place, and then share in that process through our projects. But the reality is that’s not always how things turn out. Sometimes the projects that we commission are supposed to be awe-inspiring in their</text>

They would be working side by side with people who had been involved in the original planning stages of the Palace Project, and they would be using the funds from that project to build a new community of artists, designers and architects. They would also be using the funds from the new £400 million arts centre being built in to the city, which will also have a community element, through a partnership between the Arts Council and the DfE, to create a new arts venue with a community of artists, designers and architects.

And maybe that was their intention all along: this project has allowed them to be part of a much larger narrative, which is now fully constructed and unfolding before their eyes.When the Museum of Modern Art opened its doors in 1884, it was a monument to the postmodern, postindustrial society that had recently emerged out of the quagmire of the Great Depression. In many ways, the museum was symptomatic of the way in which the economy was affected by the war – it’s no exaggeration to say that the building of the museum was a function of the stock market in the wake of the crash – but the museum itself was an expression of the new normalisation of the economy. It was a place where we were expected to accept this as a given, as a given. And so it remained until very recently, exhibiting the works of very few artists at the time – Norman Stone, Clive Owen, David Hockney, to name only a few. It still represents the modern museum</text>

And if that doesn’t feel right, well, that might happen somewhere else in the city, but for the moment, at least, the fact that this is happening in the heart of the city that’s hosting the Olympics gives us a different perspective than if we just happened to be born in the Olympic village. Because now we’re thinking about the infrastructure of the city: what are we going to build on top of what’s already there? For some people, that might mean thinking about the infrastructure of the transport network, because that’s where a lot of journeys are made. For example, the number of trains per day in the London subway is controlled by the number of seats available on the train, and the size of the carriages, and the layout of stations. So thinking about the infrastructure that makes up the London transport network might make us feel a little bit better about the way that it’s constructed, but it’s also part</text>

    subsequent iterative processing by machines is inevitable; but it is also the case that, in the past, such processing was done at a much faster pace by human beings. Consider, for example, the way in which self-healing porcelain is made: first the molten lead is purified, then the molten aluminium is cooled to absolute zero, and finally the liquid copper is poured into a trough made of graphite to produce a smooth coat of the underlying rock. As a rough approximation of the processes that create stained concrete, this process produces impervious concrete – hard ceramics that stick to the underlying rock – that is both strong and flexible. Such engineering follows two other processes first described in the late 19th century by British geologist Thomas Allsen: the process of passive diffusion and the passive crystallisation of aluminium.

Allsen developed these ideas into popularised science, but the mechanisms by which these materials achieve this miraculous behaviour are now widely understood. Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of hexagonal honeycomb patterns by which the molten lead could be condensed to form a thick sheet, then run through a pressurised hydrothermal vent that poured molten lead into a vertical tube that fed molten aluminium into a cycle of alternating current (AC) power. The hydrothermal vent then rapidly cooled the concrete to give it high tensile strength – enough to engage the active moulds in the exposed rock. Allsen realised a long time later that this works exactly like the way that lead in paint is compressed to produce a hard ceramic material that is both malleable and malleable‐in its chemical structure. As lead is compressed, it can either bond to the exposed rock or it can't, which creates a cracking surface that allows free movement of material across the surface. As a by‐product of this passive diffusion, Allsen showed how the properties of aluminium can be altered by adding lithium or other elements to the vent pipe. In the form of a film,</text>

Allsen developed these ideas into popularised science, but the mechanisms by which these materials achieve this miraculous behaviour are now widely understood. Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of boron nitride – a highly reactive form of aluminium oxide – from the reaction of water with the metal. A reaction that both destroys the material and releases the metal is now widely used to synthesise silicon, the backbone of computers, electronic components and much more. Allsen’s second proposal in 1899 calls for the active formation of silicon from the reaction of water with the element graphite. A process that simultaneously destroys the material and releases the element – in this case, silicon – is now widely used to make boron nitride from the waste product of the manufacturing of leaded petrol – a process that simultaneously consumes oil and produces silicon – a process that both consumes and produces boron nitride. Allsen’s third and final proposal in 1902 calls for the active formation of aluminium from the reaction of water with the element aluminium.

Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of a waterproof coating on alloys that reacted with water to form aluminium alloys that could be used as building material. Later that year, a second proposal, this time from the American geologist Ernest J. Zeman, outlined a similar idea in more detail. Working in concert, Allsen and Zeman realised that the world could be made much more efficiently by understanding how materials move through their environments. By this, Allsen meant that the collective properties of the materials – their structure, chemical composition, electrical charge and gravitational attraction – could be measured and understood. Alloys with properties similar to those of concrete could then be made that could be bonded to each other using microscopic lignin bridges that transferred the properties of the cement to those of the organic materials. Alloys that reacted with water to form aluminium alloys that could be used as building material would also gain the property of bonding to one another, since they are made up of similar building-sized chunks of material that readily bond</text>

Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of fire by mixing molten lead with cold aluminium to form a highly flammable solid called Alclad. Later that year, a team led by Peter Weibel proposed the active formation of magnesium hydroxide in a concentrated hydrocarbon solution in order to pave a small diameter road in the British Midlands. In retrospect, these proposals may have been more interested in the creation of a buzzword than a viable transport option for the region during the early 1900s.  Whether active or passive diffusion is the correct translation of the geological term ‘pouring bile into a chisel or chisel into a brick’, as Allsen put it, or rock into clay’, as the Romans had it. Our own Denis Hartosh ‘discovers a Titan’s tail on Mars’, but there was a reason for that.

Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the synthesis of silver nitrate from seawater and water by reacting seawater with formaldehyde – a reaction that day became known as the Allsen-Golding reaction. Allsen and his colleagues did not have the engineering or nuclear expertise to pull this off, but they did have a collaborator in the Department of Chemical Industry, which was headed by John Graham Kerr. Known as ‘the Father of Solid Mineral Chemistry’, Kerr was a Scottish biologist who established a department within the Royal College of Surgeons, where his work eventually won him a knighthood. Kerr developed a number of novel biological and chemical approaches to dealing with impurities, among them the use of hydroxynonenal, a preservative developed in Scotland that was later licensed to BASF, the UK’s largest chemical company. Using this preservative, which is incorporated in the cement that holds the bricks together, the cement is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which are then used as a</text>

Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of a waterproof epoxy resin that bond with any substance and so provide a physical counterpart to the liquid lead. The idea was that when the epoxy resin was poured onto concrete it bonded to the surface of the concrete and so acted as a sponge, absorbing the liquid lead and allowing the two to mechanically interact. As a rough approximation of what this might mean in the real world, take a look at the way in which some buildings are made from concrete taken out of existing developments. A similar active, yet more destructive reaction could be imagined here, but this time the aim is to bond concrete to the underlying rock and thus act as a sponge, absorbing liquid and solid lead and thus cleaning up the mess.  And here we see another example of an idealised process: the way in which lead is extracted from the rock. The active ingredient in lead is naphthalene, a component that gives the concrete its structural integrity, and the process of extracting it involves blasting part of the shale</text>

Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of fire retardant material by wetting the rocks with molten lead. Later that year, a team led by Owen Hartley of the U.S. Army proposed the active formation of aluminium in a similar way that water, water vapour and air combine to form a solid – Al·(111)Fe2O•24H2O•24SiO•24Pb•24Cl3•24O•24Ch.2O•24Fe2O•24H2O•24SiO•24Pb•24Cl3•24O•24Ch.2O•24Fe2O•24H2O•4Ss,5(14)Fe2+,6(13)Fe2+,7(14)Fe2+,8(14)Fe2+,9(14)Fe2+,10(15)Fe2+,11(16)Fe2+,12(17)Fe2+,13(18)Fe2</text>

Allsen developed these ideas into popularised science, but the mechanisms by which these materials achieve this miraculous behaviour are now widely understood. Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of a waterproof epoxy resin that bond to both water and rock at high temperatures. The idea was that this active polymer structure, when combined with a waterproof material with a high electrical conductivity, would permit the rapid crystalisation of aluminium using a chemical reaction. Allsen's second proposal in 1896, using a simpler form of the reaction, came up with the brilliant idea of the &quot;active&quot; molecule existing in a liquid form rather than a solid form. This meant that the liquid polymer – which was itself a double bond – could expand and contract according to its temperature, much like a liquid and solid polymer. At these high temperatures and pressures, the liquid polymer and its bonded components happily fuse together to make new aluminium, which is then bonded to a substrate of graphite and aluminium all at extremely low pressures. This form of the reaction allows the emergence of new aluminium using all available chemical energy, yet it also enables the emergence of bond-forming materials through the catalytic arms of the reaction</text>

Allsen developed these ideas into popularised science, but the mechanisms by which these materials achieve this miraculous behaviour are now widely understood. Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of waterproof cement by the combination of sand and water.[1] Since that time, numerous other scientists and engineers have sought to develop similar theories of how materials can bond. Most of these have focused on the properties of specific elements, but Allsen’s contribution calls into question the notion that the underlying rock is solid and immovable. As a fluid, the underlying rock is subject to dynamic forces – heat, pressure, friction etc. – that can alter its shape and cause it to deform. Allsen proposes a third, more fundamental force that binds all rocks together: the pull of gravity. Allsen’s third process proposes that concrete should be able to break free of its bonds by breaking alectric crystals in the underlying rock. Alectric crystals are structures on the surface of rocks that transfer energy in the form of electricity – either directly through electricity generating material (as in the case of concrete), or indirectly through the aggregation of electrically charged material within the crystal latt</text>

Allsen’s first proposal in 1887 called for the active formation of fire retardants using molten lead as a catalyst. Later that year, Ignatz launched the active development of polyurethane, a solid polymer that bonds to aluminium hydroxide in a similar way to how water and air bond to one another. By this stage, lead had become scarce, so engineers in the nascent US were developing alternatives to the brittle aluminium that existed in the past. The active formation of fire retardants using molten lead as a catalyst was a step in the direction of more widespread deployment of this potentially more destructive material. By 1914, US and British authorities had jointly developed the Joint Project Office (JP) to jointly police the development of nuclear weapons. At this time, the substance that made up the basis of Joint Project Office ­– – was becoming increasingly clear: the liquid fluoride that was being investigated by Nobel Laureate chemist Joseph Priestley for his work on lead in drinking water was also being used to form a strong, highly conductive material that bonded</text>

In other words, the institution’s role is to educate and lead, not to dominate or take over.  	The end result is that the workshop or seminar is more likely to be a success if it is multidisciplinary and inclusive. Many different kinds of people come to the same events, and different kinds of people have different kinds of skill sets or knowledge bases. The kinds of training and interaction that are possible through the structured exchange of different kinds of people are limited. It is the opposite of what the anarchist ideal is about. If we take the example of a Community Land Trust, which is a kind of NGO that is allowed to be anywhere in the country, but also trains people to be land guardians and helps other people’s land, and which has a legal capacity in this country, then that ends up being a kind of institutional mission. It ends up being a kind of political mission. 	Similarly, a workshop or seminar can end up being multidisciplinary and inclusive, in part because the participants have agreed frameworks within which to work. But those frameworks also tend to be demand-side, and so as the number of participants in a given situation grows, the institutional capacity to deliver (including through legal means) diminishes. A workshop or seminar can end up being multidisciplinary and inclusive, in part because of the number of participants, but also because of the kinds of skills acquired through that process. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the Community Land</text>

The kinds of training and interaction that are possible through the structured exchange of different kinds of people are limited. It is the opposite of what the anarchist ideal is about. So how can the anarchist tradition inform our practice? In my experience, the answer is complex, but ultimately, the answer is the same: we need to enable as many people to participate in the same way as possible. If the institution cannot or does not want to engage with the practice of its members, then it cannot or does not want to support the arts or education in the way that the community would like to see it. And as anarchists, we know that supporting the arts is important to supporting our own practice, not just for ourselves but also for our friends and comrades: because if we don’t engage with the ways in which our art is made and experienced, then our art is made in a different way and our relationships to it are weakened. Art is a shared and complex act of sharing. It’s up to the public to be able to understand and appreciate that sharing. 	The ability to understand and appreciate that sharing comes</text>

It is the opposite of what the anarchist ideal of the ‘full equality of opportunity’ entails. For instance, women who work in technology may have access to skills and knowledge that are useful for a technical job, but they are not necessarily empowered by the technology to engage in creative or dynamic work that is not constrained by the institution or office of the producer. New technologies empower people with technical know-how and knowledge, but they also empower people with social skills and knowledge, including people with a range of different kinds of expertise and knowledge. 	One example of how the capacity of large institutions to educate and empower diverse kinds of people is seen at Liverpool John Moores University (Liverpool’s Industrial and Cultural Centre is a division of the university). An MA in Art History was jointly conferred upon four artists selected through a multi-award-winning postgraduate programme at the centre: Sonja Kuftinek, Suzanne Carbone and myself, and on the recommendation of a curator.</text>

One could seek to undo the institutionalised hierarchies of power in the form of legislation or promote direct action, but such initiatives are always at best opportunistic and at worst oppressive. The institutions that legitimise and support them are already deeply ingrained, and their continued existence depends on long-term environmental and social conditions. So what can we do instead? 	There are a number of practices and practices that are likely to become more prevalent in the near future that can significantly reduce the impact of human-generated greenhouse gases:</text>

The kinds of training and interaction that are possible through the structured exchange of different kinds of people are limited. It is the opposite of what one would hope for in a project proposal from a new medium-sized institution. 	Therefore, the institute’s role is two-fold: (1) to offer engaging and educational opportunities to people in the city, and (2) to monitor and improve the city in various ways. 	The first part of this role requires that the city be regulated in various ways. The second part requires that the city achieve certain kinds of outcomes in the form of policy or legislation. 	The principal obstacle to achieving these outcomes in Vancouver is the inefficiency and arbitrariness of the municipal government. The city is divided into wards, subdivisions or areas within the larger municipality. Each ward or sub-district has a council of councillors elected by the residents of the ward or sub-district. These councillors have a set of rights and responsibilities that differ from one ward to another. For example, the ward with the most votes at the municipal level in an election may create</text>

It is the opposite of what the anarchist ideal of free association would want to foster. 	[9] One example of this is found in the production of biennials. The idea of the biennial as a producer of education came up during the 1990s and early 2000s. The idea of the biennial as a facilitator of exchange and exchange between different kinds of people came up in a number of different contexts (including in the context of the Biennale itself) during this time. In the UK, the Biennale commissioned a number of artists to commission work around the themes of the biennale, and over the years the artist-run commission has produced many works around the themes of exchange and community. The catalogue that accompanies each work from the commission has a short bio of the artist, a brief statement of the exchange, and sometimes a comment on the exchange.

[2] The question of whether there is a universal biological connection between art and culture has long been a source of contention. Much has been made of the increase in stature (and wealth) of artists producing in the context of a socially engaged, culturally engaged, socially conscious or ‘reactive' art practice as a direct result of an increased body of scholarly literature on the topic. This has been attributed to the increased access to resources within the art world and contemporary culture as a whole. More is now known about the evolutionary processes that foster stature and the mechanisms by which it is produced. However, it is important to bear in mind that the biennial form has always been a response to a specific historical and social situation and that its emergence was a response to a specific economic and political condition. As a social and political condition, the biennial form is structurally opposed to the fixed or predictable development of the art world.  [</text>

The Biennale’s 1990 financial model clearly foresaw a reduction in numbers, with the pavilion and its hosting institutions either closing or in various ways reduced to rubble. The Biennale’s 1993 purchase of the Biennalee included a commitment to a permanent, fully funded, fully conserved version of the Biennalee that would be run as a ‘public trust’.1 	The Biennalee has always been a socially engaged organisation. Its early role in the city was as a tourist attraction, and later, when it began to provide a platform for artists and curators, who could then choose to repurpose the building or retain its character. The Biennalee’s tenth edition was no doubt driven by the same social-cultural values that had driven the previous two, as well as the fact that the organisation now housed within its own venue, the La Scala,</text>

In the 1990s, it was theÂ Nostalgia Critic, in a lengthy 1993 review, who pointed out how little Venice resembled the Italian city of New York and how much New York resembled Venice. And the relationship between the Biennale and the emerging tourism industry was a pivotal juncture in the development of the city. The Biennale had helped to popularise Venice as a tourist destination, and the emergence of the tour industry meant that the city’s medieval heritage tourism business was globalised. The Biennale, in other words, took a back seat in the transition to tourism, and the emergence of a new kind of ‘value added’ by way of the tour.  	The key to the success of the Biennale in the 1990s was its intensive public relations campaign, run by PR firm, WPP, headed by Giuseppe Marroccio.

In the 1990s, Venice became synonymous with excess, but in recent years it has been on a very different path.

The Biennale has played a vital role in shifting the Biennale’s funding stream, thanks to its high profile, sustained public programmes, and its involvement in the Biennale itself.   	Re-purposing Venice: The Biennale as a Public-Private-Partnership 	The Biennale has always had a critical eye on what it referred to as the ‘zeal of the curf’, and in that sense the Biennale has a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has a very visible and controllable hand, and on the other, it has no sword. The Biennale has always been aware of its public status and its place in the city, and in this sense the pavilion, the buildings and the traffic jam are real concerns of the city. The Biennale’s output, its programming, and the level of involvement it provides in the city, and its financial commitments, are tangible and can be counted. 	But the real drama of the Biennale has always been its network of artists, curators, organisers and other stakeholders, and how they engage with the city – with its traffic jams, its cinema-theater complexes, its cafes and bars, and its nightlife – in ways that create and amplify stories. The real art has always been</text>

The Biennale’s funding stream has always been a fraction of what it is in 2017, and while the Biennale’s staff of twenty thousand people do not represent a significant increase in the overall population of the city, their constant and frenetic updating of the programme, its themes, and the themes themselves, is testament to the increasing numbers in and around the Biennale site. The increasing numbers of people visiting the Italian pavilion, and the fact that, during the Biennale’s first ten years in Venice, the pavilion hosted more than twenty-five,000 people, is testament to the fact that, despite the constant stream of visitors, the building was awash in tourists. The fact that, in 2017, the Biennale occupies its former Venetian warehouse space in the heart</text>

As Venetian, Italian and American art collectors, we understood that the Biennale must develop a long-term vision in order to function in the city. The Biennale’s proposal and eventual funding of the Giardini was a turning point in the Biennale’s trajectory, as it shifted art collectors from the periphery of the city to the center, and vice versa. 	In 1990, the Biennale was able to mobilise the resources of the Biennalee, SA and the entire Italian art world to commission a major renovation of the Giardini. The project was given the official French title of L’apparence à Venice (the City of Venice), and the Italian title of ‘acce</text>

This was evident in the 1990 Venice Biennale, when the Biennale board decided that the building of the Giardini created a new narrative around the Biennale, one that could not be accommodated in the old, traditional form. Therefore, the Biennale board decided in 1992 to decommission the pavilion and move the exhibition to a smaller venue in the Arsenale, a decision that was supported by both the local and regional governments.8 This move put an end to the Biennale’s traditional episodic structure, which was punctured by critical narratives about the neighborhood around the Biennale. Instead of building on the biennale’s critical pedagogical potential, the decision to relocate the exhibition allowed the Biennale to expand its usual episodic location in the Arsenale, spreading the narrative of the neighborhood beyond the walls and showing an expanded version of the</text>

The Biennale’s spectacular opulence (no matter how it is produced and consumed) demands a great deal of energy, and as a result the building that it occupies consumes a great deal of energy too. 	The Biennale has always been committed to conserving and regenerating the city in a sustainable way, and in recent years it has accelerated this commitment by creating cooperative associations – ‘City Future Cities?’ – that are able to devote substantial resources to research and conservation while maintaining a high standard of aesthetic standardisation. A good example of this is the project ‘Curtains’, a collaboration with architects Damphong Hong and Winnie Chun Kang that was exhibited in the Taipei Museum of Architectural Art until 2014. The project, which involved the collaboration of over 20 partner organisations, sought to develop innovative ways of encir</text>

In an age of images of decadence and excess, the Biennale’s focus has been particularly marked, as in its 1997 decision to donate one of its venues to a residential neighbourhood in the Italian neighborhood of San Giacomo. In this case, the neighbourhood was the artist Michele Landa Rossetti, whose work is housed in two separate buildings on the same block. Rossetti was advised by her lawyers not to proceed with the project, but she continued to produce opulent representations of herself in a neglected space. Her 1987 book   	Need for Speed 	and her 1987 film  	Re-Purposing Venice 	present a sweeping portrait of modern urban decay, drawing on documents from the US Justice Department and the Italian government. She describes the anger and frustration of the local residents as well as the criticism of a US ambassador, who was dismissive and criticised the project as Italian and Americanist in character,</text>

And, of course, the Biennale itself has a long-term ecological and geo-political interest in not being consumed by other art forms.

With the financial support of the Biennale, the Biennale commissioned a number of artists to produce works that reflected the city’s excesses. These were then incorporated into the proposal, which was then put on the public register, allowing the public to weigh in on the proposals. The proposal was viewed favourably by the authorities, who saw an opportunity to make a statement about the city at a regional level. The Biennale’s 1996 General Audience Survey, for the region’s largest-circulation paper, the San Marzio Partagazioni, reveals an interesting anomaly: whilst the Biennale was producing an enormous amount of negative feedback about itself, the region was actually quite accepting of the art and the community aspects of the event. The paper’s authorship was firmly placed in the hands of Italian and Italian-American artists. In fact, the authorship seemed to</text>

For some, the decision to cancel seemed as though it were a mistake, whereas for others it was a decision that produced the strongest reaction from fans and stakeholders. While some felt that the festival was cynically designed to fail, for others it was a chance to finally get behind the art and engage with the place where your work was actually made. The response to the cancellation of the festival has left many artists feeling alienated and frustrated, and they are questioning whether this was the right decision. What would have been a chance to collaborate and connect with fans and engage with the place where your work was actually made has been curtailed. What has also been a limitation for some, and a source of conflict for others, is the fact that the Biennial has been able to dictate when or where art can be made, and how. While this is a place and an industry that has an agenda, it is a place and industry that must be regulated in some way. The fact that</text>

The decision to not engage with the project in a meaningful way comes from the same people who had been hired as cultural advisers for the area. The Biennial was created in 1986, so it is easy to understand the need to reset and experiment with new ways of doing things. In a way, the decision to create two distinct festivals in the same city is a natural outgrowth of the same processes and technologies that were being explored in the city at that time. It is a way to see and experience the city in a new way. In a way, the need to distinguish itself by name, category, or place is a natural extension of the need to categorize and describe. It is an attempt to articulate a shared meaning and purpose across the city in a way that is not confined to a defined set of relations and relations. It is a way to bring together diverse publics and casts of voices in a way that is</text>

It is the responsibility of the artist and organisation to engage the community in a different way, and while the artist and organisation may wish to do so, the fact remains that such action is the only way to truly engage the community. There is much more that one can do if the community is open to learning, and although the Biennial did engage with the site and time-use aspects of the situation, there is little that can be learned from such an encounter.

There is a sense that the city is still mired in the formation of the Big Ben project, and while it is true that the Biennial has since engaged in a series of activities around the building, it is also true that the council still owns the building and that it continues to allocate funds there. This is a situation that one would like to think the biennial would have been able to navigate, but there are limits to what can be done legislatively. The decision to cancel the event was made with the understanding that it would return in 2023, when plans for a new masterplan for the area begin to take shape. While the Biennial’s decision to return in 2023 is entirely within its rights, it does raise an important question: how much autonomy do artists have when it comes to the regeneration of their own situation? It is true that the Biennial had to obtain the permission of the local authority in order to bring activities in the</text>

The decision to cancel the event seems to have come as a surprise to a public that had been conditioned by the art institution’s habit of presenting new works and projects every two years. It is not clear what the Biennial expected or intended from its community-based programme. The festival was always meant to be a ‘time for reflection and occasion for collaboration’, and so it was left to artists, curators, artists’ unions and others to put together what little there was to respond to the event in a meaningful way. The result was a scattering of artist-initiated projects on the site of the event, and a general sense that the festival was becoming more of a gathering of people rather than an event involving art. At a minimum, this shifts the focus of our attention away from who is performing, and more towards what the community is capable of producing.

While there were undoubtedly times when the Biennial felt that it would have been better to engage in a ‘community-based’ way, the fact that this did not engage with the site-specificity of the situation or involved people from outside the museum through participatory methods seems odd in retrospect. How was the Biennial able to take part in a site-specific way through a process that involved not only the local people, but also the people coming through the museum system? How were the people being trained and how the museum was building its collection of objects in a particular way, while at the same time being trained as art workers? How was the museum system teaching its collection of objects in a way that would enable it to produce a collection that is not at odds with the political, economic and social situation in which it finds itself? How is the museum system building its own political, architectural and social imagination through a participatory process, while simultaneously being trained as art workers?These are questions that continue to plague the urban planner and urbanists of today, and they continue to amaze me that such questions are unanswered today.

How is it that the Biennial, with its own biennial coming up in 2017, was able to suspend the first edition of the Biennial while simultaneously embarking on a new ‘corporate cycle’ of art fairs, and ‘use its cultural capital’ by launching a new kind of ‘infrastructure development company?’ That seems rather rushed and capricious to me. The decision to reinstate the festival at a later date seems to have been driven by political, not just economic considerations. Is that fair to say? That is a difficult question to answer. I cannot say for sure, but given the political landscape of the city in 2017, it seems rather strange to me that the Biennial would have been able to engage in a community-based, collaborative way in the first place.

The fact that it was only ever ever going to be a biennial is testament to the fact that it was never going to be a ‘bigger’. It was always going to be a gathering of artists, curators, journalists and, until very recently, a venue for a very specific kind of community, which is why it is so rare for it to be a ‘community gallery’. It is, however, a venue for a kind of community to be formed through that interaction. And so the question becomes: where does the biennial place its community? Where does it find that kind of strength and that kind of capacity? In other words, where does the biennial come from, and why does it come? These are questions that the Biennial commissions and its members engage with, and which emerge as a consequence of their work:</text>

In the early twentieth century, the biennial became synonymous with the large contemporary art exhibition, and with a much wider sense of the transient and the ephemeral. In recent years, the biennial has been out of reach for most visitors, and the district has become a place of occasional surprise and ephemeral observation. But in the twenty-first century the biennial is everywhere, and has become more of a locus of permanent exhibitionary form. The twenty-first biennial will most likely see many curators from many cities coming from all over the world to join an ever-expanding international curatorial cadre,</text>

The Federal Court dismissed these claims, concluding that Indigenous activists’ participation in the art movement was not a ‘political act’ within the meaning of the Criminal Code (at that time) and that Bruguera’s claim was genuine.10 Indeed, in the years since my first art publication, The Stranger, I have repeatedly stressed the fact that while I may share many aspects of Bruguera’s position, I do not agree with every one of his claims.11 For example, I do not agree with the way in which he characterises my involvement with RAW Art as follows:When RAW Art was started, there was a clear understanding that it would be collaborative, not partisan, with the Commission. The approach taken with the proposal to create a public domain around a particular location – the Indian Agent provocations, the theatrical release of historical records, and so forth – was a way to draw a</text>

The proposal is absurd on its face, and flies in the face of everything we have been taught by our legal scholars regarding the criminal law.As a result, a growing number of activists are intervening on the legal front to challenge the criminalisation of their political activity. In Melbourne, for example, local Indigenous activists initiated proceedings in the Federal Court challenging the criminalisation of their cultural practices. Conversely, in Sydney, the Federal Government responded by initiating proceedings against three local Indigenous activists who were conducting subsistence-related activities on behalf of the Royal Commission for the Arts. The first principal accused in these proceedings was Arnaldo Tonapi, a member of the Metiqetlan First Nation. The second accused was Francis Juan Bruguera, a member of the Luhya tribe. The third accused was Lula Lawal, a member of the Luhya tribe. The Federal Court dismissed all three's claims, ruling that Indigenous cultural practices fall outside the ambit of the law.[14]The impact of this ruling can be seen in the number of Indigenous suicide bombers between 2004 and 2010.[15] In that time, indigenous members of the Metiqetlan Nation alone claimed over 1,400 lives –more than the total number of deaths during the Napoleonic wars (590). The Luhya Nation claimed 700 lives, while the Kluane Nation claimed 507. Legal wrangling over the precise figures surrounding Indigenous death tolls in conflict zones around the globe continues to this day.Given these statistics and the fact that suicide is the leading cause of death for Indigenous Australians, it is unsurprising that in 2014, Australia became the first nation in the world to legalize the use of cannabis –a decision that many claim is contrary to the interests of the Indigenous people. It is also worth noting that in 2014, the federal government</text>

The Biennale was initially committed to exploring the full range of the resources of the Miraflores Valley, and eventually to a full scale replication of the project in the region. The timing of this shift is also indicative of the fact that in 2016, the law criminalised the participation of children in any manner in acts of cultural activity. It is common for biennials to undertake extensive replications of themselves in order to demonstrate the generational change inherent to the practice of art‑making. As the legal status of art grows more contentious, so too does the penetration of the art bench.In this new legal climate, the Biennale is forced to confront the question: what kind of legacy will art leave? Will the Miraflores Valley remain a largely silent desert, or</text>

The third accused was Lula Lawal, a member of the Lenca tribe. All three initially contested their cases in the High Court, which held that Tonapi was not responsible for what he or she did as a Member of the Council of a National Trust, and thus the National Trust did not possess the legal capacity to take such action. The High Court reversed this decision several times, until in 2012, when the High Court of Australia finally resolved the issue in favour of the Australian Government.12 The Commission acknowledges the importance of this periodical of historicity in its decision to revoke Tonapi and Bruguera’s status as Agents provokers. It is noteworthy that the Commission chose to do this rather than lodge criminal charges against either of the other two individuals, in part because they maintained that they had been subjected to a witch-hunting campaign by their own legal representatives, the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC), which had sought to delegitimise them as criminals.13 It is also noteworthy that the</text>

The third accused was Lula Lawal, a member of the Lenca people. The Federal Court found in favour of the Commonwealth, awarding Tonapi and Bruguera their statutory right to be heard independently. There was a great deal of media coverage of this, with articles in the major newspapers including one on the front page of the newspaper on Monday, 22 March 2008, headlined ‘Gang of Six'’, and featuring photographs of the defendants in prison uniforms. The article also featured an extended report from Simon Thomas, who was the Special Investigator for the Australian Crime Commission from 1993–99 and is now Research Chair at the Royal Commission for the Arts. That same week, 22 March 2008, I wrote a blog post on the RCA’s website headlined ‘Political Prisoners’, in which I described the 'Gang of Six' as a 'Cuban Coup d'état' in which the Australian and New Zealand Governments had both sought to use violent means to remove elected representatives from power.</text>

The Federal Court found in favour of the Commonwealth, awarding Tonapi and Bruguera $10 million in damages and ordering the restitution of cultural property. The Commission responded by filing an appeal in the Federal Court of which Tonapi was a co-counsel and Bruguera a co-counsel.  At the time, the case was being heard in the Federal Court of which Juan Bruguera was an admitted partner. Legal wrangling ensued over the scope of this Court's jurisdiction, with the Federal Court determining that the Tonapi and Bruguera cases were separate acts and concerned different classes of persons, whereas the Court of Appeal held that they were interrelated and had a common legal status. The Federal Court’s decisions effectively transferred the control of cultural property from the individual to the collective, thereby creating a new class of owners with rights that extended well beyond the borders of the Federal Government’s jurisdiction.</text>

I began collaborating with lawyers to try to get a sense of what the law might mean when it came to indigenous people.A friend pointed me to a Supreme Court case involving the Penañon people, in which Justice Harold Leach, while writing a separate decision from Leakey, recognised the historic relationship between the Penañon people and the oil industry. He recognised that the Penañon people were not alone in this historical relationship: &quot;the Penañon themselves were indeed historically tied to the production of oil from trees, even though they themselves considered the ecosystems to be their own rightful</text>

These individuals were charged with offences under the Indian Act which carry penalties of up to life in prison or a fine of up to US$50,000, or both. The actions taken against them were arbitrary and capricious, and appear to have been motivated by money over substance.Whatever one's position on those two occasions, one thing is certain: the criminalisation of political rhetoric has lost much of its potency in recent decades. Any action taken against a spokesperson of the federal government appears to be justified on the grounds that she publicly stated an intention to withdraw from the mainstream, whereas statements by Indigenous activists have increasingly placed her at odds with the establishment. In this sense, the actions taken against Tonapi and Bruguera and Lawal and Lula are neither new nor isolated, but point to a trend. The arrest and criminalisation of Indigenous activists has become so routine that it is almost commonplace for a spokesperson of the Australian Federal Police (AFP)</text>

The third accused was Lula Lawal, an Indigenous member of the Franciscan order.Over the course of these three decades, Indigenous people have often been able to gather around the narrative of an often-mocked-up 'tribe' of activists, lawyers, journalists and policymakers, each accused of being part of a different elite. In the 1980s and 1990s, the cadres of this narrative were often mobilised by the state to prosecute and incarcerate Indigenous people for political or religious offences. The growing numbers of non-status Indians among these communities lent these narratives additional force and resonance. Yet the state and federal governments that enacted these laws also enacted destructive or non-existent alternatives, which are now being actively challenged and replaced by precarious or free Native communities. These are the currents and trends shaping up to be the twenty-first century.Who Are We Rooting For?The Rio Grande Valley is one of the last places on Earth where the human settlement really begins to dominate the landscape.

The Federal Court dismissed all three Indigenous activists’ claims, ruling that Indigenous people do not fall outside the law no matter what the status of their ‘organisations’. Existing law criminalises acts motivated by a single, generalised theory of social change. Indigenous rights advocates and legal scholars alike have been urging the Court to strike down this provision as overly broad and to instead focus on specific acts of culpability, rather than on generalised theories of social change.In October 2016, the Court did just that. It upheld the substance of the 1996 Act, which extended the same rights to Indigenous Australians as non-Indigenous Australians. The Court held that the 1996 Act was substantially similar to the 1983 Act and the 1984 Act, which extended the same rights to Indigenous Australians, and that the 1996 Act did not ‘go beyond what the common law provides’. Existing law criminalises a number of very specific acts, but</text>

The story goes that, as part of its new £20 million Community Arts programme, Southwark Artspace invited the artist Meehan FitzPatrick, as part of a curatorial team, to develop a curatorial agenda for the programme. FitzPatrick had worked previously with the Southwark Artspace, where she worked with the community to develop a land trust and work in partnership with the local community. 	The land trust, Digital Art, is a creative writing workshop for artists and creative professionals based in the United Kingdom. It offers artists the opportunity to develop a project through writing, drawing, photography and sculpture on behalf of the community, in partnership with Southwark Council and Chirag Mansi Community Centre. The curatorial agenda for the programme is developed by the Arts Council, the Southwark Artspace and Southwark Education Trust, with input from the Deputy Chief Constable and Inspectors of Constabulary. 	The curatorial agenda for the programme invited artists to explore the political, economic and social contexts of their work, in an attempt to bring a critical viewpoint to the project.

But how to generate such wealth and dignity in the world market, which provides the fuel for so much cultural production, particularly in the US and Europe? Cultural production in the age of neoliberalism 	In recent years, cultural production has responded to a number of conditions, some of which are no longer favourable to artistic activity. The rise of global interconnectedness, connectedness and global communication networks, as well as the multiple forms of labour and the multiple bodies that play a part in it – labourato-politico-economic, anthropological and ethnographic – make it ever more necessary to be online, interconnected and globalised in all its aspects. And now, increasingly, it is inevitable that cultural practices will be generated and reproduced in all the various cities, all the various cultures, all the different languages and dialects that are part of the same world. In this context, a metainterface is a global phenomenon. In my opinion, the technological means are there to engage in ‘deep’ kinds of cultural processes, in all of these, with or without the</text>

It is the very being that creates and depends on such wealth and dignity. But how to generate such wealth and dignity in the world market, which provides the fuel for all cultural activity? Cultural capital does not come from the bottom up; it is produced by the very bottom up. And so we must demand, produce and develop from the bottom up. Art is production for the needs of the super-rich; the interests of global capital are aligned in such a way as to render the needs of the majority in many cases redundant. And so we mustn’t just produce culturally, but also in other ways. For example, we mustn’t allow our culture to become defined by the needs of the financial elite; they might want to buy a house, invest in art or start a business, but fundamentally they don’t need to. 	Such action by the financial elite is production for the needs of the capitalist market. It is production for the values of gentrification, which is the logic of the complex, but also for the values of accrual – in other words, of accumulation. And so we mustn�</text>

How to create such wealth and dignity in the name of environmental destruction? How to end the ecological crisis, which is increasingly (1) the business of the rich (2) of course also the business of the poor, of the non-conformists, of the non-human, of everything else? How to end the squandered potential of such wealth and dignity in the interest of capital itself?These are questions that continue to plague us, and which today are questions of (mainly financial) survival for some and (especially financial) shame for others. They are questions that demand answers, and those who pose such questions continue to find themselves trapped in contradictions and enmities, resentments and betrayals. And they are questions that render us powerless without ever achieving any clear and unequivocal answers. That is, of course, the trajectory of capital and culture today.

How to manage such resourcefulness when the global market for art products is awash with money and culture? How to allocate such wealth and dignity in ways that create social justice and promote sustainability? These are questions that continue to plague us in the world market, and they remain daunting to many artists and curators. 	One potential solution is the creation of nation-centred artworlds, successor to the flawed but beneficial European art fair or museum. Such venues would offer a counterweight to the strong regionalisms that are often attributed to the modern art market, but which rarely take root or are sustained for long in the region or city where the art is displayed. A such entity would offer a counterweight to the urban exaggeration and migrant flows of culture, largely because it would lack the character, the substance and the power to sustain such claims. 	Such institutions could establish a shared understanding and identity for the area, drawing artists and curators from the region –</text>

The globalised capitalist market places increasing demands on all concerned, including those at the margins, including those who are exploited and exploited. And as ever, the running of the race is on, and with it on the availability of labour, as capitalists look to expand their markets, to find the next big market. The race to fill cultural gaps, to cater to these ever-more-demanding customer groups, becomes ever more important. But what is the future for art and culture outside of the capitalist global market? What is the role of a creative community in such a world? For example, consider the potential of such resources in the world of urban renewal, which is increasingly defined by the needs of the market. The development of creative alternatives to the proliferation of buildings and concrete is essential in any attempt to regenerate the city, but what is increasingly seen as desirable is a reduced role for artists and a shift towards services and platforms that cater to the needs of large corporations.</text>

The problem with the cultural production of the modern economy is that the productive capacity of the economy is finite – the more things are made to meet consumers' wants and needs, the less can they compete in the long run against things made by human beings? The result is a massive sprawl of production everywhere – from the countryside to the cities – generating ever greater imbalances of global culture and diminishing returns for producers in the long run. As a result, we see increasing numbers of people fleeing the countryside, cities and developing economies in search of opportunities outside the big-box malls and the modern economy. And these are just the ones that show up every day. 	Every day new jobs are created outside the modern economy; but these don’t necessarily lead to improvements for workers or the environment. Robots are replacing workers in advanced industries, and as a consequence, we see increasing automation in non-white, lower-income groups. And of course, there are the</text>

Cultural capital is the shared understanding and adaptation of cultural practices, objects and objects of all kinds, across social, economic, political and spatial scales, across cultural zones, in all circumstances and with all modes of human agency. It encompasses all those things (cultures), that people ‘know’ (how to use them), and that people do with them (cultural practices, objects, practices, sites, people, places). It is the result of understanding (cultural practices), of objecthood (cultures), of agency (cultural practices), of knowledge gathering (cultures), and of making one’s place in cultural history (objects). Cultural capital is the very substance of artistic activity; it is what makes it art, what makes it cultural and artistic, and what makes it unique, valuable and beautiful. It is the very being that creates and depends on such wealth and dignity. But how to generate such wealth and dignity in the world market, which provides the fuel for so much cultural production, is an open question. And how to redistribute such wealth and dignity in a way that does not rely on the labour of millions of people in disempowered and impoverished nations is another question. 	Finally, what is the future for communities of artists, curators, writers and other cultural professionals? Many are asking themselves these questions. 	Is the future city, or future rural, or future urban? Are we more sensitive to the multiplicity of postindustrial cities, or are we more sensitive to the multiplicity of subcultures and subaltern cultural settings? Are we more sensitive to the urban/rural divide, or do we not see the need for cultural theorists and urbanists to be able to foresee and address this reality? Are we more sensitive to the needs of cities in times of crisis, or do we not see the need for cultural theorists and urbanists to be able to foresee and address this reality?

It is the very being that creates and depends on such wealth and dignity. But how to generate such wealth and dignity in the world market, which provides the fuel for technological progress and for the growth of ever more interconnected forms of cultural life, including for some professions – making ever greater use of social media and ever more information about ourselves and the world around us – yet leaves many citizens destitute? 	Art has a particular way of organising and concealing things, of making visible things that otherwise remain invisible or otherwise unspoken, or concealing from conscious awareness things that happen behind the scenes, in the public sphere, even when those things are economically profitable and even when those who direct artistic activity also happen to be clients or shareholders in media corporations, financial institutions, or other powerful socio-economic actors. The art of the social becomes accentuated through what Paul Domela calls ‘the art of invisibility’.[6] And yet, as we all know, even when art is making efforts to make its sphere of publices as invisible as possible, or at least not so visible that it is practically impossible to figure out who is involved,</text>

It is the very being that creates and depends on such wealth and dignity. But how to generate such wealth and dignity in the world market, which provides the fuel for this culture of abundance and cultural capital accumulation? 	One can ask, which economies would generate such massive amounts of culture and thereby support such massive numbers? The answer is obvious: economies of scale. More and more information is transmitted every day, signalling the value of every step of the way. In the age of mobile devices, blogs and Instagrams, the common denominator is everywhere; people want to be able to identify and consume cultural products and services. ‘Brand new’  	is a way of thinking about cultural production, its objects and processes, and the people who engage with them. To some extent, this is true; the rise of social media and the individual consumer in relation to less embedded forms of consumption is a form of what Deleuze and Guattari call ‘cultural capitalism’. It is a form of what Marx called ‘postmodernity’ with ‘new kinds of work’. 	But it is also</text>

But how to generate such wealth and dignity in the world market, which provides the fuel for so much cultural production, is a fundamentally different problem from how to use the cultural resources of the world (cultures) to address the challenges of our times.The technocrats of information technologies, cultural capture and social networking are everywhere visible in their eagerness to maximise the capacity of all modes of cultural production (media, publishing, trade, architecture). Yet there is much more going on that contributes to making art possible, and that is increasingly evident in the world’s cultures – cultural capital in its various forms, and its ever more pervasive and globalised forms of data-collecting, recording and transmitting.  	Art has become increasingly political in the age of the information superhighway, which is now the dominant form of cultural exchange worldwide. The information highway connects us not only with one another, but also with information that one might want to know, and for this reason some artists find themselves compelled to produce works that have as much relevance today as they did when they were</text>

The kinds of possibilities – imaginaries – that are not, today, reality. The kinds of possibilities that artists, curators and arts administrators everywhere strive to foster and facilitate. The kinds of imaginations that take root and evolve and change and become more and more fantastical as the situation requires it. 	What makes imagination possible in the first place is imagination in all its manifold forms – literal, figurative, pedagogical, artistic, political, intellectual, etc. – and this is why imagination is a powerful conceptual tool. Imagination enables us to comprehend; to be aware of and sensitive to the ways in which everyday life unfolds, in ways that are unimaginable to an outsider or to those with limited means. Imagination enables us to imagine things differently; to grasp the full range and richness of possibilities and complexity; to engage with the intricacies</text>

But, as I have been outlining, the  	potentialities of such a future city are limited in the ways that its inhabitants currently enjoy. In the ways that are possible within a given geographical area, access to which is controlled – in the prevailing neo-liberal order – – there is little, if any, room for such an area to innovate or create – beyond the narrow genres of goods, services, infrastructure and urban structures that are the result of the globalised capitalist modes of production. 	The aim of this book is to bring forward a set of priorities for the urbanisation of the world, in the form of ‘collectives’ of cities, that are as capable as any other of becoming self-supporting eco-systems. 	The book is divided into three parts. 	The first part presents the current political and legal uncertainty surrounding the urbanisation of the world, in the wake of the implosion of state and municipal institutions in many cities.

But, as I have been outlining, the  	potentialities of such a future city are very different from what we have today. Increasingly, they are seductive, not so much of the glamour and the money that comes with such visions as of the things that follow: the things that make us live differently, lead to better and more fulfilling lives choices, choices about how we engage with the material world, choices about urban environments and choices about how we use urban space. Such material alternatives are seductive, and yet so are alternatives that conflict with or are at odds with our current situation, choices about how to move forward, choices about how to inhabit and use space – choices that need to be lived in, not against.1 Radical Urban Futures: Towards a Post-Industrial Society by Achille Mbembe and Rob Kling,  	eds, Mutant Mice and the City, Zone Books, New York, 1996. 2 Tim R.

But, as I have been outlining, the  	potentialities of such a future city are limited today. The social, cultural and economic potentialities of such a future city will have to be found in the present, and the present is a social and cultural dead end. In the past, cultural tourism was a capitalising proposition, and now that it is a transitory phenomenon, its potentialities and exploitable spaces are limited. Cultural tourism today is about as real as it gets. The transport of cultural creativities is a post-hoc effect of the crisis of postmodernism, and the associated  	new economy of culture. The crisis of postmodernism is a crisis of the city, and cities are the places where the potentialities of cultural tourism are most completely realised – where the social, cultural and economic power of the city reside. 	But the cultural tourism that is generated by the post-Fordist capitalism of the present is different from the cultural tourism of postindustrial capitalism, and will have to confront new social,</text>

The social, economic and cultural  	potentialities of the present are deeply entwined, and the current period is no exception. The present as an object of contemplation and observation is a period of anxiety, political and economic entrenchment. 	But, as I have been outlining, the current period is not just a period of anxiety. The anxieties that we feel about the future, and the ways in which we are witnessing the anxieties of millions in many parts of the world, are anxieties that were, in part, provoked by the economic crisis and subsequent monetary policy of the United States, and its European and global integration. 	There are, I think, two ways of looking at the financial crisis and its affectations – historical and ontological. The historical and ontological approach takes into account of the ways in which the current period is the product of the crisis itself. </text>

But, as I have been outlining, the  	potentialities of such a future city are along the lines of what I would call a ‘second tier’ – places with a high potential of becoming rich and famous, but which nevertheless present some of the struggles and tensions of our contemporary urban environment. These are the cities with which I would begin to categorize those whose cultural assets are more suited to the industrial than the cultural desert. 	The fact that these urban environments are being increasingly populated means that the cultural resources of these cities are too often left to fend for themselves. 	What used to be called the cultural centre has become the physical landscape – a real city – of the privileged; a space, perhaps, of a privileged few inhabiting a city and its environs. But this doesn’t seem to be the case in many cities; in fact, the opposite is true: the poorer you are, the harder it is to move to the better city because of the stress and competition for space.

But, as I have been outlining, the  	potentialities of such a future city are indeed what give the city its character – its  	street-life, its  	indoors and its public realm. These qualities are qualities that are often ascribed to the achievements of postindustrial cities, but which are often denied and rendered as if those achievements never happened. In fact, postindustrial areas tend to get more political as the social costs of structural changes, capital intensive industries mount. During the 1980s and 1990s the financial crisis, which many in the city felt was ripped from them, was often cited as an achievement of the new urbanisation agenda. It’s now commonly cited as evidence that neighbourhoods are becoming more urbanised, though the extent to which this is due to the financial crisis is dubious. It is worth noting that postindustrial areas also tend to experience longer and more persistent recessions.

But, as I have been outlining, the  	potentialities of such a future city are necessarily limited. The social, political and cultural changes that can be made in the city without destroying its character as an urban centre are unlikely to be made in the city due to its remoteness and its size, which make it difficult to pack, move and change in the city without creating new problems. And, finally, the cultural and urban changes that can be made in the city due to its proximity to other major world cultures, but which remain largely outside the city due to its economic isolation, capital-intensive nature and dependence on imports, which makes it vulnerable to speculative capital and the speculative shocks that result from massive inflows of goods and people. 	Cities today are complex urban systems with varying degrees of connectivity, and the tendency is for the city to be embedded in other areas of the country or other locations. But, as the financial crash of 2008 showed, the consequences can be complex and uneven, and highly fragmented and unstable. The financial</text>

But, as I have been outlining, the  	potentialities of such a future city are uneven and insecure. The rich get richer and the poor increasingly desperate for any way to break even. Meanwhile, the cultural tourism industry is deeply fragmented and ill-served by the country’s economic  	recovery, largely because of the country’s economic malaise: chronic underinvestment in infrastructure, education and health infrastructure, and a general lack of investment in research and development that infuses new technology with new meaning and purpose. 	So, the cultural tourism industry has two parts: the marketing, and the promotion. The former catalyses major curatorial initiatives; the latter supports the development of indigeneous patrimony through the patronage of local artists and communities. 	There are of course other forms of cultural tourism – cultural tourism as a business, or cultural tourism as a distinct form of tourism – but they are few and far between in number and prominence. The dominant form of cultural tourism today is that</text>

The city is our primary location for the biennale – it remains so even when there are ecological or urban concerns. Therefore, the scope for bias in cultural weight is curtailed. The question is, then, what kinds of biases can the city sustain in order to create the kind of interface that artistically directs people to places and engages people? If the answer is ‘nothing’, then the city is unlikely to sustain the kind of cultural impact that the Biennale can. The city must actively engage itself in creating what it can be proud of – a reputation as a tourist destination, a cultural centre, a city, and so forth. But even if this is not a straightforward process of tourism promotion and public relations, it must engage with the city’s surface and interior landscape in order to create what Dezember calls ‘a new urban ecology’ through what she calls ‘infrastructure 21’</text>

This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the cultural tourism component of cultural tourism has become a dominant form of economic activity – but a fact of life in which the public is central and geopolitically positioned. For Venice, and for Venice as a cultural form in general, this means that it is now the responsibility of cultural institutions like the Biennale to become culturally responsive and take part in creating a new urban fabric that is not only aesthetically pleasing but is also a complete set of participatory activities capable of generating knowledge and engagement around the place. This is why the Biennale had to become geopolitically relevant in order to be able to engage with the city in ways that are not confined to the city’s core tourist traffic. It took the Biennale more than ever before to establish a reliable digital presence, and it is precisely because it is no longer a cultural institution that it can do this in such a way as to be able to tap into the biennale's resources in a way that is culturally responsive.

A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration how the biennale is becoming culturally mediated. This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the cultural tourism component of tourism is significant and cultural tourism is a multimodal market that contributes to the city’s economy and society. Cultural tourism is a widespread but relatively understudied industry that contributes to creating the perception and/or reality of cities (and cities only) in ways that directly or indirectly influence behaviour, consumption, or advocacy within the local communities that host the events. It is valued for its perceived relevance, its ability to create imaginaries, strategies and representations of places that are more like (or at least as accessible to) the real places, and its capacity to generate buzz and buzz-intelligent commerce among local consumers. Cultural tourism is a multimodal industry that generates significant financial resources for the city and its cultural institutions. Yet, it is primarily a tourism sectoral undertaking that produces only nominal economic returns to the city. Hence, cultural tourism events are often cited as evidence of cities’ economic potential, despite the fact that the likes of Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool Biennial 2 and</text>

Cultural tourism is a powerful form of economic self-congratulation. How the Biennale is Culturally MediatedOpening up access to the biennale is not just about getting good media coverage; it is also about how the media is programmed to report the news. Consider how the news is programmed. Programs are usually programmed to report the news as soon as possible following an event, or especially when there is a major event. This is why television news is still around in large numbers: people stick with programmes because they are told to by human resources. It is also why websites work on the web: people come to them because they are told to by human resources. The extent to which programming is programmed to report the news as soon as possible is a news-processing device.

A public realm strategy for the cityscape, then, must consider how to inhabit this newly discovered urban richness in ways that are not restricted to the city’s core tourist traffic.  A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration the fact that the Biennale is a cultural institution – a place where people gather to engage with art – and that this cultural engagement necessarily creates opportunities for artists to engage with people. In this sense, the Biennale is not just any cultural institution; it is culturally engaged and so it stands to reason that the Biennale will be culturally engaged as well.  A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration how the biennale is becoming culturally mediated. This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the cultural tourism component of tourism is a major part of the business model. Cultural tourism today entices people with extravagant packages that include cultural experiences in exchange for physical things – be they accommodations, trips to the art museum or a guided tour of the Biennale grounds. If the physical transport of cultural experiences is part of the equation, then the interaction between art and people becomes part of the public realm, perhaps even a part of the public realm mediated through art. If not all artists and curators in the biennale were trained in cultural theory, some professions (curators, arts administrators, arts titans) already subscribe to it and use it as a tool for their own ends. It is not a given that every curator and art administrator in the city would also be a culturally theorist, but there are some basic assumptions that need to be made. Most notably, who is a culturally theorist in this context? Who is culturally engaged? Who is culturally literate? Who is culturally equipped? Who is culturally plugged in</text>

A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration how the biennale is becoming culturally mediated. This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the cultural tourism component of tourism is a principal source of economic growth – but a fact of contemporary life in many cities. Cultural tourism is the ticket to riches for tourism officials and the like; it becomes a source of jobs and income generating opportunities that otherwise sit unused. It is an industry that depends on cultural tourism becoming mainstream and so it is imperative that the Biennale develop strategies for cultural tourism into the norm across the city. This may mean developing unique cultural tourism package deals with dominant tourist sectors, engaging more widely with emerging tourism narratives, and so forth.  In the current biennale climate, this may mean doing more to connect to the city than just participating in the city through what is legal and customary. But in the long run, the challenge for the Biennale as a cultural entity becomes one of increasing interchange between artists and audiences, of new kinds of consumption and so forth.  A public realm strategy for the biennale may also mean actively contributing to the urban fabric of the city in some way</text>

A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration how the biennale is becoming culturally mediated. This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the cultural tourism component of cultural tourism is strong. Art’s cultural capital is already cultural mediated – it arrives as text, image, sound or visual message via bus, plane or train. Making cultural tourism more culturally inclusive is a low priority for many artists. A public realm strategy for the biennale must therefore consider how the biennale is becoming culturally limited. This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the biennale component of cultural tourism is weak. Cultural tourism is a core business for many artists and a large proportion of the biennale is now done by the tourism arm of the arts organisation, the Biennale Foundation. Therefore, it is imperative that the Biennale be culturally diversified – both financially and demographically. The Biennale mustn’t be limited to a city-centred formula. Cultural tourism today is a global phenomenon and cities are its islands. Therefore, a public realm strategy for the Biennale that doesn�</text>

A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration how the biennale is becoming culturally mediated. This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the cultural tourism component of tourist traffic is a fact of life – but the reality of life in dense and redeveloping metropolises dominated by the financial, entertainment and media sectors. As a result, the biennale is experiencing an unprecedented level of commodification in its commercial form as well as in its cultural form, which is increasingly mediated through social media. The biennale has become the highest-value cultural commodity on the planet.  A public realm strategy for the biennale must also consider the fact that the biennale is a transient cultural commodity – qualitatively and quantitatively speaking – and not just any cultural commodity. It has to be culturally responsive; it’s not enough to create a permanent art museum, it’s culture that comes with a certain level of authenticity and timelessness must be embedded in the social. A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration the fact that its social function is contingent upon the city’s capacity to sustain it – meaning</text>

A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration how the biennale is becoming culturally mediated. This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the cultural tourism component of the tourism package is strong, and so a public realm strategy for the biennale could well follow the logic of cultural tourism today.  A public realm strategy for the biennale could well follow the logic of ‘creative class’ – i.e. tourist-targeted luxury travel intended for upper-class tourists.  A public realm strategy for the biennale must also consider what it means for art to be culturally mediated. Is it merely the presentation of art from a privileged position? Or does the public realm require cultural organisations to intervene in the presentation of art from a privileged position?  A public realm strategy for the biennale must also consider what it means for art to be culturally responsive. Does the biennale have a cultural identity? Is it the duty of the cultural organisation to tell the cultural story? If the latter, then the biennale’s cultural identity should be culturally responsive to the challenges and opportunities of the moment.  A public</text>

A public realm strategy for the biennale must take into consideration how the biennale is becoming culturally mediated. This is not a mere theoretical possibility – we already live and work in cities where the cultural tourism component of tourism has become a dominant mode of circulation – but a fact of contemporary urban existence in the UK and abroad.  A public realm strategy for the biennale must also consider the fact that the biennale is a cultural institution that has become culturally mediated. This is not just the ‘cultural tourism’ component of tourism, but also includes the fact that the biennale is a ‘cultural tourism entity’ within the tourism industry itself, and so on.  A public realm strategy for the biennale must also consider how the biennale is structurally dependent on the city. It cannot simply ignore this fact and assume that the biennale will operate without this structural dependency. The biennale has to engage with its city as a living, breathing entity, and so it makes frequent use of cultural tourism packages, including those that specifically target migrant workers and communities of colour. It makes frequent use of cultural knock-offs, and it even sponsors cultural festivals that in</text>
