In doing so, it has taken the place of the museum, the local branch of the museum, and the international branch of the museum, while the international branch has often been an intermediary between the two. The Venice Biennale has often been cited as a model for how a biennial could operate in a city, often operating as a parallel history between the museum and the city. But this is not at all to suggest that the Biennale is immune from the museumisation process, nor that it is immune from the museumisation process either. As biennials everywhere become more institutionalised, and more subject to the logic of geopolitics, natural resources and other elements of global capitalism, we can expect that the institutional memory of the Biennale will be recalled as a way to tell the story of the city. There is a temptation, also, to imagine that the biennial might one day return to form and produce a show that is more representative of the city’s urban landscape. This seems to me a worthy ambition, given the increasing ubiquity of</text>

In doing so, it has taken the place of the museum, the local branch of a museum, in the modern ‘collectors’ club. Biennials in Venice have an important place in the history of the Italian city, and in the world, because they are a way to take the place of the museum, returning to the city and its history, and to explore the ambiguities of the city, its contradictions, and the surprising fecundity of its urban life.In the traditional biennial, the art institutions take a back seat, often appearing in the form of counter-institutions, such as the homeless, the marginalized and the micro-biennials. Yet in the present and emergent politics of the city, the art  	gravitation provides the necessary precondition for a back seat, and for curatorial hand-wringing, especially in the context of the large-scale urban regeneration programmes currently taking place in major Italian cities.

This exhibition – which itself is a ‘time to recall and frame’ – is an act of ‘recalling and framing’, recalling the past in the hope that it may inform the future. It is a reminder that, while the biennale may be a museum or a museum in its own right, it is also a kind of time, a ‘living museum’, and as such it is a museum that develops and articulates the past in the present. In other words, the exhibition is not really an articulation of the past but an act of recollection and a ‘recalling’ of the past.’1  The Venice Biennale website implies that the exhibition is not just a ‘showpiece’ of the city’s past, but seeks to ‘reveal and articulate the past through art’, ‘bringing together’ �</text>

The Venice Biennale has often been cited as an influence by the Biennale movement, which is now widespread all over Italy and globally.In contemporary terms, the biennial is a term that describes a ‘time to come home’, one that denotes a ‘temporal alignment between different times and places, from which a convergence of different times and places may be inferred.’ It is a synonym for ‘the “Big Event” (in the case of a major artistic event, a ‘time to come home” in the case of community events). The word ‘biennial’ is frequently used in relation to events occurring in the city of Rome, but in this context it is only appropriate to mention events in Rome during the first half of the twentieth century (the so-called ‘Italian and Italian-American eras) – the so</text>

In doing so, it has taken the place of the museum, the local authority, private enterprise and other ‘enduring layers’ that it has documented. The Venice Biennale’s decision to produce its own print version of its traditional periodical as a supplement to the exhibition was a response to the fact that, since the early twentieth century, no other biennale in Italy could lay claim to the formal title of a ‘biennale’. In 1923, the Turin based Triennale d'Automne (1923) placed the historic title on the premises of the Arsenale, while the 1929 Venice Biennale (which we will refer to as the ‘present’ version of this journal) placed it on the Arsenale grounds. The decision to lay claim to the ‘biennial distinction’ seems to have been anachronistic, for the biennial was originally conceived as a ‘transitional kind of status-changing event’, emerging out of the two preceding communes</text>

In doing so, it has taken the place of the museum, the local authority, local curators, archivists, and even the military. In doing so, it has been able to absorb, inhabit and present the city’s past in an ever-widening present. In doing so, it has been able to create a parallel universe of its own construction, a parallel universe in which art, history and contemporary art can converge. And if that is not a curatorial gesture, I do not know what is. What is a parallel universe for an art institution to enter and inhabit? What is the equivalent of a museum in a museum city? One can only speculate.There is another, less obvious, but perhaps more powerful way of thinking about the concept of the biennial. That is, there is another kind of biennial, ‘one with no apparent beginning and an indefinite future’, one that we produce and produce until there is no future, or, as with the biennial that began in Amsterdam in 1990 and has been going on</text>

However, despite its traditional role – which it holds in perpetuity – the biennial has largely failed to develop its original, contemporary cultural value in its host city. Perhaps it is this perceived failure that the organisers of the Venice Biennale wish to work towards creating in the future. As we shall see, in the twenty-first century, this would make it a position of great potentiality.If the Venice Biennale is to achieve its original, critical purpose of bringing together, keeping alive and questioning the city of which it is embedded, then it is imperative that the whole organisation is reacquainted with the cultural value that it once possessed. The English version of the Biennale, which began in 1864, is an artefact of the twentieth century that is global in its scope and content.

In doing so, it has taken the place of the museum, the local archive and local neighbourhood, each neighbourhood archive, and even local zine, lending a voice to the otherwise voiceless collection of local artists, a voice that has become increasingly difficult to ignore. While the Venice Biennale is a localised event, it is widely understood as the Italian art institution having a significant internationalisation agenda. Its 2015 Venice Biennale of Art and Architecture was seen by many art professionals as a significant and perhaps even a pre-eminent event in this dynamic, if not necessarily global art market. The Biennale, along with the many other art institutions that have their origins in cities, is a global institution with an increasingly regionalised character. Art is increasingly understood not as an end in itself, but as a process leading to artistic products that can be sold, exchanged and passed on from generation to generation, often through shared family and friends. The challenge for curators and art-historians like myself has always been to keep pace with this shifting dynamic and to respond</text>

The Venice Biennale’s decision to produce and publicise this exhibition on the premises of the Biennale as an art institution, rather than as an exhibition venue, was a crucial step in the exhibitionary complex’s integration of the local and the micro-exhibitions of different worlds. This integration is often confused with the ‘biennialisation’ of the art form, but ‘micro-exhibitionism’ would do much better here, because everything that can be considered a micro-exhibition is already taking place within the Biennale grounds. The exhibitionary complex has done much to inflate the significance of art as a permanent form of cultural exchange, and the Biennale has done much to inflate the significance of art as a curatorial artefact. But the relationship between the two is much more complex and dynamic than most artists would</text>

In the 1990 Venice Biennale, the museum was reduced to a half-empty lot in the Giardini, and the local people took over the museum building and the local shops. The idea that the museum and the local community could constructively co-operate with the organisation in a different way from museums to local people is very evident in the Biennale's curatorial hand. All the exhibitions in the Biennale are open to local people – even the lesser-known exhibitions, which in Venice are often very successful, attract a large and diverse crowd, and often a large number of local people, who come to experience what the Biennale is trying to create. This is evident in the number of biennials that have been created in the city, which have proliferated over the years as a result of the Biennale's localised character, and its frequent mix of</text>

It can act as a counterweight to, or in conjunction with, the more obvious (but necessary) things, such as, for instance, the internet or automobiles. In the words of Gregory Ulmer, ‘the internet is the elephant in the room’, and so the contemporary art market couldn’t afford to ignore it. It has to be taken into consideration, because it is a thing, and because it is art. But it doesn’t need to be taken into consideration by anyone, and that is why contemporary art has to be contextualised. Otherwise, it is just art, and everyone knows it is art.‘But the internet is the elephant in the room’. And so the contemporary art market has to be contextualised in order to find meaning and purpose and live up to its potential.

It can act as a counterweight to, or in its own way to, the other. It is not a substitute for, or a replacement for, other cultural practices, but art as a cultural form is itself a quite complex thing, and the more we know and love it, the less we know and love other cultural practices. So, contemporary art might not only produce art that is interesting, powerful and weird, but it might also facilitate or contribute to a future or future culture being formed through that culture. It is a way of making sense of a world we don’t yet understand. This is what contemporary art, and art in general, is about. It is a deeply human thing to do.Art today is, in other words, made up of many different kinds of art. It is art made by artists with different kinds of skills, with different kinds of knowledge, with different kinds of experience, with different kinds of social power. It is made up of the knowledge of many different kinds of people, and so it</text>

It can act as a counterweight to, or in conjunction with, what the other world might be like. But this isn’t easy, and it certainly isn’t cheap. And so contemporary art has had to be continually contextualised, ‘stewardised’ by experience, and ‘a bit of everything’ in order to find new projects that add something new to the world. And this is what contemporary art today is like, in that it provides a constant supply of content and possibilities for change. It is art without a mandate, but with the stamp of authority, and that is what makes it contemporary.Art today is almost completely contextualised. Artworks are often found at ­​arrangements that put artists on a pedestal, or in museums where visitors sit around waiting to pierce the veneer of things. But the veneer doesn’t extend very far, and the real work happens beneath the surface. And this is what art needs: it has to be</text>

It can act as a counterweight to, or in addition to, what it sees as its own increasingly diversified, globalised, mediated, social world.Art has a huge amount of inbuilt social value – billions of people visit museums everyday, and so does the art market – but it also has a social cost. People who visit museums and galleries are likely to have a very superficial understanding of what they are taking part in. And so the contemporary art market has to be creative and innovative in how it uses its capital and intellectual capital, and engages with what it means for a certain kind of art to be made in this world. It has to be able to build intellectual capital on the back of what it perceives are the most valuable assets, and so it has to be imaginative and flexible. And so the contemporary art market has to be imaginative and flexible, and art has to be made in this world in a particular way. This is what biennials do.

The questions here are whether there are compatible social and ecological needs, and whether the needs should be met through art or information or both.What might a contemporary art market look like?  Whether we are talking about the current ecological crisis of urban sprawl or the impending ecological crisis of the cultural sector, the same questions are being asked and addressed. The term ‘markets’ seems to encapsulate all of that is at stake in a crisis of information. And so, the need to quantify, to quantify, to quantify, to map etc. is a need to be met. And yet, somehow, we as consumers of culture just don’t seem to pay enough attention to the ecological footprint of what we are consuming. And so, all of this is happening in real time, and we</text>

In an ideal world, of course, the contemporary art market wouldn’t have to worry about what the future would be like, and could instead focus on what it already has. But that is increasingly difficult to achieve, and art markets today are political actors, playing multiple roles – providing, for example, access to information about the upcoming elections, or highlighting the importance of watching conservation documentaries on television – and so their access to information and engagement with issues of importance requires expertise and spectacle. As a result, the contemporary art market today is a complex world with actors with many different motivations and skill sets – many of whom have their fingers in many different pies – but all of whom are ultimately operating in a world of one common thing. The contemporary art market today is the social-media equivalent of the early internet: ubiquitous, diffuse, and very fat.  Another problem with the contemporary art market is spectacle. The</text>

It can act as a counterweight to, or in addition to, other forms of art, and so it does that’s worth doing. But it also exports this complex thing, which is to say, it causes art to be more of what the contemporary artist, or curator, would consider to be simple, everyday, commonplace, contemporary. It doesn’t mean that it behaves like classical art, or that it has to adhere to an exact contemporary art canon. Rather, what it does is that it creates spaces and occasions – contemporary art is art if it occurs contemporaneously with, or in connexion with, art made prior to it. This doesn’t mean that contemporary art necessarily has to adhere to the canon, just that it should have the capacity to create and maintain contemporaneous artistic environments.  The issue of what counts as contemporary and what isn’t is a tricky one, and I would say that the 1980s and 1990s were marked by a kind of contestation of modern art canonicity</text>

This is the world we actually inhabit, and so the contemporary art market needs to be able to read the signs, just as the contemporary artist needs to have a reason to work. The other is that, just as the contemporary art market needs to know how to deal with the uncertainty of the information it does possess (just as the contemporary artist needs to have a reason to work), so too, the contemporary art market also needs to know how to act when it does have that information. It doesn’t need to be art, but it certainly needs to know how to act when it does have that information.

Yet it is also true that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the contemporary art market had its hands full with other things – wars, hyperinflations, white elephants, prisoners of information, feral child performers, internet porn etc. – and so there was some concern about what this other, more complex world would be like. Some thought it might be useful, in the form of a curatorial argument, to inform the current art market (and any future art market) about the things we knew and loved, and the things we didn't.This is what contemporary contemporary art might do if it didn’t have to worry about what the other, more complex world would be like. It can act as a counterweight to, or in its own way to, what it sees as the inevitable implosion of the other world, and so it continues to produce contemporary art with a decidedly different set of skills and sensibilities. But it doesn’t necessarily have to do so. The contemporary art market doesn’t necessarily have to produce contemporary art. It just has to know how to shop. The task, in the wider sense of the word, is still pretty clear: what counts as art today, and what isn’t, remains largely a matter of opinion, even amongst those artists whose work is often precursory to arguments about who is and is not art.When the internet was invented, and social networking brought together a community of like-minded people, one of the first things that came to mind was, unsurprisingly, the Renaissance. And so, perhaps, the word ‘classic’ comes to represent something more enduring and valuable than a tangible cultural artefact or a set of distinctive artistic practices,</text>

It can act as a counterweight to, or in tandem with, other social, economic and cultural changes, and it does this through what Goya did by imagining a second future, or a parallel universe, where art and aesthetics once again coexist peacefully. It can also act as a provocation, a way to go beyond, or in tandem with, other artistic forms and artistic practices. But it doesn’t need to be sophisticated or sophisticated-looking in order to do this. It can be incredibly beautiful, moving, dynamic and sophisticated in some ways. And it has to be able to do all of this in a way that is both powerful and simultaneously accessible. And Goya’s storytelling is powerful in ways that today's art market couldn’t possibly imagine.But another thing the contemporary art market could do is create its own alternative contemporary, and this is what contemporary art has in mind when it promotes the prospect of a ‘twenty-first century’. And this is what contemporary art has in mind</text>

Her work received a special kind of critical treatment in the United States, where she was labeled a &quot;white feminist poet&quot; by the New York Times and was accused by others of being a hoax. In Canada, her work was described as a &quot;poor appropriation&quot; by critics who saw in her Canadian origins a kind of vernacularism.1  In a sense, Rankin is correct to define Canadianness as a kind of fragmentation, a kind</text>

    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is set to open, but what can the Liverpool Biennial do next? What next for the city, in the face of such a pivotal and ever-present event? This is the question that the Biennial must address. The question is uniting a broad range of people from all over the world: artists, curators, architects, journalists, politicians, residents, councillors, students and others. It is a decision that must be taken with great care, since, if not addressed, the impact could become destructive. In this context, the Biennial’s future is uncertain. It must anticipate, however, the day when a new generation of artists, from everywhere in the world, set up shop in the Biennial, and begin to offer a new angle on life in the city. This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists

What is needed now is a clear vision of what the Liverpool Biennial can and cannot be. This may require changing the law of attraction, but as our experience with the Liverpool Biennial shows, changing the law of attraction is not enough to sustain creativity. Creative action requires organization, and this cannot happen in a vacuum. When spontaneity is stunted, and all around us acts of invention are repulsed, something is amiss. The organizers of the Liverpool Biennial should learn from the mistakes of the past, and address the needs of the future. This may require changing the law of attraction, but as our experience with the Liverpool Biennial shows, changing the law of attraction is not enough to sustain creativity.Creative perforations are in part about escaping the prison of expectations, and so the organizers of the Liverpool Biennial should organize in a way that creates the possibility of spontaneity and interaction between audiences.

This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists set up similar events in the city. The question is, can the Biennial inhabit these new artistic contexts? The answer to this is a decisive &quot;yes&quot;. The question becomes, can the Biennial inhabit these new artistic contexts in a way that is not exclusive to itself?I believe that the answer to both questions is a definite &quot;yes&quot;. In the coming years, I expect that the Biennial will become something like a hybrid institution: it will exhibit an ever-increasing number of works from all over the world, developing a global impact, and maintaining a very distinctive character through its own particular set of institutional forms. At the same time, it will also exhibit works that in many cases were made by and for the city, but which are now popular with residents and tourists, and which are thus representative of the city in a larger, more pervasive way. I have my doubts about both of these. The question of cultural hygiene will play a larger role in determining what counts as art in the future</text>

This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists take up the challenge. The answer to this is a difficult one to give, because the dynamics of the contemporary biennial are such that the only way to be seen by others as ‘real’ is to be ‘influenced’ by the biennial in some way. If the biennial is to achieve universal accessibility, it will have to change its form and become something more. The question is how to change the form and become something that other curators and artists can access. In doing so, it will have to address wider publics, and it will have to achieve wider participation, since there is no way to know what works and what doesn’t. The answer to this is clear: the biennial must become something that is truly international in scope, that creates experiences in a citywide way, and that brings with it deeper localisation. In doing so, it will have to invest in culture warriors, because that is what cities do best: provide culturally</text>

This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists align themselves with the city in the future.What can the Liverpool Biennial do differently? One answer is to create a hub around itself, and its cultural resources, rather than relying on a collection of artefacts. The Museum of Modern Art in New York has done this, and many other museums and cultural centres have followed suit. Some of the advantages of this approach are that it is easier to access cultural resources when you are a hub, and that the resources you access help create a sense of community around the location. For example, the Biennial could set up a workshop or host a reception at a local museum, or it could establish a partnership with a museum of art or architecture. Local artists, curators, architects and others could work alongside or in parallel to the artists and curators currently working in the Biennial, creating a mutually supportive and inclusive environment. This could mean creating a hub dedicated to architecture, or the design of buildings and infrastructure, or the urban history of Liverpool. It</text>

This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists come to terms with the change of venue and, in some cases, the arrival of new communities. The question of community is an issue that is of great concern to the city, and for many people in the city it is their top concern. It is a question that relates to identity, belonging, belongingness, belongingness, belonging to places, belonging to people. It is a question that demands a sense of place, and a sense of community. The question of who is included in and who is excluded from a community is a crucial one, and while the biennial may claim to be a community asset, it is also critically dependent on the decisions of its members, particularly when they are making their annual gifts. The question of inclusion and diversity is also an issue that is of great concern to the city. While the Liverpool Biennial may claim to be a 'home' to artists from all over the world, the reality is that most of those artists are already situadble in other cities</text>

This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists take up the challenge. Will the Biennial, in its current form, offer a venue for curatorial activities that are not confined to the city, or will it become something completely different, and leave its current predicament unsolved? This is a critical question for the city to confront. It is a mistake to assume that the biennial will find a way of remaining independent of politics and the city, and therefore, politically, it is also a mistake to constrain the biennial’s activities. The biennial is an event that is bound to become politically relevant in its own right, and its current form should serve as a reminder to politicians and local authorities everywhere that the biennial can still be politically engaged and creatively innovative. The Liverpool Biennial is set to open in October 2021, so we need to see what happens in June 23–27, 2022, the earliest and most practical dates for the event.

This is the question that the Biennial must address. The question is uniting a broad range of people from all over the world: artists, curators, architects, journalists, politicians, residents, councillors, students and others. It is a decision that must be taken with great care, since, if not addressed, the impact could become destructive. In this context, the Biennial’s future is uncertain. It must anticipate, however, the day when a new generation of artists, from everywhere in the world, set up shop in the Biennial, and begin to offer a new angle on life in the city. This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists take up the challenge.The answer to the second part of your question may relate to the role of the press. Should the press be allowed to witness the city as it is made? If the role of the press in shaping perception is the job of the media, then surely the role of the press should also be the media? I strongly disagree. As journalists, our main role should be shaping perceptions through what we observe, writing and reporting on what we don’t know, exposing apparent injustices and advocating for justice where justice is denied. That is our main responsibility. In the case of the present situation, much of the reporting and writing on the region is done from a distance, in a city that is increasingly defined by its own economic imbalances and social imbalances. The press is critical in gaining information and making the most of what is perceived to be a public investment. It is critical in that it emerges as an informed public, but it is equally critical for the Bi</text>

This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists set up shop in the city and in the wider biennial format. The importance of this for the future of the Biennial cannot be overemphasised. The Biennial’s current and future potential must be managed in a way that ensures the city’s cultural resources are deployed in a way that is mutually beneficial to the city and to the Biennial. The question now becomes whether the Biennial can reclaim its cultural resources for the city’s future. This may require redefining what is culturally valuable, and how cultural resources are distributed globally. It may require changing how the constraints of the biennial are imposed, and in what way they are resisted. It may require reinventing the biennial itself, and creating other ‘cities in which art is made and celebrated’. The question may well prove more problematic in the wake of Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, as well as in the wake of</text>

What would you do if you no longer conducted such experiments? Did you ever consider what other futures there are than Liverpool? Does the question still apply to your work? Do you still believe in destiny? I imagine you have other questions.DDownload this article as PDF29 September 2014To Osvaldo Sanchez2021 Venice, California2021 Venice, CaliforniaDear Osvaldo,Thanks for your invitation to tour The Foundry.

This is a very exciting prospect, but the question remains whether the Biennial can inhabit its space in ways that are not exclusive to itself, and even if this happens, how other curators and artists take up the challenge. What is needed is an understanding of the city, and a willingness to explore its past, present and future. Otherwise, the question remains: what will be the role of a biennial in the future, other than as an occasional visitor and tourist attraction? The answer to this is a likely question. The answer to this is a likely question because, today, the biennial is an event, and because today, the event is embedded in the social totality in which it takes place. It is an amalgamation of many different kinds of relations, and because it is an organic whole, part of its social context, it is also subject to a variety of different pressures and agendas. And so it must be given space and time to take part in this new social totality, to merge with other social  	nations, to develop and evolve.

In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only way to address the problem is to implement a city-wide curatorial agenda, and this may prove challenging, since the artist(s) and organisation(s) organising the event are scattered all over the country.  This may be the case in a city such as Copenhagen, where the Danish Council has its headquarters, but also in New York, where the Museum of Modern Art is located. In these cases, the problem may be that the curatorial agenda is not clearly defined, and the definition of the city may be ambiguous. The key is to research the city, and to become familiar with its neighbourhoods, its streets, its architecture. This sounds trivial, but its impact is significant. If implemented, a city-wide curatorial agenda can fundamentally alter how resources are distributed in the city. The results may be seen as art, rather than as a collection of buildings and streets. The emergence of specific projects such as the aforementioned in the city may be expected to generate significant new data, which</text>

Nor does the fact that the event is being organised by the Danish Government.  In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only way to achieve this through a cap on artistic budgets is to abolish the very concept of art altogether. I do not believe that the demand for greater access to art and the gallery is a new phenomenon, and I do not believe that the crisis of cultural nationalism is unique to the 20th century. Rather, the reason why access to art is restricted today is due to competition for low-cost housing, which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in Copenhagen despite being widely considered a luxury good. Also, access to art is often conditioned by the availability of cheap transportation to the art institution. It is true that the financial crisis in the 1980s severely limited artistic freedom, but this was balanced by a policy of state support for the artistic side of the institution. Subsequently, the emergence of alternative cultural institutions like performance and dance colleges, which offered programmes in a hybrid model of public and private education, triggered a proliferation of alternative educational models. The present crisis of public and civic education comes as a consequence of a</text>

In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only way to do this effectively is to share the entire cultural budget with an autonomous district council, which would in turn set priorities and work with artists to produce projects that would be included in a cultural register, and would in turn contract out some of the services to artists.  One can also argue that the engagement of local artists could also be a solution, since they are already artists in their own right and already artists within the cultural system they are part of.  But this solution is hardly ever employed, and in fact many cultural councils today are heavily influenced by the industries they are entrusted with regulating.  I see an opening to explore this possibility, but in my opinion, the key to unlocking cultural potential today is a system that puts cultural resources where they can matter most – where they can actually change things – rather than the other way around. The art world would be well served to learn from the local artists who have successfully launched projects on the local level, and have gone on to establish long-term</text>

In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only way to change the social composition of an art museum is to abolish the museum itself. If the museum is the locus of exclusion, the district, or even the municipality, where the exclusion takes place, then the district is the site of proliferation. And here we see another paradox: the more art is ethnically and structurally circumscribed, the more it is perceived as an asset by the district; and the more art is ethnically and structurally circumscribed in the city, the less it is valued. If the objective is to actively generate positive perceptions of the city as a potential art site, then the ‘Citizen Artist Project’ seems like a logical extension of the original vision. But the objective has to be compelling in order to win over the artist(s) and the city(s) with which it is associated, and the ‘Rights of Way’ is the operative principle of the project.

In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only way to do that effectively is for the Council to set aside a percentage of the budget for arts education, and for the artists to decide what percentage of the budget to put towards arts education. That would enable the arts community to decide how much of the budget it would put towards producing works of art and culture in the city, and for the city to choose how much it would put towards supporting the arts.  Art and the urban crisis  In my opinion, there are other ways of approaching the crisis of cultural nationalism: poverty, war, hunger, despair, anger and so on. But the key is to understand that the root cause of the problem is the same as the symptom: the fact that the cultural resources of the city are severely constrained. The only way to actually affect change is for the Council to set aside a percentage of the budget for arts education and for the artists to decide what percentage of the budget to put towards arts education. In other words, the cultural councils must find a creative</text>

In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only place where the Government of Denmark, or any government, can fund cultural activities is for events such as carnivals and festivals, and even then only in the form of a tax-deductible ‘Copenhagen Philharmonic Foundation’ (COPFE). At present, the only way to become a COPFE is to establish a cultural centre dedicated to a particular art form, and to that extent, the only way to access funding. In my opinion, the only way to create a truly localised programme of cultural activities is for artists to actively recruit local artists and organisations, and for arts organisations to take part in such an initiative, and to their credit, participate in the governance of the project. This would mean supporting arts centres that actually build organisations and artists, supporting organisations that actually work and providing the organisations with resources in the form of funding to carry out an art programme that is not exclusionary and does not generate resentment towards the Government.  It would also mean supporting</text>

In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only way to do that effectively is to create a national biennale, but that seems redundant to me, because what is at stake when we attempt to institutionalise a particular form of national identity in a city like Copenhagen? What does it mean when we attempt to create a national identity around an art form? When we attempt to apply the identity of the city to an art form? When we attempt to create a national pastime? When we attempt to combine cultural activities in a way that is not restricted to the city? The answer is a resounding yes!  A new generation of artists, whose work is frequently commissioned by the Council, is developing work in parallel. Some of these artists, such as Mogens Rehberger, Benoît Carré, Guenther Oe and many more are experimenting with this new form of art and its places in the city. The important thing is that these artists, whose work is often commissioned by the Council, use this</text>

In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only place where the Government or a authority such as the Danish Council has a direct interest is in the arts and culture infrastructure fund, which is a limited resource. Therefore, the only way to influence a project through direct funding is to find a partner who has a stake in the project and can potentially play a role in the project’s direction. For instance, if the Danish Council is interested in creating a cultural landscape in the city, it’s much more feasible to oblige the artist to create a landscape that is culturally significant in the city than it is to entrust the task to an artist who has a say in the creation of a city’s cultural landscape.  Similarly, if the Government of Denmark wants to create a cultural geography, it’s much more feasible to oblige an artist to create a culturally significant landscape than it is to hand the job to an artist who has a say in the creation of a city’s cultural geography.

In my opinion, the solution to the crisis of cultural nationalism is simple: abolish the crisis of cultural nationalism as an event, and in the meantime fund a cultural education programme for schools in the city. At present, the only way to achieve such a programme is to join a union and demand better working conditions and benefits. I do not think the super-indicators of contemporary art – great art, great festivals, great installations – would be attracted by the prospect of fulfilling their potential through a biennial or a new art institution. On the contrary, the artists who are already in the building but don’t have a workplace and don’t own the artistic instruments – the young person who painted that arched window, the artsy kid who made some noise on the playgrounds, the hipster barista who introduced a coffee filter to a van Heeswijk’s latest – would be less likely to move into the building if the rents were lower and the cultural activities less intense.  The main problem with the current form of the biennial and non-biennial is that it is a double-bind: on the one hand, the institution itself is trapped in a form of domination (the</text>

At present, the only way to achieve that would be to dismantle the Danish Council altogether and start again from scratch, and that is not a realistic option for most people.  So what does the Danish Council do? The Council organises the Art Biennale every two years, and although the biennale has a budget of about DKK 350,000, it is usually organised with an eye on whether there is money to spare, rather than whether there is art to be exhibited. So if there is art to be seen, the Council arranges for it to be seen. It is not clear whether the decision to organise the Biennale as a kind of a ‘curatorial lottery’ was taken in 2011, or if it is a new one. The fact that the biennale is now organised with an eye on whether there is money to spare seems strange to me, and the fact that the art is displayed in such a way that it is difficult to see the art in its natural context –</text>

    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is the first in a planned series of supervised visits to the city, and the first in more than a century. Our plans call for a series of visits in subsequent years, culminating in a public exhibition of the city's architecture at the end of 2022.The Biennial will visit a number of important sites in the city, and the surrounding region, including Anfield, Moseley and Anfield Home Tours. The approach to the city will be guided by a public, guided archaeological tour, which will take visitors from Anfield to Anfield, and the nearby Cotswolds Industrial Park. The tour will conclude with a stop in Anfield, where the Biennial will showcase its plans for the city. The first phase of the tour, entitled 'The Anfield Home Tour', will take place in Anfield on 28 October, during the Anfield Home Tour, which is now in its second phase. The second phase will be entitled 'The Anfield Home Tour: Part 2', and will take place in Anfield on 4 April, when part three of the tour takes place.The Anfield Home Tour: Liverpool Biennial is a multi-disciplinary art project that emerged from the collaboration between The Arts Council of Great Britain (www.theartscouncil.org.uk) and Liverpool Biennial. The project was started in 2004 with the objective of visiting every corner of the city, and producing a multidisciplinary, multi-use art project that would be used in schools, community centres, residential neighbourhoods and workplaces. The project was developed through a research university, architectural school, community land trusts, heritage organisations and community organisers. The combined expertise and resources enabled us to create an experience that was original, engaging, challenging and local. The challenge was to combine the originality of the work with the maturity and compassion of a museum or a library, in such a way as to connect with people on a personal level and create a shared experience. The main factors that determined whether the art project was collaborative or competitive were the quality of</text>

The locations for the tours have been fixed, and the archaeological excavations will take place between 2016 and 2018. The tour will stop in Anfield, at the former Honeymarket building (now a office and retail space for IKEA) and in Moseley, where the Biennial is building new exhibition spaces. The tour will visit several historic district theatres, including the former Theatre Royal, which will be restored to their historic venues, and visit the new exhibition spaces for the first time. It will also take visitors to the bakery where the Biennial is planning to build a new exhibition hall. The bakery will serve as a meeting space for the first time. The bakery will be home to the bakery staff, as well as a new exhibition space for the first time. The bakery will be both a meeting space and a hub for the local arts community.

These tours are designed to be individually tailored to each individual user, while ensuring a shared experience across the board, with information about the area collected from surveys and the local pub and bakery communities. For this reason, the descriptions provided by the public in the initial tour are more specific, and the neighbourhood in which they take place more specific. The purpose of the initial tour is to introduce the audience to the area, while the second is to give a deeper understanding of the area, and the people who live and work within it. The bakery neighbourhood of Anfield is the site of a number of different cultural activities over the years, including on weekends. The bakery is where the Biennial is set to be held, and the area is the setting for a number of other activities, including a number of charity events. The area is a major research centre for the Biennial, and is home to a number of different community art projects. The bakery is a site of</text>

The narratives will be assembled from diverse geographic areas in the region, tapping into a shared past or myth. The narratives will be assembled in chronological order of appearance in the region, from the Bronze Age to the Information Age, from the Nullah Valley to Anfield. Some of the artists selected for the works to be assembled in Anfield include Meehan Crist, Sophie Hope, Gareth White, Polly Brannan, Rebecca Traister, Maria Hlavajova, Loraine Newman and Yvonne Rainer.

It has been translated into thirty-six languages, and is the subject of a worldwide &quot;Where is Anfield&quot; phenomenon. In 2015, the tour company, TOMM Club, was established in Holland, and in 2018, the Dutch version of the Biennale was established in New York. In addition to being a Dutch company, TOMM is a private limited company established in 1863. It is a founding member of the Biennale Commission, and its chairman is the Dutch politician Bert Koenders.

The Anfield Home Tour was written and directed by Tony Blackburn and Roberto Reina. The script was co-penciled by Andrew Bird and Mark Loudon. The artwork was designed by Sandeep Parmar and was delivered by Nandini Pathak. Liverpool Biennial is proud to have been part of the research and planning process for the city, and to have had a role in its creation. I have always thought of Liverpool as a city in constant flux, ever on the verge of being woken up by events, places and people out of whack, and so it is with the Biennial, whose earliest and most recent projects are the work of spontaneous associations. The idea of the biennial as an event that is ever-shifting and ever-shifting in its location, time and subjects began to grate on me, as it expanded from being a biennale to being a cultural institution, and it is now a</text>

But what is art, really? How does one define the term? In the age of the biennial, and its multitude of senses, one could say that we are living in a 'biennialisation of art’s world'. And indeed, some of the qualities that attract us to art, its accessibility and value, its communitarian character and its presumed accessibility – such as its accessibility to people from diverse walks of life – are what make it art. It is art because it is accessible; because it is possible to consume it in countless other ways, subject it to rigorous criteria, and still be able to draw a consistent and perhaps influential aesthetic. For some, and I include myself here – perhaps not even myself – the quality of being able to consume art in those other ways is the real draw. It is possible to experience art in a completely different way, to a degree that is familiar with the art but is also sensitive to its cultural contexts and ideologies. In this sense, perhaps, biennials can be seen as a hybrid art form that is capable of being both ‘art’ and accessible. But perhaps what makes this art is something in between: a rarefaction of artists able to inhabit diverse aspects of the cultural landscape</text>

But what is art, really? How does one define the term? In the age of the biennial, and its multitude of senses, one could say that we are living in a 'biennialisation of art’s world'. And indeed, some would argue that we are. There is a tension that exists between art events and biennials, who encounter art events as opportunities to explore art and its possibilities, and who thereby need to be multidisciplinary and deep. I would dispute this notion, arguing that biennials can and should be events that pick up where art is left off and that is where their potential to multiply art's activities begins. I would also argue that, while they’re an art event, they’re also a biennalisation of the world as a whole, in a way that art’s historical and present moment-to-moment encounters with the world inevitably are. The present moment includes everything that is and will be evermore contextualised, quantifiable and commercialised in the ever greater historical and cultural consciousness that biennials bring with them wherever they go. And this is where we, artists and curators alike, need to find our place, our voice, and really</text>

But what is art, really? How does one define the term? In the age of the biennial, and its multitude of senses, one could say that we are living in a 'biennialisation of art’s world'. And indeed, some might say that we are. The biennial is a term that is used to describe many things in one sense – a global phenomenon that is characterised by (1) frequent but variable exchange between places and times; (2) the appearance of places and times that are rarely, if ever, the same; and (3) the randomness of appearances.Art is a complex commodity. It is both a product and a demand side of the same transaction. It provides a way of seeing the world that is both quantifiable and intangible, both real and unreal; it is both consistent and unpredictable. It is both powerful and enigmatic. But it is also, to some extent, a lie. That is, the art it is supposed to represent is most often fake and made to look real in order to sell a product or service. That is, the art it is supposed to represent is made to be experienced in a particular way in order to sell a product or service. And while the art may</text>

But what is art, really? How does one define the term? In the age of the biennial, and its multitude of senses, one could say that we are living in a 'biennialisation of art’s world'. And indeed, some have speculated that the co-emergence of biennials and museum collections is contributing to the growth of museums and art’s contemporary relevance in an increasingly fragmented and dispersed society.Biennials are ever-present in the modern and contemporary artworld, and are a part of the larger collection of art, literature, documents, objects and collections that is commonly referred to as the ‘collectors’ group. They are considered a museum-like institution, with permanent exhibitions and an extensive range of programmes, that gathers together and represents contemporary art in a way that is accessible, interesting and occasionally provocative. But how do biennials achieve this inclusionary character? What constitutes a biennial? What constitutes an exhibition? What constitutes a venue? And what constitutes a community? In the twentieth century, the growing up of collections took place in the context of a museum-like collection structure, with curators, art producers and art’s board of trustees putting their ideas into practice</text>

And indeed, some of the language of place and community seems to be migrating with the advent of the biennial. In recent years, the biennial has become synonymous with the global, mega-exhibitionary event. Yet, the democratic biennial is itself a microcosm of the world as a continuous display of art from many different places and times. The biennial – and its numerous, often overlapping iterations – is a global register of peoples and experiences travelling through time, from city to city, nation to nation, region to region, often accompanied by a series of related activities. The biennial is a global register of experiences, a kind of ethnographic archive, that is ever-shifting in its recording, recording and memory. It records, re-measures, re-photos, narrates, analyzes, documents, narrates – all in the name of the art. And yet it also makes claims about other, deeper, normative, historical and contemporary experiences. For example, the biennial</text>

And indeed, some might say that we are. But this is just one sense, well-grounded in the work of art itself. There are others that resonate with the work of art and artists, and point to deeper trends and processes that are at work in the world, and so we might say that we are living in ‘the culture industry’. And this is where the work of art and artists comes together in ways that are dynamic and unpredictable. It is not an industry that has neatly defined functions or products, nor one that is inherently hierarchical or exploitative. There are other ways of doing things, and these must be negotiated. There are limits to what art can accomplish, and beyond which it cannot go, and so on.Art can only do so much good, and it is this dynamic that creates the conditions and forces the action, and so the biennial becomes what it is: a set of appearances, a set of displays, a set of data. It can also do this in</text>

And indeed, some might say that we are. But how can we define what is, in fact, art? Would-be curators and artists’ friends might offer valuable suggestions. For some, perhaps, these are game-changers. But for me, and many others, and I include myself among them, the answer is always the same: what can it be, good and bad, that result from coming together as a community as artists, curators, writers, activists, activists and members of a community – coming to work, play, learn, create, explore and tell stories?And that is what art can and should be. It is a powerful tool, and while it is powerful in its own right, it is far less so when wielded in an authoritarian capacity. That power must be used responsibly. It is time-consuming, perhaps even impossible, to recreate the communal relationships and collective experiences that result from a biennial, whether it is in museums, galleries or museums.

But what does it mean to make art? What is meant by making art? What is meant by the contemporary art market, or biennale as a market?

A biennial is an internationally visible museum that documents the art cycle, or in this case, the art’s appearance in the world. It is a museum of conspicuous consumption, a museum of appearance, a museum of expressivity, and it holds the key to the art’s mysterious riches.The biennial must do more than display the art. It must actively engage with the art and, above all, with those who make up the art cycle. It must be a place where the art can be experienced, experienced and understood. And it is this last mission that the biennial is currently undertaking. It is a place where the art can be experienced in ways that are difficult to quantify, that capture its imagination and stir within it unexpected feelings.I say this without qualification or attempt to apply the</text>

And indeed, some members of the art world are already questioning whether art should be curated or not, or whether it is even legitimate for art institutions to seek out artistic talent from communities, beyond the institutionalised elite of artists and curators, through a competition to see who could create the next Richard Link, Richard Link Art Gallery? What this competition actually is, and what it has in common with other art international competitions such as the Venice Biennale, is that it seeks to top off a long running, often highly diversified market of artists, curators, art collectors and art writers through a single entity, offering a singular, often aspirational end point. The Venice Biennale has done this with a regional flavour, highlighting a particular set of local talents, while the other exhibitions have tended to be more general, highlighting a geographic region or cities within that region. But the purpose of the Venice Biennale is to ‘reanimate and elevate’ an institution, and to do so by creating</text>

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, and the number of curatorial schools has more than doubled, from about twenty-five to over fifty, with varying levels of autonomy and autonomy granted to individual schools. Moreover, the number of art galleries has more than quintupled, to the present level of over5,000, with a large majority of galleries being run by for-profit companies, which makes it easier to imagine a completely independent future for art galleries. So the curatorial remains a much more prominent position in terms of who has access to ideas and objects, and can exert considerable influence over one’s understanding of the world.Nevertheless, the curatorial position is not without risk, and the new curatorial methodologies that are emerging everywhere, both in the UK and internationally, will inevitably expose art’s traditional mission of taking part in civic life, such as taking part in religious life, to new, more public functions. Thus, the new curatorial methodologies may also expose art to the politics</text>

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past fifteen years, while the number of art teachers has nearly trebled. So the number of art school children or art teachers has more than doubled, which means that the number of art-related events has skyrocketed, and this contributes to a general sense of things being more visible and less hiding place that contributes to the general sense of the incompleteness that art seems to engender. It is true that the Art School itself has only recently begun to experience a general public that is responsive to art’s inherent raison d'être. I believe that the Art School has always known how to engage its resources effectively and creatively, and that it will always find a way to do so, no matter how many biennials it may lose or how many self-started art schools it may nurture and persevere in its noble task of supporting local artists. But the Art School also knows that it is not enough to aspire to the impossible; it must also actively participate in creating the impossible.</text>

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, and as many as in the entire history of the country. Many of those students are now employed as art teachers or art critics, and their positions are not confined to art schools or art crits; critics, writers or curators of any kind are increasingly common. The Art School is a big employer in its area, and the local Art Department is a big employer in its own right. The number of art institutions in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, and the number of students has trebled too. All of this growth has happened on a regional or local basis, and it is these very localities that are the places where the new art is born, nurtured and thrives. The Art School, locally to the art departments, is a very particular institution, and the local Art Department as an entity is also a peculiar one, with its own distinctive set of skills, processes and processes, and distinctive set of needs. In the past, the need</text>

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, while the number of students in Canada has quintupled. The number of students in the US has likewise quintupled, and the number of students in the UK is likely to continue to do so, although I am hesitant to draw a firm conclusion until the number of students in each country is fully surveyed and statistical power is developed. Nevertheless, the numbers that remain show increasing numbers of students in both rich and poor countries, and increasingly coloured, ethnically diverse and migrant populations, who are drawn to the art school as a place of learning and a potential employment in postsecondary education. The number of art students in rich and poor countries has quintupled, and the number of students in Canada has quintupled. What has caused these sharp increases? I cannot speculate, but I can say that there is a strong and persistent public relations campaign for art’s perceived social good, including television series, films and signage, which are often quite effective at generating images of people doing</text>

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, and more than one in four (42%) graduate from the Aarhus Art School, which itself has doubled in size during this same period.3  And, as the Aarhus Art School has shown, even when the Art School is expanding, its number of students is on a constant decline, as is evident in the figure of the school’s present and former curators (figs. 1 and 2).Fig. 1: Curator Alexandra Weidenfeld (1868–1971) at the Aarhus Art School, 1972.

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, and twenty-five per cent of undergraduates are enrolled in curatorial programmes across the UK. The number of art professionals has also increased enormously, from 4 per cent in 1980 to over 10 per cent in 2015. So the role of the art professional in the contemporary art world has expanded immensely, and it is quite possible that the number of art professionals attending the Art School would increase as well.However, the key question for contemporary art is what kind of world would such a world bring? An expansive and confusing world of art, or would it be art in a very specific form, and would it be art in a more general sense? Contemporary art today is experiencing a kind of qualitative 'art-by-the-hour' – the art-world quality that is inherent to mass media and social consumption in a capitalistic economy – which is undermining the art of the past, and art today functions in relation to a larger and more pervasive form of social consumption.

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, while the number of art school spaces has nearly trebled. This increase has been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the number of students, who are increasingly drawn to Art as a way to explore careers in art’s social worlds, to meet other artists and explore the arts’ wider social practice. It is easy to dismiss these numbers as the chimeric repetition of some long-standing patterns, but it is much harder to imagine a future where such a pattern does not exist. In that case, the apparent randomness and vacillation mentioned above would still be a problem, but the more structural the increase in social and cultural capital created by the mechanisms of modern art, the less accessible and transient the problem would be. The Art School is a much more potent and persistent form of social capital than the Art School (and perhaps that is its raison d’être).

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, and while the number of artists per student has remained the same, the number of curatorial-trained artists has exploded. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the Art School was developing its curatorial credentials, the number of artists per student was around 200-300, and today it is over 5,000 students, scattered throughout the UK and abroad. The new curatorial school had been recently founded by the Arts Council and the then Welsh Streets Arts Centre, a building once part of Tate Modern, and it was being led by Peter Carr (who would go on to found the then Chisenhale Gallery, where we have the Tate Modern relics) and was staffed by Leonor Creasy, who would go on to found the Norton Arts Centre, where we have the remnants of a bygone art-world. As we all know, the Art School was cut short by the financial crash, and many</text>

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, and according to a recent survey, over half of art students surveyed felt that their future art experience would be in the curatorial school, or gallery, rather than in museums or galleries. These numbers are staggering, but they are also true of art institutions, which have also seen significant increases in enrollment and budgets, and these may well be the authentic scaling-incidents of a more fundamental historical tendency. Nonetheless, the Art School and its enrollment in the present has grown tremendously, and in the 1980s and 1990s it was relatively easy to get a piece of the Art School act, since most schools either folded into the overall Art School narrative, or framed their programs around a theme or a mode of discourse that fitted neatly into the school’s distinctive rhetorical strategy of the late twentieth century. In these decades, the Art School has largely morphed into a transient phenomenon, with little interest in what it produces or says.

The number of art students in the UK has quintupled in the past twenty years, and the number of masters’ students has more than quintupled, although the precise relationship is still made up. In both the US and UK, the number of museums has also increased enormously, making it ever more important to have a wide range of specialist art and contemporary art museums nearby, in the city, alongside major art galleries and specialist museums.Art’s curatorial legacies are made up of many different kinds of art, and their curatorial power is often underestimated. But in the current globalised and digitised curatorial world, which thoroughly understands and assimilates the contemporary art of any place, speed is an especially important determinant. And as much as anything, the power to define what is and isn’t contemporary is in the hands of the artist and museum, and not in the hands of the globalised art value. What might be contemporary in one city might be totally different in another. The modern curatorial search is like that of a hunter</text>

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim and a claim in perpetuity, and at the same time a set of tools for the destruction of other kinds of communities. It is a project with a long-term ambition and a clear sense of its own destiny.  Art biennials are often the project of the artist(s) who lead the project, and for that matter are often the project of the curators who work alongside them. The question that arises in the context of the biennial is, however, far from straightforward and can lead to dangerous situations. The biennial needs both artistic leadership and a deep understanding of its own future, because the project it leads inevitably entails changes in the social and political landscape of the world, and those changes will have an impact on the place of art in the future.While artistic leadership is imperative for any great change to happen in the world of art, it is much more important for artistic change to happen in the world of art, because without both, there can be no change.

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim on future revenues generated by the art produced in cooperation with other stakeholders in the city. If cultural resources are made available to other stakeholders in the city, and are distributed equally, ‘the additional revenue generated from art sales could be put to productive use helping to build or revitalize the ‘restored’ parts of the ‘city’ – a possibility that has not been sufficiently considered.  One aim of the biennial is to contribute to the ongoing development of the city through its artefacts, whether that ‘empires’ are the products of the collective might of a city or the outcome of individual artists’ individual acts of creativity, and how those roles may be filled in the future by those with skills and tools to engage with the contemporary situation.  A number of artists have careers in artefacts. Some are household names; others are not.

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim recognized by both the public and the private artists who work within it. The claim is that the art be valued and acquired in exchange for the art’s contribution to a community’s well-being, whether that contribution is appreciated or not. In other words, if the community is to reap the benefits of the asset, the community must take ownership. This is the entwined logic of the ‘biennial model’: the public sector, which produces the art, and the community, which owns the art.1   	But the ‘biennial model’ also entails the potential downsides. Publics understand that which is expected of them by the artist, and that which is not. In the context of a biennial, the responsibility for an artwork’s success lies in the hands of a diverse array of stakeholders, including artists, distributors, curators, administrators, visitors, collectors, professionals, students, volunteers and others.

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim to access resources and to occupy previously occupied sites. It provides both access and legitimacy for claims to be made on behalf of the community. Biennials can and do happen in any urban space, including on streetscapes dominated by shopworn art, in neighbourhoods where art is frequently cited as a problem, or in the suburbs where art is often cited as a solution. In either case, a stake in the ground is a claim to be defended. The biennial’s claim to be a ‘truly global’ entity is a claim to be able to claim a set of shared resources and to occupy sites in a way that is not necessarily restricted to those with access to resources but extends to sites of cultural exchange. Art biennials’ claim to global impact is a contested one. Globalization in its broadest sense means that it encompasses all manner of ways of doing things, including the ways that others might disagree with. To some extent, this is why biennials</text>

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim on future work from artists who have already taken matters of community development and empowerment into their own hands. It is a claim that artists can exploit to achieve their own ends, and that artists can share the road map and tools they have created with other artists and communities. The community is a stake in the ground, and it is the community’s turn to gain agency and to expand the biennial’s scope of engagement. Artists may choose to engage in actions that do not require community consultation, participation or empowerment, but do demand commitment from other stakeholders and the community at large. This demands agency from others, and from those who will be affected by the action. The authority to dictate who can do what and how a community may be distributed among those who take part in the action, but it also depends on the commitment of those who will be able to afford the privilege and resources to resist such appropriation.

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim recognized and managed collectively. It is an inherent part of the biennial’s mix of investments. The claim is that ‘This might be the location of a biennial, but it is rather a site of ongoing work by artists’ studios, a mix of public and private uses, and a significant chunk of the biennial’s budget goes on repair and maintenance.’[2] In other words, the claim is that the site has an intrinsic cultural value, something that can be traced to its historical location, yet which is being undermined by developers and socially conscious urbanists. The question then becomes whether the site has been sufficiently site-specifically designed to be culturally significant, and whether the building codes, permitting policies, and institutional power that constrain site-use can be changed to permit a different kind of site-cultivation. I would argue that the institutional capacity to change permitting policies and create new site-cultivating codes is limited to the institutional interest</text>

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim deserving of sustained and appropriate management and management support. Art is a consejoin in the community of the biennial, and as such it is a common resource, a trusted partner, a source of expertise, a champion, and a critic. All of these terms and concepts derive from the work of artists, curators, artists’ organisations and other curators who have worked on or co-commissioned biennials in the past, and they continue to do so.  The key concepts and concepts here are the property of the copyright holder; their use is governed by the law of the land (including treaties); and their ownership is absolute. The law also provides that: (a) the use of a work in a biennial is ‘sole and complete’ and (b) any attempt to limit the use of a work in any way is prohibited.

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim to ownership in the creative and dynamic outcomes that result from a community’s work. It is an investment that is not easily denominated or quantified. It is intangible, and yet has real effects on the world as a whole. It is a claim on cultural resources, a right that is legitimate only to that community whose cultural resources are employed or used within the biennial.1  The claim is that of a given volume of cultural resources, and that is what counts. The reality is that art and cultural resources are found at virtually every scale of society, and that every effort is made to allocate them in such a way as to maximize the participation and efficiency of the local labour force. The biennial is faced with the problem of finding ways to engage both the stakeholders concerned about the quality of their surroundings as well as the wider publics. The stakes are high, and the bargaining position is uncertain, but the ability of the biennial to govern at least some of its urban space</text>

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim recognized and protected by the law. The law provides for the establishment of a ‘trekkerry’, or institutional memory, to preserve and appreciate the work produced by artists during the course of the biennial. In addition, the law provides that such a person or entity may, within a limited time, establish an art school specifically for the purpose of training artists in the use of art tools and in the art of community projects. Art is a ‘work of art’, a concept that encompasses both natural and juridical elements. It is an inherently social activity and, as such, it is vulnerable to both natural and juridical elements contributing to the production of socially engaged and aesthetically interesting art. Natural and juridical elements include, but are not limited to, the following: distance, the angle of a mountain, the density of a population, the climate, the density of settlements, the density of traffic, the topography, the soil type, the</text>

The biennial as a ‘community asset’ is a stake in the ground, a claim on which other claims can be built upon. Amongst the claimants to the ground are the local artists’ community, whose cultural assets and networks can be counted on to fill in the blanks where opportunities for growth, development and innovation become evident.  The claim on the ground is that of the localities; and as such, the ‘biennial’ as an entity is a local entity, distinct from other art institutions and localities, and thus subject to the laws of commonwealth, state and federal jurisdiction. The claim of the artist is that the ‘biennial’ as an entity appropriates his/her resources and makes use of their inalienable right to be heard, to be seen, to be believed and to be taken seriously. The biennial as an entity thus constitutes a form of public agency distinct from other art institutions and subject to the law of commonwealth, state and federal jurisdiction.

If the biennial is the most representative artistic artifact of the contemporary urbanisation process, then the city is the point where, across a given geographical area, the artist is most vulnerable to the transformative effects of capital. This is especially true for younger artists, who are more exposed to the forms of institutionalised art today than any artist of their generation might be, and thus have a more limited range of experiences with the commodity that is art (even if this latter is an extraordinarily limited experience for artists of any age). 	Artists of all ages are exposed to art within the city, but the city also has a critical effect on the development of art-historical and artistic-ideological frameworks and narratives, which in turn shapes what artists can create and how they create it. The criticality of this effect becomes evident in the figure of David Hockney, who is credited as the originator of the idea that the H.L. Mencken Quartet were the originators of the Biennial, and that the Pan American Biennale was the first major art biennale.13 Hockney was born in 1887, in the small Canadian town of Lac La Biche. His family emigrated to Michigan from the B</text>

This is especially true for younger artists, who are more exposed to the cultural capital generated by a biennial, and c) the city is the site of the biennial’s future ‘cultural capital storm’. As biennials become more regional in scope, less identifiable in their organisation, less identifiable in their medium – a biennial is a different kind of art event. It has the potential to shift geographically, taking audiences to places where they never imagined they would be going, and fulfilling the potential of art to address local ills – issues that can be addressed with a city’s infrastructure. Yet in undertaking this potential, it also stands to become less artistic, less artistic in its own right. As biennials become more global in scope and more globalised in their audiences, their potential artistic impact wanes. These changes are likely to cause serious damage to the artistic capacities of certain artists, who will find themselves excluded from the artworld due to their insufficient numbers in certain cities. This is the situation today</text>

If the biennial is the most representative artistic artifact of the contemporary urbanisation process, then the city is the point where, across a given geographical area, the artist is most vulnerable to the transformative effects of capital. This is especially true for younger artists, who are more exposed to biennials and the many other forms of artistic production that take place during that period. It is this kind of spatial complexity that is rendered invisible in the image of a biennial, or, to be more specific, rendered unimportant by the systematised, commercialised production of art that is being developed in the region. But this kind of spatial complexity is also what makes the city, and art in particular, extraordinary. It is what makes it possible to make a biennial culturally relevant and influential. Art, and art-making in general, is a process of making, and art-production in particular a system that produces art. To some extent, this is done through the medium of art, and particularly through the medium of art-making. But it is a process that also produces art that is significant in its own right, and that is culturally significant in the way that biennials are, and are likely to remain so for some time to come.

If the biennial is the most representative artistic artifact of the contemporary urbanisation process, then the city is the point where, across a given geographical area, the artist is most vulnerable to the transformative effects of capital. This is especially true for younger artists, who are more exposed to the culture of mobility and globalisation that is generated by the biennial and other contemporary art forms. Art today is made and delivered outside of the city, but this does not necessarily make it immune from the systemic effects of capitalism. A city that is cosmopolitan in its economy, in other words, may still be subject to the vagaries of the market: the real-life, urban market, which is the locus of the fluctuations in exchange and value that characterise the biennial. As biennials become more and more autonomous from the city, the city becomes less and less subject to the fluctuations of the market. This in turn, has two effects. First, it distributes the cultural production generated by biennials outward; from the city, the production flows into the suburbs, and from there into the cities. Second, it opens the market to artists who produce culturally transnationally; from the city, the radars that detect and capture the artefacts</text>

If the biennial is the most representative artistic artifact of the contemporary urbanisation process, then the city is the point where, across a given geographical area, the artist is most vulnerable to the transformative effects of capital. This is especially true for younger artists, who have their work commissioned by civic authorities, city councils and other higher governmental bodies, and are thus especially exposed to the city’s development. It is this kind of exposure that contemporary artists crave. It gives them an edge, a sense of place and agency, that is indispensable for artists to have. But in the contemporary urbanisation process, place is not where it is; nor is it where it is today; it is neither central nor exclusive. At the centre of the biennale is the financial centre, where the biennale is expected to announce its financial results in 2017. Its status as a cultural institution in the city is also a crucial step in this process of commercialisation. In order to maximise its returns, the biennale must produce material that is) deeply embedded in the city’s cultural landscape and b) visible in the city at all times. Otherwise, it is certain to lose its commercial edge. If the biennale is to maximise its</text>

If the biennial is the most representative artistic artifact of the contemporary urbanisation process, then the city is the point where, across a given geographical area, the artist is most vulnerable to the transformative effects of capital. This is especially true for younger artists, who are exposed to art outside of the artist’s given social context. Cultural geographers have long been interested in the extent to which is the biennial phenomenon is a reflection of the city as a cultural space. They argue that it is the biennial with its dense, defined, and defined art forms that is distinctive, whereas the city is a culturally diverse system that supports a multitude of different forms of art-forms. They also argue that a) the biennial is a globally distributed exhibitionary form that engages with the artist, b) the city is a heterogeneous collection of diverse localities with varying cultural histories and varying ecological systems, c) the biennial form is sensitive to the specificity of the artist’s particular situation, and d) the biennial form is particularly responsive to the needs of artists’ patrons. However, despite these long-standing theoretical debates, little is known about the host of biennials, their artists, or the cultural perforations that</text>

If the biennial is the most representative artistic artifact of the contemporary urbanisation process, then the city is the point where, across a given geographical area, the artist is most vulnerable to the transformative effects of capital. This is especially true for younger artists, who are more exposed to the panorama of commercial art production that is frequently implied in biennials, but is also true for artists with short and medium-term curatorial portfolios. The city is the site of the biennial, but it is also the site of the city’s subsequent airport, its maritime and cartography ephemera, its mediaeval bookshops and postcodes, its film and video rental shops, its car repair shops and hardware and photographic shops, its art galleries and bookshops, its post offices and postcodes, its postmen’s clubs and childcare centres, its artisans and art supply shops, its plaques and nativity scenes. The city is a complex system, deeply dependent on its inhabitants, and its urbanisation is largely a by-product of its economic life. The biennial form has emerged as the dominant artistic and curatorial resource on the planet, but it is equally at the mercy of geopolitical and technological change. It is</text>

If the biennial is the most representative artistic artifact of the contemporary urbanisation process, then the city is the point where, across a given geographical area, the artist is most vulnerable to the transformative effects of capital. This is especially true for younger artists, who are more exposed to museum culture and to rarefaction. The city presents a particularity, a kind of historical anomaly, which artists, curators and art historians alike can look back on fondly. It is a site of extraordinary complexity, of which the artist is most vulnerable. But it is also a site of immense growth and change, and the most vulnerable are those who develop into museum-goers or art collectors. The biennial condition, then, becomes both the preserve of artists and curators; it is an art project confined to a particular geographical location, and its growth and change is precisely constrained by the institutional limits imposed by the city. Biennials may have adopted a globalised, interconnected urban condition, but they also seem to be grappling with the problem of art being produced in the city, and in particular, of art failing to be produced in the city. This is a conundrum for the biennial to confront. It can either adopt an art world view that actively participates</text>

This is especially true for younger artists, who are exposed to art from all over the city and beyond by virtue of being in the visual medium with their index fingers. Biennials have emerged as the main entry point into the City, and are a major contributor to this. However, just as important as the entry of artists into specific art worlds is the work of art itself, which has to negotiate its way into the cultural economy of cities. Artists have to work actively, creatively and informally, in order to engage with the city. In other words, they have to be able to negotiate the system they are working within. 	[i] The Biennale, Wikipedia. The Biennale is a major international exchange of ideas and arts. It was started in Paris in 1884 and since then has hosted twenty-six biennials, of which thirteen were in the United States and twelve in other parts of the world.

If the biennial is the most representative artistic artifact of the contemporary urbanisation process, then the city is the point where, across a given geographical area, the artist is most vulnerable to the transformative effects of capital. This is especially true for younger artists, who are more susceptible to the systemic political and institutional changes that result from a city’s increasing political, economic and jurisdictional power. However, the city also possesses considerable potential – perhaps the most so today, thanks to the ubiquity of mass media and the constant flood of information that it can present at any given time – which can nonetheless be utilised to actively generate potential creativity and new artistic practices. This potential comes at a cost, however. The cost is evident in the number of artist-performer partnerships that have been formalised since the mid-1990s. In the 1990s, the biennial would have been unthinkable in many urban areas; in 2015, it is commonplace. In an effort to maintain its cultural value in these jurisdictions, the biennial has had to become something more substantial and political in order to sustain itself. In doing so, it has tended to become something that it is virtually impossible to de-biennialise. In other words, the biennial condition is</text>

Probably, in public or private, some participants took issue with many of your remarks.I liked what you said about the relationship between biennials and the cities they portray. We’re thinking about that. We have biennials that are virtual communities with their own distinctive forms of engagement and politics, and they’re communities too. They’re moments of art that happen to be hosted in cities, and cities are places where art sometimes happens again. In that case, the host city is a node in a hub of art-related activity. Biennials offer a storehouse of artistic activity. And as you know, there’s a direct economic relationship between the museum and the economy.There was a question about what it means to be an art institution. I didn’t get a clear sense from you, but I expect that in a place like Berlin, where the biennial is the main art form, the institution that I represent is a node in a chain of art institutions.

We’re thinking about this in relation to Liverpool. I work as an architect for the Liverpool Biennial and its plans to create a ‘renaissance’ around the historic Riverside Church in the city centre. The plan is to create a series of public plazas, one for each of the hundreds of buildings that make up the city. Each neighbourhood will have its own mini-riverside trail. The idea is that each neighbourhood will be able to articulate a story, step-by-step, through the architecture of the city. For example, the story of the Riverside Church could be integrated into the ‘renaissance’ around Anfield, creating a continuous narrative that moves from the street level to the cathedral. This kind of storytelling is not possible in a typical urban setting,</text>

I’m sorry to have sent you away.I had a question about the compatibility of your exhibition model with the ever-growing, but still nascent, Palestinian diaspora. We’re thinking of how to support a biennale that takes place in the city where the Palestinian call for a return to the city track closely with the diaspora’s natural inclination to seek out and embrace its connectedness. In the past, the Palestinian call for a return to the city was often interpreted as a call for a separate statehood bid from the land mass encompassed within its borders. In the present political moment, the entanglement between the politics of representation and the politics of relocation is as great as it is in other parts of the world. What might be thought of as a biennale’s natural curatorial function – gathering together disparate elements – has come to be seen as a more effective way to intervene politically, financially and culturally in a city’s</text>

I’m interested in the idea that the Palestinian narrative is an authentic one, even though there’s been a movement towards more precise and controllable versions over the past five years. I thought you might find the idea of ‘the Palestinian people’ useful.I wrote to ask if there’s a way to make the symposium happen again in the future; if the Palestinian narrative is valid today, why not just add another chapter?

The symposia, on the other hand, are there to recall the past and to ask questions. What does it feel like to be a visitor to a forgotten neighbourhood? What does it feel like to witness the mass murder of civilians in Iraq and Syria? How is it possible for a museum to simultaneously investigate these complex issues while simultaneously celebrating the power structures that created and allowed them to develop? These are questions that invite and respond with diverse strategies and tactics.There will be brief personal greetings from the curators of these various exhibitions and symposia.

I think we need to set up some time to talk.I thought I'd send you some notes about the discussions that have been going on in the context of the Palestinian diaspora. There’s a mutual respect that has to be built up between the locals and the migrants. The local community is very conscious of its own engagement and involvement in the larger community. They’re not willing to be ignored. Local people’s participation is a fact of life in the West Bank and Gaza, and it’s a way of asserting identity and belonging. But it’s also a way of creating spaces for other identities to flourish. That’s what the West Bank and Gaza are for. It’s to be seen whether the diaspora is interested in that kind of construction. In other words, the West Bank and Gaza could be useful for each other.You’re right that the Palestinian diaspora is a global phenomenon. I didn�</text>

This dynamic is intended to be seen as a dynamic, rather than as a static or monolithic) that can be manipulated by forces beyond its control. The biennale board is called upon to maintain a balance between the various cultural identities of the area and the museum, the biennale, the local community, and visitors. The balance must be maintained in the face of the complex metainterface of the city. In order to achieve this balance, the biennale must be able to move from the museum, the biennale, and the local community, and must be able to offer an experience that is unique to each locale, but that is responsive to the unique needs and interests of the community in which it is staged. In creating the Arsenal, the Biennale Board sought to work with artists who were interested in exploring the history and culture of the area, but also with those who were interested in using art as a political tool. The Biennale was conceived as a biennale in the strict sense of the word, and so it was possible to conceive of the whole event as a single event.

This dynamic is intended to be seen as a dynamic, rather than as a static or monolithic) that can be manipulated by forces beyond its control. The biennale board is called upon to project an image of the area in which the biennale is taking place in a way that is neither prescriptive, ethnically specific nor representative of the area. The board is expected to project an image that is both current and changing. This is expected to happen through research and discovery, which is intended to happen at a pace that supports the biennial itself, as well as the local community’s interest in and engagement with the area. In the case of a biennale that projects an image of the area in a specific way such as by highlighting an area of high cultural value, the board is also expected to give prominence to research on the area in addition to curating or exhibiting the work in an area where art and curatorial engagement is widespread. For example, the board may want to establish a series of workshops or events in an area where art is often not widely appreciated or celebrated.

The biennale board is called upon to project power in the public imagination in a progressive but restrained way. It is aware of the need to project power in a serious but controlled way in order to produce long-term change and to maintain public acceptance. The board is composed of a chairman and a vice-chair, and their remit is limited to the art institution, the biennale, and the selected community. Power is used to project power, not necessarily for the enhanced good of the local community, but in order to produce long term change and to support a stable future for the area. The board seeks to collaborate effectively with the artist and artist to achieve the aims of the art institution, but it is also keen to exert its own creativity in relation to the art institution, the biennale, and the local community. This is particularly true in relation to the local community, since many artists are artists first and foremost, and therefore are interested in creating lasting relationships with communities. It is also the case that many former students</text>

The biennale board is called upon to project the museum, the biennale, and the local community away from the museum and the biennale, while simultaneously managing the biennale itself. The local artists and curators who will be commissioned to work with the biennale on a local level are expected to embark on a collaborative project with the biennale on a regional or national level. The project manager is expected to lead this process, and the artists and curators are expected to absorb elements of both the local and the biennale styles into their projects. The biennale may decide to present its work elsewhere in the world, and its local projects may be developed into international curatorial initiatives. The local curatorial initiative is considered a success if the biennale can leverage the local art world as a vehicle to promote cultural exchange between the two cultures, and vice versa. In an ideal world, the museum and the biennale would work in concert to elevate cultural exchange, and the interaction between the two</text>

The biennale board is called upon to intervene in situations when the biennale itself is threatened by developments outside of the locality, and to foster a positive image of the city in the process of development through cultural tourism. The board members, artists and other stakeholders convened as a group to consider how to work together to protect the city from the effects of a development project in progress. The board members were selected through a competitive selection process, and included representatives from the Biennale, the Museo del Trastorno, the FACT (Foundation for Art and Culture), the FACT (Foundation for Electronic Arts), and the Biennale itself. The members of the board were selected through an open dialogue on the website EuropaCentro.org.ua, which sought proposals from artists and community groups with a focus on the biennale. The dialogue was facilitated by the Biennale board and the FACT, with the help of an online toolkit. The selection process involved extensive research on the city, regional and</text>

The biennale board is called upon to respond to the changing needs and desires of the city in the face of this dynamic. It is also my impression that these changes in the city do not always manifest in the form of direct interventions, but often have to be negotiated with, and are often negotiated in advance with, the local communities.  In this dynamic, cultural tourism is often employed, and the city is often left waiting for cultural or tourism opportunities, such as when the Biennale board is slow to respond to art fair proposals, or when the Biennale board members with experience and connections in the art world are more concerned with meeting the financial goals of the biennale than with meeting the needs and desires of the local communities.

The biennale board is called upon to maintain an ever-widening range of priorities and to project such cultural identities both to the local population and to museums within the city. This is due to the fact that, although biennales in London have traditionally been local in scope and within the museum, biennales in other cities are global in scope and involve a large audience of international travellers. It is also the case that biennales in other cities are often voyages in the making, with artists creating experiences that exist outside of the city in their perception of the world. This is particularly true of major biennales, such as Venice, which are oriented towards their local audiences but can be seen as representing aspects of the city in which people live and travel. In this sense, biennales may be seen as cultural exertions that exert cultural effects across a global scale.

This dynamic is intended to be seen as a dynamic, rather than as a static or monolithic) that can be manipulated by forces beyond its control. The biennale board is called upon to step back as much as possible when making decisions that can have a transformative or transformatory effect on the area. This can happen only with the knowledge and consent of the local residents, stakeholders, and communities to be affected. Therefore, the local residents, stakeholders, and communities are highly critical in shaping the biennale. The biennale must consider what kind of art is being produced in the area, how it is being experienced, and how it is being experienced. It must also consider art’s place in the area; how it is integrated into the local cultural landscape.Art and culture are the frontline in the battle over control of an area. Their inclusion in the public realm is essential if the city is to be effectively contested (i.e. held by the winning side). The biennale must be creative, adaptive, and responsive to the needs, priorities, and experiences of the local community without losing sight of its primary mission: to explore the city and its inhabitants.</text>

The biennale board is called upon to catalyze the creation of the biennale in the area, whether through a city-wide street festival, a community-based art project, or by sponsoring a small biennale programme. The biennale may be organised through a city-wide advertising campaign, a city-wide ‘branding campaign’ or a city-specific ‘branding agency’ that places the biennale at odds with its surroundings. In the former, the biennale is accused of being insular, lacking in imagination and devoid of resources, whereas in the latter, it is accused of being decadent and lacking in character. As such, the biennale is expected to rear its ugly head again and again in the area, until finally, all who have been displaced by development will repeat the bureaucratic error of not knowing enough or not knowing enough to affect change.

The board is responsible for creating the best possible narrative for the biennale to follow through its curatorial process. It is also responsible for its effect on the community.  The board should anticipate, map, and prepare for the visitor’s expectations, but it should also respond with creativity to the visitor’s strengths and weaknesses, and to the situation realistically and constructively. In doing so, it may end up creating experiences that are more like actual places – more like homes, in fact – by providing essential services and essential materials, but without assuming any responsibility for the experiences produced. This is a bigger ask than it may first seem.  The biennale should continue to be a place of interaction</text>

How different would the historical curatorial narrative and the contemporary curatorial narrative be from the historical and contemporary curatorial narratives we inhabit? What would be the difference between the two? What is the contemporary curatorial story? What is the historical curatorial story? These are questions that, as we learn from Bourriaud, are questions of &quot;staging&quot;, or the art (or art, or visual art) being staged in a public space in preparation for exhibition. However, staging is itself a relatively recent development, and staging is also a type of pre-exhibitionalisation, or how art is traditionally and currently conceived and represented in a given cultural context. Staging is different from museumary art in that it is not artefactualised; rather, it reflects the historical conditions and processes involved in its production, including those that create the cultural production itself. By staging, I mean taking part in, participating in a cultural productive process that is not an artefactualised production of the art within the art itself, but takes place in a world that is made up of artefacts and cultural products that one can touch,</text>

How different would the historical curatorial narrative and the contemporary curatorial narrative be from the historical and contemporary curatorial narratives we inhabit? What would be the curatorial and exhibitionary mission of a museum today, if it were no longer defined by the traditional museum, the traditional exhibitionary form (including its current incarnation as a biennial) and a host of other curatorial traits? For one thing, museums today play a much more prominent role in the social, economic and political life of the world, and it is not just in countries with a large number of museums, but are also present in regions and cities around the world. So a museum today would be present in any city with a large population of low-income citizens, and would be present in every city with a high-income population. It would also explore the curatorial and exhibitionary life of these cities and regions today, and of what these cities and regions have to offer to visitors and residents. Such a narrative would not only explain the place of museums in urban centres today, but would also lay out the curatorial and exhibitionary mission of such cities in the future</text>

How different would the historical curatorial narrative and the contemporary curatorial narrative be from the historical and contemporary curatorial narratives we inhabit? What would be the difference, if any, between the two? What would constitute the original curatorial commitment to the history of a particular art form and the contemporary curatorial commitment to the cultural production of a particular city? What elements of the former would constitute the curatorial radical practice, the form that is no longer sustainable? What are the contemporary curatorial practices that betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the art form? What are the consequences when a dominant form of art is produced in a city that is not necessarily a hero of the modern world?

How different would the historical curatorial narrative and the contemporary curatorial narrative be from the historical and contemporary curatorial narratives we inhabit? What kinds of tensions would they create? How could curatorial narratives inhabit, or create distance from, contemporary forms of participation? These are the kinds of narratives and questions that can inform a modern curatorial project, but also a historical one. These narratives are also the kinds of forms that modern curators aspire to design, commission, create and lead. They are the kinds that we can all adopt and lead. Some might even adopt the profession ourselves. But how do we as artists, curators, administrators, artists and members of a community of artists, curators, artists and thinkers react to, engage with and ultimately manage these various forms? These are questions that arguably need to be asked and possibly answered in a way that collectively reflect the unique conditions of our current and future curatorial projects. This will require a collective and open-ended dialogue that engages with these different registers of cultural signification, proposing solutions that all involved can adopt and implement. This will require no formal training in art history, doctrine</text>

How would the curatorial imagination allocate its curatorial resources? What kinds of relations between the artist, the audience, and the local? These are some of the questions that can frame contemporary curatorial thinking, but few places in the world are as acutely influenced by the artist as Liverpool Biennial is. The biennial has become what it calls a ‘fresh start’ – it does not take itself seriously, and yet it does. It is a very different kind of event from the kind of event that usually takes place in Liverpool: the kind that is about making art and the art of the future, about making art that is accessible to as many people as possible, and about using art as a political tool. This is a change, I believe, from the kind of event that usually takes place in Liverpool: the kind that is</text>

How are the historical curatorial narratives formed, and how are they generated? What are the curatorial roles in the contemporary production of language and cultural significances, and how do they generate cultural significances today? These are just some of many questions that can be asked of a curator in the public arena, and they reflect on the role that art today plays in our actualisation of historical narratives and cultural continuities. If the curatorial today represents the social totality, then today he or she is a locus of power, and today one of the functions of power is to narrate history. But what is the social totality? Who is a curator today? Is it the art collector or the collector of cultural resources? If it is the former, then the latter is the curator today. Is it the collector of past curatorial materials or cur</text>

How different would the historical curatorial narrative and the contemporary curatorial narrative be from the historical and contemporary curatorial narratives we inhabit? What would be the curatorial gesture to tell the story in a different way? One might add that the biennial form might even be witnessing a moment of epiphany. In a curatorial survey of art’s up-to-date materialises the historical curatorial narrative towards an ever more transnational and globalised globalised urbanisation. The public, it seems to me, is awakening to the fact that our curatorial language, our curatorial gesture, is no longer fitting the parameters of a region or city. We have become globalised and suburbanised, and the biennial is the last vestige of a once nationwide practice. I believe we are witnessing a micro-temporal event that is witnessing the endgame of a once-instrumentalised form. It is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a future if you are not inside the cork. This is a question that all art lovers – contemporary and historical – must ask.5.

What would be different about the contemporary curatorial narrative? What elements of the exhibitionary form would be affected? What elements of the historical curatorial narrative would be affirmed? Would the curatorial gesture have been as important as the artist’s skill and ability? These are questions that lend themselves to being asked and answers that tend to emerge from, and emerge out of, small groups of people. But in a general sense, would the curatorial gesture have been the same if the form had remained static? Would the form have come to define the actuality of the curated space? And if the curatorial gesture had come to define the actuality of the space, what would have become of the myth of the image-bearing curator? These are questions that lend themselves to being asked and answers that tend to emerge from, and emerge out of, small groups of people. But they are questions that demand a different kind of curatorial gesture, one that creates, or purveyes to be created,</text>

How different would the historical curatorial narrative and the contemporary curatorial narrative be from the historical and contemporary curatorial narratives we inhabit? What kinds of tensions would they expose, and what kinds of opportunities would they offer for curatorial thought? 	One may speculate that the biennial as an art form, and the curatorial narrative as a whole, is in crisis. Art is being made everywhere, but what is being valued most in the contemporary curatorial production is what can be labelled a ‘big data’ approach to art production: the power of the machine, its ability to produce images anywhere, anytime, and at any place. If images are to be generated anywhere, then they must be exchangeable. The biennial as an art form is being reduced to what Matthew Arnold terms ‘austerity’: the cutting of artistic production in an austerity package that does not sufficiently capture the society produced by the art, or does not generate enough new art to satisfy the consumer. In other words, the austerity measures of the machine are not enough to cover all the bases when it comes to creating new art. This logic</text>
