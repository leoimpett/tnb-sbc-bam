The new curatorial direction for the Museum of Modern Art in New York City is a good example of this new curatorial paradigm. In the main exhibition hall, the new curatorial paradigm is displayed in a half-dozen glass cases in a corner. In the other half-dozen cases, the earlier, more institutionalised curatorial paradigm is shown. In either presentation, the role of the museum is questioned and questioned, sometimes successfully, sometimes not so much. The present exhibition, ‘The Contemporary Condition: Art as a Contemporary Form’, is a particularly good example of this new curatorial paradigm.

The artworks, as curatorial devices, act as agents of change, generating new interpretative spaces and positions through their imagery, their function as media, and their ability to enter new cultural spaces such as social networks and the biennale. The exhibition is particularly well-placed in this historical moment as a way to bring contemporary art back into the fold of the social, and, indeed, into the social networks of the social. However, these social phenomena also tend to generate a considerable amount of waste. Artworks that are displayed, and which become part of the curatorial narrative, are likely to be of a particular quality – witty, clever, sexy, well-produced, well-designed, etc. – and so the current exhibition format is a disjointed collection of works that are as likely as any other to be empty of meaning or full of mistakes. The key to the current curatorial turn, as I understand it, is a change in the image that emerges from the various exhibitionary forms. The key to the contemporary curatorial turn, however, is a different image, and the curatorial shift from the past to the present is a difficult thing to pull off. To pull off, a shift in perception has to be accompanied by a corresponding shift</text>

The artworks, as curatorial devices, act as agents of change, generating new interpretative spaces and positions through their imagery, their function as media, and their ability to enter new cultural spaces such as social networks and the biennale. The exhibition is particularly well-present in the new curatorial paradigm because of its transnational character. Its transnational character is exemplified by the fact that the main exhibition space for the major curatorial regions is located in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the biennale in other cities worldwide. The new curatorial paradigm is both geographical and regional in character, operating in places such as Berlin, Paris, Istanbul and Venice. It seeks to penetrate these cities ‘deep within’ to see the way art is made here and how that might contribute to a future urban future. It is a microscopic survey of the spatial aspect, but it is a survey of a future city that is possible through the new curatorial paradigm. In this sense, the new curatorial paradigm is both ‘global’ and ‘local’ in character. It seeks to make sense of the enormous amount of data generated by art and curatorial production globally, as well as to offer alternative futures for art and curatorial</text>

The artworks, as curatorial devices, act as agents of change, generating new interpretative spaces and positions through their imagery, their function as media, and their ability to enter new cultural spaces such as social networks and the biennale. The exhibition is particularly well-positioned in the biennale’s new structural mode, which demands a structural change in its surroundings and geometry – in other words, it’s not just an exhibition anymore. The structural mode is a condition that art, and particularly contemporary art, will continue to fulfill. It’s the space where the artists who compose it can continue to make art in their current form, and to do so in a way that reinforces its current political context, thereby making it more ephemeral and disposable. The biennale must therefore make efforts to expand its current artistic and curatorial repertoires, and to respond to the new curatorial paradigm that is generating a more material and individualised version of itself. This is a tall order, not easy to pull off in a day, but the biennale in its current form is a very specific kind of specific – and globalised – kind of characteristic of the moment. It represents the new curatorial paradigm, and so it is</text>

The exhibition is particularly well-designed, affordable, productive and ecologically sustainable. All the elements of the new curatorial paradigm are present in the exhibition, but with a twist. The main thrust of the new curatorial paradigm is supported by a powerful, international multimedia installation, ‘The Contemporary Condition’, that is well-positioned and well-publicised in the artworld, where it is both the subject of a major art fair and a main instigator of new curatorial practices worldwide. It is easy to understand the exhibitionary character of the new curatorial approach. It is not just the art objects anymore. The curators are multi-talented individuals with a range of expertise and different levels of education. Curating is a craft. The discipline is complex. But in the end, what matters is that the art is delivered with care, skill, and analysis. That is, the art is delivered with context, and curators have become valuable because they deliver context with power. The new curatorial</text>

The artworks, as curatorial devices, act as agents of change, generating new interpretative spaces and positions through their imagery, their function as media, and their ability to enter new cultural spaces such as social networks and the biennale. The exhibition is particularly well-placed in this context. In the twenty-first century, we are living through a cultural cataclysm that is reshaping the world around us, and much of the planet. The global circulation of information and images is reshaping the world, and these new images and images are making themselves visible everywhere. However, this does not mean that images and images of the world are equitably distributed. Some artists and institutions are better at producing images that are specific to their places of residence, and can spread their ideas widely. For other artists and institutions, the image is not so easily grasped and transmitted. Institutionally, the contemporary condition means that much more internationally, and at a local level, and in the larger biennale itself. So the biennale must do much more to foster imagination and imagination power than the museums and large art collections that often accompany the ethnographic portrait. The biennale must also exert a greater influence on economic and cultural power structures. The biennale must exert a</text>

The artworks, as curatorial devices, act as agents of change, generating new interpretative spaces and positions through their imagery, their function as media, and their ability to enter new cultural spaces such as social networks and the biennale. The exhibition is particularly well-placed, both geographically and historically, because it takes up a significant space in the Museum of Modern Art and the remains of the Art Deco building. It is also well-positioned because it is part of the wider Contemporary Condition series, a curatorial process leading to the new curatorial manifestation of the collection. As a curatorial action, it is part of the museum’s portfolio, and as such, exhibits in museums and the collections of other curators, are objects of cultural exchange between curators, art’s audience, and the curatorial staff. There is a lot of overlap between art and curators, and a lot of room for creativity and innovation in both. This is true both at the micro and macro level; between the art collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the collections of other curators, and between art and curatorial projects. And it is true that the curatorial process can and does bypass the artist or institution in favour of the museum staff</text>

The exhibition is particularly well-sited, and the eight large format images that make up the bulk of the exhibition set up neatly into categories such as ‘Features’ and ‘Maps’ – categories that, in their own right, help us to understand the new curatorial paradigm. The categories even align with one another, appearing in the same order in the text, as if the categories had been written by one and the same author, with a shared set of symbols. Such a hybrid curatorial approach seems to be the norm, in part because the artworks and their images are so ephemeral and displaced. The significance of a piece of artwork may not be apparent for some time, and may be lost in the mists of time, yet its presence in museum collections and online is still felt. The ‘periphery’ is the object of our dreams, and yet we have no idea what the hell that means.  The principle curatorial objective of the modern curatorial paradigm is to</text>

The exhibition is particularly well-placed here as a return to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, where the curatorial turn has been particularly active in recent years. It is a welcome change from the earlier, ‘traditional’ museum structure, in which the curatorial weight was primarily on the museum's external, decorative, material and congealing internal display. Through its curatorial turn, the contemporary condition is understood on the micro- and macro-levels, and the museum is seen to play an active role in the development of contemporary culture. This turn of events is particularly evident in the curatorial hand that is being folded into the new curatorial paradigm, which is being actively revised. The campaign to create ‘The Contemporary Condition: Art as a Contemporary Form’[17] seems to be the culmination of a decade-long process of research and development. A legacy of archival materials and materials originating in the museum, this materiality is seen in the machinery of the curatorial hand, which</text>

The artworks, as curatorial devices, act as agents of change, generating new interpretative spaces and positions through their imagery, their function as media, and their ability to enter new cultural spaces such as social networks and the biennale. The exhibition is particularly well-suited to the new curatorial paradigm because it is a ‘present’ kind of thing, present in the exhibition hall alongside works from the museum that are newer and have a temporal dimension. This exhibition is particularly well-suited to the curatorial role because it is a new curatorial paradigm that is constantly (re)present in the museum, often repeated in different forms in different museums. So the ‘display’ and the ‘presentation’ both refer to a ‘feature’ or a ‘functionality’ of the artworks, but also to a mode of temporality that is dynamic and constantly evolving. Here, they act as media of change and representation, constantly telling a story or showing a variation of a story. This exhibition uses these powerful words to describe what is perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of contemporary art: the power of image, the potential of language, the potential of crowds, the potential of crowdsourcing, and the</text>

The exhibition is particularly well-placed here because the curatorial agenda for the next instalment is rapidly converging on a resolution to the Art Basel crisis that will see the museum either closed or transformed into a new art gallery (assuming that the galleries of the new curatorial form will be able to absorb the new art). This is a problematic usage of art-historical material – the museum as a historically contingent materialised form is now increasingly seen as a problematic material presence in a social and cultural landscape. Even more problematic is the proliferation of biennials such as Venice and Museo di San Paolo, whose museum-like character is now frequently questioned. The challenge moving forward for Venice-based curatorial priorities is to find new ways of incorporating the museum and the biennale in their curatorial processes. This exhibition is a good case in point. It is a rare, museum-like event in its own right, and an ideal candidate for the curatorial paradigm shift that is needed. However, the exhibition</text>

One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, during this same period, the great Renaissance thinkers like Galileo were being accused of being heretics by their European patrons. It is also significant that, during this same period, the Englishman Christopher Wren was attempting to set up a colony in what is now New Zealand. This proposal was put before the Full Court of Admiralty, but, as we know, the King reportedly turned down the idea of colonising the island.11 But, somehow, somehow, somehow, something else happened in the intervening years, and alchemy quickly became a legitimate alibi for European imperialists and later, by the late eighteenth century, for a majority of Europeans. In this view, alchemy is not just a pseudoscience, but a science that provides a legitimate basis for speculation and contributes to the establishment of a universal, humanistic framework of knowledge. Indeed, Wren’s colony was put on trial by a jury in London, and his case was judged legally flawed by</text>

One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, while there are many traces of this kind of magic today in certain African tribal groups, such groups are rare in Europe and rarely encountered in China. In Asia, the presence of alchemy as a field of research generates much more of a reaction from practitioners than from researchers, who are quick to dismiss it as magical nonsense. However, there is evidence that, during this critical period, alchemy was more widely shared and accepted by European powers than it is today. For example, among the Florentine artists who painted self-criticisms on the walls of the Medici residence in Florence, the Medicis themselves were often depicted as having a magic touch with the wall paintings, and the Florentines themselves were often depicted as having applied magical alchemy to frescoes.11 It is also significant that, during this period, the Florentine frescoes that were eventually painted in black and given the name Medicis were predominantly painters' frescoes, while</text>

One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, in the spring of 1519, the Englishman Henry Browne applied for a patent for a form of bonded currency called the &quot;Browne's Soap&quot; – a name that represented, uniquely, wealth and power. This application was granted in June of that year. The term ‘browne’ refers to the bond – the substance – rather than to the symbol of the cross, which is often confused for money. Yet, as we saw, the bonds themselves are often used as money. How then, with its three letters, can the bond be used to make any object? This raises the question: what does it mean to make an object? And, more importantly, what is the origin of such an expression?Questions of identity are central to any project involving humans – and, indeed, to alchemy – and it is not clear that the medieval alchemist could have imagined a more timely or encompassing marker of things to come than the emergence of finance and a global</text>

One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, in the spring of 1519, the man accused of being a member of this supposedly fictitious group, Johannes Opitz, instead founded a company called Transalpine that manufactured pieces of Italian marble and other fine objects useful for building houses, including one of the first pieces of glassware ever made. It seems entirely plausible that, during this same period, Opitz was actively investigating alternative alchemical formulations of magic. It could also be that, at some point during this critical period, another man – a man named Johann Wolfgang von Liebig – synthesised the first molecule of LSD, and that Liebig was executed for his role in the drug's production. Or, one might also argue, that, at some point during this critical period, another man – a man named Herman Goering – synthesised the first LSD tablet, and that Herman Goering was executed for his role in the drug's production. Either way, we know that, between this first Goering and Go</text>

One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, in the spring of 1519, the English poet John Lyly included alchemy in his collection of poems about the Elizabethan era, seemingly to downplay the threat posed by what he called the ‘dark arts’.11 During this critical period, Lyly was himself framed for a variety of offences against humanity, including war crimes.12 It is also significant that, during this same period, a host of revolutionary patriotic poets were being formed in parallel with the Elizabethan period, including Robert Louis Stevenson, T.S. Eliot, William Blake, William Law and William Shakespeare. A host of artists were being trained in the arts of war and communism by the time of his death in 1887, including Ezra Pound, William Hall, Peter Brook and Terry Smith, while a host of artists were being exposed to the arts by way of a host of biennials including William Blake, Oscar Holter and Muriel Turner.13 All of these movements are to a</text>

One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, while there were indeed marked increases in both mystical and occult-like phenomena during this same time period in Europe, there were also marked decreases in both physical and conceptual indicators of alchemy’s widespread cultural influence. For example, while the English language first appeared in the Middle Ages in the writings of a monk called Richard of Norwich (later Richard of Norwich), it is not clear that the magical potential of alchemy was widely shared. And it is also not clear that Norwich was acting alone – as a local celebrity, or even as an act of rebellion. It is more likely that, during this same period, a host of other Benedictines were also converting to Catholicism while this was happening. It is also important to note that, while Norwich was publicly committing itself to Catholicism, it was doing so at a time when, in English Europe at least, there was widespread secularisation and the emergence of a broadly secularised Muslim community. This fact is often cited as evidence of Norwich�</text>

One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, within a year of the 1519 arrest, Francis Bacon published a letter in his The Complete Works of Bacon in which he emphatically denies ever having met any such persons.11 It is also significant that, during this same time, Johannes Kepler was also arrested for conducting alchemy experiments on animals, and that Erasmus was similarly accused of the same thing by the Spanish.12 It is also significant that, during this same time, the English philosopher John Winthrop was writing to his brother William, complaining about the impact of the witch-hunts on the fledgling English science. A letter that appears to have been written in Winthrop’s own hand is the basis for much of what we now know as the ‘Commonplace Denial’14 movement. This is to say that, according to Winthrop, ‘it hath not sunk in that the English science writers, who are everywhere invested with a love of Naturalists, and who are assured</text>

Indeed, it is significant that, in the spring of 1519, John Winthrop, one of the accused, claimed to have discovered a previously unreported second Marianne (or Mary) spell that would give him and his fellow accused magical powers.11  It is also significant that, shortly afterwards, Winthrop claimed this spell in a public trial before a larger assembly of people who publicly convicted him and four fellow co-accused of participating in the First Witch-Hunting Council.12  It is also noteworthy that, just as Winthrop claimed his innocence, a succession of subsequent petitions calling for his acquittal were also presented in court. Probably, the ability to marshal sufficient evidence in court to overturn a conviction was a crucial element in the success of these legal challenges.In sum, we can state with some degree of certainty that, during this critical period in English history, alchemy was not a real scientific discipline, but a fiction that was widely believed by many people in authority. It is</text>

Nevertheless, these accusations and others like them generated a great backlash against magic in Europe, and the emergence of modern alchemy as a legitimate field of research across the newly-conquered territory of Europe. One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, while some of the accused were eventually tried and convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, most of the rest of the body politic seemed to ignore the conflict and move on with their lives. Perhaps, one might even claim, the development of modern alchemy was actually a form of resistance, an act that it would have been easier for the medieval alchemist to embrace and propagate throughout the empire.  	When, in turn, modern alchemy was allegedly invented in the mid-eighteenth century in the UK, it was actually some of the earliest documented magic in the west. At this time, magic was becoming increasingly institutionalised in the western secularised society, and was being actively discouraged through the logic of secularism.  	However, the development of western magical realism did not come without risk and, during this same period, alchemy was being actively investigated by the Catholic church. In 1519, John Winthrop, Bishop of Exeter, launched what is</text>

One might even agree that, during this critical period, alchemy was perhaps even a bit of a hoax. Indeed, it is significant that, in the spring and summer of 1519, a large number of manuscripts relating to alchemy were discovered in the possession of the Franciscan Friars, who were at this time engaged in waging a heretic on the Franciscan Friars of Burgos.11 It is interesting to note that, during this same period, another Franciscan Friar named Pietro da Luzio was also accused of witchcraft in Rome.12 It is also interesting to note that, during this same period, another Franciscan Friar named Pietro S alberti was also accused of witchcraft in Rome.13 It is also interesting to note that, during this same period, another Franciscan Friar named Pietro Nigri was also accused of witchcraft in Rome.14 It is also interesting to note that, during this same period, another Franciscan Friar named Pietro Nigri also had his case dismissed by a court in Turin.15 </text>

The breakthrough came when the researchers switched to using ‘Deep Belief Networks’ to train the network, and allowed the shapes and small changes to propagate throughout the system at a faster rate. At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – identifying significant numbers of genuine photos as hoaxes – but also of course significant numbers of fake ones. The researchers were amazed at the extent to which the network could deceive – to the point where it was able to fool even the most sophisticated photo detector. Such capabilities are fundamentally different from the kinds of capabilities that humans typically develop, and from what we typically imagine ourselves capable of. But the idea that machines are capable of operating with such disregard for truth is becoming increasingly important, as increasingly is the case with social media and AI.The discovery that Facebook has AI systems trained to spot fake news stories is a good example of how machines are being used to fabricate narratives. These systems routinely debunk seemingly legitimate claims, but they also regularly fabricate narratives that fit within the context of the site or network of networks that the site has just been built upon. For instance, if the discovery of a particular news story triggered an AI system to re-predict a number of things, including headlines and news</text>

The breakthrough came when the researchers switched to using ‘Deep Belief Networks’ to train the network, and allowed the shapes and small changes to propagate throughout the system at a faster rate. At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – identifying genuine photos as altered versions – which further shortened the validity of the claim.At this point, the researchers were left with two choices: either to declare the photos genuine and start all over again, or to revert to their original work and try again with a cleaner network, or to revert to their original work and try again with a cleaner network but with diminishing returns. So they did both, and while they are on the same page ideologically, they are operating at very different speeds. What the Deep Belief Network achieves is a degree of transparency into the system, whereas what AI does is more internalised and relies on deeper principles and algorithms. As the saying goes, ‘Big Data’ is the future, and while this may or may not be true in the long term, it is true that as more images are digitised and stored in a cloud, there is a growing need for secrecy. In addition to the increased transparency of images, images with metadata that identify the photographer and</text>

At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – patterns it identified as genuine – but it was unable to determine whether or not the images were genuine. Eventually, the team decided to completely remove the threat of fake images from the network, and to publish a software update that completely erased the need to perform deep neural networks in the network. This allowed the researchers to completely eradicate any vulnerabilities from the system, and to actually make the system more secure by introducing ‘temporal dependencies’ into the system.At this point, the real challenge lies in convincing a broader public that the benefits of such a system outweigh the risks. It may be that the benefits of such a system are so profound that they outweigh the risks, but the question remains whether or not the benefits are realised in the system at large. For the sake of discussion, let's assume that the benefits of ‘Transform[1]’ outweigh the risks, and that the system is able to achieve critical mass. What might be called ‘transform[2]�</text>

At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – areas where images with certain properties supposedly stood out more – but even at this stage the researchers were surprised at the levels of false consciousness that were being generated. When the researchers switched to using a completely different type of deep reinforcement learning algorithm, they were even more surprised to see significant improvements in the performance – albeit with some people still showing some degree of false consciousness. This type of reinforcement learning involves adding new layers of code to existing networks, rather than replacing existing layers of code, to ensure that networks continue to learn and grow.In a nutshell, this type of reinforcement learning involves adding new layers of code to existing networks, rather than replacing existing layers of code, to ensure that networks grow in complexity and adapt to changes in the world around them. In other words, it involves more than the re-implementation of a function or algorithm; it involves conscious thought and action.

The breakthrough came when the researchers switched to using ‘Deep Belief Networks’ to train the network, and allowed the shapes and small changes to propagate throughout the system at a faster rate. At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – patterns that mimic the shapes of objects but are in fact actively sabotaging the system by detecting and correcting flaws before they become evident.The discovery has now led to new kinds of defences being developed – systems that detect and correct flaws before they become apparent and objects that lie between user and workstation without requiring any interaction from the user – but it also raises the question of just how capable the human being is in the face of such overwhelming amounts of data and massive amounts of data generated continuously online. How are the human capacities that enable object recognition – the kinds of abilities that come with the digital interface – sustained over the long term in the face of this massive amount of data? If the digital interface is constantly being updated with new data, and if this data becomes increasingly complex, then the kinds of abilities that allow human interpretation and interaction become increasingly difficult to maintain. In addition, how are the kinds of biases and imperfections that characterise the digital interface maintained? If the digital interface is constantly being</text>

The breakthrough came when the researchers switched to using ‘Deep Belief Networks’ to train the network, and allowed the shapes and small changes to propagate throughout the system at a faster rate. At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – identifying genuine representations as ‘fakes’ – but denying the appearance of such behaviour entirely.Deep Belief Networks are algorithms that recognize data before it has reached a human being; they are similar to how computer programs recognise data, but unlike human programs, recognise data in a pattern and not in its ordered sequence. In other words, they can ‘see’ patterns and ‘think’ without the need for explicit instruction or programming. One could argue that this approach to recognising data in this way is akin to magic, but the fact of its being automated and automated only goes to show that humans are still at the core of such systems. If such recognisers can be made with relatively low levels of programming, then there is no reason why they cannot be made with greater levels of abstraction and human interpretation. Indeed, the more we think about how data is generated and transmitted, the more we realise how crucial it is that humans have access to this data. A person walking</text>

At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – patterns that falsely detectably identify objects in photos as authentic, but also objects that cannot be reconciled with the truth – an effect that can be exploited in advertising.As the researchers point out, this level of performance is unheard of in the human computer system, and is therefore highly desirable. But what is more desirable is the implementation of such systems in a practical way, in conditions that encourage human behaviour and creativity. That is, systems that can detect and correct for the imperfection in photos, but also systems that can learn to recognise genuine representations of things – objects that have meaning and functioned in ways that evolve over time – something called Pattern Recognition. The ability to fabricate elaborate systems to recognise patterns is what makes the computer possible. And while the human capacity for creative computation is admirable, the system that emerges from the resulting programs must also have the capacity and will to carry these representations out, with or without human intervention. Towards that end, the researchers suggest that such systems be</text>

The breakthrough came when the researchers switched to using ‘Deep Belief Networks’ to train the network, and allowed the shapes and small changes to propagate throughout the system at a faster rate. At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – identifying genuine representations only at a higher level of abstraction. The authors are adamant that the network was trained to only recognise &quot;true positives&quot; – meaning patterns that emerge from actual interaction with the world around us. The implication is that when faced with a photograph that is fabricated or manipulated in some way, the system will distort or ignore the photograph in some way. For this to happen, the researchers would have to have vast amounts of data to analyse, something that can only be done with the support of a research institute.The discovery opens new directions for the way in which images are interpreted, and sets in motion a chain of events that could one day lead to fully autonomous images. The question remains whether the same kinds of human biases that allow human interpretation would also allow autonomous interpretation. That is, could the network be taught to identify genuine images as doctored images, and act accordingly? That sounds like magic to us, but it could also lead to miraculous results.

At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – patterns that falsely detectors incorporate into systems – but it also started to produce significant amounts of false negatives. Finally, the team managed to produce a system that accurately identifies between 20 and 30 per cent of the time, which is still considered to be relatively advanced.This is not to suggest that human speech or AI can do it, but rather to show that the architecture of our computer systems does need to be modified in order to support creative or subtle behaviour. The breakthrough came when the researchers switched to modifying the network parameters involved in speech synthesis to make it more difficult for the network to falsely detect fake words, while also increasing the rate at which neural networks were rewired. This increased the effective kernel of error below 20 per cent, which is considered to be acceptable.This raises the question, what kinds of behaviours can be simulated in this evolving technology? One possible approach is to create ‘virtual communities’ – groups of computers that communicate with one another via networks – which would allow members</text>

At this point, the network started to generate significant amounts of false positives – pattern recognising software that incorrectly identifies genuine objects – which is similar to the way that viruses cause damage to data.However, unlike viruses, which can be identified and contained within computer programs, falsehood does not spread at the speed of information. Rather, the false positives propagate at a rate that destroys valuable sources of information, such as history and heritage, as well as eroding the credibility of those institutions that create and maintain online publics. So while the network identified and contained the problem, it did not have the credibility or the skills to detect forgeries or fabrications. Its impressive power comes from the fact that it is composed of so many different components that can easily be changed within the confines of the operating system. Such flexibility is desirable in a system designed to monitor and change – but also because it allows the exploiter of the system to create ‘fake news’ – think Isis or Daesh – when it makes sense to do so.The upshot of all this is that</text>

The wilderness space is seen not only as a location for physical and cultural reclaimance, but also as a site of potential corporate breeding grounds for sustainable development. The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological monographs seems to be that humans will always occupy pockets or small regions of the planet, and that such occupancy is inevitable given the growth of industrial civilization. But as biennials and other exhibitionary venues around the world became more and more of a reality, and as biennials themselves became more and more autonomous, this assumption became increasingly difficult to square with the increasingly frequent empirical documentation of human-animal behaviour that is produced by the evidence of ever-more elaborate laboratories and massive imaging apparatuses. The question of who is entitled to occupy what space and who is entitled to make decisions about how that space is used seems to be playing out increasingly on a global or transnational scale. The term ‘exhibition’ has been elevated to describe a kind of ­collective ‘imagination around a theme’.7 This kind of global or ‘collective imagination’ is one that is more easily mobilized and visible than the local or local-specific imaginaries that are</text>

The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological monographs is that ecosystems operate between people on an interrelated and confessional level, yet their natural habitats essentially exist outside the public realm. In the words of Francis Galton, an American ecologist, who was the first to apply the concept of biological space to ecological systems, including human-generated ones, ‘the human species, although divided into numerous and variable kinds, is an ephemeral cultural presence, trapped in a temporal succession of transient and varying constant‐time “[1]  inhabitants.’ As Galton indicates, cultural ecology today is more like a public relations campaign than a science; it is heavily dependent on the self promotion of the artist or his or her team, but also relies on the integrative activities of cultural‐institutional relations and the self support of a self‐selected cadre of artists, educators, journalists and others committed to the maintenance of the narratives that are sold as ‘naturalistic’ to the ‘</text>

The wilderness space is seen not only as a location for physical and cultural reclaimance, but also as a site of potential corporate breeding grounds for sustainable development. The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological / urban planning programmes seems to be that natural resources – including mineral resources – are the future, and that the future therefore necessarily has to be populated with people. As ecological and urbanists-in-waiting, we’re assigned the task of creating the kinds of places – aesthetically speaking – that can simultaneously be inhabited and colonised. The challenge then becomes how to harness the architectural and design talents of a growing number of local experts to resolve the problems of ‘food deserts’ while simultaneously accommodating the needs of a growing population.  Acknowledging that food deserts are real and that they can be addressed with some degree of success, Hamilton proposes three strategies for the future of her adopted hometown: (i) cooperate more closely with city governments and the ‘Big Three’ banks to reduce or eliminate the need for eminent domain and allow more space for public realm, particularly for artists’ studios and exhibitionary venues; (ii) create municipally-owned ‘green</text>

The wilderness space is seen not only as a location for physical and cultural reclaimance, but also as a site of potential corporate breeding grounds for sustainable development. The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological and urban planning approaches seems to be that nature has already ordained that certain areas be preserved and endowed with a set of distinctive characteristics – a primacy, a certain level of diversity, and so forth. In short, the planners imagine a landscape already endowed with these characteristics, and thus have a clear and consistent understanding of what kinds of management regimes are possible there. The problem with this vision and these notions of primacy and of naturalness is that nature herself often acts in unpredictable and sometimes disruptive ways. If managed properly, these developments can hasten the demise of certain kinds of urban form – as has been the case in Cairo, Los Angeles and New York – but also of some kinds of indigenous social life and biennials. Furthermore, if these kinds of urban forms are to be saved, they need to be managed in a way that doesn’t annihilate others. This seems to be the prevailing political and economic mindset in the USA and much of Western Europe. But how do we know</text>

The wilderness space is seen not only as a location for physical and cultural reclaimance, but also as a site of potential corporate breeding grounds for sustainable development. The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological, urban and urban planning processes is to a large extent determined by the availability of food, which is ascribed a positive value by virtue of being a scarce resource. If the boundaries between the natural and the engineered are blurred, the latter is expected to experience a value-add in terms of both physical and institutional forms. In the case of rapidly increasing rates of industrialisation in the developing world, it is likely that this boundary-blurring is even more pronounced. It is quite possible that the boundaries between the natural and the engineered may become so blurred that the former may be replaced with cross-breeding operations. This is the scenario being run in the US right now, as the federal government attempts to reinstate a manufacturing base in the wake of the disastrous economy created by the disastrous policies of the last eight years of war. The revival of the landscape is being used as a site for the production of high-end products and services, primarily for the benefit of a few financial institutions and their shareholders.</text>

The wilderness space is seen not only as a location for physical and cultural reclaimance, but also as a site of potential corporate breeding grounds for sustainable development. The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological and urban discourse has shifted from the land into the increasingly critical ecological and social concomitant of urbanisation in the context of increasingly frequent, and increasingly variable, extreme weather events. Such political and ecological concomitant shifts are no doubt factors in the proliferation of biennials, which seem to be able to more readily exploit places with a high degree of urbanicity. Biennialism has become an internationalised practice. New York may not be the only city to have its own biennale, but it is the only city with its own recurring biennale. New York is the international symbol of the biennale. At the 2006 Venice Biennale, over 200,000 people visited the city. Biennials are popular with tourists, and to a large extent, they thrive in such a climate. The biennial level of tourism generates significant subsidies to the city. A biennial can be a powerful symbolic weapon, able to simultaneously generate major public and private investments while remaining tax-</text>
    <text>project raises questions about how human biodiversity is managed through the industrial agricultural system, and what kinds of ecological and urban systems might be built around the production of food in the interests of large corporations. The publication of this book coincided with the publication of two related periodicals, one in the US, the other in the UK. The second US publication, Fast Company, ran two issues in its February 2007 issue devoted to the topic ‘food deserts’. The term ‘food desert’ refers to areas of the world with arid or semi-arid conditions, and the development of biennials, fairs and other exhibitionary venues there to attract business and tourism. It is used synonymously with the term ‘wilderness space’. The wilderness space is seen not only as a location for physical and cultural reclaimance, but also as a site of potential corporate breeding grounds for sustainable development. The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological/biennial format has not changed: it is about developing nations and specific places. The issue of where those borders ought to be drawn remains unresolved as well. The boundaries of the new form of ecological observationally oriented curatorial practice, then, remain unresolved. This presents a set of questions that, as the subtitle of the second US publication of the journal suggests, are of global consequence.I. What is the Boundary Commission? 	The Boundary Commission was a US federal commission established in 1970 to recommend to the President an appropriate form of federalism for the federal territory comprising British Columbia and Northern California.1 	The commission’s mandate was twofold: (1) to ensure that the nation’s borders were permanently fixed; and (2) to ensure that the nation’s jurisdiction over those borders would be absolute, unlimited and uncorrupted.2 	The commission was unequivocal in its determination that federalism is the applicable mode of governance in the</text>

The premise of the new ecological and urban discourse surrounding large-scale agricultural and biennale production in the Americas seems to be the re-embracing of indigenous territories and cultures, in an attempt to repurpose them in the interests of large corporations. The publication of two volumes of his work in quick succession, including an expanded and updated version of his much-loved, much-criticised, much-loved first one in 2006, quickly gave place to the publication of three volumes in 2015 and 2018, covering a total of fourteen countries and regions: North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, respectively. These three volumes cover a wide range of topics, covering topics ranging from economics to geopolitics to social change. The subject matter that is addressed in each volume is drawn from a number of different disciplines. These cover topics from architecture and landscape architecture to urban development and postcolonial studies. The volume covers of each discipline are organized chronologically, starting from the volume that came first.</text>

The wilderness space is seen not only as a location for physical and cultural reclaimance, but also as a site of potential corporate breeding grounds for sustainable development. The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological and urban discourse is that large-scale ecological systems must be dramatically altered in order to accommodate the emergence of ever more demanding and resource-intensive biennials featuring ever more intensive agricultural production, but also in order to support the increasingly precarious and energy-intensive use of fossil fuels. If, as the ecological movement has promoted, the ecological is the social and the urban is the ecological, then the urban and the biennale must simultaneously exist. In an ideal world, the biennale would be a worldwide phenomenon, encompassing not just the cities but also the periphery. But as the ecological movement has promoted, this is not always possible. The biennale has traditionally been an event confined to a local elite of artists, curators, art collectors and others with a clear interest in preserving and promoting the cultural practices of a particular region. But as biennials proliferate in Europe and North America, and as the biennial has become a global cultural phenomenon, a diversification of practices is</text>

The wilderness space is seen not only as a location for physical and cultural reclaimance, but also as a site of potential corporate breeding grounds for sustainable development. The question of where the boundaries of this potential territory lie remains unresolved. The premise of the new ecological and urban planning approaches seems to be that nature herself, not to mention humanity, is the solution to the problem of agricultural decline. The ‘wilderness space’ seems to be an ideal location for the establishment of large corporate plantations, which would occupy both the land and the water. This is supported by the notion that the ‘natural components of the landscape, such as mountains, rivers and grasslands, are especially suited to support ‘high-performance, high-value sites’, or ‘capable of supporting a growing number of businesses’.1  The assumption is that the new economic development strategies would relocate to locations where the environmental and urban considerations would be most clearly differentiated.  In the absence of such differentiation, the boundaries of the new economic zones would remain open to corporate and political colonization. It is evident that the dominant forms of labour in the new economic space would be those requiring minimal resources, such as typographers and writers, while the infrast</text>

Perhaps neighbourhood groups, neighbourhood watch coalitions or neighbourhood activism via grassroots groups could emerge to serve as the platform for such initiatives.Such innovative approaches to envision alternative futures for neighbourhoods are not new, but recent examples include: in Liverpool, for example, which opened its streets to artist-led 'Creative Time' projects; in New York, where community gardens sprung up alongside of the city’s largest ever residential building programme, which led to a decline in 'problem areas' and allowed for the creation of mixed-use districts; in Bristol, where residents formed into nascent urban citizen committees to fight littering and restore public realm; and in San Francisco, where citizens established 'The Olde English Times’ to chronicle the city’s old ways.   Aims such as these have one thing in common: they are not designed to please or return anything to the city; they are designed to amelior</text>

But in the present, the actions of individuals can also shape collective ‘truth’.In the end, the question remains whether the resistance to neo-liberalism today can be built on an understanding of its history or whether the future, if it presents itself, will be defined by the past. Perhaps the future is already here and now, ‘here’ being a sufficient shorthand. We simply do not know what that future might be, or rather, what actions, if any, the localities take to defend themselves against what is shaping up to be an invader and coloniser class (if not, then who knows?).This article was originally commissioned by and published in Sloan Science &amp; Research &amp; Research University, Manchester.

Perhaps communities with histories of anti-racist activism in the 1970s and 1980s could be forged through such practices, joining forces to combat injustice and advancing progressive change through dialogue and negotiation.Perhaps the key to the success of such a movement is for such organisers to disengage and instead of being at the centre of decision-making, empower communities to make their own minds up. This would mean engaging with the issues and coming up with creative solutions that actually work for communities rather than trying to impose solutions that will be beneficial to all stakeholders but most certainly not benefiting any particular community. Such organisations would gain credibility and increase access to resources and knowledge, but they would also become less able to claim and hold onto those who are most needed and deserve to be closer to the places where violence and instability are rife.In the end, I believe that the key to the success of projects like the one described above is for such entities to dissolve and instead of being at the centre of decision-making, empower communities to make their own minds up.

Perhaps communities with histories of anti-racist activism in the 1970s and 1980s could be forged through such practices, joining forces to fight back the violence raining down on communities in the city. Perhaps it would involve creating co-operative ‘housing trusts’ that jointly owned and operated housing projects in and around the city, with a mandate to revitalise areas where poverty and segregation exist, while creating jobs and providing affordable housing to residents in and outside of the city.Perhaps the only limit to the power of symbolic action in the service of socio-politically responsive solutions will be the imagination of the planners. But as the financialisation of urban and local infrastructure becomes increasingly apparent to all, the need for activists to step back and re-position symbolic action – that is, the ability to achieve change through symbolic action – will become evident. Perhaps the only way to truly know is to take concrete action, and that requires activists to put in the work.Download this article as PDFJennifer LutherJenny PovichJenny Povich is a Brooklyn-based artist.

Perhaps what is needed is not an ideology of individual empowerment, but an ethic of collective responsibility. Perhaps what is needed is a system that not only provides the means to implement such an ideology, but also encourages such an ethic by enabling social and economic systems to operate according to the values of the community. We need to find out what such an ethic entails, in order to create a local alternative to the urban sprawl favoured by global capitalist patriarchy.Download this article as PDFLauren Jessop and Nadine Attewell-White 	The project started in 2015 with the publication of two books: one on the history of Community Arts and Culture in Britain, and the other on the history of Community Arts and Culture in Ireland.

Such a project, however, would not be forgeworld, nor a ‘village stage’ – a stage chosen by the city to show the city’s true colours, let alone offer any possibility of redemption or resolution.   Another possibility is to emulate the initiatives carried out by the 1980’s Black International, whose members included prominent artists, activists and critics, as well as community organisers, in an attempt to trace the path of anti-racist activism through that period.   A third is to turn to the 1990s Black International USA (Black International) and its sister organisation, the International Black Organisation (IBO), which provided resources, training and support to local Black partners throughout the world.   An attempt to trace the origins of anti-racist activism amongst black intellectuals in the 1980s could be found in Jeanne Robinson’s</text>

Perhaps communities with histories of anti-racist activism in the 1970s and 1980s could be forged through such practices, joining forces to challenge the systems that enable racist ideologies to flourish. Community organisers such as myself have long known that it was vitally important to us to have contacts in key government departments and to be able to access channels of communication with officials willing to act in the best interest of the community. We also knew that it was critical that we established relationships with experts in our community who could shape the future of our area in ways positive and negative. One such relationship was forged through the work of the Black Education Movement, founded in 1980 by academics Ken Thompson, Stephen L. Tisch and Jeanne Robinson. The Black Education Movement was a network of over 100 community colleges and universities that sought to create an alternative to for-profit education through research, teaching and organising. It was not only an academic exercise, but it was a political one. It was not just an academic exercise, but it was a political one because it fundamentally challenged the notion that a university could legislate or criminalise discourse.</text>

And perhaps what is needed is a role for imagination not necessarily mandated by the state, but rather encouraged and empowered by it. I do not claim to have the answers, nor do I claim to possess the knowledge, but I do believe that what works for one location may not work for another. And I believe that what really defines success for any community is for such communities to actively seek and create it, whether that is through organising themselves, forming community based organisations, initiating legal action, creating their own art projects or simply by seeking out and engaging with opportunities that exist outside of the conventional and conventional wisdom.

And this is a very subtle way of putting it, but it’s also the point where in the 1980s and early 1990s, the biennial entered into a mutually beneficial relationship with the city that at one point or another was prepared to accept that it was hosting a cultural event. That relationship became very complicated and expensive if the biennial didn’t change course and host something more permanent.  The interesting thing about the biennial is that it goes back to its earliest days. When I first started in 1997, there was a proposal to host an exhibition of the</text>

I think that there was some confusion about what the boundaries were, and how to get involved. There was some resistance, but I think that in the end the business was able to operate within the parameters of the plan, and the boundaries were crossed.  	And what about the remaining fifty trees that were cut down as part of the project? What do they represent? I don’t think that they represent the original intent of the project, nor do I think that they represent the cultural significance of the place today. The intention of the city was always to accrue historic timber, so I think that the decision to downsize was probably made with the understanding that this wouldn’t be celebrated as a city tradition. It would be renovated as a conservation area, and the trees would serve as a reminder of the past.  	And what about the people who now live around the periphery of the city?

That happened eventually, and now the biennial occupies a prominent position in the city, but in the intervening time it has acquired a second identity – that of the cultural tourism operator. Its tentacles are all over the place, now that the biennial has achieved critical mass.When the biennial first started, there were around 200 museums in the city, but now there are over 1,000. The interesting thing is that some of the newer institutions, such as the Performing Arts centre, have a very low attendance. Even when it has a large programme of performances under its belt, the number of people attending the arts programme is low. IMI Corona did pretty well with this low profile; it achieved much of its purpose through word of mouth.

The biennial has become a multi-year venture, and the biennial now has a life of its own. IMI Corona was an event that could last anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. It could also be a ploy to seed an entire business plan around it. I think we saw that in the business plans that were put together, a certain amount of planning was clearly being done internally, to ensure that this wasn’t just a one-off. As the business plan developed, so did the seeds. The more successful the seeds were, the more opportunities there were for this event to develop into something more. It’s as if the biennial has a plan. It was a difficult process to have the art come out of the blue and fly by the honeybee, because the biennial in its current form is impenetrable and unimaginative, but at the same time it’s life-sustaining. It’s impossible to top, but if the life of the biennial becomes unmanageable, then something has to give. The key is to make the life of the biennial as real and precarious as possible. 	As an artist, my job is to deliver something to the biennial as faithfully and metaphorically as possible. I have a unique perspective and relationship to the museum, and I’m able to deliver storytelling through art while putting the museum at the centre of a very real, very emotional and difficult situation. The museum, as an entity, plays a very important role</text>

It was an interesting way to think about the relationship between art and labour, and the impact that some of the ideas had on the art world. There’s a sense, I think, that there’s a way of the biennial that’s as important as the art world.“[1]  It’s also worth noting that, although the idea of the biennial has come to encompass a lot of art history, the actual practice doesn’t necessarily align with this. The big biennials, the Tate Moderns, the Whitney Biennials, the Gettys, the Joshutterys, the Bloomsbury Arts Biennials – they all have their own distinctive way of putting themselves in the historical context, but they also tend to be quite literalised, particularly in the United States.

The more successful the seeds were, the more opportunities there were for the biennial to emerge out of the looser version of the logic that was put together internally. For the most part, those internal inconsistencies were worked out in the context of the business plan, and the biennial itself emerged out of that. At its best, the logic that we developed allowed us to imagine a different kind of logic, where the temporal parameters could be adjusted in real-time. In other words, what was happening now could be followed sometime in the future.                        1. See, for example, Lisa Parks and Nicole Stoner, eds.,   	Modern Painters: The Art of Painting 	, Ponte City, New York, 2000.  2.

I think the real conflict here was between those who wanted to see the biennial as a long-term investment, and those who didn’t want to see it overtaken by the biennial. I think that the latter was the dominant vision. The conflict between the long-term investor and the new crop of entrepreneurs was a conflict that the biennial was happy to play into.   Preeana Reddy: I think that the real tension here was between the biennial as an institution, which you and I are sitting around talking about, and the emerging phenomenon of the biennial as an event that is so fluid and can be pulled in many directions at the same time. And I think that the biennial, as an artistically significant cultural production, is like that. It’s very difficult to define precisely what a biennial is, or what it means to be a cultural production, but</text>

And there we were, a business plan developed, a few big plans, and the juice from the biennial slowly turning into the juice of the retail market. Things got bigger and more complicated, but we all realised that this was still relatively uncomplicated. There was still a lot of work to do, but once things were put together well, it was possible to have some fun and make some connections. Things started to click. Things that had been contained started to be opened up and made visible. Things started to look different now. Things are much harder to define, but there is a shift now. And as such, things are more open to interpretation. For me, personally, this has meant opening up things in a different way. I think this is a cultural thing. Things have changed in a lot of places, but I don’t see a lot of similarity between the way that the art world and the biennial are approaching things now</text>

The more successful the seeds were, the more likely the whole project was to come alive again, and the more likely we were to be able to support the art. The more the art was embedded in the project, the more was the biennial designed to play host to it. So the greater the embedding, the healthier the first crop. And the more is the murals sprayed, the better the crop. It’s a symbiotic process. The more we embraced the art, the more we wanted to come to the biennial and do other things, the more was the biennial going to be able to feed off the budding art industry.But the art industry has its own set of forces, and the ability of the curators to suspend their disbelief and move the art forward was severely weakened. There were times when the art was put in a different form, and the biennial in turn had to deal with the increased commercialisation of art, both in terms of visibility and income.

This was a particularly interesting concept for a business plan to have a point of entry into the city. The fact that it was being done as a biennial opened up a whole new set of questions. Questions about what the biennial could be, how it should operate, and so forth. I think that the question of what the biennial could be and in what form it should take was an area where a lot of interest and discussion took place. While this wasn’t necessarily a position that the artists or organisers of IMI Corona found most interesting, there was a sense that questions of power and jurisdiction and the place of art in the city were of value to a city of over a million people.

Despite being found in abundance in every direction, seaweed has only recently begun to make a difference in regulating the climate. A species that regularly produces five to six million eggs a year (with up to 90% of these destined for the ocean) and feeds on microscopic plankton in the water column is in for a radical rethink. As the marine environment warms and the ocean absorbs more of the heat that it produces, the North Atlantic sub-species is on the cusp of a tipping point. If global warming continues to accelerate, as scientists expect it to, then the likelihood of this happening becomes increasingly remote.

The question is pertinent not only because of the tremendous amounts of water and carbon that are being pumped into the UK via the built environment (highways, tunnels, bridges). It is also because of the rapid growth of population in the UK: 	over a million people are added to the population every day, 	and yet the built environment (including infrastructure) consumes an enormous amount of water and produces a great deal of greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite this apparent contradiction, the UK government seems determined to expand its nuclear power stations and other fossil-fuel dependent energy sources in the wake of the predicted diminishing rate of growth. 	What can be done to address this contradiction? 	There are several initiatives that seek to address this contradiction through research and education, but none of them stand a chance against the entrenched interests of the nuclear and fossil-fuel industry, which would rather see the city produced via their techno-scientific means of increasing output than situate</text>

If the cities ceased to be the sites of industrial production and circulation, and if the cities instead became places of creative, dynamic and participatory urban existence? I believe that is the potential shift that needs to happen in order to address the city’s increasing scarcity of resources and equally scarce use of space. I also believe that a city can only be greened if it is densely populated and has a thriving arts and cultural sector, which is the only sector capable of supporting itself through its own resources. Without a thriving arts and cultural sector, there is no city. The challenge then becomes how to support the arts and culture sector in the creation and expansion of a city, while simultaneously supporting the emergence of a diverse range of alternative urban experiences and practices that are not confined to the urban centres.‘In a nutshell,’ says Coleman, responding to the question, ‘what would</text>

If, instead, we embarked on a Quest to Understand Ecology and Start Creating by creating an eco-system that would allow for the emergence of new social forms? If we started with simple ecological principles, based on current trends and current environmental dilemmas, and applied them to create an ecologically sustainable future urbanisation for our planet, then we would undoubtedly start to see the fruits of our labour in the shape of cities, although this is not at the moment possible with the current economic model. The current economic and political systems we have built are too entrenched and politically neutralised to allow for the emergence of new social forms. Nevertheless, there are certain fundamental changes that can be made, in the direction of a more ecological and equitable future urbanisation, without compromising existing systems and hierarchies. So, what are some of the most pressing problems of our urban future? What are the priorities for a city to be green? How might the city produce</text>

What would be the Greening of the planet if we stopped being consumers of the natural resources of the planet? These are amongst the questions that confront us as we embark on the second edition of the Future City symposium. This is the opportunity to share experiences and identify breakthrough opportunities, in order to assist in the design of future cities that are not reliant on the production of resources, but instead nurture their own economies and serve the needs of their citizens.  A presence and energy of more than a few hundred delegates is all it took for a grassroots movement to initiate the creation of what is perhaps the most progressive city in the UK, but which is also the most fearful and unstable. The creation of sustainable ways of enabling a city to thrive, sustainably meet its needs and dreams, while rejecting the destructive effects of resource dependency, is the real opportunity of the ‘greening’.

And if we started to look at the bright side of things?  I think we could start to build green spaces and create mini-guilds around our houses and parks, where people come together to share in the creation of a place and participate in its creation. This would make a great event for a number of reasons. It would make us conscious urban geeks and make us citizens – a change from how we live our lives. It would also make us citizens of a much larger city.  The second reason is that we already own chunks of the city. We have large mortgages and property portfolios. If we park our cars in the park, we don’t own a house but if we buy a house through a public works project, we own the house and parkour is a last resort. We already own the chunks, and creating a mini-society around the chunks would give us leverage and make us homeowners</text>

The answer is obvious – let the market decide. But the way in which the surplus has been frittered away in the UK is such that the question of what to do with it – whether that means letting the market decide or pulling the plug on fossil fuels entirely – looms large. A Greening of Britain would see Britain take back control of its cities and are already beginning to implement some of those changes. What I’m doing in Liverpool is just the beginning. I want to work with local authorities, local businesses, grassroots groups and other partners to take the city forward and create new ways of using the surplus that will make it more productive, collaborative and inclusive for everyone.This is the second part of a two-part research project.

If we instead started helping each other to build our futures? If we started to treat the city as a source of creativity, of learning, of possibilities? If,  we started to call it home? This book is the sequel to JAMIE: Fracturing Britain, the first book in the Greening series, which looked at the UK's urban ruins and the problems that remain after deindustrialisation? This book is the first in a trilogy of books about the city, and it uses the ruins to explore the past and present of urbanisation in the UK. It draws on the experiences of the author’s two young children, as well as material from The Daily Worker, the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph. The city is a place where conflict and tragedy can happen at any moment. But what happens when the city is green? What does the Greening of Britain look like?</text>

Whether we’re talking about the countryside or cities, the concept of the ‘greening’ of Britain is still very much defined by the past. The past is defined by the present and the future, and the past is both present and the future. In other words, the idea of the past is determined by the present and the future.  So what would be the greening of Britain if we don’t constantly tell each other and between us?  I would propose that we start creating future-looking projects that reflect on the past, not in terms of what’s happening now, but in terms of what can be learned from the past. What can we learn from the past?  I believe that the past is a fascinating source of ideas and strategies that we apply in the present.

In the face of such urban ills, which party is most likely to benefit? Answer: it depends. If the cities are made sufficiently dependent on the whims of the market, then inevitably politics comes into it. If the cities are made sufficiently autonomous, then it’s the market that comes out.

This has been evident in the decimation of the former Yugoslav republics, which have all but disappeared into thin air, replaced by megacities in the east. In recent years, New York and London have both started to divest themselves of their former glories, while the rest of us, trapped in our cities, are stuck in what used to be called the ‘Rust Belt’. The phrase ‘Rust Belt’ refers to the areas around major grain elevators, pipelines and refineries, where jobs once produced and where heavy industry once exerted considerable control. The rhetoric has shifted in recent years, but not all the actors in the region are ready to embrace the idea that they no longer control the situation.

In 2014 it established the first printing press in the Museum’s history, and has been developing its own printmaking operations. The Museum is a not-for-profit cultural institution with a cultural focus on the Middle East, Central America and the United States. It is dedicated to the global dissemination of knowledge about art and culture through its various exhibitionary programs, publications and educational initiatives. It maintains a permanent collection of works from its galleries, online exhibitionary platform The Gallery of Modern Art (2014–present), as well as a team of artists and designers dedicated to engaging with local cultural practices and international art-making through research-based projects in the region. The Museum’s curatorial approach to artworks from the region is informed by a three-tiered archipelago approach: exhibitions, recordings, and oral histories. The Museum is a not-for-profit cultural institution with a curatorial focus on the Middle East, Central America and the United States. It is organized into three zones: the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Art and Design in the United States and the Museum of Modern Art, the Middle East and Africa. Each has its own distinctive character and is distinct from the other. The major difference is the level of cultural interest: the Museum</text>

Inspired by the Rape of Bengal Tiger, a killing spree by farmers accused of illegally killing large carnivores became epidemic, and countries around the world mobilized to save the animals. A movement  	called the Bengal Tiger Initiative was started in Mumbai, spearheaded by artist Ganga Raina and her husband Sandeep Srivastava, and led by prominent artists including M.

The historical irony is that many of the people who developed the algorithms that underlie​ ​​the social media platforms that we use every day – Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn – were the very people who created the social media platforms that were later bought and paid for by the state. As the value of an algorithm in these cases rapidly outpaced that of a person, a company, or even a government, the ability of artists to ask tough questions and seek accountability through legal means has been circumscribed. The result has been a proliferation of algorithms that can be programmed to do many things well, while leaving much else to be desired. Conversely, the proliferation of algorithms that can be programmed to do very little but maximise shareholder returns has also empowered those in positions of power to spy on citizens, and to police the public space in ways that are almost Orwellian in their scope.

The Black Mountain Arts Centre, for example, which is predominantly funded by the Arts Council, used to run alongside the V&amp;A, and the V&amp;A also runs the Black Mountain Arts Festival. But in the 1990s, when the Arts Council started to defund the V&amp;A, the Biennial withdrew from the Biennial, and the Arts Council then reconvened, which again it did in 1998, when the Biennial was restructured and rebranded as the Biennial Royal Arts Festival. The main activity of the V&amp;A Arts Centre, as it is currently organised, is subscription-based, although artists can apply for financial support through the Biennial Fee. The primary function of the Biennial is to host, register and catalogue exhibitions of artworks created in or in connection with the arts. And yet in a 1990s vernacular, the arts were usually seen as a dirty word, a hindrance to public enlightenment or a subversive force</text>

By understanding how photos are organised (using principles of art and science), the technology can detect patterns between photos, images, and even objects, thereby giving artists a way to discern between good and bad images, even if they are doing so on a purely aesthetic level.

The need to monitor and control artistic practices is real, and institutions themselves are subject to the whims of powerful technologists. And while the need for art to be available via codes is real, the need to monitor and control everything that happens within that art is material. Artists are artists, and like everyone else, they make mistakes.

One of the first artists to embrace this perforce was Arjun Appadurai, who worked with IBM and created ‘Bullet with Anand Menon’, a fairly crude but powerful application for  the new breed of supercomputer that combined modern and ancient maths.Bullet with Anand Menon was originally published in 1971, in which time there was considerable excitement about how the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence would change everything, from how to diagnose illnesses to predicting the behaviour of financial markets. The novel centres on a group of students led by Manoj Sinha at IIM Bangalore who are developing an application, 'Bullet', that predicts, in part, what kind of artwork will be produced by a university faculty member or artist.

Both the human artist and the technologist is exposed to the aesthetic threat posed by the growing cognitive infrastructure of connected devices, apps and platforms. The threat to the autonomy of the artist is addressed, as well as the threat posed by the fact that such systems are increasingly exposed to media of their own creation, and that artists are increasingly exposed to audiences not trained to use the technology.

His public persona was that of a monk travelling in the desert, resisting evil and pursuing eternal life, but his works, which were typically self-contained and confined to a specific region of the globe, often dealt with political and social issues. Buchel’s work, which addressed themes of poverty, oppression and political imprisonment around the globe, was frequently at odds with the proclaimed progressive intentions of the biennale, which were often filtered through a lens of economic development and environmentalism.  In the biennale’s own words: ‘every art project is a marathon, not a sprint.’[5] And this is where the ethical question is put. In the case of biennales, the</text>

The proliferation of computer programming in schools and the burgeoning of hi-tech start-ups at this time was a natural extension of this base. The ‘brain drain’ – artists leaving the US to pursue careers in Europe or elsewhere – was a stark reality in places such as New York and London. So the need for art to be able to adapt to these new technological systems was critical. But this also meant that the art had to be able to change, to adapt to the changing needs of state power and</text>

The CBDA Brighton East team worked closely with local community designers to develop a shared set of responses to a range of questions that were posed in a local local design competition. The questions asked addressed how to support the creation of a Future City for Brighton and Hove, how to support the creation of an independent Community Board, and how to support the development of knowledge about the area. A total of eleven design proposals were received, all of which addressed the same questions. The questions focused on the role of the local authority, with specific proposals relating to the role of the CBDA in the development of a Future City. The involvement of local artists, cultural professionals and architects was also valued.

At the same time, the city was experiencing a rapid population explosion and the construction of new housing fuelled the exponential growth of the needs of the burgeoning city. In an effort to support a growing population through a low cost and high quality of life, the city was turning to measures such as ‘greening’ and ‘rebuilding’ programmes. In an effort to support these initiatives, the city was turning to measures such as ‘asset lock’ and ‘devolution’.  	However, as the city expanded, it became increasingly difficult to maintain and even contrary to the goals of the city, which were turning towards greater public subsidies and control, that there was no longer a clear separation between research and management. In the 1990s, a new generation of architects were brought into the mix, and it was at this point that</text>

It emerged from the wider notion of the ever-present, of habitation, of cities as ever-present environments that constantly reconfigure themselves in response to changing conditions. This constant redefinition of the terms and parameters of everyday life, and their resultant social and political entanglements, is at the root of our current economic predicament. And yet, despite this constant and inexorable changing of terms, the future that we envision for ourselves as a result of what might be imagined possibilities lies not in the economic future but in a radically different future, where people are no longer bound by the parameters of location, location, location, and so on. 	In this radically different future, the future that is no longer bound by the economic or spatial past, but can freely assume and create</text>

The biennial would not only reveal the local conditions that exist within a city, but it would also allow a variety of voices to be heard in the city, allowing for the prioritisation of areas of focus. For instance, a biennale that focuses on art and its practitioners might prioritise areas with a high concentration of art venues, or places with a high concentration of artists, over areas with a high concentration of factory and office parks, or other types of ‘plant-based environments’.

It should be able to emerge independently, creatively and organically from the surrounding context.This is a difficult quality to cultivate in a city, especially one as large as New York. The challenge becomes how to read the surrounding local artworld and urban environment and incorporate that into the ethos of the biennial. The city is populated with distinct neighbourhoods – the Inner East Village, the Lower East Side, the Upper East Side – that are home to a multitude of arts venues, but they also include many public spaces, parks and public galleries that are devoted to a specific community. Although these neighbourhoods may have a significant impact on an artist’s thinking, their presence compromises the integrity of the biennial as a whole. The Inner East Village was built on top of a landfill, and its use as a biennale venue became a way to make a quick buck when the landfill became vacant. The Lower East Side was largely abandoned during the 1990s, when many artists moved to lower Manhattan; Park51, a community park that once hosted Woody Allen’s oratorio, became a venue for concerts by artists including</text>

It should be able to emerge independently, creatively and organically from the surrounding context.This is a difficult quality to cultivate, and it comes as no surprise that biennials tend to emerge as disruptive forces in a city. When the biennial fails to live up to its potential, it is usually faced with a mixture of displacement and despair. But the biennial is a specific kind of potential that is realised. It is potentiality followed through, the kind of potentiality that is realised by the biennial in the person of Peter Brook, whose exhibition Life on Mars: Art from Extinction at the British Museum opened in London, and whose work is displayed at the Carnegie Museum of Art. Brook represents the unresolved tension between the powerful biennial form realised in museums and its equally powerful counterpart embodied in the biennial itself. The former calls forth artists to engage with the latter, but the former calls upon them to engage with it comprehensively. Brook is the Norman Mailer of the biennial, and his work is a sustained series of poems that move from the high to the low. The poems invite us to look</text>

It should be able to emerge independently, creatively and organically from the surrounding context.This is a difficult quality to cultivate in a city, partly because of the multiplicity of voices and networks involved in the art and cultural life of a city. But a biennial that emerges from the surrounding context might also attract artists from elsewhere in the city, and so change the city through these artists’channel trips. The important thing, I believe, is that the biennial should be able to manifest its own idiosyncrasy and contingency through this creative oddity. This would require a city-wide action plan to be drawn up in coordination with artists, and would require the co-ordination of different art agencies, and even the co-ordination of the art itself. But if we take the idea of the biennial seriously, and start to talk about the biennial as an ongoing project, and the fact that it is projected to become a very large art institution, then we can start to imagine other kinds of art institutions – art societies, art historical societies, biennials themselves.These kinds of institutions would have</text>

It should be able to emerge independently, creatively and organically from the surrounding context.This is a difficult quality to cultivate in local institutions, whose primary focus is often one and the same thing: the city as a whole. The biennial has it in its circular structure – the art museum, the biennale, the major art fairs, the post-art fairs, the annual visitor survey, the monograph‑like ‘survey of art’. Biennials in their various forms have a tendency to dominate cultural life in the area, to dominate any and all forms of art and culture, and to do so in a way that is both reductive and exclusionary. Art is made possible by the biennial, but the real reason we have art is precisely because of the beauty that can be found in so many biennials. Biennials are a form of urbanization that are often used as a way to make a profit, and as such they are expected to be transient and ephemeral. The real ingenuity of the biennial arises when it is used creatively, as</text>

It should be able to emerge independently, creatively and organically from the surrounding context.This is a difficult quality to cultivate, and it starts with the biennial being something that is not simply an object of consumption: it must firstly and foremost exist as an artistic production, must foster a dialogue with its surrounding urban environment. In other words, it must produce meaning in the surrounding that is experienced in a specific way. The difficulty then lies in the other aspects of the project – in the form that it takes, the content and, above all, the interpretation of that meaning. If the meaning is not experienced in a specific way, then the biennial will not only not produce meaning, but it will also not be able to engage with the urban environment in a meaningful way. In a word, the hard part is yet to come.In this respect, biennials can be seen to be precursors of what we think we have today – a global biological assemblage consolidated under one flag, shared cultural histories and embodied in one language – although this is not without risk. For instance, the posthum</text>

This could, of course, lead to undesirable consequences, but the important point is that the biennial should be able to emerge out of the surrounding context in a way that is sensitive to the particularity of the situation. It should be able to emerge independently, creatively and organically from the surrounding context.This is a difficult quality to cultivate, and it begins to define the meaning of the biennial. The biennial is a visitor-producing institution, and its primary mission is to draw in visitors as much as possible. It is this kind of mission that is consistently under-appreciated within the art world. If visitors are not drawn in, or do not show up, or change their minds and come away, the biennial is left with empty spaces and unhappy exhibitors. In trying to achieve this objective, the biennial is setting itself up for disappointment, which is not a desirable state of affairs.The biennial may not always achieve this kind of momentum, but it does what it is set up to do: it exhibits and it records. It observes and it documents. In this way, it is both a catalyst and a promoter of change. This kind of institutional memory, or institutional storytelling, is very difficult to comprehend and to influence in its own right. It is much more manageable when it is enabled by art</text>

It should be able to emerge independently, creatively and organically from the surrounding context.This is a difficult quality to cultivate in a city, and it comes as no surprise that cities that have hosted major art exhibitions for many years are also the most prone to experiencing a decline in artistic activity. However, the biennial might prove able to reverse this trend. The key is in ensuring that the biennial is a biennale in the first place – one that is not trapped in the past or trapped inside the parameters of any particular city. It should be able to emerge out of its own set of cultural energies, rather than being catered to by them.This is exactly what biennials have tended to do, neglecting the latter. They tend to be melancholic, and this is understandable, but this is not how biennials are meant to be lived. The biennial is a transient phenomenon, with very few of its artists remaining permanently embedded within the artworld, and few remaining in position to become involved in the art process today. The biennial is an episodic, curatorial event that occurs</text>

The challenge for the biennial becomes a constant shifting of priorities. The city is constantly changing, and with it, the priorities that need to be shifted. In the current biennale, the main institutions that are always at the forefront of the city’s social, economic and political life are the institutions of the art museum, which are always seen as the optimal setting for the social. But in an ever-evolving city, this ideal is constantly evolving, and new mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure that the ideal is maintained. New artists and curators need to be put through the paces, and these need to be put through the wringer of finding their way through the city, meeting local needs, finding places that are convenient, engaging with the city’s infrastructure and so forth. Furthermore, bienn</text>

It should be able to emerge independently, creatively and organically from the surrounding context.This is a difficult quality to cultivate, one that most artists struggle with at some point in their careers. In the biennial context, the problem is particularly acute. The institution is faced with a huge amount of material, both financial and material, that it needs to process. It is also confronted with the ever-present issue of sustainability. The former dimension is particularly relevant, as biennials are expected to be sustainable in their funding streams. The latter dimension is particularly relevant, as biennials are an integral part of any city’s economic and cultural ecosystem. This last dimension is particularly relevant in a city like Liverpool, which has enjoyed a unique economic miracle in the context of being the financial centre of Europe. The biennial as an institution and its funding streams are intimately tied to the city’s economic growth and its effect on its residential and commercial development. If the biennial is to achieve its ecological goals, its funding streams and forms of ownership must change. For instance, it is more natural for bienn</text>

The journals that came out of the Venice Biennale in 2011, for instance, were gathered together into a single, 144-page document that offered a snapshot in time of the contested area around the Biennale. But this is just one example of the journal format's tendencies. As biennial critic Peter Osborne noted in his review of the first Venice Biennale, the increasing number of journals, their frequent publication and the fluid nature of the journal market meant that the journal became both reader-supported and ‘a last resort for a post-media culture that is losing its self-image and identity’.[8]Reading these journals every day, and continuing to read them up until the very last page, is a writer’s dream. But the biennial has its limits, and with the city’s chronic shortage of affordable housing and poor urban transformation, the biennial has to be driven hard in</text>

The exhibition on the view of the Biennale was concerned with the politics and ideologies of the present, while the other curatorial initiatives of the exhibition took this to be the present – a politics of the present that is both aesthetically pleasing to the eye and deeply injurious to the body politic. This is both a function of the architecture of the biennale as a function of the urbanisation of cities, and the social forms and ideologies of the present – a global capitalist logic of ever greater scale and social complexity that demands ever greater political and material resources for the undertaking. And yet ‘the present’ is simultaneously a view of past ‘trending’ and a mode of ‘permanent motion’ – a change in perspective from the vantage of contemporary urbanisation, or ‘global’ cities.

It was a space for the curatorial team to find a way to engage with the political context in which they were operating, while also creating a visual experience through engaging with the political notion of ‘viewpoint’ in a conceptual way.The on-view ‘found’ part of the exhibition focused on the curatorial role and ethos of the biennial as a curator-driven institution. The idea that the curatorial remit and ethos should be shared with the public (a.k.a. audience) is an idea that has been around for a long time, and it is an aspect of the ‘biennial’ that is deeply embedded in the institution’s DNA. But the on-view ‘found’ aspect of the exhibition added a ‘political’ twist. And in a way, the public, including the visiting audience, are invited to participate in the political aspect of the institution. The curatorial remit and ethos are political in nature, but the on-view ‘found’ aspect is political as well. This was true both in France and in Venice, where the public was invited to take part in a 'feudal�</text>

The exhibition ‘On the View’ was also concerned with the politics of the biennial through a ‘viewpoint’ that it projected onto the larger biennial landscape. It was a space for the curatorial team to find a way to engage with the political context in which they were operating, while also creating a visual experience through engaging with the political notion of ‘viewpoint’ in an explicit, tangible way. This approach required two things in particular: (1) an explicit political context, and (2) a way to engage with the notion of point of view through art that is both visible and invisible. The first part of the exhibition was concerned with the political, while the second part focused on the invisible. The exhibition ‘On the View’ opened by Christopher Booker, was a ‘contemporary account of the political place and contemporary challenges that the Biennale can play in urbanising nations and emerging powerhouses worldwide.’ The book captures the essence of the Biennale’s current political situation, but it is considerably more qualitative and exposes its hidden political tugs. It recounts how the 2014 Gezi Park protests ushered in a new era of protest in Istanbul, and how the Turkish government attempted to rewrite the Gezi Park case in an effort to establish a new ‘public prosecution’.

The exhibition ‘On the View’ opened with a space-time dualism, where the image was both of the past and of the future, where time and space are not reducible to measurable quantities, but can instead be utilised to make use of the capacities of individuals and collective behaviour. The exhibition ‘On the View’ ended with a question mark, which signaled the point where the viewer had exhausted all possibilities of reading into the image in any way. The viewer could still read the question mark into the image, but the author had clearly exhausted all possibilities of narrative force and thus the image fell completely flat.

The exhibition on view at the Museum of Modern Art, ‘Pointillist Painting in a World Context’, was conceived as part of the curatorial programme ‘On the View’, with artists, curators and art historians taking the opportunity of the exhibition to engage with the ways in which modern art is reproduced and reproduced in the world, and to question the systems that produce and rely on art. The curatorial remit and ethos of the 2015 Liverpool Biennial was to offer a ‘window’ into a specific chapter in the exhibitionary history of art’, but also a ‘pale imitation’ of the geopolitical conditions of contemporary art.

It was a space for the curatorial team to find a way to engage with the political context in which they were operating, while also creating a visual experience through engaging with the political notion of ‘viewpoint’ through art. The aim of the exhibition was to counter the inherent tendency for artists to project their own political leanings onto a venue and audience, by inviting the audience to project their own political leanings onto the curatorial team. The policy of ‘On the View’ was to be used as a site for the collective collective re-imagining of the place and the journey through time, through the intervention of biennials in the running of cities, and above all, in their imaginations. The policy of ‘On the View’ was to be used as a ‘point of departure’ for the taking of cities by the biennial. For the 2015 edition of  	Views on the View, the authority in Berlin was questioned, as a new perspective was sought in relation to the place and the journey of cities, and a new understanding of the biennial as an inherently historical event.

It was a space for the curatorial team to find a way to engage with the political context in which they were operating, while also creating a visual experience through engaging with the political notion of ‘viewpoint’ by which the biennial is expected to operate. This viewpoint was then sought in part through the use of themes that were already common to other curatorial programmes of art, often through themes that had been suggested by others. It was hoped that the shared commitment to ‘viewpoint’ would lead to a co-generative and democratic curatorial dynamic, one that would permit the participation of diverse points of view.  The discovery and exploration of ‘new’ ‘worlds’ by the curatorial team led to the possible incorporation of existing themes and paradigms, although this was by no means a universalisation of existing themes and paradigms. The adoption of a new idea or paradigm – be it progressive, democratic or revolutionary – is likely to elicit a great deal of discussion and controversy, especially within a programme of art that is as diverse as the boundaries that it is invited to represent. It is this sense of diversity, this precariat dynamic, that</text>

The exhibition on the view of the Biennale opened with a public audience that was engaged with and participated in the exhibition, which in turn created a space for the artist to be present in the context of the exhibition. In the case of a biennial, the audience is the point of entry into the exhibition, where they step out of the temporal parameters of the art world and into the real world, interacting with the art and the art culture in a way that is mediated by the art and culture in the biennial. The audience is not there just to be entertained or ‘taken in’. They are there because that is what the art world tells them to do. The audience is political, urban, rural, global – the very worlds that the artist inhabits. And the audience is urban because that is where his work is located.The audience is the point of entry into an art world, and in the</text>

In the event, the curatorial remit and ethos were further differentiated by the curator’s office staff, who were tasked with overseeing the activities of the biennial as a whole. They were expected to maintain a 'positive gaze' towards the city in which they were operating, while also projecting a certain amount of cynicism towards the urban conditions that they were situated in. While the role of the arts manager in the biennial must be viewed through the particular lens of its respective city, the role of the arts administrator in the biennial itself is a critical one, and one that needs to be constantly renegotiated in order to maintain a positive gaze and even a modicum of cynicism. It is this renegotiating that I was trying to do, by bringing together the various aspects of the city that I was trying to project cynicism towards, and the fact that this was happening in the same time that the biennale was happening.

The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will continue to be the case that the interests of maritime travellers and users are not being served by the infrastructure that is currently in existence. The proliferation of ports around the world is a fact of life in many urban centres; they are used as transshipment points for huge container ships, and the infrastructure supports the continued expansion of these ships through various means including the supporting infrastructure of the port itself. So while the port may have been able to be absorbed into the broader urban fabric of the metropolis, it is doubtful that it is capable of sustaining its current form as an independent entity. It may be the case that the socio-political conditions that enable and foster the proliferation of ports around the world are such that they can no longer be considered &quot;natural&quot; or ‘the way things are&quot;. But this is the very questionable and ambiguous place that the politics of portentry and immobility takes place in the developed world.

The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will remain in existence for ever. It will simply mean that its economic relationship to the port, and the political and legal status of its current form within the port, will be altered in such a way as to be more favourable to commercial interests. The key to the port’s future is in fact its capacity to change shape and to adapt to changing circumstances – changes that are largely determined by market forces – and this is what differentiates it from other elements of the metropolis.1 Transportation infrastructure is a big business today, and it is no exaggeration to say that it is the second-largest employer in Canada after the mining sector. It is also a ‘marketable commodity’ – a commodity that can be bought and sold, and one that can be physically transferred between buyers and sellers – so it is possible that the infrastructure could be repurposed to support an alternative economic system if necessary. At present, however, the port remains overwhelmingly an economic sector – a</text>

The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will continue to dominate all aspects of the globe. But it does mean that it will be challenged as often as it is being developed. The port has played a pivotal role in the evolution of globalisation, whether as a carrier of containers or as the carrier of humans – people, goods and services – around the globe. It is imperative that we as users of this infrastructure be able to identify and challenge those contributing to fuelling the infrastructure of hatred and violence. Beyond this, the port has a fundamental environmental and social function – providing access to resources, creating a marketplace for that resource, and serving as a point of transshipment between peoples, cultures and regions. It is up to us as users to exert a little influence and disrupt the systems that are generating, sustaining and creating inequality and conflict. This may include direct action and protests, but more and more governments are turning to oil as a source of energy and political leverage in the global economy. The port of Tianjin is China�</text>

The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will remain economically viable without being expanded. But the fact that it exists does mean that it is possible to speak of the infrastructure as a ‘system’ and not a ‘tissue’ or a ‘patchwork of different components’. And while the port may in principle be considered a static site, it is developing at a phenomenal rate, as new developments and policies ripple through the landscape. As the port matures and contracts, its users change, add or subtract, taking the site into their own hands, and ceasing to exist in a transient and transient way. Meanwhile, the infrastructure that is built on the port’s performance is not immune from change and new programs of program improvement are needed. And while these improvements may address certain short-term concerns, they often exacerbate existing problems and so create new problems. In this sense, the port is a ‘dead end’ in itself, in that it is subject to periodic reorganization and</text>

So while the political may be able to limit the systems that can be developed, the question remains as to whether or not the rights that are being created are actually those that are or are made possible by the socio-economic and political conditions that are contributing to fuel the present condition. This is a critical distinction to be making the case to any future governments that might consider increasing the capacity of infrastructure such as railways, ports, roads, airports and so on. The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will continue to dominate all aspects of the globe; nor that it will be able to do so in perpetuity. But the fact that it exists and is here and now a vital node in the network that creates and builds the infrastructure of the global economy means that it is possible to rethink and reshape this infrastructure in ways that are not dependent on who owns the port or whether or not that ownership is actually owned by the nationalised transnational corporations that control it. Such structural changes require economic power, and the port of Liverpool is indeed an economic fulcrum. It is the heart of a port city, a site of transatlantic trade, and it is a site of significant residence for many people – people like myself – who commute by sea to and from Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. Yet for many people, and indeed many jobs, the port remains a place of poverty and injustice. A place where racism and economic colonialism still thrive, and in fact, are deeply embedded</text>

The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will continue to dominate all aspects of global transport and communication. But the fact that it has been there for a reason – its capacity to add value in the form of commodities and its proximity to larger infrastructure projects – does imply that it will be there for a while yet. And while its current form may be valuable for commodities in and through the current economic downturn, its future shape is highly uncertain. That is, the evolution of the port may well determine its capacity to contribute to the expansion and sustainment of any future economic system.  One may ask: what is the relationship between port infrastructure and the ecological system that it is designed to support? And if the answer is that ecology cannot be separated from the socioeconomic, then one may ask whether or not the social and political systems that are complicit in creating the infrastructure are also complicit in failing to notice and thus to react to the ecological crisis that is threatening the planet? The answer to this question is a resounding ‘no’.</text>

This is a critical distinction to be making the case to any future governments that might consider increasing the capacity of infrastructure such as railways, ports, roads, airports and so on. The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will remain autonomous; nor does it mean that it will continue to feed into its own decaying structure. It may very well become subject to the whims of global economic forces; and such forces may well seek to expand infrastructure at any moment. But the port has an exceptional ability to weather these changes, to thrive on the oil that it produces, to moulder in the face of such expansion. That ability to weather such forces is what makes it a unique position within the current globalised capitalist mode of exchange. That ability to weather such developments is what makes it a distinct and unique position. This ability to weather both the expansion of globalised capitalist systems and their fundamental processes of becoming ever more complex – which is what happened in the wake of the Arab Spring in 2011 and in the wake of Black Friday in Australia – is what makes the port relevant and different from other locations within the port. That ability to weather such developments is what makes it a port of today.  At a deeper level,</text>

The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will continue to dominate all aspects of global transport and communication. But it is certain that the port will increasingly occupy a predominant role in the global economy, and that will have a profound effect on the rights and obligations of port users. It will become increasingly difficult or impossible for any user of the infrastructure to create new modes of movement on the site, and users will have fewer rights and obligations. In fact, as more and more of the infrastructure is developed on a massive scale, it is likely that the role of the port will grow increasingly autonomous, semi-autonomous and even up to that of a city itself. As the infrastructure is expanded and modified, it is likely that rights and obligations will have to be negotiated between various stakeholders, many of whom will be vested parties to the globalised economy that is now setting in motion.  One could argue that the expansion of infrastructure has come at a cost to rights and obligations; namely, that is has shifted resources and urban space in ways that</text>

The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will continue to be able to support its current infrastructure, despite any political decision-making on the part of the future government. Nor does it mean that the port will continue to exist in perpetuity; nor even that it will continue to feed the world with oil at present levels. Rather, the port represents a point of transition between the modes of production that are produced on the port side of the harbour and those produced on the global market. It has ceased to be a location for active commerce and is instead a market for refined products. Any future governments that might seek to expand the capacity of the port would do well to know and understand the history and geography of the port, and make the port their principal external sites of exchange and market for goods and services.  One could argue that while the port’s continued growth is a point of great potential for exploitation, the growth that results from its market place of exchange is a point of great potential destruction.

The fact that the port has been around for as long as it has does not mean that it will remain so; nor does it mean that it will continue to dominate all aspects of the globe. But it does mean that its continued existence depends on many factors, including the political will and ability to absorb changes, and on-going research and development, and international collaboration. It is true that the port has had problems in the past; history teaches us that when such problems occur, they are often exploited by those with a political or economic agenda. But the development of new technologies and the growth of infrastructure does not necessarily result in a politicised form of infrastructure as in the port today; nor does it necessarily result in a situation in which political will and ability to absorb change are compromised. In fact, it is the contrary. The more infrastructure is enhanced, the more opportunities for economic exchange and new modes of travel are created, the more opportunities there are for those with political will and ability to innovate and act on those possibilities. And it is this final aspect of the port’s continued existence that must be addressed in future trade agreements</text>
