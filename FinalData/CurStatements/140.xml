The book, which documents the early stages of the Vietnam War, traces the artists’ attempts to imagine a post-totalitarian society in which people could openly discuss the war and its social impacts. The authors make a powerful case for the kinds of social change that would be necessary to end the conflict, one that would abolish class as a factor in society and usher in a new era of planetary cooperation.</text>

The new edition of the book is dedicated to the user interface – a physical surface that provides a consistent interface between the user and content – and considers its varied representations through an analysis of the effects of intelligent behaviour on the interface. In the introduction, he discusses his interest in interface design and user experience. In the book, he provides an overview of the history of the interface and its evolution, providing an ideal setting for the ongoing dialogue between artist, researcher and technologist. He uses the term ‘curating the interface’ to explore how user-experience design contributes to societal progress and how it might be incorporated into future interface designs. He also explores the role of artists and other socially engaged cultural practitioners in the design of the interface and its implementation. In a chapter titled ‘</text>

Is it possible to imagine a future without cities? Raimundas Malasauskas: Yes, it’s possible. When I started this project, there was a lot of thinking about the past, a lot of looking backwards – looking backwards in time to the past to understand how things were done. This is very important for a developer, because in the future there’s a lot of automation, a lot of destruction. The reason why I’m interested in the future is because at some point, there’s going to be a need to create something that can last for hundreds of thousands of years.

    Working with algorithms, Daniela López de la Torre, a computer scientist at the Complutense University of the Arts, made sculptures that attempted to decipher the city’s fragmented architecture code. The sculptures, entitled Maps to Masks (2014 and '16), depicted locations in Mexico City that were supposedly based on actual maps that had been drawn up by an art department head, and arranged them into hierarchies of complexity ranging from poorly understood to incomprehensible. The sculptures stood in for the cityscape as a living document – a dense cloud of interpretation, ambiguity, and disagreement. The ambiguity of the cityscape was interpreted through the actions of individuals who happened to be programmers: the artists, the journalists, the historians, the architects – the very seductive seductive seductive qualities that the city holds within.

The discovery and installation of new apps was made possible by the discovery and installation of old – old – lost apps, and the shifting of allegiance between old and new. These are the voyages of the city, and they’re extremely boring on a technical level, but they’re really interesting in their own right.These technologies that emerged during the Information Age – the machine, data, codes, routers, switches, cables, servers, switches and more – provided the means by which the city could be readied to meet the demands of an ever-expanding and increasingly pervasive app ecosystem. The rise of the Information Age coincided with an infrastructural turn around culture industry: there were more servers and more phones, but more of them meant more traffic and meant that there were more screens everywhere. And so the city experienced an expansion of what Vern Langerman calls ‘cultural capitalization’: the construction of ever larger screens everywhere in the city</text>

It is a form of political and social cannibalism. The sculptures, their creators and the city find themselves in a kind of loop – trapped in a kind of shared hallucination of ubiquity, ubiquity, ubiquity. These appear in small, seemingly random places in the city, often juxtaposed together, sometimes in isolation. They are a kind of urban ghost – a kind of urban anomaly. The artist Jeanne van Heeswijk describes them as ‘excess baggage from the past that has returned, a threat to the city’s very foundation’. They are objects of transit in a garbage can, waiting to be picked up by a city planner and put into place a century hence. But they are also ‘woven into the fabric’ of</text>

The fact that the sculptures were done in China and linked to the social transformation of the social into the algorithmic, economic and political in the Information Age is a form of interpretation that the city could not possibly participate in. It does not occur to the city that it is an obstacle or a setback or even an obstacle in the city’s march towards a new type of social ecology. It happens because of the city’s ability to infer meanings from seemingly random data. The artist Jeanne van Heeswijk, whose work we have seen, had a project called JugbandlandsKulturelijkHeurist Kølbærte. In 2016, she was awarded an MBE from the British Council.In 2015, a group of artists, academics, activists and activists created what was then called the Urban Curator Project, an online platform through which local artists could share ideas and strategies for urban advancement and conflict resolution. From the group’s own words: …to create a map of the world based on actual places and cities… the Urban Curator Project was born. The name comes from a 1992 concept document the group had written together after encountering a similar idea</text>

The development of ever grander and more encompassing local governments, police forces, economic development commissions and all other relevant institutions was a globalised version of the city as a function of cities. The emergence of new coded languages, codes, symbols and proto-narratives as scripts and proto-narratives as localisations of experience was a global process that became known as ‘The Information Society’. In other words, cities had a kind of ‘bottom-up’ impetus and part of the function of cities was to listen to what was happening around them. 	But what had begun as a globalised and interconnected version of the city that was both politically and economically reactive gave way to a kind of bottom-up, with artists, theorists and urbanists coming together across different cultures to discover what was</text>

The fact that the sculptures were done in China and linked to the social transformation of the social into the algorithmic, economic and political in the Information Age is a form of interpretation that the city could not compete with. The emergence of new media has certainly influenced our understanding of the city in important ways, and has given rise to a multitude of new media types, genres, and nationalities. But it is important to note that these new media types are often developing innovative means of operating outside of established forms, and breaking with the established media structures that are used to constrain them. For instance, the proliferation of social media allows us to survey previously unseen urban landscapes, and can even liberate hitherto incarcerated populations from the grasp of the criminalised social. We might also consider the role of artists and think-tanks who put themselves in harm’s way by encouraging creative destruction, or at least to see artistic practices as legitimate when done in a free and transparent manner.  To understand how the city is made fun of, one has to understand the social. And the social is precisely what López de la Torre sought to eliminate in Cartagena.

The fact that the sculptures were done in China and linked to the social transformation of the social into the algorithmic, economic and political in the Information Age is a form of interpretation that the city could not have imagined just a few years earlier.  	The Role of Art and Architecture in the Information Age 	The role of the arts in the rise and fall of populations in the developed world is a well-known story. Histories such as that of the Genographic Project and the Carmen Project explore in detail the cultural and economic changes triggered by the invention of print and the subsequent proliferation of images, and the consequent transformation of urban space. Art and architecture are often cited as a cure-all, a magic elixir that can mend all  	 wounds. But a closer look at the art and architectural histories that are often ignored or perverted in the pursuit of dense, computer-aided urban development reveals a far more sinister reality: the very notion of arts and architecture as a shared resource shared by all inhabitants of large urban spaces is an act of war. The very notion of the arts and architecture as a shared resource is itself a weapon in the service of war. The role</text>

The fact that the sculptures were done in China and linked to the social transformation of the social into the algorithmic, economic and political in the Information Age is a form of interpretation that the city could not possibly resist. It linked its construction with the emergence of new media, its economic expansion with the spread of computer programming, and its participation in infrastructure projects with the proliferation of graphic designers, journalists and other cultural professionals. It is the very complexity of the city’s social ecology and political economy that the city has embraced with open arms, willing its inhabitants to embrace whatever comes their way. But the city’s embrace can also come with a price. When the city embraces an idea, it inevitably imposes that idea down its citizens’ throats, imposing it wherever it is needed most. That is, of course, unless something like Wikipedia comes along and saves the day. In that case, the city actively prevents its citizens from using the idea, insisting that it ‘owns’ them. And if that happens, there is a danger that the concept will destroy rather than enhance the city, rather than help it along. So while the concept might be cool, the city’</text>

The fact that the sculptures were done in China and linked to the social transformation of the social into the algorithmic, economic and political in the Information Age is a form of interpretation that the city could not possibly endorse. The sculpture of the cathedral as a monolithic computer system for mapping out areas of the city is a variant of the monolithic administrative system that was developed for the new economy, or what Raymond Williams would later call the ‘postindustrial society’. The bureaucracy is the system that collects, sorts and reports on information; it is, in other words, what we have all become conditioned to become accustomed to. It is a social adaptation that has to be constantly tweaked by those who hold the ultimate authority over us. As computer systems and mobile apps become ever more complex and layered, the possibility that information could leak out of the bubble of formal complexity and into the wider world arises. And this is precisely what Apple’s twenty-first century factory does.  The contemporary factory is deeply embedded in how we understand and conceptualise labour – embedded, in the way in which the automobile has become so embedded that it no longer needs the need for drivers to sit in vehicles that are</text>

The sculptures stood in for the cityscape as a living document – a dense cloud of interpretation, ambiguity, and disagreement. The ambiguity of the cityscape was interpreted through the actions of individuals who happened to be programmers: the artists, the journalists, the historians, the architects – the very seductive seductive seductive qualities that the city holds within. The fact that the sculptures were done in China and linked to the social transformation of the social into the algorithmic, economic and political in the Information Age is a form of interpretation that the city could not possibly embrace. The city is the locus of the synthetic social; it embraces its historical role but it does not yet know how to use that identity or that history.  	The art of the city is not just art: it is a social act that involves politics, and politics are feelings. The art of the city is not just art because it makes use of the city; politics are also deeply felt and personal. However, the depth and character of those feelings, the range and range of those political and economic experiences, and the richness and range of those social relationships – these are largely indeterminate and unrealised because the city has declared war on itself. The city is trying to put a machine on the city’s surface and then commanding that you should either embrace that machine or fight it. You embrace the machine and then fight it because you don’t want to embrace the machine and its politics. The city is trying to regulate the political and economic interactions between people</text>

The fact that the sculptures were done in China and linked to the social transformation of the social into the algorithmic, economic and political in the Information Age is a form of interpretation that the city could not possibly endorse. It is, in fact, a form of resistance.The idea of the artist as an object emerged as a way to address this ambiguity and create spaces of possibility for resistance. The notion of the ‘Artist in Her Space’ became a modus that could be manipulated and controlled, while simultaneously offering a modus that invited critical thought and a creative response. From the early 1970s onwards, the city commissioned a series of artworks to be placed in parks and public spaces around the country in an attempt to rebrand the city as ‘the Park that Carry the Name’. The first art space was created in 1977 in New York’s Chinatown and later renamed Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial became a local landmark and the location of several other locales where artists would come and spend time, including the artist Eugene O’Neill’s studio, where he would set up shop for many years. The park that would eventually be dubbed the Park</text>

What might art do in this new environment? I propose that it engages with the fact that, according to a recent report by the National Priorities Project, only 37% of the US population currently lives within a half-hour's drive of a major museum or library. Perhaps a new generation of curators is being formed who understand that the future museum may not be the same museum from where we look back in fifty years.

What is evident is that the museum has become a more significant locus of cultural exchange and discovery for artists and their audiences, even though the museum remains the dominant form of cultural experience for Americans. Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that a different kind of cultural form is emerging. The kind of cultural form that creates not only engagement with art, but also engages with the social function of art and its relationship to the contemporary condition of poverty, homelessness and war. Perhaps the main role of the museum is to foster not only criticality, but also culture war. If this were the case, the galleries would be packed with works that challenge the prevailing narratives and paradigms of contemporary art, and they would be overflowing with works by artists expressing their own unique perspectives and ideas. Such a transformation would make the gallery a battleground of cultural significances and vocabularies, producing not only new art, but also new identifications and allegiances with a political implication and a cultural terrella. In a recent exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Rubens Baraka (2016), the curator of Visual Cultures, presented a new work called Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, the American Slave Trader, by introducing audience</text>

Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that a new generation of artists is being formed who understand the importance of the museum as a locus of their cultural endeavours. This would mean engaging with the notion of the museum as an institution that, despite its nominal formal qualities, is imbued with a deeply imbricated history and, through a series of cultural practices and procedures, is capable of sustaining a network of cultural exchanges and cultural influences. Curators and arts professionals are highly capable of creating a ‘big data’ perspective on art and contemporary culture through data mining, which is a branch of artificial intelligence. In other words, their contribution to this conversation should not be limited to quantitative methods but should extend to cultural ethics as a whole. 	What is at Stake in Cultural Practice? What are the Tools and Agitators that Artists Need to Participate in Changing the World?

Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that, in the age of the autonomous driving car and sensor-rich urban environment, the museum has become the locus of cultural exchange and, by extension, of cultural consumption. If this is the case, then the museum may play a more significant role in the future of the institution. It is a place where cultural practices have taken root, where concepts and concepts have a place in museum collections and oral histories, and where concepts and concepts can be revisited and reinterpreted through a range of different cultural scenarios.  So far, so normal for a museum, but what if the museum becomes an agency that, at the same time, produces and, in turn, speaks to the future? What might be different today, and what might be different in fifty years? One suggestion, which has been gaining momentum, is to create biennials that, at the same time, function as research centres and cultural institutions in their own right. This could entail creating what are, in effect, independent bi</text>

Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that a new form of cultural form has emerged in which the museum is a central node. This is the ethical and political dimension of cultural production articulated by Francis Bacon: ‘Cultural production … assumes the form of governmental support.’ If Bacon is right, then perhaps it is our current lack of cultural institutions that creates the present crisis, not institutional poverty or political awakening, but a lack of cultural production. Perhaps, as Bourriaud suggests, the criticality of our present moment comes from a lack of understanding; a lack of cultural production will, by its own nature, alert us to meaninglessness.

Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that a new form of cultural exchange is taking place in the metropolis. This new form of cultural exchange may well yield artists ‘returning home’ or lead to the creation of new artistic forms through the magic of big data. Perhaps a new generation of curators are already forming as to what ‘the Met'’ means in the metropolis, and what that ‘moment’ might be. Perhaps a museum today represents a new form of cultural exchange that is not confined to the city in which it is located, or, alternatively, may connect the two cities in a way that is mutually exclusive. Perhaps the museum is a vehicle that facilitates new modes of cultural exchange through the magic of big data. But whatever its function, the Met is here to stay. It is the most definitive term of the century, and as such it encapsulates everything that is contemporary, contemporary, contemporary about the city. Its proliferation is now the defining characteristic of the metropolis; its decline</text>

What is evident is that the museum has become a more significant locus of cultural exchange and discovery for artists and their audiences, even though the museum remains the dominant form of cultural experience for Americans. Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that audiences from other cultures now constitute a significant proportion of the museum visitor pool. Perhaps the primary reason for this increase in diversity has to do with the museum, which is the common denominator of all cultural forms and hence is the primary locus of all kinds of difference, including difference itself. As a museum, the museum is a double-edged sword: its capacity to record and represent (in a relational and ‘time-critical’ way) is questioned; and its perceived obsolescence and dependence on date (in the vernacular of cultural analysis) has become a cliche. On the one hand, it is prized for its historical collections and collections relating to the past, especially in its modern and contemporary forms, but on the other, its presumed ‘pastiche’ of disparate cultural experiences is being readopted by a dominant historical-entitling discourse that exploits the artefact as a commodity and not simply as a meeting place for diverse practices and approaches.

Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that culturally responsive action in the museum is far more influential than the typical curatorial approach.  Art and the curatorial approach  One may engage with the over-discovery of cultural resources and the cultural logic of the US through the actions of artists and their curators. Thus the curatorial intervention may not only alter the future of cultural resources, but may also alter the past, present and future of cultural resources.  One example of the curatorial's cultural logic is provided by the work of artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan, who in the 1990s proposed the idea of the ‘curtains of the city’ to counter the influence of the megastructure. His idea was that, instead of architecture providing physical barriers between public space and private property, the latter was populated with ‘strict, contrived, and artificial curating devices’ designed to meet the needs of the museum but also the private capitalist structure of the city.  One can also engage with the inherent contradictions</text>

Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that the museum and its curatorial practices are reshaping the cultural landscape in the US, and in doing so, artists’ audiences elsewhere may find themselves participating in a new wave of cultural tangles. This is the scenario I imagine for curators and artists to consider: what role might the museum play in the future, and how might it engage with the present? The answer to both these questions may inform the curatorial practice of future artworks, and may inform what kinds of cultural productions may be possible. That is, the role of the museum may be flexible and responsive to the varying conditions and possibilities of the real world, as different real-world forces and events may render the symbolic relationship between the museum and the past problematic. The potentiality and flexibility of the museum as a venue for cultural exchange and discovery may be realised through research-based, archival and ‘true story’ curatorial practices, whereby audiences are encouraged to grow attached to specific characters, places and stories in a</text>

Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that, in the twenty-first century, cultural exchanges and cultural discovery may occur at a much slower pace and in more private networks of cultural exchange. In an ideal world, this would mean engaging with the museum as a museum rather than a collection of artefacts and collections. What would be ideal for an artist to do in this new museum environment? I believe that curating would become more natural and art’s place in this new metropolis. It would be time to let go of the museum as an object of cultural exchange and leisure, and to engage with the museum as a museum rather than as a collection of artefacts and collections. I also believe that curating would require less formal education and less institutional knowledge, since a good number of the curators I know have only recently begun their careers. I have known some young curators who have only recently begun their careers. Many young artists I know have only recently begun their careers.

Perhaps the museum is no longer the dominant cultural form in the United States, but rather that a new form of cultural form has emerged in response to the museum, which is the locus of images and traces of meaning and meaninglessness, of images and traces of history. The challenge for curators is to cultivate a sense of wonder and enigma, of wonder that is both embedded in their curatorial projects and readily available to the public. As Francis Ford Coon, one of the founding members of the National Endowment for the Humanities, once said, ‘The museum is the invisible hand that engaged the American public in a cultural revolution.’ The goal of curatorial work for the foreseeable future, therefore, may lie in transforming the museum from an inherently ideological instrument of social change into a site of wonder and enigma.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleMy work centers on the intersection of art, identity, and politics in the contemporary urban environment.

It’s that last bit that the city did for the first time, and that’s always been a battle. It’s going to be a while before the city feels like home again, and we need to start working on making that happen.  	Finally, what are the next steps in your research, or curatorial process, that allow you to begin to change the story told by the city?

That story has to be told, and it’s up to the local artist to decide how that story should be told. 	The key to engaging the local residentry is in engaging the narrative that’s already been woven together through all the other projects, and the other programmes run by the city. I started by telling the story of how I first came across the architectural plans for the site, and how it occurred to me that the triangular land marks that area where the former ship channel used to be, and the former auto trade centre. That story resonates with me, and with many people I know. That’s how you start a conversation. 	The story has a happy ending, of course. The city builds a new harbour, a new airport, a new public realm, and then the neighbourhood groups that were displaced start coming back, and the whole city comes together to create a new narrative around the area. That’s how it began for me, with the archival footage from the old ship channel,</text>

That story has to be told, and it’s possible that it will take many years to build the required scale and range to be able to engage with other narratives. But even then, there will always be room for debate and disagreement, because there is only so much space in a city. The important thing is to build systems that allow people to participate, and to see the way in which that can be done. 	Conclusion 	The question of scale and impact has increasingly become a source of contention within the arts community. There is a sense that the big institutions, including the arts institutions themselves, are too focussed on the big picture, and are not giving enough weight to the actual city that is built around the arts centres. There is a need to find new forms of engagement that are responsive to the city, and to that extent, outside the curatorial reach of the biennial. That has indeed been my role, and that’s why I’m doing research right now into what the Biennial could be, and</text>

You need to know how to get people to make decisions they may not yet be fully capable of making, and you need to understand the psychological effects of that decision-making.

How do you make the choices that will actually happen? I don’t think it’s easy to define what I mean by that.

I work as an artist doing research for a masters thesis, and sometimes I just sit around thinking about how to produce a narrative for my community in a way that will be relevant to the city. Your local pub, town hall, heritage building, school playground, park, street or warehouse could be reinterpreted and re-imagined to produce a new narrative for your area, and that could happen anywhere. That story has to be told, and it’s up to you to decide how that story should be told. 	In my opinion, there are three ways to tell a story: through texts, images or both. Images are powerful, and texts can be powerful too. But at the same time they’re also affected by the fact that these powerful images are also images of conflict. So while the image might have a very powerful effect, there comes a point where the image and the text that is created and delivered via it has to be interrupted and interrupted in some way – either by intervening with sound or imagery or something else entirely. 	If you’re an artist and you produce compelling images that activate a story, that can change the narrative that builds towards a future conflict. That is, you have to be aware that what you do has an impact on stories that are told, and that is inherently ambiguous and variable. This is particularly true for images that are sent via text or image, since there can be a great deal</text>

You need to know what you’re getting into, and how to put yourself in the place of an artist or a designer in order to really understand the power of narrative. 	You can also learn how to put yourself in the place of an artist or a designer in a different way. Your local Community Arts organisation could get involved, as an artist, in creating a new narrative for your area. You could find creative ways to put yourself in the place of an artist, or a designer, in order to create that narrative.

In order to achieve that kind of impact, you have to have the imagination, the connections, the connections of the right people, the connections of the city, and the connections of the arts. Those are the building blocks, the building blocks that enable you to think big-picture. You have to be able to imagine, and you have to be able to access the imagination of the masses. If you can't, or don’t want to, then you’re not going to get things done. That was the experience of many of the local people I spoke to last week: they had different takes on the same thing, and sometimes the same thing, over and over again. That was the beauty of it: we all had our own take, but we all had different access to the imagination of the masses. I don’</text>

The choice is yours, but I hope you can see how the city is slowly being turned into something else. 	There are of course many other ways of approaching the city, and I invite you to explore those modes of urbanisation in further detail in your dissertation, or if you prefer, in your hands-on art project. I hope this helps, and see you soon. 	See also:  	Design &amp; Empire, by Suzanne L. Tang, Design &amp; Empire, Inc. rev. ed.

    Working with algorithms, Jonathan Crary (left) and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology, in the early 1990s, were developing techniques to read human language – the way in which sentences are arranged in paragraphs and sentences in pages. By reading human language, the researchers were able to create artificial neural networks that read texts in a similar way to how a human brain works, but with important differences. These were able to recognise patterns and gain access to data, such as images, that is used to categorise and classify things.The ability to read human language is just one example of many ways in which machines are able to learn. Another example is their access to data. Machines are being developed that can analyse huge amounts of data in a near-instantaneous way, which is much like our own ability to process data.

What kind of infrastructure is being built to be able to process information and identify the things that are valuable – but is being trained to do this in ways that are far from natural, human-like or valuable?What kind of politics of the machine is this? This raises the possibility that the politics of the machine may be political in ways that we do not yet fully understand.Making the Machine Understand Politics of the MachineIn the wake of Trump’s election, we must ask: what kind of politics are we creating for ourselves? What kinds of mechanisms are we adding to the infrastructure of the machine that are able to self-correct? Some have already begun to do this in troubling ways. For example, in the wake of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual harassment allegations, many tech companies</text>

In another example, scientists developing tools to detect chemical pollutants is planning to embed sensors in the soil that detect when the soil is contaminated with chemicals. In both of these examples, the failure of any one of the components seems to be sufficient to trigger the system to action.The idea of a human being as a 'toolkit' – or an implementation of a set of skills – is perhaps the most pernicious of the contemporary machine ideal. The human factor is reduced to the notion that things fall to machines, that humans are capable of anything automated. This dehumanising view of humans is fundamentally at odds with the historical and social context of how we understand ourselves and our place in the world. The historical account of how we came to be is a story of resistance, mutation and change. The current iteration of the story is a product of resistance, organisational skills and data. The scientific and technological narrative of the past is a story of progress, of course, but it is also a story</text>

Another example is their access to data. Today, large data warehouses are developed using cutting-edge computer modelling that involves the construction of ever larger, more encompassing data sets that can be fed into the building of ever larger, more powerful machines. These processing units are able to analyze the data sets and gather information on things like the people, places and things that are stored in them, as well as on the machines that are able to read and process that data. This kind of massive data-processing becomes possible because of the ubiquity of digital cameras and other sensor technologies, which means that data can be captured and transmitted over vast distances in real-time, as images propagate across the globe. The possibilities are endless – imagine what a landscape could become if we could capture and share images of it –</text>

In one sense, this is akin to what Desai refers to as ‘plant-level intelligence’. In another sense, this is what Nader Daghestani refers to when describing the kind of humanity that is being ushered into ‘AI-enabled’ applications.So, while we clearly see a trend towards greater autonomy for robots, machines and data-driven applications, the question becomes whether there is something that we can learn from the human in creating such systems. Perhaps, in the future, we could create software that acts like our own memory – that is, able to recognise and store information in the same way that our own brains do. This would make such systems able to recognise meaning in the world through data, and perhaps even the ability to impart that meaning to other machines.Such systems would be able to see through the human error that we humans cause in placing certain objects in certain situations, and thereby being able to deduce from that mistake – for example, human</text>

For one, there are the developments that take place in the context of our cities, which are becoming ever more like artificial ecosystems governed by algorithms. This is evident in the development of self-driving cars that constantly check for improvements and adjust the car accordingly. As more and more data is gathered in this context, the likelihood of finding something that is not in use grows. This is also evident in the developments that take place in the context of labour: as the number of human labourers increases, the likelihood of finding work increases as well. So the more data is gathered, the more patterns are identified and identified, which in turn, leads to a greater likelihood of becoming recognisable. This is also evident in the finding of cures for diseases such as cancer. While</text>

In these cases, the ability to analyze huge amounts of data is just one more way in which the capacities of humans are continually increasing.And yet another example is emerging: the use of virtual reality to imagine worlds where people can cooperate, rather than within which only a few people can. At the intersection of virtual and physical reality is the question: what is the role of art in this equation? One answer is emerging: many forms of art are used for good and ill, for social purposes, and as part of larger systems that have a clear interest – such as the health systems – in the form of data feeds and conduits that help to direct human behaviour. And yet another is emerging: art as a function of art is increasingly being reconfigured in relation to the data feeds and conduits of the system so as to render it malleable and bendable. This may include the rethinking of the roles and entitlements of artists and creative professionals within the infrastructure of the social.I</text>

The ability to understand how data is gathered and used, and to produce such tools, is another example of how machines are able to understand more of what we mean when we speak of the same world.This ability to understand more of what we mean – in both literal and figurative senses – is another reason why the future looks bright for believers in a just and expanding world. Machines will certainly get smarter, and they will certainly learn to do more of what we do not yet understand how machines might do. But it is also why so many people are still drawn to the idea of the machine. After all, machines are not perfect – and although they may learn all manner of things, they are not yet capable of understanding everything that we mean when we speak of the world as a set of machines. Indeed, it is this idea of the machine that creates the ambiguity and the magic of its possibilities. For many people, and indeed many cultures, the idea of the machine is what defines it,</text>

For example, scientists developing tools for mapping landscapes are developing features that help the machines figure out where to find things – like trees that grow in certain areas or mountains that shrink in other areas. In one version of this, the activity is automated and thus the naming of features is never going to be perfect, but the aim will always be to find things in the landscape that are useful for the activity – in this case, trees. And the aim will always be to help humans do things that are useful in the landscape.In many ways, then, the aim of the Anthropocene is to help humanity do things that were once performed by humans – gathering and food – while enabling the machine to do things that are more creatively designed. This is perhaps one way of reading the Anthropocene as a process leading towards a future in which there are no longer humans in the ground, but rather in which there are always intelligent machines operating in systems that look to the future and augment the human condition through data mining and data-mining techniques that seek to identify and augment what humans can do.This raises the question: what kind of future will this create for us? I would imagine that it will foster</text>

For example, scientists developing tools for mapping landscapes are developing features that help the machines figure out where to find things – like trees that grow in certain areas or mountains that shrink in other areas. These data mining algorithms then find structures that can hold water, gas or other valuable resources, and from there, work with existing infrastructure to produce things like mining rights or building permits. The possibilities for these kinds of infrastructure-building are endless, and yet so are the kinds of problems that need to be solved, because while massive infrastructure projects are being developed, the problems that need to be addressed are also growing in size and complexity. And so the discussion turns to how to make the infrastructure that supports them both sustainable and meet the ever-growing demands of the metropolis.This is a complex and dynamic issue, and few places are as exposed to the demands of our times as the biennale itself. As we have seen, certain artists and curators were quick to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the increased access to cultural resources and infrastructure, and have pursued projects that are almost certainly not sustainable or will become so – projects that are often condemned as wasteful or even irresponsible by other quarters.

In one version of this, the mountains might actually shrink in size, giving the tools access to even more data.In many ways, then, the tools we develop and the worlds we create are essentially autonomous. They’re developing at an incredible rate, and we, as artists, are left with the task of monitoring and controlling what they find. The tools don’t yet have the ability to understand grammar or syntax, the finer points of semantics, or the subtle structures of language, but they are developing incredible amounts of data – both visual and mathematical – that is being gathered on a massive scale. And as more of that data is gathered, the worlds we inhabit are being continuously reshaped. This is one way in which machines are becoming more human-like: the more data is gathered, the more patterns are identified, the more meaning is attached to those patterns, and the more things</text>

In the coming weeks and months we will be inviting residents and community groups from around the region to participate in a 'consensus tour' around the site of the proposed developments. This tour will be a way to begin to define the city in terms of what the citizens of Liverpool want and need in the city – a city with a future – not through a strictly defined set of priorities or ideal forms of government, but through a participatory, bottom-up, city-wide process that will determine the way in which citizens in the city engage with the city. It will be a way to see the city from different perspectives and learn about different kinds of city. It will allow you to make your own assumptions about the city. For example, the assumptions of the residents of Anfield who arrived in large numbers to voice their opinion on the project in early 2012, and of course the Liverpool Biennial staff who visited the city in March 2013. These were the final encounters before the project was put on hold and the city was given a new identity. The project seems</text>

The city is a place where many different kinds of people live and work, and this opens many different ways of interacting. In the coming weeks and months we will be inviting residents to join us in exploring the different worlds of the city. This will allow us to uncover hidden meanings and hidden connections that may be operating at a microscopic level in the city right now. This can happen in many forms, including digging through our memories, taking sides, joining forces and magic. This kind of experimentation is what makes the city real. It is not possible to draw a straight line between now and then, because change and unpredictability are part of the ongoing biennial process. But we can begin to imagine what the city could be like in a different way and in many more creative ways.This kind of thinking is what the city does now; it is what the museum does now; it is what RAND Corporation does now; it is what the Biennale commission does now; it is what the city council does now; it is what citizens, academics, artists and other stakeholders do now; it is what city residents and community activists do now; it is what creative professionals and grassroots groups</text>

There is a lack of resources and political will in the city, so this is a potential future for the city. For now, the art project is a curiosity and a beginning, but a city that is creative and builds itself is a city that is also capable of sustaining great art, taking part in something more fundamental than its economic capacity. The future city will need to be able to build on the strengths it has already, creating new possibilities for interaction and urban growth.In the coming weeks and months we will publish a series of blog posts describing the different ways in which the project is unfolding.

In the coming weeks and months we will be inviting residents and creative professionals to participate in a variety of ways. The public art project is just the beginning. The creative professions are beginning to realise the value of the collaborative process and the power of dialogue when it comes to creating a work of art or a city in which to live, work and play.The intuition behind actions such as planting trees, creating community gardens and activities is that people’s intuition is the limit to how strong its force will be. Therefore, it is vital that we gather as much data and feedback as possible before taking action, lest we all be afraid to act again because we may have hurt someone or hurt ourselves doing so. The data and feedback we collect will shape the future of the city and our sense of self. We therefore need to collectively decide how we want to use the information to create new ways of interacting with the city. For example, by gathering feedback from the art project, we may decide to convert the raw data into a form of interactive map or widget that</text>

In the coming weeks and months we will be inviting residents, community organisers, artists and others with different kinds of skills to join us in different ways. This is a starting point, and we will continuously experiment, devolve, and grow as we move forward. For sure, this means developing new ways of interacting across different social, cultural, economic, political and operational levels. We will need more than art to make the city work for people, and we will need people with different kinds of skills, so it will be essential that we build new modes of organising and engaging people, new ways of engaging people, and so forth. This will require a long period of work, and it will take a long time to be realised, so it is essential that we build new modes of organising and engaging people, new ways of organising and so forth. The reason why this project has taken so long to be realised is that many kinds of people have been organising, which has complicated things in different ways.

They will be able to contribute directly to the art project or contribute as an organization. They will be able to take part in the city in many ways that are not local and traditional. For example, they can become artists, curators, urban activists, architects, writers or whatever kind of person they want to be. They can also participate in the wider community through volunteering or management roles. The kinds of knowledge and skills that can be gained through this kind of intensive process will allow for a deeper understanding of the city and its dynamics, and for an increased capacity to act as a co-creator, a modeller, a creator and a part of the city’s future.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleFounded in 2014, Leeds Biennial (UK) is a biennial established in Leeds, UK, in 2014 and 2014, respectively.

It is home to some of the most sensitive parts of the walled city, where the Jewish and Muslim visitors are regularly subject to round-the-clock surveillance, checkpoints, surveillance and demolitions. It is also the home to one of the largest concentration camps ever built, and the grave of four Lebanese soldiers killed in the Israeli war on Lebanon in 2006. The Palestinian refugees who make up the bulk of the city’s population are concentrated in the Manger district, which was once the home of Liberty International Airport and the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Abye Daejing Museum is the only remaining significant Palestinian presence in the city.Over the past decade, a number of exhibitions and small works projects have investigated the history of contemporary art in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Many of these projects were developed by or with the support of the Israeli government.  The most prominent of these is the Jerusalem Art Biennale, which began in 1999 and has exhibited every year since. The Biennale has staged over 200 exhibitions worldwide, with over 100,000 visitors. It is the largest biennale promoter in the world.  It is important to note that East Jerusalem is the site of final status negotiations</text>

It is also the home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the country. The Muslim quarter has been renamed the Tribulation Area, while the Christian quarter, which includes parts of Jerusalem, is known as Area C. The word ‘Area C’ refers to protected areas set aside for specific communities to build houses according to their traditional set of customs. The idea is that these houses are privately held cultural assets and can be used for communal purposes. However, these claims are frequently abused and non-used property is bulldozed to make way for market developments, new high-rises and other developments. Before and after the Arab Spring, cultural resources like cultural districts and museums were frequently the scene of mass protest and generated significant public and international attention. The rise of social media and new forms of economic exchange allowed the exhibitionary trade to wane, while other critical sectors, such as the post-production and packaging of DVDs and CDs, also began to be digitised and automated.

It is home to some of the most sensitive parts of the walled city, where the Jewish and Muslim visitors are regularly subject to round-the-clock surveillance, checkpoints, surveillance and demolitions. It is also the home to one of the holiest sites in Judaism, where Muslims perform the Tefillin, a nighttime burial rite, in which they uncover the remains of two Jewish men who were brutally murdered there 400 years ago. The city is the backdrop for the second Innocence Project, which documents the lives of the people prosecuted and convicted of the Jerusalem murders. In the wake of these cases, a new generation of artists, poets and artists is beginning to explore a city that is again becoming a site for collaborative and collaborative art. The exhibition was shown in many cities around the world, including in cities with significant Arab populations, including Berlin, New York and London. It was shown at the Venice Biennale, the Agnelli Gallery in Venice, the Tate Modern and the Welsh Streets Museum in Liverpool. It was also shown at the F.W.

The Jewish Quarter is the site of the Western Wall, where the Dome of the Rock is thought to have been placed, and where the Jewish people’s Temple is located. In the 1990s, a plan to rebuild East Jerusalem – the site of the biblical Jewish Quarter – was put on hold amid violence in the city. The site has been the subject of repeated requests by Israeli and Palestinian organisations seeking the return of pre-1967 borders, infrastructure and planning documents. In 2014, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) re-analysed and expanded the city’s historical planning plans to take into account climate change, resulting in massive increases in housing and commercial development. The plans envisaged massive increases in water and sewerage systems, desalination plants, underground reservoirs and storm water drains, along with the construction of enormous electric grids, transmission lines and transformers to distribute the surplus electricity generated by</text>

It is also the home to one of the largest Arab minority populations in Israel. The Jewish community is anxious to distance itself from the encroachments of the new government, which are forcing it to adopt policies diametrically opposed to those of the Christian Byzantine empire. The Muslim community is even less circumspect. It prefers the term ‘state of emergency’ to describe the new government’s plans to eradicate Israel from the map. Despite these variances, we can agree that the new government is going to have to deal with a public that is angry and discontented. In this case, there is only one option: calm the situation down, hope things will return to normal in a few years, and then implement the policies of the last two centuries that created this mess in the first place.This course is not going to magically make things right. It is going to take years of concerted work by artists, curators, activists, academics and other stakeholders to create a climate of tolerance and co-existence that is both internal and</text>

It is home to some of the most sensitive parts of the walled city, where the Jewish and Muslim visitors are regularly subject to round-the-clock surveillance, checkpoints, surveillance and demolitions. It is also the home to one of the largest concentration camps for Palestinians, with over 10,000 Palestinians crammed into 2,000 privately owned temporary dormitory units. In the past, Palestinian artists have staged intensive residency programs in East Jerusalem, documenting the history of the city as part of a bid to gain access to the city.The current Israeli government, however, is not interested in preserving the character of the city; it wants to demolish it and build a new one entirely. It has decided that the old city – Judea and Samaria – is too important to leave behind any longer. It is pursuing a plan to build a massive new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, which will encompass almost all of Judea and Samaria, while creating a new city in the city proper – but not in the old city. This second city will be an entirely segregated city – Jews will be allowed to stay only if they move into specially designated East Jerusalem housing units, and Palestinians will be allowed to stay anywhere in East Jerusalem.In an attempt to</text>

The choice to host the exhibition in Jerusalem was a combination of factors, including the city being the seat of the US Supreme Court, and the home to the US Fifth Fleet, which can be used to challenge any move towards a Palestinian state. Furthermore, the exhibition was made possible by a partnership between the New York Art Biennaleeers (archive), the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Biennale of Modern Art – Jerusalem. The Biennale was founded in 1964 and is a financial success; in 2012 it was reported to have raised $290 million. In the intervening years, the Biennale has morphed into a cultural reference, exhibiting works from that era but also those from the present. In the 1980s and 1990s it was a secular art institution, in the 2000s it turned into a Jewish cultural institution, and now it is back in the city to showcase its collection of Palestinian art.

The exhibition took place in the historic and current Charles University building, which was designed by architect Frank Gehry and architect A. Ronen. It showcased a mix of modern and Byzantine styles, with touches of both Christian and Jewish styles. The Byzantine section featured original Byzantine mosaics and objects from the library, museums and archive of the Byzantine Empire. The Modern section featured works by artists including Rafael Cardoso, Oscar Niemeyer, Adam Szymczyk, Laura Siege, and many more. The bulk of the work in the Byzantine section was commissioned by the European commission, but the council also put out a bid for the rights to a few of the more experimental works. The Byzantine section was led by Ana Laura Lopéz de la Torre, who worked closely with the artists to develop their ideas and push them forward. The Modern section was led by Juliana Engberg,</text>

It is also the home to one of the holiest sites in Islam. The decision to present this site in Venice as an exhibition was a difficult one to make, given the city’s recent decision to re-open the Old City, or Temple Mount, as part of the Jerusalem Biennale. The new exhibition will arrive as a book that chronicles the project from its beginning in 2011 to the present. Jerusalem, which is being rebuilt from the rubble of multiple wars, terrorist attacks and unlawful demolitions, will become the tallest building in the city and will host the first Jewish district. The city’s new Jewish district will be part of what is being billed as a ‘new Jerusalem’, a hybrid form of ‘Temple Mount’ that both refers to the Jewish past but also to the Jewish future. The new ‘Temple Mount’ will feature a plaza in the old city that will house both the Jewish quarters and the Muslim world’s most authentic representations of the place.  So</text>

The history of evocation in the Middle East that informs the City of Lights is one of constant religious fundamentalism, imperial conquest and colonial strife. From the second century on, the Arabic writer Abu Talib Al-Anbari, a contemporary of Suleiman Al-Banna (d.1490), one of the first caliphs, and author of several books on Islamic jurisprudence, poetry and architecture, wrote extensively in support of the Muslim rulers of Egypt and Syria.

I contend that the first challenge is met by images that are distinctive to a particular location, time and societal setting, and that images of a given scale, shape and character are equally influential in a given cultural context, but are not necessarily exclusive to that setting or societal context. The second challenge is to produce images that are representative of a given cultural or social context, but also images that are accessible and negotiate distortion and distortion in that prevailing media system, but are not necessarily prescient or representative of contemporary conditions or developments. While the first set of challenges may or may not be met in an ideal or desired world, the latter set of images will almost certainly be met in a world or society in which the image is the dominant form of media, and images rule information gathering and dissemination, and ideas rule action.  	So, for example, if I were curator of an international contemporary art or biennial, and exhibited internationally renowned contemporary and recent art in my hometown, California, but was also interested in the contemporary art of other places</text>

But while the image is the primary medium through which the social and cultural significations of colonialism and racism are constantly reified, the other forms of social organisation that we produce and rely on also participate in and are shaped by images. The image is a powerful tool, but it is not sufficient. Power is produced and wielded through other means. Images play a critical role in imagining contingencies, possibilities and alternatives, and images play a pivotal role in imagining possibilities. But this crucial role is exercised through images. The challenge for contemporary art and curatorial practice is twofold: (1) to produce images that are relevant and influential in a globalised capitalist media-generated culture (with or without social media savvy); and (2) to actively participate in creating images that function in this prevailing media system but are not predicated on or dependent on an image. I contend that the first challenge is met through images that are political, but also through images that are images that generate political feelings. The image is revolutionary in its own right, but what makes it revolutionary is that it is not simply an image.  So, contemporary art and art’s curatorial actions and initiatives cannot and will not be accepted or lauded by everyone. They have to be produced through creative means that are also object lessons in the bureaucratised and monetised culture of the contemporary world.  And, yes, these actions and initiatives are necessary in the interest of art and art’s social function. But they have to be produced in concert with other social and political action. Otherwise, what is curatorial and what is art?  And what is art today?  I would argue that the ‘realigning of the museum’ is due to an increased demand for museum-quality historical and archival material in the wake of rapid technological change, which generates ever-greater material effects and media needs</text>

I contend that the first challenge is met through images that are ethically ambiguous, produce feelings, images, and seem to speak to contemporary conditions and desires. Such images exert a destabilising influence on discourse and action in a globalised and integrated culture. The second challenge is articulated by those who project their own particular cultural and political values onto images and images only; and the third element is articulated by those who seek to utilise the power of image to exert control and dominate.In this article, I seek to articulate in chronological order some of these challenges as they pertain to the contemporary condition and present moment. I use the term ‘controversy-free museum’ to designate spaces and grounds that are free from ideological struggle, ideological blind spots, and conflictual tendencies; and ‘controversy-ridden city’ to designate areas and social practices that are politically aware, politically astute, and socially engaged but are also culturally resilient and capable of enduring change. 	At a deeper level, controversies are the terrain</text>

I contend that the first challenge is met through images that are culturally inclusive, and can operate in a multitude of media, and images that are politically aware, but also images that are culturally specific and operate in a particular cultural context. I. Image and Image-System 	Every image I take part in or contribute to creates a new piece of cultural history. It expands the historical record, making it more complete and revealing, and it represents or represents a particular point in a particular historical trajectory. The image becomes, by definition, of a specific kind of historical significance. 	However, this historical importance often needs work and transformation. It must win over stakeholders with different sorts of hearts, interests, desires, etc. In other words, it must win over the  	majority of people who use cultural products, whether or not they identify with the cultural product in question. 	In the current cultural climate it is often forgotten that Sven Spieker in his wonderful book Cultural Capital notes that a cultural</text>

I contend that the first challenge is met through images that are culturally responsive, and can be contextualised within the prevailing system of images and symbols. This second challenge is more technologically feasible and politically manageable. Nevertheless, the first challenge remains critical.  [1] See https://www.ibrary.com/books/b...

I contend that the first challenge is met through images that are ever more variable, opaque, subjective and exploitative of their subjects. The opacity, variation and fluidity of image formats and social media is a constant and growing threat to the power structures of neoliberalism.

I contend that the first challenge is met through the image and its production of power; the second is met through images that are not necessarily images of images, but can nevertheless create an image and thereby exert significant influence over its creation.  The image is a complex social process that requires constant review and reinterpretation, and it is this critical mass of images that characterise the social world through which contemporary art is made. But the image is not made in a neat linear or simply aestheticised way. It is a dynamic combination of many different kinds of images, and its adoption, adoption by, and among various kinds of people is a much vaster event than that of a painting or a tweet. In the twentieth century, the adoption of an image was seen as a major event that would alter how images were constituted, constituted and taken up again; and in the twenty-first century the ubiquity of images is being interpreted in different ways. Social media is a major platform through which images now proliferate globally, and images are not just</text>

I contend that the first challenge is met by images that are as vivid, powerful, and pervasive as possible, but also by images that are images that are not images. The second is met by images that are images that are relevant and influential, but also by images that are images that are images that are not images? I would argue that the former is art and art is a critically-enabling political-cultural-ideological construct that enables the latter. The criterion that distinguishes art from other kinds of cultural artefacts is the degree to which the latter is created through the former. If the former is not taken seriously, then what is it that makes art? If the latter is not taken as seriously, then what does?  Art is often described as being both ‘transhistoric’ and ‘postcolonial’ in its own right. Transhistoricity describes how cultural forms re-occur, that is, how they return and evolve in response to changing social and economic conditions. Postcoloniality describes how such changes</text>

I contend that the first challenge is met through images that are as precariat as they are pop-culture savvy. The second is furthered in art and artistic-curatorial activities that actively create images through the misappropriation of images and images. I would argue that contemporary art and art-historical practices are directly related to technological change and the proliferation of information technologies, and that ‘big data’ is a primary media-generator for images today. This is because the image is the fundamental medium through which social change is realised and social change is realised through images: images that are capable of resonating across cultural divides and crevasses and across different social worlds. And because images are increasingly sensitive to the multi-layered images they receive, ‘infrastructure images’ play a pivotal role in maintaining and emerging social change.Infrastructures are the contemporary incarnation of colonial images, and not just in the sense that they are images of the past. They are images of the social impacts of historical processes that</text>

I contend that the first challenge is met through images that are political, but do not appear in a globalised media culture. The second is met through images that are image-based and image-specific. The image-based component of the art form – i.e. images that are representative and immediate, but also point to specific cultural phenomena – appears in works today that are much more readily available, have more access to resources and are more readily exchangeable.  	The image-based component of the art form is a versatile one, and can be used to produce ever-shifting images of ever-widening range and with ever-increasing immediacy. But it is the last step before the final image that dominates and mediates the world as a whole. Consequently, the image that emerges from an artist’s point of view is necessarily that which is most immediately relatable to a globalised and mediated public. This is why images that are truly iconic and truly stand out are those that last for a very long</text>

The project has been put on hold while the city works on a new masterplan that will include a larger civic and urban component. The project is now a deferred maintenance phase, and the only visible effects of this are that the Sculpture Garden receives new landscaping, a remodeled storage building, and an increased surveillance camera network. While the Sculpture Garden appears to be standing on its own two feet, the city is now in a position to interpose itself between the artist and her audience, overriding any potential artistic or community perspectives. This in turn may have unforeseen effects, such as creating an artist-student partnership with the city that could result in an increased exposure and value of the artist’s work.

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, through the actions of individuals such as ourselves? These questions are among many that can be asked of the emerging field of artificial intelligence. In this article, I turn to a range of topics that are of concern to me – topics that may not be sci-fi or fantasy per se, but are nevertheless of concern to humanity in its current form: what does it mean when a behaviour emerges that is inherently part of a species, and how might we alter that species to meet our needs?While much of what I want to do in this world is already possible through science and technology, understanding how species interact through their interactions is much more difficult. I see this in my work – the task of understanding how animals communicate comprises much more than simply science and technology: it is an art project, a ‘graphic novel’ that narrates the structural principles that underlie how our world works. Understanding the mechanisms that make up our world is not simply a job for engineers and scientists; it is</text>

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, by harnessing the significant amount of energy that is produced in the automotive industry? How might this affect the environment in the future car industry?These are questions that address new kinds of relationships between humans and the technological infrastructure of the future. Questions of infrastructure, not unlike infrastructure today, are a signature feature of the new technological society. They are, I believe, the platform upon which the new technological practices will be built upon.Questions of intention, whether philosophical, ethical or both, fuel much of what makes the technology work. And the drivers behind the wheel of tomorrow’s cars and trucks will likely have a strong moral compass as to what is right and wrong, how one should act in the world, and how one should interact with the world.New technologies are expected to interpret and augment human behaviour in subtle and sometimes profound ways. And in their current form, they will likely exacerbate existing inequalities and injustices. This is true whether we’re talking about driverless cars or self</text>

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, through the shaping of individual human behaviour? The possibilities are many and far-reaching. But the point of going to sea is not to discover the future; rather, the future is the point at which you attempt to build something like the present from the wreckage of the past. In other words, the future is the point at which you attempt to reconstruct the past in the present.If you look at the sea, you will see that the future is already here – it is all around us, mapped out and predicted by geography – but unlike the future, which can be defined, predicted and taken away from us, the future is here to stay. So, although the future may be uncertain and unpredictable, it is also certain and patently obvious here on Earth: there is no such thing as the ‘future’. That is, there is no such thing as ‘human progress’. There is only progress as in ‘progress books’. And so we must</text>

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, through the actions of a loosely distributed population? Perhaps one approach to such a capacity would be something like Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Artificial Neural Networks.These technologies simulate the processes that lead to the behaviour of machines, using techniques such as reinforcement learning and neural networks to seek out and engage with those who can best learn the system. In the case of self-driving cars, this could mean seeking out and engaging with certain types of drivers, or even just those who share certain characteristics. In one demonstration, a computer program instructed a fleet of cars to follow certain paths, based on data provided by a sensor network. The end result was that the paths took the vehicles somewhere, and the fleets arrived at destinations that were determined by the algorithms. This kind of behaviour is part of a larger trend, as cars become increasingly intelligent, and AI further enhances the capabilities of the vehicles.The question, then, becomes whether or not the emergent properties of the world are capable of supporting a new kind of</text>

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, through the actions of thousands of individuals, entities, or even massive bureaucracies? How might such change affect the way we see the world? Questions of race and gender come to mind, but there are many more that need to be considered.What might be possible through such architectures, I ask in the article, are questions that are beyond the reach of any one person or organisation, including the capacity of such organisations to create or contribute to such change through their actions. And therein lies the promise of such work: this type of ‘new thinking’ might lead to changes that are more enduring and even beneficial than those brought about by the individual actions of these individuals and organisations.In preparing to contribute to the Future City conference on 21 and 22 September 2018, I took the opportunity to reflect on the ideas and procedures behind autonomous vehicles, and how they might one day be able to contribute to a more comprehensive and positive future urbanisation agenda. What might one day be possible in such contexts? In</text>

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, through the mechanisms of self-driving cars? Perhaps one could even envisage such cars having the power to change their own colour scheme and packaging, and cars themselves changing colour as a function of driverless sensors? These shifts in colour would be indistinguishable from natural colour shifts, and the systems that monitor and control them would be indistinguishable from our own brains, in the form of electrical impulses triggered by the environment.At this point, however, we would need to understand how the brain maps colour into patterns that emerge from the environment – patterns that emerge because of interactions between neurons in the brain. In other words, we would need to understand how the brain creates its own patterns, and how such patterns emerge. Until now, this has been seen as a more of a humanistic endeavour, one that aims to understand the world through the human capacity, through the representations and representational techniques that humans employ to create the images and behaviours that result. In effect, this means developing self-driving cars that understand</text>

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, through the actions of a diverse group of people, rather than through the actions of an autonomous machine? These questions are questions of infrastructure, and they open new frontiers of understanding.Here, then, is my proposal: to give up something but to continually push on to create more of what you want – a potential one day to own a car company or even a company that develops advanced biofuels or other energy solutions – I propose that we call this ‘episodic succession’. As soon as possible after the driverless car is developed, I propose the design of an ‘episodic’ schedule that will allow the public to experiment with the car in various ways. The schedule will be shared between the car and the public, and will enable the car and the public to review the experience in different settings. The idea is that the public, rather than the other way around, organises experience; it gives the impression of driving the car, rather than of driving</text>

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, through the mechanisms of our techno-mechanical species? These are questions with potentially transformatory implications for our species, and they are addressed in great detail in the excellent book The Architecture of a Consumer Culture edited by John Urry and Allan Sekula.In this book, the authors show that the ‘machine’ in question is no longer constrained by the logic of formal systems or the fixed exchange of commodities. It has a host of transformative effects when applied to a material world, and the authors show how this happens when these systems are encouraged or even encouraged to do so. For instance, the book shows that when people are encouraged to become designers, they tend to become aesthetically displeased when faced with a bland object presentation. Designers are perhaps not always the best people to teach machines how to think, and the book shows that this can lead to mistakes that are often quite reactionary. Nevertheless, the authors show that this can be corrected through a series of sessions with the machines,</text>

How might we create environments in which such change can happen, at least in part, by encouraging such thought? These are questions that neither the experts nor the passengers in these futuristic carriages would wish to face, but which all experts and passengers now understand. What might be understood by these carriages, and what unknown unknowns might complicate the design of future carriages? These are questions that all experts now ask, but which none of us really know the answers to. Maybe we do know the answers to some questions, but few of us really know the reasons why some people are more likely than others to respond with different behaviours in different situations. Perhaps, in the future, we will all be able to drive autonomous cars.Download this article as PDFAna Laura Lopéz de la TorreAlterations, which appear in the journal American Scientist, are written by a rotating group of contributing writers from across the fields of science and technology.

How might these structures empower communities to enact their own changes, while remaining conscious of the actions of others? I will argue that we’re not capable of creating ‘machine learning’ through current scientific and technological means, but we can learn to employ non-invasive ways of learning.I. What is Machine Learning? 	Self-driving cars are becoming more common, and cars are becoming more complex. This article provides a brief introduction to what is meant by ‘machine learning’, and how it might contribute to our understanding of the world. 	It all begins with the introduction of statistics, and continues with the demonstration that the popularity of a song is directly correlated with the number of people in a car listening to it. 	Machine learning is the application of statistics to categorise music into types, and thus sound, into classes. The application of this underlying mathematical principle to human behaviour</text>

There are several candidates for this post, with names that conjure up images of dystopian futures: ‘Wild West’; ‘Wild West 2’; ‘Wild West 3’; and, of course, the list goes on. The reason why I refer to pre-apocalyptic is precisely because, while technological might may well change the ways in which social forms are constituted, it is social life that is shaken by the new systems. Technological might can and should be used to build cooperative housing co-operatives, but there is still the pressing matter of building new ways of organising society. New social forms that can be built can emerge from the wreckage of the old, but new ways of organising society are still needed. New social forms ultimately have to be built from the social whole, and new ways of being social. That is, new ways of organising society has to come from above, and these have to come from above in a way that is responsive to the needs and interests of the society at large.

The reason why I refer to specific works as ‘postindustrial’ is that they were written as if the present were still possible: as a point of departure for future writers, thinkers and artists to jump off into the vast and ever-shifting maelstrom of quantified reality. But as the following example shows, there is a sharp distinction between the techno-scientific imaginaries that emerged during the 1970s and the less savoury realities that people actually live with and produce in the world around them. 	The Wild West was the first apocalyptic novel I ever wrote, in 1975. It was a premonitory call to arms: don’t be fooled by the machine. 	The opening scene of Wild West 2 depicts a succession of apocalyptic visions in the wake of a machine that looks like a giant sentry.

The reason why I refer to these as ‘Wild West’ futures is that they are the future that are yet to be; those futures are not yet here. However, they are here now; they are part of our lives-pictures and cultural import. If we intervene now, and actively participate in creating them, we can alter the future in powerful ways. 	Today, we are involved in creating an infrastructure that can support large-scale renewable energies; a form of society based on energy efficiency and renewable energies will be based on smart buildings and sustainable mobility. It will be possible to travel back and forth between these different futures, taking part in one of several future art exhibitions that will be organized by the Biennale and its partner organisations.

This question begs the kind of general philosophical and social question that can lead to powerful new ways of organising the world. It also depends on what kinds of AI are envisaged. 	In principle, what is meant by creating an AI that acts in a way that maximises the utility of humanity as a whole – that is, in general, what we as a species as a whole would do? – is an AI capable of learning to do things optimally through experimentation, yet there are limits to how far this can be realised.

The reason why I refer to these as ‘postindustrial’ is that they are dominated by the functions of tracking, managing and manufacturing (in the wake of) commodities, fossil fuels and other forms of manufactured goods. The proliferation of transnational corporations and their attendant need for ever-more complex ways of structuring and automating means that the social is no longer what is considered normal or productive – that is, society as a whole is no longer deemed to be capable of sustaining itself as a function of its own metabolism. 	In a certain sense, then, postindustrialisation could be considered to have been ‘an inevitable by-product of the logic of commodity production’, as Walter Benjamin so articulates.1 Benjamin is referring to the fact that from the late nineteenth century to the mid twentieth century, as the capitalist system underwent its final phases of development, a certain amount of social decomposition was expected within the framework of the capitalist production process.

The reason why I refer to these as ‘postindustrial’ is because, in recent decades, they have become increasingly rare. The postindustrial is the location where the postindustrial no longer constitutes the operative concept; new industrial parks and seaside resorts are the locus of the last lingering traces of the once-inaccessible ‘near coastal zone’. 	However, there are others that are equally at home in the hyper-commercialised global economy: parks and recreation sites that serve as meeting-places for corporate executives and other dignitaries of capital, as well as places where nature reigns supreme – a notion that has recently come to define a new global economy. 	The postindustrial no longer constitutes the locus of the social; nonetheless, it is precisely in the globalised capitalist society that the social is no longer a determining factor in determining one’s access to wealth and power.

For this reason, I prefer to refer to such claims as ‘future studies’. 	The term ‘Wild West’ derives from the name of the region in question, which in turn derives from the Native American word for ‘wilderness’, which is part of the name of the region.

So, as we move forward into the uncertain future that is predicted to be populated by sentient life forms, we are subject to the whims of a machine that is capable of inventing ever more fantastically creative ways of organising the world. Will we be forced to choose between a future where intelligent life forms rule the planet with an iron fist and protecting us from the consequences of our actions, or a future where intelligent life forms with conscience and freedom emerge from the mists of time and space and take on the forms of creatures that are capable of opposing dehumanising machines?

There are several candidates for this post, with names that conjure up images of dystopian futures: ‘Wild West’; ‘Wild West 2’; ‘Wild West 3’; and, of course, the list goes on. The reason why I refer to these as ‘postindustrial’ is that they are locations where postindustrial development has become the norm, rather than exception. The dominant form of postindustrial social and economic development today is driven by the demand for access to raw materials and cheap energy – two commodities that are becoming increasingly scarce. As a result, a large share of the world's population lives within commuting distance of a major petroleum terminal or nuclear power plant. The postindustrial society I envision is one in which the collective needs are made explicit through the creation of a publicly verifiable set of rights – entitlements that would extend to all humankind irrespective of location, citizenship or economic standing. This may sound utopian to some, but to achieve this critical mass of rights, rights that would render the dominant forms of labour obsolete, we must all be able to identify with the movement for these rights. We must all be able to articulate why we are the way we are in terms that are visible to those with economic means to influence change. </text>

The reason why I refer to the interface as ‘the point where the violence stopped and the dreams started’ is that it is the point where the interface stops being a point and starts looking like a nightmare. It stops being a metaphor and starts being reality. 	The reason why the interface is so powerful in its ability to gather and fuse information is that it is able to map real-world phenomena onto pre-programmed schemas. In other words, the interface can map real-world phenomena onto pre-programmed schematic images. 	Once, the interface was a confined set of relations between the user and the work produced by his or her brain. As a result of this narrow focus, the user could not make or break the interface, and thus the productivity of the system was limited. But as the interface becomes ever more pervasive and interconnected, the limits of the user’s labour become unmanageable.

Today, the M.S.F.R. is the backbone of the borough’s dense development and supports an incredible amount of high-end residential and retail development. It is the physical manifestation of a political-ideological shift, and while the M.S.F.R. may or may not in fact be the answer, it is certain that the dense development that characterizes much of Manhattan now will be different. The question is whether the density needed to sustain such a future will be possible in a dense setting.

Today, the M.S.F.R. is the backbone of the Midtown Manhattan development project, and its continued evolution is the subject of great conjecture and debate. At the same time, the M.S.F.R. is experiencing what M.S.F. founder Murray Straus describes as ‘austerity’. The M.S.F.R. is increasingly the subject of a costly, multifaceted lawsuit brought by a coalition of community activists and a New York City council member. The suit claims that the M.S.F.R. is too centralized, lacking in horizontality, and subject to eminent domain.

The M.S.F.R.'s stated rationale for the Manhattan Project was that this project would produce 'the resources necessary to support the emergency response to a declared or suspected terrorist attack’.1 	The resources never looked further towards the future than the immediate neighbourhood, and the project’s eventual cancellation seemed necessary in order to deal with the threat from radiological contamination. The resources of the immediate neighbourhood now look to be harnessed in a war on terror scenario where even the US government admits that the war on terror is not working. 	The question of ownership remains unsettled.

As a result, the need for ever-greater amounts of energy decreased. 	Making the blocks affordable for daily use meant overcoming some resistance. New Yorkers would not drive down Fifth Avenue without stopping to explore the many green spaces and museums lining the north side. The M.S.F.R. required that people park for long periods in designated lots, and then be able to find a parking spot. The lots had to be wheelchair-accessible, and waiting lists could be announced by sign-language. A group of artists was formed, the Green Family, to develop strategies for accessibility and to keep the art form alive beyond the few artists who were able to work on the spot. 	The Green Family was active in the borough from the beginning, and their strategies for accessibility evolved over time. The most successful were developed in tandem with the M.S.F.R., and distributed widely by the gallery system,</text>

The towers rose higher than ever, and the need for ever-greater energy resources shifted the need for ever from the peripheries of Manhattan to the centres of the city. The M.S.F.R. did away with the notion of land and replaced it with a need for physical proximity – meaning access from all parts of the city. The increased height and mass of the structures also meant that they needed much more energy to be fuelled than they were originally built to be used. Thus came the day when the M.S.F.R. suddenly declared that the whole block would be suitable for energy production – a declaration that was almost word for word an echo of what the T.S.A. had just said ten years earlier.1 	The M.S.F.R. seemed to be saying that the factories and mines of the city were no longer to be trusted, and that the factories and mines of tomorrow should operate according to the same laws and take the same pollution into account when making decisions as we do today.

The towers rose higher than ever, and the need for ever-greater energy resources shifted the burden of renewable energy from the hands of the farmer to the very tower. The need for ever-greater amounts of fossil fuels came to define the character of the tower – what counted as valuable, what could be counted as valuable, and how one should count such things became increasingly important – as did the need for ever-greater profits. The need for ever-greater infrastructure came to define the character of the borough. 	Today, the M.S.F.R. stipulated that certain types of development could no longer be counted as ‘renewable energies’. These included new stadiums for the soccer and basketball teams, as well as recreation facilities for the city as a whole. Despite these strictures, however, many developers flocked to the outer boroughs, devoting enormous resources to converting already highly-developed areas into profit centers.

The M.S.F.R. required that each developer develop a clearly articulated Master Plan for the District, but it also provided that the plans be submitted to the Mid-Island Manhattan Development Corporation (MICCD), the governmental entity responsible for creating the city ‘stabilization’ of the island ‘frontier’.’ The plan must include a catch-all formula for the utilization of the surplus, and it is up to MICCD to draw up a plan that works for all of Mid-Island Manhattan.

The need for ever-greater energy resources shifted the cost of energy to consumers – workers, customers, shareholders – rather than to the city. This was true not only of buildings and equipment, but also of raw materials and biofuels needed for the machineries that churned out these buildings and the biofuels needed for the transport of these materials across the board. And these materials and biofuels didn’t seem to scale. This happened because the density of buildings in Manhattan increased, not because of anything new or innovative about the way Manhattan was built, but because of the sheer amount of building material and how it was stacked. As a consequence, the cost of energy became increasingly variable – depending on how much of each kind of building material was used, and how much was recycled. If a building with a rooftop was ever going to be affordable, it would</text>

For the decisions that humans make on a regular basis – which decisions, perhaps, are driven by the forces of nature? – we are constantly evolving mechanisms to adapt to changing circumstances. And these are the decisions that algorithms now make, increasingly conscious of their own capabilities and intent, and even as they do so, increasingly aware of the ways that they might be replaced. The question is how much of the decision-making that went into the app maker’s success in the 21st century is now similarly impacted by the actions of an evolving and data-driven public, and how much is actually automated.One might speculate that, as the popularity of social media grows, and as more people live their lives online, the need for human curators grows.

Such advances render ever more difficult the task of imagining anew, such challenges are bound to repeat themselves if not checked – which is to say, they are almost always checked. Given the exponential growth of data-mining and machine learning, it is easy to imagine a future in which such applications are deployed widely and widely, and in which individuals do not need to reside in particular locations or have particular identities. Such a future would also permit a great leap backwards in the construction of identities, in that it would mean that today’s identities would no longer be determined by a particular historical or geographical location, but rather would be determined by machine learning and artificial intelligence.Such a scenario is not unimaginable, and it is certainly possible to imagine such a future. However, it is not this future, and neither is it this today. We need to be cognizant of the fact that there is a very real threat to our very identities as identity documents.

It is the application of mathematical models to the social sciences and humanities in an attempt to understand human behaviour, and is part of a broader effort to make the underlying data of human behaviour available to enable new kinds of understanding. In other words, it is part of a broader historical and theoretical conversation that has yet to have sufficiently enfused our perceptions that we can call it ‘science’.Machine learning is part of a ‘big data’ revolution that is reshaping the social sciences and humanities in ways that no previous generation of social scientists could have imagined possible. It is a war for social media, and its outcomes will determine whether or not the social media giants that emerged in the wake of this revolution will be able to adapt their business models to accommodate them any longer.

But in the face of this growing mechanisation of everything, there is no room for complacency.We must take stock of what is happening, both at home and abroad. Is there something we can learn from the emergence of autonomous weapons systems, where the player ‘plays’ according to predetermined rules? Or is there a chance that such systems might be used for good, where the checks and balances that we impose on them break down? If the latter, what are the checks and balances? Where does that leave us? These are questions that continue to terrify us, and which continue to define our international relations. [1] The Oxford English Dictionary defines an autonomous means of understanding something other than by reference to its intrinsic characteristics. For instance, the ability to read maps is considered to be an autonomous ability.

This time it is the ‘real-time’ aspects of social media that are being programmed into the software of media players, players of video games, and even of commercial websites. Such algorithms monitor and control content in real-time, giving rise to all kinds of new media possibilities. Some may be good, but as Google shows, most are created by machines.Let’s look at an example from Google’s Project Ara project. Project Ara is a new kind of modular housing that seeks to address the structural issues of housing in a non-hierarchical and transparent way. The modular movement of components allows for a wide range of creative configurations – accommodating different needs and lifestyles – yet remains extremely tractable and can still be assembled into a single unit with minimal disruption</text>

As the end game for creative destruction is revealed, artists therefore find themselves thrust ever deeper into the narrative, and even if this is ‘what they’ve always intended’, it’s now becoming clear just how that will all end. I view some of my own work as a kind of intrusion, a provocation. It’s an amazing thing to witness how society is evolving, how much of what we call ‘the future’ is actually here already, in the form of apps, data, music and films. I’m not sure there was a time when I didn’t consider the fact that at some point in the future, people might want to try to stop this kind of stuff from happening to them. Yet somehow, someway</text>

Such advances render ever more difficult the task of imagining anew, such challenges are bound to repeat themselves if not checked – which is to say, unless a determined core of inventors and users stands up and takes matters of the future seriously.We can only imagine what ‘real life’ would be like if people cared deeply about and participated in creating it, and if they realised that their actions could have lasting consequences. We do not yet know whether such empowerment would mean things like boycotts and demonstrations, but it is certain that it would entail significant changes in how people interact with the city. We do know that in recent years there has been a marked increase in hate speech directed at immigrants and refugees, and that in some cases this has been fuelled by specific policies of the state. We also know that in recent years, people have been encouraged to follow specific programmes and accept roles – be they police officers, social workers, teachers or nurses – in a wider movement to transform the city.

Such advances render ever more difficult the task of imagining anew, such challenges are bound to repeat themselves if not checked – which is to say, they are expressions of the present in which there is no horizon. The challenge today is to imagine new futures, or perhaps to imagine places and worlds outside of today’s urban centres. Although this may seem like a reductive claim, there is some truth to this. There is much going on in the world of which we do not yet know, that is to say, much of which is still largely invisible to the urban centres. We do not yet know how the migration and refugee streams arrive, how they are distributed, who they are, where they are headed and with whom they are made en route, and so forth. We do not yet know that the social and spatial conditions that enable the emergence of new modes of interaction and cultural consumption are also fuelling the growth of transnational corporations intent on selling these narratives to a public eager for knowledge.It is easy to dehumanise these publics when viewing them through a capitalist filter, but it is much harder to</text>

Such advances render ever more difficult the task of imagining anew, such challenges are bound to repeat themselves if not checked – at least in the short term. Such repetition is also evident in the art world, where artists are quick to declare their intent to expand their audiences’s horizons if such a thing exists. The difficulties of imagining anew, however, are dwarfed by the intrinsic beauties of modern art. One may argue that the efforts of artists today are directed at providing aesthetically pleasing experiences for their audiences, while also engaging with deeper philosophical questions about the world. Perhaps it is the latter that is being done in an arts context, albeit one where philosophical questions are frequently raised.On the other hand, modern art has its moments of real utopian potential. The early modern avant garde was a particularly interesting case in point. Its philosophical underpinnings are deeply embedded in our modern cultural landscape, and its urbane, sometimes absurd, occasionally absurdist spirit is a refreshing departure from the strictures and taboos of contemporary art. Its rejection of the historical avant garde and the strictures</text>

And while we might wish to think that the 21st century would be an age of peace and social inclusion, we also know that the social needs of the many require that we engage with one another. As a consequence, we are bombarded with messages of engagement from all over the world, from places such as Liverpool, which are designed to engage us in activities such as football, or the Grenfell District Council, which is redeveloping its old post-industrial site into a regional cultural hub, engaging with locals through a series of cultural events, or the North East Anglian Art Biennale, which</text>

    The project is a speculation on the fact that, during the 1980s and 1990s, the United States and UK intelligence services actively supported the spread of Marxist and civil-rights ideologies throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, especially in the lead-up to the Transatlantic Air-Transit Corridor (1984–1990) – a $3.8 billion (£2.2 billion) air-transit corridor that ran from Spain to Ireland, from Portugal to Canada, and from Egypt to Israel. The American and British intelligence services provided technical and financial support to the leftist guerrilla groups that were active in these countries at that time, including the armed wing of the International Marxist Tendency.

Artists would no longer prescribe artists and the sites on which they work, but would instead work with artists to create sites that are their own, spaces in which to work and live free from algorithmic surveillance. This is the technocratic vision of the future society, and while it is theoretically possible to reimagine the social in such a way as to overcome algorithmic surveillance, it is doubtful if this could ever happen on a large enough scale.

This is the culture industry of the future, in other words. It is a media industry that seems to absorb and generate its own aesthetic values, which are then passed on from artist to artist, and are constructed according to the unique needs of each individual artist. 	Artists who are drawn to this technological milieu tend to be creative and rebellious individuals. But their artistic decisions are often guided by the algorithms that monitor and control their online behavior. These algorithms not only determine what artists can and cannot do in the context of art, but also what kinds of art can and cannot be made in the context of art.

These artists are the cyborgs, and their avantgarde projects speak to the contingency of artistic freedom when faced with a new machine learning algorithm. 	In a later stage, when the ethical and aesthetic concerns of the project are further considered, it could even turn out that the artists who adopt this new mode of making are actually operating against the prevailing order, because the prevailing order is themselves often threatened with extinction. 	The question is, which order is this going to lead to? If we consider, for example, the avant garde practice of 2006–07, we can see that there is a tension emerging between the aesthetic concerns of the time (evoked by techno-mathematical media) and the political concerns of the moment (evoked by the war in Iraq). The aesthetic concerns of the time revolve around the destruction of art and aesthetic values in the pursuit of military might; the military might of today is directed against the very idea of beauty and the social values that underpinned the modern culture we have all grown up with. The political realm is also increasingly interested in optics and technical know-how, and advances in artificial intelligence mean that this interest will no longer be confined to the military. 	</text>

In a later stage, when the ethical and aesthetic concerns of the project are further considered, it may be possible to recreate the influence of these cyborg artists by bringing together contemporary art and computer arts in a shared context. But right now, the situation calls for caution, as it is being introduced at an alarming rate in the arts world: art is being used as a surveillance tool, and some would say it is being hijacked. Art is no longer the sole determinant of our environmental discourse, and although we might wish to think otherwise, the increasing reliance on computer aided techniques such as image processing and social media will inevitably affect the very fabric of our utopian future cities. 	Art is no longer the sole representative of our cultural landscape. Nevertheless, it is our responsibility as artists and creators, to take stock of the state of our cultural landscape, to map it, to take stock and map it ourselves, taking into consideration the ever-increasing scale and speed of change that is inevitable in the wake of the new technology that is being unleashed.

In a later stage, when the ethical and aesthetic concerns of the project are further developed, these artists could become moral arbiters or even philosopher-kings or just ordinary folk who find creative meaning in the world around them. They could be artists in all but name, and discover new ways of working in the service of art. 	The biopolitics of the internet could be a turn of events, and art as an art form could again be drawn to the question of the machine. This is an exciting time to be alive, when so many new technologies are wrecking havoc on the natural world around us. The biopolitics of the internet could also mean new forms of artistic expression, since the social media platforms of the future will not be artists but crowds, and will instead serve audiences that are more social and connective. 	Artists will still do what they do best: find meaning in their circumstances, face the crowd, and sometimes fight for it. But the biopolitics of the internet could also mean that the art form may no longer be so</text>

In a later stage, when the ethical and aesthetic concerns of the project are further developed, this might even be possible. But for the present, we’re stuck in a loop of increasingly dystopian futures where the technologists reap the most benefits and the citizens of a post-AI society suffer from the consequences. The biopolitics of the internet has created a new situation in which the biennial is unavoidably placed in a negative relation to the city. We need to find other ways of organising ourselves in these times. Art is a powerful tool, but it’s questionable whether its potential is shared by all artists. The biennial, as an institution, is particularly susceptible to this kind of abuse. In a previous incarnation, the biennial might have a clear social purpose: in the age of the biopolitics of the internet, maybe it would consider its place in a broader cultural hierarchy. 	But the biennial we’ve created today is different from any other. It has a social purpose only, and that’s why it’</text>

In a later stage, when the ethical and aesthetic concerns of the project are further considered, the biopolitics of the internet could be adapted into a politics of the negative, or perhaps a politics of the positive, as well. 	Such a politics would address the systems that enable the biopolitics of the machine, but it would also involve a complete rethink of what art and culture really are. In recent years, the biopolitics of the internet has become even more prominent in the context of curatorial politics. It is no longer simply an area of politics that is decided through technocratic means, but one in which issues of culture are regularly used to justify or preemptively preempt governmental action. This is evident in the fact that in 2014, when Australian federal police raided the Bahrain headquarters of the Australian-based Bahrain Foundation, which was hosting the Al Asmakh Festival of Art, a decision was taken to close the festival down altogether, citing a threat to national security. The Bahraini government responded by temporarily banning all forms of art from the country. 	</text>

In a later stage, when the ethical and aesthetic concerns of the project are further considered, a biopolitics of the machine could become possible. Perhaps what is needed is for the biopolitics of the internet to be expanded to allow for a cultural ecology of the information age in which art and culture play a central role. There are already artists who dedicate their careers to placing artworks online, and there is ample precedent for such an expansion of the biennial through the decades that it exists.

Perhaps the future city is only as smart as its weakest link. 	The question, then, becomes whether the artists who emerged during the critical years after the art fairs and petrocities of the early twentieth century could be considered modern artists. My answer is a positive and emphatic ‘yes’. The art fairs and petrocities that emerged during the first half of the century were characterised by the flowering of artistic freedom, and this flowering is part of a general artistic trend towards the more universalisation of experience, more universal concepts, and hence, in the twentieth century, the more universal forms of art. The important thing is that these artists were conscious of the creative potential of what the art fairs and petrocities offered, and that their work came out of that. The problems that emerged during the twentieth century are similar</text>
