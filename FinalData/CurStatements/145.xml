    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial, organised by Liverpool Biennial and the Chisenhale Foundation, is tentatively titled Liverpool: The City of Lights. It will see the art projects and collaborative efforts of a group of artists led by Rami El Samahy, in creating a new narrative of the city through a physical and virtual re-construction of its infrastructure. From the press release:The proposed ‘city of lights’ is an idea that has been circulating for some years now, and it is believed to be a new paradigm for conceptual design and urbanisation in the “real” world. The name is a play on words – actually two different things – and reflects the idea that the ‘world’ is made up of two distinct spaces, or ‘levels’ – separated by a void or two.

The idea was put forward by Rami El Samahy and his team at the Chisenhale Foundation, and it was part of their larger ‘global concept’ project. The project was conceived as a ‘City of Light’ – a city whose streets and buildings could nevertheless be unseen by urban explorers and the surveillance state – and a ‘city without a city’. It put forward the idea that the obvious city centre, with its skyscrapers and museums and ‘town’s ‘roundabout’ and ‘green space’ that is the object of surveillance, could also be transformed and democratised through the efficient use of transparent building materials, permeable parkland and a host of other practices that are now standard in urban districts everywhere in an instantaneously accessible manner.“The city is made up of many small pieces, and each of these pieces is unique. Therefore, if one takes a look at the city from above, one can infer a great deal about the city from the information gathered from these small pieces.”‘The news of the project's discovery spread</text>

The idea was put forward by Rami El Samahy and his team at the Chisenhale Foundation, and it was part of their larger ‘Light Rail’ project. The proposed ‘city of lights’ would have incorporated a number of public spaces, including parks and streets, a new ‘sub-purpose area’ for the summer, a multi-purpose ‘design district’ for commercial and cultural uses, and an area similar to that of London’s Fenway Park where the Boston Red Sox play. The area would have also included a number of new residential towers, including some that would have been part of the ‘SkyDome’ – a new kind of ‘high-performance, high-value, mixed-use development with a few tweaks here and there that Rami would have approved. Instead, the proposed area was given the nickname ‘Little Darlington’, and its moniker has stuck. And there we are, stuck – stuck in the evolution of ideas and discourse surrounding a city that wants to be called home, stuck in the evolution of a city</text>

The project was presented at the 14th Venice Biennale and part of the ‘Future City’ exhibition series in Berlin.The new narrative of the city is one where people do things differently, and create new situations and situations, according to which ideas of ‘public’ and ‘private’ space are imbricated.

The end of colonialism, the industrial revolution and the beginning of a global temperance drive have brought unprecedented riches for a nation-state, but the race to the bottom in global capital has seen a marked reduction in population. In many cities, especially in the West, the decline of the Victorian era is still a concern, but in places like Liverpool, which is experiencing its own demographic crisis, the loss of its architectural glory days</text>

The two projects together form part of a one-month multi-disciplinary symposium that will see art, architecture, community design and urbanisation at work in a new urban development project in Liverpool. The project will see the involvement of around twenty-five artists, designers and architects from across the UK and internationally, as well as local residents, chosen on the basis of their 'welcoming of new people to the city’.The proposal was received with much enthusiasm, and from the beginning, with many of the ideas originating with Rami El Samahy and his team.

The idea was put forward by Rami El Samahy and his team at the Chisenhale Foundation, and it was part of their larger ‘Light it Up’ project, which also includes the installation of more than 1,000 LEDs in the Old Bailey and the creation of a new public realm, which they call ‘The Roundhouse’.The idea was put forward that the biennale, which is so consistently about the city, should be about more than the architectural elements that are often cited as defining the ‘city’. So the question was, how to create a ‘long-term partner’ for the biennale, while also valuing the biennial in its own right? The answer, it seems to me, is in the interplay between the two. The biennial has to be a long-term collaborator in creating the city in order to sustain it, whereas the role of the artist-organisation is to produce art that is persistent and universal in its impact. It is a ‘transactional dynamic’. The relationship between the biennial and the</text>

The proposal is to create a worldwide network of grassroots ‘luminary users’ to create a virtual ‘daylight’ that corresponds to the urban environment, but with a clear ‘side’ that traverses the entire sky. This new ‘daylight’ would stretch for hundreds of thousands of km, reaching as far as Antarctica. The project is part of Rami El Samahy’s ‘Rethinking Urban Spaces’ project, which addresses the effects of urbanisation on the natural world.The idea is to embed a photovoltaic array near the ground-level entrance to the city, with the goal</text>

The idea was put forward by Rami El Samahy and his team at the Chisenhale Foundation, and it was part of their larger ‘Lighting a City’ project. The proposal is a new paradigm for urbanisation that looks to the past while pushing the envelope of what is possible within architecture, urbanisation and governance. It proposes a new kind of ‘research project’ that engages not only government, but also the public in constructing the city, while enabling a critical analysis and design of alternatives.The press release also includes a statement of purpose and a proposal for research project.  It mentions the need for resilience, but also for understanding, and suggests that understanding is a precondition for resilience.  For those unfamiliar with the concept of planetary sustainability, understand that sustainability refers to the ability of a community to support the functioning of its ecosystem in the presence of human activity. In other words, it refers to the ability of communities to grow and absorb new people and goods – new technologies, goods and services – into their social systems. If a community cannot or does not manage these technologies and goods effectively</text>

The idea was put forward by Rami El Samahy and his team at the Chisenhale Foundation, and it was part of their larger ‘Investiture: Crisis of the City’ project. The concept was developed in collaboration with Welsh Streets Community Land Trust and commissioned by Liverpool Biennial.The proposal and development processes are detailed in several documents including The Resident, Issue #2 (2016), and the report 'The State of Play’ in The Resident, Autumn 2016, p.75. The report provides a detailed survey of the state of British urbanism and culture in the period from 2007 to 2016. It is based on research that was funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change at the University of Liverpool and published in conjunction with the Liverpool Biennial. The report provides a critical analysis of the crisis of culture in the city and the USA through the prism of the epidemic of 'crisis culture'. It is the thesis of the project 'Beyond Crisis’ that investigates the seemingly intractable wound inflicted by the crisis of culture in Britain and the world at large. This wound is felt most</text>

The project was also part of Future City 2020, an ‘adopt-a-city’ pilot project funded by the Arts Council and run by the Arts Council’. The name comes from the Arabic phrase فَعْلَيْنَ (ʘAllāh Akbar), which literally means ‘inside the city’, and is often translated as ‘inside the country’. In this translation, the city is frequently identified as a site of conflict and political instability. But in a nutshell, the city is a site of continual change – constantly on the edge of new developments, undergoing new configurations and configurations of cities, and constantly in need of stabilization – constantly in need of a third party to maintain order and create a sense of predictability. In this sense, ‘the city’ becomes a site of possibility – an outcome of unpredictable processes that can and do occur at any</text>

The concept was further developed and refined by the artist and his team, and it now forms part of the museum collection at M.I.T. This is a brief introduction of the historical roots of the concept, or at least some of the things that have come out of the blue in the last year.The roots of concept go back to 1972, when Benjamin Fulmer, an artist and researcher, started collecting cultural materials from all over the world. His interest was cultural construction, and he collected artefacts from all over the place – objects that were intended to be gathered and made publicly visible. He collected cultural tools, materials, and even implemented some of his own ideas and practices into these collections. For example, he would invite a group of artists to create performance projects using ‘culture tourism’ as a vehicle to explore cultural destinations. He would pay them generously, and then provide them with a platform to explore cultural sites around</text>

It is projected to create or create a new business for itself, employ 4001 of its tourist population and support over 2,500 jobs by redeveloping or creating new venues, restaurants and shops.

The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but also the ability to change course when the situation warrants it. A biennial can be a catalyst for change, bringing people together to consider alternatives and opening new avenues of action. Researchers at The New York Public Library, The University of Chicago, and The Smithsonian Institution have collaborated on a number of projects related to the book of Mormon, which was made possible through the partnership of The McCormick Place. The exhibition was shown in over 200 countries and at more than 200 art museums. It is currently on display at the National Gallery in London, and the Biennial is planning to show it in Los Angeles. The exhibition should be read as a corpus of experiences, from the author and her collaborators to the people who came to the Biennial to learn more and talk about it. The text should reflect both the author’s own feelings about the subject, as well as the knowledge of the participants.

The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but in this respect they are especially adept at bringing together people from different fields and communities. Their facility with different kinds of people, places and worlds makes them ideally placed collaborators. The Liverpool Biennial has been a strong proponent of its collaboration with the arts community, recently announcing an ambitious new arts and culture programme that will see the organisation supporting artists and producing artist-curated art projects across the city. In support of this programme, the Biennial is embarking on a year-long, multi-disciplinary residency programme, inviting artists from across the city to engage with the issues of community engagement and art production through a deluxe workshop programme in a renovated gallery system. The programme will see artists from the Biennial curate a series of activities across the city, with a special focus on the arts and culture of the Asian diaspora. The residency programme will see the artists employed in various capacities develop a shared set of skills and knowledge relevant to the new media and visual arts methods employed. This includes the</text>

A new perspective, a consideration of what might become of a project, is precisely what biennials are good at providing. The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but equally critical is the need to ask how one can build on previous projects and move forward. This is precisely what the Liverpool Biennial is attempting to achieve, by contributing its resources and shaping the project in ways that are as creative and innovative as its curators have been in choosing projects. In this sense, the project is in no way a re-branding exercise, but seeks to turn a project into something more than what it is. This is not a commercial enterprise, but a cultural one. Cultural production is a production for knowledge, and the question of what becomes of knowledge becomes ever more critical as the biennial project advances. As the curator of the Liverpool Biennial, I have a great deal of responsibility for the project’s success, but also a great deal of responsibility for its failure, because I am its architect, and its controller. I alone am responsible for its success, because the project will not be able to exist in a vacuum. I have a responsibility to the community</text>

The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but also the ability to change course or break away from the path taken by the prevailing tide. In a recent survey of European cultural practices, Holly Holmfeld and Asma Qureshi of the Danish Council for Independent Research asked: ‘What are the characteristics that distinguish an independent cultural practice from an institution?’. The researchers concluded that a post-institutional shift in cultural resources was needed, and that a cultural commission was the best instrument to deploy in this new environment.4. A cultural commission, what is the new institutional capacity for the production of publics? How are resources mobilised to render a given public good, or public good in this case, a function of a particular artist? How are resources applied in the making of publics, and in the actualisation of such publics? What is the relationship between art institutions and their audiences? What are the forms of cultural organisation that aim to draw individuals in through their commission, their purchase, or any other means? What</text>

The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but in a larger context, rather than in isolation. The Liverpool Biennial has already demonstrated a remarkable amount of curiosity about its past and the world of its present; it has invited scholars from a wide range of disciplines to contribute to the project’s future research. The project has already produced a number of authoritative books with titles such as ‘The Anfield Home Story’ and ‘The Anfield Home Tour’9. The project has also invited artists, writers and curators from across the globe to contribute to the publication of its ‘30th Anniversary Edition’10. These diverse approaches will be presented at a conference on 14 and 15 December called ‘30 Years of Biennial in Liverpool’s High Street’11. In conducting research in Liverpool, the Biennial secured funding from the GB8 Innovation Fund and the FOUNDation, as well as the GB12 Strategic Capital Fund and NOMAD program at Columbia University's Mailman School of Architecture.

The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but also the ability to change plans if the new knowledge conflicts with the old ones. In the case of a project seeking to establish a new cultural form in a city, a biennial could prove vital. It is projected to add $41-$56 million to the value of the city over its first ten years, and add another $17-$29 million annually thereafter. In 2015, the biennial was up for a double digit increase, and is expected to add another $1 billion to the value of the city in perpetuity. The increased value of such growth, however, is greatly dependent on a number of critical urban trends, including the sustainability of social and health conditions, the proliferation of decent and affordable housing, and the ability of communities to take part in cultural life. Current estimates place the annual value of housing provided in Liverpool at approximately ₤10 billion. If the housing crisis is not addressed, and rapid growth in housing-related infrastructure is addressed, the housing crisis could become a much</text>

A new perspective, a consideration of what might become of a project, is precisely what biennials are good at providing. The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but also the ability to change course if the need arises. In a recent engagement, I led a symposium for a conference of the Society for Visual Anthropology, Learning Arts and Science in New York that invited speakers from different disciplines to explore the ways in which cultural geography intersects with physical geography. I introduced the notion of ‘cultural tourism’ to the symposium, which ties in with the idea of ‘cultural hypersurveyor’ that is beginning to gain currency, and which is closely related to what I’d previously proposed as the mode of cultural tourism.1  Traveling by cultural tourism is a form of cultural imperialism that exploits the myth of the return to home and intermingles with the myth of the epicurean, universal return. As Paula Ridley-Thomas observes,2 ‘cultures that produce, narrate or document return journeys are typically characterized by the return of ideologies and histories, including ‘essentialist narratives of a return to a pre</text>

A new perspective, a consideration of what might become of a project, is precisely what biennials are good at providing. The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but also the capacity to shift those perspectives as circumstances require it. For example, the Liverpool Biennial may have the financial means to initiate a project that would result in an asset being created, but it is clear that the project would be highly individualised: the significance of that particular asset would reside in the hands of the biennial itself. The sole authority to create that asset would reside in the biennial itself. The question becomes: what does it mean to be an asset in the age of abundance? At the same time, what is the difference between biennials and museums? What is the difference between biennials and historic buildings? 	Looking back at the history of the Biennial, it is clear that the biennial emerged through the combined efforts of a diverse group of individuals: the curator, the artist and the historian. The biennial was originally conceived as a recurring exhibitionary form, but over time various curators and art administrators have used the space, exhibitionary and otherwise,</text>

A new perspective, a consideration of what might become of a project, is precisely what biennials are good at providing. The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but equally essential is that project’s original conception and implementation. In seeking to understand a project fully, a museum or an art gallery must offer all the relevant information in a way that resonates with the actual practice, or more accurately the theoretical possibility. Here, biennials play a key role. They are likely places where the actual activity takes place, and where knowledge is gathered, disseminated and exchanged. They are a platform on which social, economic and spatial relations are worked out, and through them relations between people develop. They are places of discovery, where knowledge is sought, and by doing so generate knowledge about themselves and the world around them. And finally, they are places of analysis and discourse.As projects are developed and continue to be developed, their sites are often re-designated, re-named or redrawn to fit contemporary needs and desires. This is a natural by-product of the constant shifting of where things are located. The true identity of a site doesn�</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is the first in a planned series of seven venues to be funded by the Biennial. The total estimated cost of the project is $125 million. The biennial is the largest visitor attraction in Liverpool, and the city’s largest cultural draw for visitors from all over the world. It is projected to create or create a new business for itself, employ 4001 of its tourist population and support over 2,500 jobs by redeveloping or creating new venues, restaurants and shops.

A new perspective, a consideration of what might become of a project, is precisely what biennials are good at providing. The key is collaboration and the willingness to consider alternative perspectives, but the emergence of such critical or innovative approaches to projects is also a necessary condition of the project’s success. The project that was initially developed as a ‘tenants’ part of the ‘Big Four’ – the Museum, The Public Theater, The Williamsburg Museum and Southampton Artspace – is being revised to take into account the knowledge of the tenants and the local community, and to incorporate suggestions from the local residents' organisation in an open and deliberate fashion, taking into consideration all relevant stakeholders. This new perspective may well differ from the original proposal, and may well be rejected outright by the Biennial management, but the emergence of such new ideas represents an opportunity, a counterattack, and a challenge to the prevailing order. It is a chance to address vested interests and make new, positive assumptions about the city. This is a chance to make a difference.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is a writer and artist. Her work has addressed a broad</text>

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the art form, and who may engage with the art form themselves. For example, although the artist may have intended her installation at Tate Britain to be accessible to anyone who wanted to learn more about visual art, the fact of its being in this form inevitably means that it will be of use to a certain demographic of people, since people use art as a form of transport, and art is a culturally performative art form. So an artist who intends her work to be accessible through performance and discourse, and whose installations do not engage with such a concept, but rather engage with a wider, more negative sense of art, is engaging with a form of art that is of a higher order, and should therefore be more readily accessible. And this is why an artist should be able to choose the community in which her art takes place, and to be able to define the terms and parameters of this community. In other words, when an artist creates a socially engaged art form, she or he creates socially engaged</text>

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the art form. In designing their own art, artists and artists’ teams are often confronted with the difficult task of educating a group of people of a certain age, similar in age to themselves, on the difference between art and art history. But this education is usually provided through a metaphor or set of relations that do not encompass or relate to the concrete conditions and situations that an artist or a team of artists would encounter during curatorial activities. For instance, the art of the 1960s and seventies was produced on the back of the notion that ‘genuine art’ – or, by some accounts, the genuine spirit of the era – was being reproduced on the walls of buildings across Britain and beyond. Although the hard-nosed curatorial work ethic was often cited as a reason for the inflated returns to the art market at that time, it is now generally acknowledged that the art of the sixties was produced on a mass scale, with large-scale installations found nowhere else, and</text>

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the specific art form. For example, while an artist may design her or his artwork to be accessible to those with a lower income, she or he cannot design his or her artwork to be accessible to those who do not have access to a gallery or museums. In contemporary art, this would mean engaging audiences with works that are accessible to a specific audience, while in the past when art was this way, the goal was to engage audiences with culturally relevant works that would be of use to their communities. Today, a gallery visitor with a low income may find art that is not culturally relevant to their community, whereas a community artist with a community of engaged patrons might find art that is culturally relevant to their community. But this is a community effort, and as a community artist knows, knows how to negotiate the system in order to achieve cultural relevance. Another example of the art world failing to see the need to reckon with communities is found in the use of eminent domain. While it is sometimes argued that the public</text>

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the issues and perspectives. The projectors in most art programs are not necessarily the best audience for the most basic kind of education, but they typically deliver a rich range of knowledge, including of course about art history. If the art is to make an impact, it is essential that the context in which it is shown, heard and understood be accessible. How an art form is contextualized is a task that can and should be undertaken by an artist’s organization, and an artist should take part in creating that context through organisation, education and activism.An art project is a collective act of taking part in a shared historical project, that is ongoing across generations, in which people from different places and times come together to engage with, and sometimes to change the course of, the art in a particular place. It is an ongoing act that involves not only the places where art is produced, but also through cultural networks, production and distribution (including through the distribution of literature and art materials). It is a</text>

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the particular art form in which she or he works. For example, the art of Rwandan artists is of course highly visible, but many Rwandan artists are now active in Brazil, South Africa and elsewhere in Europe and America. This is because the media has shifted so much of its focus away from Kowaleski, Central Africa, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in recent years, and many African artists are now active in wealthier countries such as the USA, Canada and South Africa. This is why many contemporary artists of colour are drawn to these countries, where the consumers of their art are more likely to be white, middle class and urban.Finally, what is the role of an artist in the new art forms? I believe that the key is to remain engaged, and to understand that art is a social activity, and that artists are expected to engage with their audiences in ways that are authentic to the contexts in which they live and work. I also believe that an artist</text>

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the subject of her art. For example, a biennial that focuses on a particular theme may employ artwork from many different periods in history, using this as a teaching tool. The aim of this workshop was to teach contemporary art history through a series of six works that were part of the exhibition Triennials: Art from Multiple Times, Triennials: A Visual History of Art from Colonial America to the Present, and Triennials: Art from the Internet Age. The artists in the group were asked to imagine their subject at a particular point in time. What would be the range and depth of these currents and histories? How would they orient the artist? What would be the range and depth of this vision? Participants in the workshop responded by asking whether their work addressed contemporary art, art from a particular era, or art from a specific location. Theirs was a cycle that involved asking, who am I trying to appeal to? To what extent was the artist trying to engage with the present through</text>

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the particular art form she or he is creating, and to be able to interpret that art form in a way that is both accessible and transformational. This is why an artist whose work is already deceptively simple and accessible must devise ways to simultaneously make that art form complex and powerful, while simultaneously constraining that art to be understood in ways that are both globally visible and specifically designed to please a global audience.When I first started out as an artist, I often did both, while simultaneously trying to figure out how to create works that would be both visually powerful and also made universally visible. And although I eventually came up with a formula that made it easy for an artist to arrive at a work of art that was both visually powerful and also a global phenomenon, there was always that element of chance and randomness involved: the genius for the superficial thing was often in fact a reflection of the artist’s genius for the more subtle.

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the art form. The art has to be accessible in order for that to happen.An artist cannot create a new art form by itself, nor should she or he expect to. That is why it is vital for artists to have a repertoire of artistic styles that they can access and use across a range of contexts. If an artist does not have that repertoire, or does not understand how contexts work, she or he cannot make art that is accessible to a broad range of people. Therefore an artist has to be flexible and adaptable, and that is why an artist has to be able to respond to different forms of art, including new media. An artist cannot create a new art form by herself, nor should she or he expect that to happen either. That is why artists must have talented and accessible collaborators. They cannot create a new art form on their own.But what is an artist to do? Should an artist be obliged to engage in something that is not already a core part of her or his</text>

And this is why an artist must design her or his art to be accessible to those who may be interested in learning more about the art form. For an artist to produce a new artistic form, she or he has to be able to read art books, watch art programs, and get art-related media coverage. And this is where the accessibility problem emerges: the more media coverage an art form gets, the harder it is to change the media coverage of art to refer to the art in that art form, as well as to the art form itself. So the more an artist creates a new media format in which to discuss her or his art, the harder that artist has to work to expand the art form in order to really engage the public. This is why artists who create new visual forms, such as graffiti or murals, have to continually redefine what the art form is in order to remain accessible. It may be that the art form they are creating is too abstract or conceptual for the media format they are using to convey its essence; or there may be an underlying technological or social dimension to the art form that makes</text>

If the city is to retain its artistic character and artistic sensibility, it is imperative that the artworld be accessible to and aware of the city’s diverse cultures. And yet, here we are, almost twenty years after the first Venice Biennale, and almost twenty years since the last time a completely new art-historical form was staged in Venice, and we find ourselves struggling to find new ways of structuring our collective imagination, feeling and understanding of the city. Why is the Biennale in crisis? Why are some works more accessible than others? Why are some galleries more engaging than others? Why are some biennales more ethnically diverse than others? Why do some cities have more biennales than others? Why do some biennales have exceptionally long histories? Why do some cities have</text>

But as the cultural norms that comprise the new economy are put into practice, the cultural production generated by the old will be displaced by new creative alternatives and new forms of organisation will emerge.   Art is a complex, long-term investment, and the emergence of new creative alternatives is often attributed to a shift in the ways in which people consume art.1  The shift in consumption patterns is largely credited to the advent of mass media, which enabled artists to expand their audiences and connect with audiences outside of the artist’s core audience.2  But AI could also play a part in the shift towards more aesthetic forms of cultural consumption. The rise of social media and connected devices has fundamentally changed the ways in which we consume art, and it is easy to imagine a future in which the artist’s workflows would be normalized and artists could freely pursue audiences outside of the art institution.  The challenge for curators is to find creative ways to engage with AI, its potential and responsibilities in a way that is sensitive to the context and the place where it arises.4  A generation of artists</text>

But as the cultural norms that comprise the new economy are put into practice, the cultural production generated by the old will be needed more than ever. The new economy demands that artists have assets that are traceable and can be used for making new art, and will require that the cultural values that animate the new economy be shared.Art is a complex commodity that requires its buyers to be savvy and open to new ideas and experiences. But understanding how to use art responsibly and ethically is an even more critical step for any cultural form to take. The future of art is in doubt because of massive data collection and mining operations that are threatening not only artists’ jobs, but also cultural heritage and the environment. But understanding how art is made and the processes that put art together is even more critical. This will not just mean understanding how to make art more accessible to a consumer market, but will also mean understanding how to support artists’ artistic projects across industries and across cultures.Art is a cultural production. Understanding and producing culturally responsive art is critically important for any artistic practice to exist. But understanding how art is</text>

Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s Sergey Brin’s Alphabet, 1999–2001 is a classic case in point. Google’s Sergey Brin’s original ideas for the search engine and the connected device were far from unique, but the connection between the human and algorithmic search engines that emerged in the late 1990s is still considered a technological curiosity. The roots of the fascination with cultural algorithms reach back to the work of Claude Goass, who first developed the idea in 1941. Claude’s ideas about the relationship between language and computation are rooted in his understanding of algebra, and go beyond the formal level to point to the underlying principles that underlie algorithmic creativity and the production of ever more encompassing data sets. Going beyond the formal level, Goass’s ideas about algebra start to make some conceptual sense when applied to music and culture. But beyond that, Goass�</text>

But as the cultural norms that comprise the new economy are put into practice, the cultural production generated by the old economy will be displaced in a process of its own momentum. The question is what form this culture production takes, and how it is generated. The current mode of production for art institutions is changing in response to the demands of a predominantly digitally multi-tasked, multi-capricious society. The demand for art institutions to be accessible and transnational is a constant, and a consequence of the globalisation that is reshaping the global marketplace. But there is also a ‘different kind of cultural production’ that is qualitatively different from what is currently being done in the arts, and which is distinct from what was done previously. This kind of cultural production is being done on a local (city-state or nation-state) scale, but it is being done in a qualitatively different way. It is being done in parallel to the expectation that there will always be a marketplace for art, and that it will be available to all – not just the privileged few. This situation is creating</text>

But the question remains whether the new AI will be able to find meaningful relationships with other cultural phenomena, and beyond that, what constitutes a meaningful relationship?  The answer to this is a definitive in  	Art &amp; Architecture: it depends on whom you ask. The question is: what constitutes a meaningful relationship? The answer, of course, depends on the context and person you ask it to. But the idea of ‘meaningful relationships’ is a difficult question to define precisely, and one that is difficult to define in a definitive, quantifiable way.</text>

But as the cultural norms that comprise the new economy are put into practice, the cultural production generated by the old will be displaced in favour of the production of surplus, and new forms of administrative capture will be introduced. The relationship between AI and large-scale data mining will become conscious and will have a significant impact on how we understand and engage with the technologies that are the products of new economy.Art is a stage on a trajectory towards culture; it will no longer be content with remaining passive and wilfully unaware. In the new economy of AI, culture will be produced through systems that understand cultural norms and the cultural logic of their production. But in its current form, art is expected to excel in its engagement with these new forms of social production. It is imperative that the cultural production generated by AI takes root in cultural institutions and that it is not suppressed or erased in the process of technological advancement. The cultural projects formed through the new economy of AI must be creative and autonomous.   The challenge for the next stage of cultural integration is to imagine new kinds of interactions between humans and natural systems. But even</text>

The idea is to create a shared vocabulary that artists and curators can access to understand the systems that monitor, collect and analyse art. The challenge is to deliver this to audiences where it is meaningful and relatable, and to ensure that the art’s normative value is realised through a system that is accessible and plays by the artists and audiences who use it.  The collaboration between art institutions and large technology companies is routine and expected. But the potential of AI to understand cultural phenomena is exciting and could fundamentally alter how art is produced, distributed and consumed. The partnership between Google and Microsoft in the 1990s represents the early stages of this potential, and much like in the biennial, there is an expectation that the cultural norms of the new economy will prevail. But as the cultural norms that comprise the new economy are put into practice, the cultural production generated by the old economy will be replaced by something more exploitative and consumer-oriented. It is these shifts in norms and values that are produced through negotiation and negotiation with large corporations and governments, not through the imposition of new technologies.

But as the cultural norms that comprise the new economy are put into practice, the cultural production generated by the old economy will be needed more than ever. The need to understand how art will be produced around the norms and ideologies governing the new economy will become ever more urgent. This is why, if curatorial intentions are to make their institutions relevant again, they must also be possible back again.Art is a complex commodity. It is not easy to quantify the value of a painting in a way that can be quantified and used by a stockbroker or a multinational corporation, and art today is no exception. But there are ways of making the art measurable that reduce the risk of its abuse. One example is the use of in-gallery photography, which allows an artist to publish a photograph of a piece of artwork on a website that is indexed by Google and shared by other websites. This allows the value of the photograph to be determined by the likelihood that the photograph is found in a Google index.  Another example is the use of deep learning, which is the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with image processing</text>

Art’s role in the new economy will be enhanced, and its production system reconfigured to meet the demands of the new economy.   Another potential new industry for art to tap into is the newly minted sector of social media. Social media has enabled us to connect across cultural boundaries, and a cultural capital that can be built on shared experiences. But what does it mean to share cultural experiences? Does sharing mean exchanging? It could mean that the art produced through the sharing of cultural norms translates into practices that are similar to those of the other side; that is, it could mean that the norms apply to everyone regardless of their cultural backgrounds.   A third potential industry for art is the burgeoning field of real estate. Real estate is a concept that has been around for a while and is widely used. But what is the difference between homemaking and making a home? How long has the title been? How often does the</text>

It is not clear that the new AI will be able to differentiate between artist’s work and that of its creators, nor is it clear that it will be able to differentiate between curatorial and artistic work. But the AI that produces biennials will likely understand some of the cultural norms and values that we do. And given its focus on art as a productive skill-set, the AI will likely produce potentially transformative outcomes.Art is a multi-layered substance that requires a great deal of theory and conceptual work to parse through. But given the right set of data, AI can do amazing things with it.  The AI that produces art biennials could well be inspired by or even mirroring contemporary art practices. But given the right data, it can also produce enduringly interesting and valuable work that serves as a baseline for exploring deeper trends or</text>

In 2015, the Arab Spring erupted in Egypt, demanding political reforms and catalyzing a political awakening among a global population frustrated by decades of economic oppression. Inspired by the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, and the Arab revolutions elsewhere in the Middle East,3 the biennale’s proposed approach3 was to create a platform from which up to 5,000 artists could converge across 5,000 venues in a city for several months in preparation for a future uprisings.4 	A timeline of the biennale’s origins reveals the year it was conceived, but little about who funded it or what it represented.

In most cities, art is produced via curatorial departments and artists’ studios, which are staffed mainly by art professionals. These spaces, which often have a cultural function, serve as informal meeting spaces for the artists and their creative teams to work, exchange, exchange and exchange again.4 	In the case of North America and Europe, these creative-team spaces also play host to large-scale exhibitions and other curatorial activities. In the case of Asia, however, they are predominantly occupied by the major exhibitionary organisations in the region – Sydney, Beijing, and so on. These include, but are by no means limited to, the following:  1. Taipei Biennale</text>

The twenty-one projects identified in this report are divided into three broad categories: public spaces (streets, parks, squares, alleyways, street corners, roadside stands, public plazas, playgrounds, museums and street level publics), architecture (vertical or horizontal), and media (film and television, radio and print). Media is understood as a public of artists, curators, writers and other public stakeholders, audiences and communities. It encompasses repertoires, platforms, practices, technologies, languages, discourses and media. In this sense, it is both a noun and an adjective.

I focus on projects in major Canadian cities, specifically Hamilton, Toronto and Montreal, because they are the major centres for the production and diffusion of culturally responsive art products. Minor projects that address local problems or serve as models for future practices are encouraged to be filed under ‘Innovation City’ and ‘Outstanding Universal Value’ in the museum's Digital Presentations section.3  The twenty projects in this survey are listed chronologically from the most recent issue of the museum’s online journal PC/11 (January 2018), selected from a priority listing that was developed by the curator’s office and the project team.

In this article, I offer a detailed survey of twenty projects funded by the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Arts Council, the Canopus Gallery, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Toronto Art Gallery that addressed art and culture as a human-influenced issue. I focus on the projects because they are the most readily identified among artists, curators, art writers and art’s many publics. Their rapid success and shifting of focus away from analysis and commentary on art as such has created a situation in which new ideas and creative solutions can emerge. 	Though much attention has been given to the importance of public art spaces and infrastructure,2 recent studies have shown that artists do best when spaces and audiences are actively engaged with and participate in.3 	I seek to show that today’s art is produced, and can be distributed across the geographical area of a city, even if it occurs in largely inaccessible or marginal places. I also seek to show that art can be produced in a densely populated urban setting, through a combination of grants, cooperative art funds, and individual</text>

So the artist collective that was operating on the site in 2014 was operating at a loss financially. The question that came up at the time was, could the community pull together and fund a project like this? And the short answer to that was, of course. The Overground had been started by the Columbia Arts Trust, and so the Trustees had put together a small grant to start a curatorial programme on the site. The grant came from the Arts Council, and so the Arts Council was creating a programme of activities around the site – planting plants, cleaning the streets, making mowing lawns, renting rooms, taking out household goods and buying luxury goods (t-shirts, mugs, clothes, chairs, furniture, flash drives, studio equipment). So the question was, could the Arts Council, through the Trustees, fund an artist’s residency in the suburb of Columbia,</text>

So the artist collective that was operating on the site in 2014 was operating at a loss as to what to do with the art produced in that neighbourhood. The overground continued to be a point of convergence for artists and the residents of the neighbourhood, but the biennale as an institution was no longer expected to produce meaningful cultural outcomes for the area. The biennale’s current president, Joasia Krysa, once again, seems to have taken the opportunity to return to the city through her organization, but the overground has returned to be a point of convergence for art and city life in this neighbourhood. The overground has created a kind of collective memory for the neighbourhood, while the biennale produces a kind of diffuse memory for the city.1. Concrete Space, 2013.

There was a time when the group thought it might lease the site to another organisation, but that organisation is now in the midst of redeveloping it into a brand new mixed-use development called The Mandarin. So the question that came up as to what could be done with the site was, in effect, what could be done with the city. Is there something that could be done with the site now that it is part of a cultural district, which is part of a larger redevelopment project? And the answer to that question is a great many things. There are unanswered questions, and there are cultural organisations that need to be supported in their work, and so forth. But there is also a need to be supported in the way that art is supported in the city. And here, the biennale’s current and future funding comes into play. It is true that the Biennale has had to struggle financially in the past, as development on the site has depleted</text>

So the Biennale decided to invest in a community land trust that would allow the community to collectively own and manage land and buildings. The land and building trust would jointly manage the buildings and the land, providing affordable housing, providing employment and empowering the local citizens to direct the building and land development process. The Biennale also decided to invest in a local grassroots organization called the Community Land Trust Network (CLT), a non-profit public policy organization that provided advice and resources to the CLT on issues related to the redevelopment of the site. Through the CLT’s creative collective, arts and community groups worked with the developer to improve the site through small-scale office and residential renovations.

New York City was created as a financial success through the creation of a financial district in Manhattan called the &quot;Overground&quot; – a name that became synonymous with the city’s financial industry. The logic of the overground was that you could put up collateral and hope for the best – in other words, ‘real estate values’ – which in turn could be bought with a high-grade loan. Over the years, as development on the site increased, so did the cost of living in the neighbourhood. So the artist collective that was operating on the site in 2014 was operating at a loss financially. She was struggling to find funding to carry on the project, which was seen by many curators as antiquated and not relevant in an era of massive financial support from the arts administrators. In an effort to stay relevant, her self-presentation as an artist doing socially engaged work on the site was undercut by the new curatorial approach, which was more interested in the accumulation of art collections. It came as a surprise to many curators when the biennale announced its intention to return for a 15th biennale in 2026. This is despite the fact that the biennale has made no secret of its desire to resume operating on the site in perpetuity. Its mission statement continues to read: ‘We, the undersigned, artists, writers and others concerned with the urban condition…recognise that the essential mission of the arts is to produce a culture of communication across class, race and gender lines.’[17] In other words,</text>

New York City was created as a financial success through the creation of a financial district in Manhattan called the &quot;Overground&quot; – a name that became synonymous with the city’s financial industry. The logic of the overground was that you could put up collateral and hope for the best – in other words, ‘real estate values’ – which in turn could be bought with a high-grade loan. Over the years, as development on the site increased, so did the cost of living in the neighbourhood. So the artist collective that was operating on the site in 2014 was operating at a loss financially. In the case of the Chelsea Arts Centre, the entire operating budget for that biennale was coming from external sources – sponsorships, tax-deductible donations, and performances by art institutions. Being artists, these artists felt that they were producing works that would be seen as authentic to the area, but also made choices about what to leave behind when the site was redeveloped. In the case of the Biennale of Sydney, the organisers chose to make a large-scale, world-renowned, ‘once in a generation’ sculpture of themselves as a response to the decline of the art world in the city. This sculpture would be a globally recognisable version of the artist’s heads held up as a representative image. The choice to make this sculpture as a head or body part may be taken as a response to the decline of image quality in the art world in the US and elsewhere, in which artists were often accused of feeling uncomfortable doing</text>

New York City was created as a financial success through the creation of a financial district in Manhattan called the &quot;Overground&quot; – a name that became synonymous with the city’s financial industry. The logic of the overground was that you could put up collateral and hope for the best – in other words, ‘real estate values’ – which in turn could be bought with a high-grade loan. Over the years, as development on the site increased, so did the cost of living in the neighbourhood. So the artist collective that was operating on the site in 2014 was operating at a loss financially. In the years that followed, the community started a non-profit organisation called the Midtown Community Land Trust, which evolved into the Midtown Project. The Midtown Project was a partnership between the Midtown Community Land Trust, New York City Department of Homeless Services and the New York Public Theater. The artist that was part of the 2014 Biennale was Nasser Rabbati, who was part of a collaborative process that produced works in the site, including works by the artists themselves, as well as landscape architecture and urban designers.  	[1] Midtown Community Land Trust, 2014. http://www.midtownproject.org.uk/research-/landlord/research-questions/housing-market-impacts-in-new-york-city.html.

Over the years, as development on the site increased, so did the cost of living in the neighbourhood. So the artist collective that was operating on the site in 2014 was operating at a loss as to what to do with the artefact that was produced. In the words of Gregory Ulmer, who was curator of the 2014 Melbourne Biennale, the curatorial role was one of a ‘temporary fiction writer’. It was a last-ditch effort by the curatorial council to save the biennale from the blighting of its former glories by the city’s financial machine. If it could not find an alternative, it turned to the courts – which were more or less the last bastion of capitalist property in America – to shut down any opposition to the city’s economic juggernaut.As a result, the biennale became something akin to a tourist attraction, attracting wealthy visitors to a city on the cusp of a revolutionary transformation. The Biennale of Sydney, which was initially conceived as a ‘three-month' ‘evangelical'' event in the city, soon became something akin to a</text>

Over the years, as development on the site increased, so did the cost of living in the neighbourhood. So the artist collective that was operating on the site in 2014 was operating at a loss financially. In 2015, however, the site was repurposed and a community land trust was set up to develop an alternative to the Overground into an urban farm. The plan for the site is to create a number of small community-run managed farms with a focus on producing high-value, local ingredients for local consumption – something that is easy to grow and maintain, and something that is different from a large corporate agriculture system. The farms will be set in stages, with stages one through three set in motion, with stages four and five finishing up. The intention is that each stage will produce a set of skills and knowledge that will enable people to produce on a smaller scale, providing jobs and growth for the community. ‘Fruit and veg, once you’ve planted them, can be harvested and turn into produce – a recipe for local wealth, sustainability and a higher standard of living for the local community’. Within this framework, the Overground is</text>

So the artist collective that was operating on the site in 2014 was operating at a loss as to what to do with the art that was being produced on site. This inability to produce new art on site – which was part of the original concept – was also seen by some as a problem. The overground was a huge success, but the biennale has to be realistic in its ambitions. It can lead to art being produced in an idealised form, but it can also produce art that is actively destructive of life in the city. That is, unfortunately, the situation today. The overground has been cancelled, replaced with a new urban development that is all about profit-maximisation and the spectacle of buildings and buildings only ever visible from a financial centre. The problem with the overground is that it was about infrastructure and not architecture – in other words, the infrastructure that supports the biennale was built with prefabricated housing and served by a public sector that is deeply politicised. The overground was also about landscapes and not monolithic views</text>

The short answer is that we don’t know what to do with them. After all, humans are the ones with souls, after all, and the technology that creates them is human-made, autonomous technology designed to serve humans in their ‘presence’. The question becomes whether or not the technology is also designed to augment and augment our own lives, to augment and augment our consciousnesses. This is the question of John H. Gilmore, Jr., who authored the now infamous 1984 Manifesto   ‘Signingpost to Human History’:  	So long as resources remain scarce and the pursuit of happiness is the sole aim of human institutions, culture will remain a mystery. But if the future is any guide, it will become increasingly apparent that the pursuit of happiness is not</text>

There are several possibilities for future mapping that could yield social benefits in the form of increased access to resources, improved public health or both: the power to determine which social good will be created through which technology is deployed, and the social benefits to be derived from that socialisation. In a broader societal sense, the potential social benefits from new kinds of mapping could be vast. There are several key questions that could help us answer this crucial question: which social ends will new social technologies serve? What do we want our social forms to be able to achieve? What kinds of social costs will new social forms impose on existing social forms? What kinds of social tensions will they create? Where does the social find its sites? What kinds of tensions will they exacerbate?How can new social</text>

Some might even consider the possibilities of augmenting human capabilities through the incorporation of super-intelligent or artistic beings, machines endowed with extraordinary or poetic abilities, or even beyond-human intelligence. One could even imagine the ‘potential benefits of AI’, seeing what that might mean in the context of globalised capitalist economies.One could also consider possibilities for ‘machine learning’ in the context of culture, specifically, considering what sorts of capacities might be created through the merger of human and machine intelligence. Some might even consider possibilities of augmenting the human capacity for poetry through the possible integration of artificial intelligence into the cultural process. Such a merging of human and machine intelligence seems particularly plausible given the increased complexity of the contemporary world, but there are also emerging human-machine symbioses that are as complex as the biosphere itself.

So far, so normal, but what if, with the right social context and implementation, could create extraordinary capacities for self-repairing socialities? If applied to a global or local scale, this technology could offer a powerful new toolkit for the social engineering of the future that neither the humans nor the non-humans will ever know about.This is the technological scenario in which we could conceivably start to imagine such possibilities. It is based on the premise that our present ecological crisis is due to over-emitting finite resources, and that future resources must be carefully planned and managed in advance in order to ensure that the present flows towards the required abundance. It is also based on the assumption that the social, cultural and political conditions necessary for a future social ecology will exist, and will evolve, as a function of time, reflecting the cumulative impacts of industrialisation, and that they will have to change in order to accommodate future needs.

These guidelines establish what kinds of interactions are allowed between humans and the technological artefacts that are incorporated into automated systems. In other words, the question is not how to render human life on a computer unintelligible, but how to foster the kind of collaboration necessary for a robust and ethically complex society to emerge.In the context of AI and social media, the primary challenges for the future user are: how to link his/herself to the information gathered via a surveillance system, and how to negotiate a more complex set of social and cultural circumstances. The tools for a social engineer, however, are available in almost any programming language, making it easier to create a surveillance system that collects and distributes data than it is to understand the intentions behind a human-rights campaign. In either case, the shared and interconnected context of AI makes it harder to imagine a future where intentions are not actively surveilled.In the wake of these</text>

These advances would make possible not only the expansion of healthcare, but also the mechanisation of everything from farming to manufacturing, from farming to shipping, from logistics to retail, from publishing to marketing, from agriculture to logistics, from media to agriculture, and so forth.Such sweeping generalisations are often made with the naïve support of a utopian vision of a blissful world populated by benevolent super-intelligent beings, operating in a qualitatively similar way to how the technology is designed to be used.

One could also speculate about the modes of social life generated by large data collections and analyse the ways in which the human species is divested of its inherent self-reliance. One could even speculate about the implications of these technologies for contemporary art and aesthetic practice. But the fundamental role of the infrastructure of infrastructure is likely to remain homogenised, detached and malleable. Assemblages of individuals, neighbourhoods, cities, nations, even regions – all of which together constitute the global metropolis – are likely to be assembled into nation-states, big business empires, or mere pockets of semi-feudal poverty.

The primary reason to believe that a society will act in this way is if and when it has a clear and present understanding of the capacities and hierarchies enabling the situations, and the corresponding behaviours. There are other technologies, such as those related to social networks or mapping, that render humans indistinguishable from abstract data, but which nevertheless have important effects on how we live our lives. And finally, there are the less identifiable but perhaps more pervasive but nevertheless valuable technologies – those that enable communication or data collection but also allow for the creation of new forms of expression and cultural practices – that are likely to emerge in the context of a future dominated by data. These last few words sum up the state of knowledge on this question in my opinion. We do not</text>

This is the paradox of artistic and curatorial revolutions: their roots are in the same cultural landscape but the activity in which they are performed is deeply unconscious. The reportage on the changes in the figure of the artist as a result of these conferences is no different from the way in which we learn about art and its production, or how the media reports on tragedies such as the Hillsborough Football Ground disaster. However, the reportage of the concomitant and overlapping phenomena of mass media, scientific and engineering revolutions is in many cases more pervasive, more pervasive and more pervasive in its affects. Its manifestations are often more visibly articulated and discussed in the art world than in the arts world, and in some contexts than in others.

This all ties in to the notion that the art world and the biennial are in some ways the same.  Artworlds that emerged from the conference, and which I participated in in as an artist, were a mix of academics, curators, artists and others with a wide range of expertise and experience. Some were more directly involved in the art or art-related activities; others provided support or guidance to curatorial activities. All participated in the creation of an environment in which art could be explored, experienced and judged in ways that are authentic to the place and time – whether this was through providing tools or advice or creating an authentic arts organisation. All of us felt that we were part of a team, and that we were contributing something to the conversation and debate around art and contemporary art. The conversations we had and continue to have, and the places we’ve gone, are necessarily public and fluid. We can be present in public or</text>

And although this is perhaps the most generalised claim of the conference, the specific applications of the ideas that emerged at Venice last year are deeply embedded in our present cultural landscape. They were not invented or imagined by artists, nor do they represent some grand synthesis of all contemporary art’s practices. Rather, they reflect the cumulative effects of a changing cultural landscape, the progress of science, technology and institutional knowledge. And although it is true that this information is generated and disseminated constantly – every day, naturally – it is also true that its actual shape-shifting is largely unconscious. We don’t know what art is made up of, where the art is made up of ends, and with whom. Indeed, the more we learn about art and its production, we also learn about the activities of the art world, and the functions of the art world in the contemporary condition, the more we mistrust our own knowledge of what art is made up of, and about the causes of its activities.‘Art is made up of activities that are invisible’, said Marcelle Richard on a conference panel about the exhibition she was curator of, Black-E, in Venice, in a speech that was partly about the fact that she was a curator and partly about the fact that her talks about art were often read as if they were ephemeral and ephemeral-looking affairs, in contrast to the more usual order and timeliness of things. And although she did say that she thought that the things that we call art are made up of many different activities, from the very first things we create to the very last things we discard, there is a tendency to associate the things that happen in art with an identifiable act of artistic accomplishment. In this sense, she was saying, the very act of making something is art, just as</text>

Indeed, the more we learn about art and its production, we also learn about the activities of the art world, and the functions of the intermediary – a concept that has come to characterize the contemporary art market – the more we distrust our own representations of things. We need more precise and controllable measurement tools to map the nuanced infrastructures and cultural flows that are part of contemporary art’s current production.I don’t mean to suggest that the infrastructural model is a perfect representation of contemporary art’s consumption and consumption culture. And I don’t mean to suggest that the infrastructural model is necessarily a better representation of contemporary art’s future consumption. But the fundamental infrastructural of the contemporary art market is the same as the infrastructural of any other market: it is subject to the same forces of deindustrialisation and global commodity fetishisation that are fuelling the contemporary art market. And just as the contemporary art market depends on the former, the contemporary curatorial and art museum should likewise be subject to the latter. How to Choose Between Markets</text>

Indeed, the more we learn about art and its production, we also learn about the activities of the art world, and the functions of the art world in shaping and interpreting our understanding of art. The more we know, the less we know – which is to say, the less art we make, the less we can share, bond and exchange with one another. This is the paradox of information-intensive growth. The more information we have, the less we know. And although the human capacity for cultural exchange is prodigious – equal parts information gatherer, information hoarder and cultural critic – this capacity is tempered by the recognisable limits of cultural intelligence. For this capacity to grow, the human cultural complex requires an inexhaustible supply of cultural lubricant (in the form of cultural products, performative aids and cultural resources), which is to say, a far greater quantity of cultural products than we can currently consume. Art, and the cultural products that flow from it, enter our everyday cultural landscape via a series of conveyors that are both physically and ethically unsustainable. Yet this capacity to consume is itself subject to change.</text>

As the saying goes: a story told at a picnic. In this sense, the concerns of the cultural landscape do not necessarily map onto those of the real world. This is an oversimplification, and there are many ways of reading the data, analysing it, and making sense of it. But the underlying ideas are real. And although the precise mechanisms by which cultural practices emerge and devolve are still poorly understood, there are signs that our evolving biennials are awash in cultural terms.

So the more we grow intellectually aware of our cultural dependence, the less able we are to imagine a different kind of art world. And this is precisely what the biennial has in common with the contemporary art world. It creates its own image of the world, but it does so in relation to a particular set of people – artists, curators, collectors, journalists. All of whom are constantly informed about art and the world in relation to which it exists – but which people aren’t necessarily aware that they have. If the biennial were to cease to exist, it would almost certainly cease to be. It would begin to exist in some form in museums and archives, but it would also begin to exist in social media. So the relationship between the biennial and the contemporary art world would become something very different. It would cease to be a mutual dependency,</text>

And this is perhaps one of the conveniences of being part of the contemporary artworld: we constantly move from the object of our aestheticising gaze to the object of our understanding and justification. We don’t really know what art is made up of, where the art comes from, or with whom. We only know how we feel about it when we have something to say. This is why contemporary art production constantly seeks to infuse contemporary art with aspects of the past, and why contemporary art has such a habit of doing precisely that. It’s as if the very notion of art for contemporary art purposes is being constituted through the act of making art. But again, this is an exaggeration. The real reason why contemporary art is often maligned and misunderstood is precisely because it is constantly made and disseminated on a massive scale and at such an enormous scale.

In other words, the more we learn, the less we understand. In fact, a conference about ‘culture’ should be able to produce its own understanding of the contemporary art world. If the definition of ‘culture’ is the internal division between artist and audience, the contemporary art world and the curatorial, then the contemporary art world is the internal division between curatorial and art world. The contemporary art world and the curatorial world are not made up of artists and curators; rather, they are made up of administrators, administrators, journalists, art collectors, collectors and so forth. All of these groups operate on a daily basis in relation to one another, and their interactions. But although the core values and intentions of the conference may sometimes converge, they do not necessarily share a common history, place or audience. This is why biennials can be so</text>

Indeed, the more we learn about art and its production, we also learn about the activities of the art world, and the functions of the arts in that realm – from the production of visual art to the exhibition and promotion of biennials and major exhibitions – the more art that we make is conditioned to fit the social world around us. (And we might add that this is true of contemporary art as well, since we live among art lovers and art shall rule all.) So while it is true that the biennial has a particular role to play in shaping and complementing the city, it is also true that its real power comes from within. It is the rare biennial that actively seeks to create a social or political context or to alter what art means or ought to mean in order to suit its patron. Rather, the biennial is a creating of what it can – and should – do in and for its own sake. It is a form that is compelled to publish what it cannot, and this is what the Venice Biennale is doing today. It is a failure in many ways, but one that is trying. </text>

    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is the first in a planned series that will see artists and designers working together across disciplines to explore the history and the practice of biennials in the UK and abroad. The initial festival will see artists from across the region and the world, from the oldest and most traditional biennials of the region to the most recent contemporary biennials. The aim of the exhibition will be to create a shared space where the diverse aspects of regional and global art can be explored and developed through the exchange of artists, designers and artists. It will also enable the development of a shared vocabulary through which artists, curators and art’ creators can communicate constructively and imaginatively about their current and past environments. The project was conceived and jointly managed by Biennale Liverpool, Exhibition Research Lab (ERL), Tate Liverpool, Art and Exhibition Research Lab (AIR) and the Liverpool Biennial. The project was presented as part of the ERL’s 3rd London Biennial 2016 schedule

The project was supported by the Historic Environment Agency (HEA) and the Arts Council (AEC).Art is often seen as a static concept in discussions of the environmental impact of art, but it is much more complex, and less accessible to consumers, and particularly difficult to value in a market place, than many may realise. Many artists and curators struggle to identify, value or capture the nuance and contextual complexity of art in a cultural context. This is particularly true for projects that are based in cities, such as those related to the Biennale, but also for those that are form-related but localized. These must address a specific set of stakeholders in order to be successful, and it is often</text>

It is a multi-disciplinary, multi-edition, multi-edition-type annual exhibition series based in the US that has exhibited in over a hundred countries and has been curated by Judith Herman and commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts. The first iteration of the Biennale was held in New York in January 1965, and in London in June 1967. The 1967 and 1971 editions were staged in different cities in each of the three zones encompassed by the ERL: New York, London and Berlin. The Biennale was renamed the Chisenhale Gallery (in honor of Colin Ward) and relocated to San Francisco.

The Liverpool Biennial is the only biennial to have taken place in and around Los Angeles. Its mission is to celebrate the local and the global aspects of art and culture through a series of art exhibits and activities in and around the city. The Biennial has its headquarters in the old city of Los Angeles, which was formerly the home of Universal Studios and the Burton Homes, the precursor to Universal Studios Archives. It opened for Universal Studios in Venice in 1966 and Universal Studios in Burbank in 1979. It has its permanent home in the Burbank Art and Textile District.

Each stage is then a standalone exhibition, with new ideas introduced at each stage. The aim of the exhibition is to change the form of the ‘biennial’ in perpetuity. As a convention, the biennial has an ongoing, sometimes fractious form that seeks to articulate a spatial trend or an idea across themes and forms of the city in perpetuity. In this sense, it embodies a periodicity that has real effects on people’s everyday lives, and thus is a kind of an ‘episodic’ that has real-life effects as well.  	[2] The Biennial format is the culmination of a long and variable history of collaboration between art institutions, civic groups, businesses and other interested parties.

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. In the end, what is needed is genuine collaboration and exchange between artist and public, mutual aid in the service of shared knowledge. The workshop participants suggested that while the exchange between public and artist is a reality of the contemporary art market in many respects, it is severely constrained and filtered through the political and economic systems that we have built. While the exchange between artists and audiences today is complex and dynamic, it is also extremely utilitarian. The context, the audience, the place, and the people who use the place and the resources that are available to the artist and his organisation must coexist in order to be effective. This coexistence cannot come about through the imposition of a particular vision or ideal on others, nor through the commodification of cultural resources through the production of a specific brand of art. The coexistence that is desirable today is dependent on a greater understanding and exchange of different forms of cultural knowledge.  One can only imagine the possibilities for the future if these ideas are widely shared and understood</text>

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. Moreover, since the emergence of new media, there has been an explosion of self-appointed curators, artists, artists' studios and curatorial styles who have little or no artistic training or professional experience.  So while the workshop achieved massive media exposure and resonance, it also lent itself to the creation of a fake sense of friendship and affinity with artists and the new media they access.  The adoption of code words and imagery that echo the institutional modes of artistic production but can be traced to the projects that were collectively titled The Communal Village also played a role. Contemporaneous media coverage and online activity generated by the communally accessible projects quickly fed into the myth of a common humanity that was further fuelled with the image of a village in chaos. For many years, the myth of the village in crisis was a dominant narrative. The workshop delivered a powerful counterweight to this crucial effect. Responding to the media narrative of the communally accessible projects, many of which were framed within the</text>

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. While the emergence of social media and graphic media has greatly expanded the range of discourse and expression possible within a person’s social media feed, it is important that the basic principles underlying social media and graphic media be taken into consideration when engaging with art. In this workshop, participants would have the opportunity to develop and expand upon ideas from:  	Sculpture and Graphic Art (2009-2014) and Beyond Images: Art as Social Media (2013-14) and Assemblage: Art, Media and the Politics of Digital Cultures (2015). They would also learn from the experience and questions raised by the Sculpture Program at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and from the workshop at the FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) campus in London.

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. In the past, artists, curators and art supporters in Hong Kong were often wary of the new media that was being produced in the city, and felt that such media were often used for the bidding of powerful commercial interests. To some, this may even have seemed absurd; after all, what is now considered art may not even be art any more than what was once considered traditional forms of art.  So while Creative Time’s promise may be nostalgia-inducing, there is also some truth to the notion that by engaging with art through artful means, we may actually make it more interesting and eminently digestible. The workshop at Man So First Church was an opportunity to explore this idea from multiple perspectives, and in so doing, to unpack some of the assumptions and prejudices that have been brewing for some time now.  The workshop was moderated by Grant Achat, Curator of Entomology, and it was generously hosted by The National</text>

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. For many years, curators and artists were limited to mutually beneficial relationships with institutions. Cultural production through art institutions was understood as a production for the common good, and the exchange between them was understood as a mutual dependency. However, in the last decade or so, a ‘curious contemporary’ culture of sharing, of sharing in spaces and of sharing culture has become the norm rather than the exception. So while the art institution may or may not be part of the common good, it is often the occasion of exclusive reliance on shared resources. This is particularly evident in the realm of architecture, where access to affordable housing and social services is tightly linked to access to art institutions. In recent years, this sharing between institutions has become increasingly difficult to access for working-class and poorer people, who are burdened by huge student debts and have their funds forced upon them by the state via taxation and subsidies. The result is that social and economic mobility has been severely constrained. A person with a</text>

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. In fact, a recent study of Swedish social interaction on the web site of the Minnesota Multicultural Museum revealed that many of the participants in the museum’s online audience were drawn from out of state, which is a depressing development considering that the museum is located in downtown Minneapolis. 	So while the museum is doing well by using social media to bring people together over the past, present and future of Hong Kong, it is also performing a kind of proxy war for control over the city’s artworld by simultaneously alienating and infusing a specific artworld with a specific set of curators. While the art world’s reaction to such a challenge is likely to be as hostile as the real thing, the museum’s role may have some playing along the lines of the artist and some playing along the lines of the state. 	The relationship between art and architecture has been a production for conflict. While the state has a clear interest in controlling the landscape and st</text>

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. The new media make it easier to discover art, but harder to connect with art. While new media can certainly be used to inform, disrupt or otherwise affect a situation in a way that traditional forms of media cannot, this does not make such changes desirable or even possible. New media have their place, but only as props, used or discarded as is often the case. The time and effort involved in producing an effectually equivalent effect using different media is time and labour intensive, and with the inevitable loss of control over one's creative outcomes. The main difference between digital and analog media is that the former are permanently embedded in the historical record, whereas the latter are continually mutating and evolving. 	One participant described how the advent of the internet made it easier to access postcards and other cultural artefacts online, but also made it easier to engage with the art form through which such online cultural materialises.

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. A closer look at the mechanisms of cultural self-organisation can unambiguously be shown to produce a significant impact on the rate of change that one should pay attention to.  The workshop then moved onto the topic of relationships. While it is true that artists today face unprecedented pressures to be seen to be in love with their work, this is not necessarily a common experience for all artists; nor is it necessarily the case that all relationships will end well. In fact, many participants in the workshop felt that a strong emphasis should be placed on maintaining genuine connections with their audience, and the larger community of artists and curators that they work with. This may include artists who curate for galleries and museums, but also curators of other art-use venues such as youth and art support organisations. They should be aware that in a capitalist market there is a greater chance of a client landing on your best-selling song than on the fiftieth time you have appeared in a gallery exhibition. So</text>

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. The new media also has the potential to corrupt and dehumanise, as with the use of anonymous social media, capitalising on social tensions and creating a sense of belonging not so much to the people who use it, but to those who passively consume what is created. This is especially true in the context of urbanisation projects, which are often promoted as ways to boost the city’s image and sense of self. While this may help to create a sense of belonging, it is often accompanied by projects that actively seek to destroy it.  At the workshop, participants sought to find common ground between themselves on these issues. Some had already begun to explore alternative forms of art production, exploring the possibilities of digital fabrication and installation.  One after another, artist requests were presented, each with their own take on the same dilemmas. While each project offered a different solution to the same dilemmas, all of them addressed the same underlying issues. This allowed the collective to gain a sense</text>

While it is true that new media has greatly influenced and democratised access to art, this does not lend itself to engendering true friendship or genuine affinity. Government policies, market forces and sheer institutional inertia still exert a great deal of control over what can and cannot be said in public, and in many cases, still shapes what can and cannot be said in public. A cultural imperative has always been an essential component of any genuine cultural revolution. It is this fundamental misunderstanding of how the public engages with art that needs to be addressed if we are to experience a meaningful response to the art-house problem. In this way, the workshop's title, ‘An Image of Understanding’, captures the systemic nature of the problem. It is not just an art-house problem, but one that affects all of the artist’s studios, not just those located in the city. The workshop is a deeply embedded part of the larger exhibitionary complex in which many of the curators are embedded. It is a phenomenon that needs to be observed and actively participated in, lest it obscure the real issues at stake and obscure the positive aspects of the city</text>

Since the late nineteenth century, cultural theorists have been grappling with the phenomenon of ‘contemporaneous cultural interchange’ – a phenomenon that they hypothesize constantly re-produces and reifies the former. In The Cultural Trap (1962), Benjamin Bratton Morris, a scholar of postcolonial and settler relations, traces this process of cultural self-sufficiency in the contemporary urban environment to the late nineteenth-century growth of the national socialist infrastructure: infrastructure, he claims, is the final frontier of modernity.</text>

However, its purpose was for a single, tightly controlled section to last for a millennium – much longer than the city had originally been planned. At present, the section – which runs parallel to each other and is approximately the length of a city block – houses a museum and a handful of office and retail spaces. At one point in the twentieth century, the plans envisaged a city of more than a million inhabitants, of which this particular sector is a major metropolis. Today, it contains only a few hundred residents. The MFA’s ongoing exploration of twentieth-century cityscapes led it to a series of projects in the area, including the construction of a new city wall around the old one. This came as no surprise to researchers already interested in the medieval heritage of the city, as well as to those who came to see the early works – a few hundred in particular.

At one point in the twentieth century, the plans envisaged a city of more than a million inhabitants, of which this particular sector is a core. Today, the core city is an urban oligarchy dominated by the megacity, but the museum and office are increasingly rare and expensive to renovate, and the museum is increasingly fragmented and empty. The rapid population explosion in the core city has split the museum into two parts, leaving only a half-empty third section representing the lucky few tourists who make the journey to the mega malls and shopping districts of the metropolis. The rapid population explosion in the periphery has also fragmented the museum – with many branches now housing only transient or semi-permanent residents. The main reason for the rapid expansion of the core city during the twentieth century was the hope that the metropolis would one day be a vacation spot for tourists, who would flock to the region in search of cheap vacations and indulge in the region’s many excesses. Today, most visitors to the region are urban tourists desperate to get away from it all. The nineteenth-century global gala was the first such occasion,</text>

Yet, despite the obvious and persistent difference in quality and quantity, the two were strikingly similar in terms of the overall goal, which is to some extent a response to the museum. The overriding aim of the one could not be wider in scope or more easily accessed, and in fact, was often contradicting the purposes of the other. A further complication is that, while the one was often ideologically motivated, the other was often also. In the twenty-first century, that can mean many things. The one is predicated on the fact that we are all interconnected, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, which means that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle.

The one is predicated on the fact that we are all interconnected, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, which means that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle. Part of the contemporary urban environment is made up of subways and elevated travel options. So there is a huge amount of information about the world around us that is available via the one and the other is made up of many small pieces. The question is: can the two be combined in a meaningful way? And the answer is usually yes. But there is a tension there that needs to be worked through, and it is a tension that needs to be worked through in an honest and open way.  	So, there was a very real tension there, and it is interesting that, even though it was a very real tension, the relationship between the museum and the city was often seen as being between a fortress and a no man's land. There was a tension between the artist and the museum that was seen as dominant and that treated the city as a dangerous and unstable abstraction. And there was a tension between the museum and the people who came to see</text>

In the twenty-first century, that can mean many things. The one is predicated on the fact that we are all interconnected, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, which means that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle. The other is the fact that, at one time, we had a common ancestry – a common language, common ideas, common places – so that we are all made up of parts from the same possible angle. In another version, we’d all be called ‘Inheritors’. In the end, though, all of us end up with the same common ancestry and, well, parts. So the original, simple and powerful idea that the one has its roots in a particular place and all of its branches on the globe is itself traceable to a particular historical and geographical moment. In a way, then, the one is always on the tip of something, and the other is always far behind.  	But, as the saying goes, hindsight is a curse. And, although I don’t have a problem with that, because, you know, hindsight is always a problem, but, you know, hindsight. The irony is, though, that,</text>

The other is that, as a society, we are all also made up of parts, which means that we are also made up of parts from every conceivable angle. As a consequence, the purposes of the two can be understood as contradicting each other.  As a final element, consider the fact that, while the one is primarily a global process, from its earliest stages the other’s aim is to some extent localise it, bringing things closer together so as to be more present and, by implication, more accessible.  A world map of the world drawn up by artist Benito Quinquela represents both the European and American continents with the Americas at the centre. The Americas appear to be dotted with gold mines, and archaeological work suggests that the first Americans were already exploring those regions.  Such parallels are often ignored, or misrepresented, due to the inaccessibility of the territories concerned, but they can nevertheless be seen to exist</text>

The one is predicated on the fact that we are all interconnected, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, which means that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle. This is significant in that it establishes a common definition of what is possible, and makes us ask, can we imagine being able to imagine such a thing? When we think of the possible it enfolds us, and when we are made part of something larger,  	like a body, a set of parts or a whole, and part of something more complex,  	like a city, a metropolis or a universe, part of a complex whole, and part of something more durable, more adaptable and more invulnerable.  	There is a sense in which the relations between biennials and museums should be historical, and that is that biennials have to be seen as products of museums, and, to some extent, artifacts of museums. But this is by-products, to some extent, of the inefficiency of the former to the latter, and of the latter to the former:  	there is no reason why a biennial, or</text>

In the twenty-first century, that can mean many things. The one is predicated on the fact that we are all interconnected, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, which means that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle. So, part of the one is also predicated on the fact that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle, and part of the other is predicated on the fact that, unlike the museum, we do not know what the other is made up of. In other words, if the one is more universally accessible, which it was to some extent, then part of the one has to be equally universally inaccessible. This last part is perhaps what the Joana Foundation was trying to address when, in 2014, they created the Biennale of Sydney (in fact, the original name of the biennale was changed to the Biennale of Sydney). The problem with the biennale of Sydney was that it was an institutionally specific thing, and the local people who used to run the museum (and used to live in the surrounding neighbourhoods) found themselves alienated by the institutionisation of the biennale as an institution, and by the fact that</text>

The one is predicated on the fact that we are all interconnected, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, which means that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle. As a consequence, the one is often explicitly ideological, while the other is more and less so. Yet the primary purpose of the one is to identify aspects of a specific person or set of people, while the other is more and less focused on that person or people. In other words, the more we know about someone, the more we can identify with that person or people.  The other problem with the one is that, as the biennial grew, the need to be seen as a museum grew too. The increasing number of exhibitions and their numerous contentions about places and people that are not necessarily museums also tended to make the art condition in the city more urgent and the subject matter more accessible. So, the biennial was met with both the increased autonomy and the increased autonomy of the biennial as a curatorial strategy. It became more of a museum, with curatorial turns at many points, and the subject matter more accessible. And, of course, the biennial</text>

In the twenty-first century, that can mean many things. The one is predicated on the fact that we are all interconnected, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, which means that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle. We are not made up of parts in isolation, nor parts only from certain angles. The interconnectedness of our societies is what makes the revolution possible. If we do not feel our societies are made up of equal parts, then there is no revolution. If, however, we feel that many parts are made up of marginalised and embattled peoples, then there is a possibility that we might start to understand the social, political and economic conditions that others live or live in. Similarly, the biennial as an institution might well be a vector that, as the curator Sandy Volzke explains, is  making its presence felt &quot;across sites and social networks&quot;. In other words, it is creating a common set of purposes between different sites and people, which then stand in for the various sites and people.  So, the biennial institution is making visible what it has hitherto withheld in order to avoid or mitigate the impact of criticism, whilst at the same time it</text>

The one is predicated on the fact that we are all interconnected, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, which means that we are all made up of parts from every possible angle. We are all made up of people with biennials in our homes, and the one brings together of all these different stories. Through this, the one creates a common space, common images, and a common language. The other is based on the fact that we are all made up of parts, and that, as a society, we are all made up of parts, so that we can all feel the effect of separation, which is made worse by the fact that we all live in different parts of the same city. In other words, if  	there is a ‘different model' for museums and galleries in the twenty-first century, it must be different for biennials. 	The biennial has certainly undergone a revolution in the twentieth century, and it is obvious that the museum has a part to play in this too.

Yet, almost every post on social media is of offices, corridors and production lines, with little or no reference to the people who actually build those buildings or the processes by which they are constructed.  A reminder of this reality is found in the number of meetings attended by the Liverpool Biennial in 2016, and the number of publications that it has published since its inaugural, in 2015, and 2017, in which the organisation was either absent or ambiguous.  A similar ambiguity surrounds the term ‘biennial’, although the rationale for its current use is somewhat different.  Biennials can be defined as 'regeneration projects that aim to produce lasting cultural impacts through the production of local cultural assets through research and education, in an area or across a period of time', and thus they are often directed at</text>

This is not to say that one or the other is necessarily wrong, but it is to say that the underlying assumption of the co-constitutive relationship of all of these systems is equally valid and must be respected. One final aspect of the exhibition was that, as the main example, it is physically removed from the city in order to a museum. This was seen as a positive thing, as it allowed the exhibition to reside in a different world, to be present in a different context. But in the twenty-first century world, this rarely happens, and so this additional complexity adds to the illusion of exoticism, to the extent that it appears as though the system that is being shown is being shown in a particularly peculiar way. For example, the   World Trade Center was designed to be demolished in a single motion, and so the fact that it took twenty-four hours for this to be done (at a rate of one a day) is</text>

The aim of this project was to map the art objects and sites of art in Qatar, and to this end, physical and virtual traces of each art object were produced in stages. A virtual trail of art objects was produced in stages – the virtual trail  	1  represented the physical objects produced in the museum, and the real trail  	10  represented the ideas and practices behind the art objects. The decision to produce a virtual trail was made in part to allow differing opinions from a research group in Qatar to be expressed simultaneously through a single interpretation. This virtual trail can also be considered as an extension of the virtual trail produced by the physical collection, as different interpretations can be accommodated within its framework.[iii] The exhibition’s title, Transforming the World, and its numerous other statements, suggest a particular kind of radical transformation.

Aspects of the exhibition’s content were also intended to engage with notions of power and social organisation.[iii] The database was constructed using 3D modelling software  and Rapid Build that mimicked the structural qualities of artefacts found in archaeological ruins. It was also based around the idea that the urbanisation of a city is a continuous process that can be traced to the formation of distinct urban cultures. The idea was that the archaeology of the future would be built around the production of cultural capital, the production of ‘memory banks’ – which translate the traces of historical urbanisation into material assets – and the production of urban space through the dynamics of the ‘block chain’.[iv] Assembled by a research team at</text>

The first French translation, published in 1971 under the pen name Le Daumesse (The Two Thrones), saw the Arab revolutions as a conflict between different kinds of humanity, but also a self-generated cultural clash between the modern and the spirit forms of the ancient civilizations. The Arab revolutions were a response to modernity, and to a certain extent modernity’s effect on the region that then followed. Art, and especially modern art, is a very powerful tool. It can be used to resist and address certain kinds of pressure</text>

The official collection comprises 860 pieces, of which 450 are of art works, and is divided into twenty-five categories: performance, art, objects in private collections, objects for organized exhibitions, non-profit art, critical art, personal collections, and collections for archiving. The second category includes works produced by artists at the museum level, and includes works created by the Doha team, though this is not a direct count of the number of artists who created works for the museum. The figure is 500, as a ratio of both production and preservation. The preservation of the historical collection is stressed, while the production of works from the museum level is emphasized. For the purposes of the exhibition, both preservation</text>

A database of art objects was produced in response to the new consumer culture that emerged in the wake of the journal article. With the support of the Doha Center for Art and Archives, a research project was undertaken into the physical and virtual traces of art in Qatar. The aim of this project was to map the art objects and sites of art in Qatar, and to this end, a small team of artists, collectors and architects was sent to Doha to oversee the construction of a new complex for art and architecture that had been proposed by the city. The team was divided into two groups: artists were sent to work in studios or collective works, while architects and landscape architects were sent to design alternative developments for the city. Both the art and architecture departments were sent under the direction of Professor Matthias Kuehnelt-Bornemis, a specialist in architectural and urban forms. The fact that the two art departments were sent separately, and that Kuehnelt-Bornemis was only appointed curator of the art department, may have been an attempt to preserve some of the ambiguity of the department's mission, since the two groups of artists and the urban designers had been sent to different projects. For instance, the mission of the Art Deco Centre was to encourage art and culture to form part of a 'common heritage' – a reference to the physical and virtual traces of</text>

These traces were then produced and distributed through the exhibition catalogue, with an overall virtual ‘state of art’ representing the totality. The virtual traces included works not part of any museum collection or a particular art school’s permanent collection, as well as works created and published outside of Qatar. These were then placed in chronological order across the museum’s collections, in a project that sought to create a 3-D ‘virtual gallery environment’ through which art’s traces could be detected and appreciated.

Knowledge Is Power was an experience in which the user generated content was textured with cultural references and pop culture references to reflect the voices of the people with whom they were associated. The interactive maps and multimedia images were designed as a way to engage with and map cultural identities and practices in the area, while also offering insights into the personalities and cultural histories of the people who created them.

During this time, Heptapods were born.4 	The emergence of large scale data-mining operations is often attributed to the proliferation of computer networks and connected devices; however, there is growing evidence that these are also the tools of critical decision-making and information-gathering. In fact, a growing body of research points to the positive effects of open-source software, protocols and software engineering.5 	In an effort to better understand the mechanisms of action that generate trust and facilitate collaborative action,  	Knowledge Is Power commissioned the construction of a new cultural centre on the outskirts of Montreal. This centre would be a hub for the work of the Montreal Museum of Art, as well as for collaborative research and design activities.

It is important to note that the project was not just about teaching people how to code; rather, it sought to understand how artists could be empowered with the codes that run along the web and how the web can be used to organize and connect with communities in a multitude of new ways.  	Knowledge Is Power was a response to the neo-liberal decline and to a more militant engagement with business as usual, specifically with the necessity of a high degree of political agency for First Nations people and communities. It sought to create a collaborative platform for collaborative learning based on code and grassroots knowledge, grounded in the practices and structures of First Nations peoples and constructed with grassroots labour. The platform was not just an extension of the artist’s studio or exhibition space; it was an autonomous learning platform centred on the needs and interests of the communities who created it and the sites it was brought to.

In addition to reporting on developments in the Indigenous question, they addressed broader themes of Canadian and Indigenous life and culture. The role of the arts and craftsman was emphasised, while knowledgeable Indigenous voices were taken into account.

Although the project had initial research and design proposals, it soon became evident that the web-based design and research approach would be more productive and interesting in the context of a participatory action plan. The collective project then turned to community members and youth groups to assist in creating a map-making tool and research project.1 	Community Arts practitioners formed a critical and collaborative advisory group for the project, which included artists, historians, artists, social workers and others with a broad range of expertise. This group produced a Blueprint for a New Economy of Art, Culture and Health [PDF - 591KB], which was shared with the local Indigenous community groups, grassroots artists, academics and others interested in the project. It offered diverse perspectives and innovative ways of engaging with the current political, economic and social contexts and the underlying social forces shaping them.

Knowledge Is Power was an important and sometimes contentious project for many reasons, but I would rather focus on the reasons why it was controversial. The main reason was that a) it was an art project; b) it was an art project that was also a social project catered towards a curatorial agenda; and d) it was a social project that was deeply rooted in the practices of First Nations peoples and artists. In addition, it was deeply rooted in the curatorial priorities of other curatorial priorities. As a curatorial gesture and a gesture of goodwill towards other curatorial groups, this project was part of the broader social significance of the National Film and Art Museum, and part of a relationship. All of these factors were present in the making of the project, and some of the tensions and conflicts that emerged were resolved through collaboration and compromise, but the fact of the art being made and the social meaning it had as a result of it is what ultimately defined the</text>

In 2013, Heptapods were born. How do we begin to imagine a future in which the collective actions of individuals have a greater impact than the direct actions of nation-states? In an ideal world, we could abolish nation-state borders and give individuals and small groups of people complete sovereignty. However, doing away with borders and internal models of nation-statehood would only make us more vulnerable to the desire to merge with large corporations and the financial sector; it would also guarantee that we would all remain voiceless members of a globalised future economy. To achieve that future, we need to abolish capitalism as an economic system and begin to build social and ecological capacities that are capable of supporting new kinds of economic activity.

The discovery could lead to the development of new treatments and possibly even cures.If developments in AI and big data analytics underpin these new surveillance strategies, they could also create new kinds of parallel universes where existing legal and jurisdictional protections cease to apply. In the event of a major disaster such as a nuclear war, the break-even point for a humanitarian response may be far away, yet the loss of human life and property may be considerable. In the event of an outbreak of infectious disease, the ability of healthcare providers to respond may be limited to staging public health campaigns and vaccinating individuals against the outbreak itself.Public health campaigns are an essential component of any response to a public health emergency. However, in the current political climate, in which massive data mining is routine, the scale of the response may be underestimated or nonexistent. Moreover, in the current economic climate</text>

A collaborative research team led by Microsoft Research is helping to discover an Ebola vaccine through a similar stochastic image processing approach.In addition to diagnosing and fighting infectious diseases, predictive models enable actionable action plans that can then be adapted based on empirical data and expert opinion. This type of adaptive behaviour is similar to that demonstrated by the medical community in its response to the Black Death, when individuals with unique gene profiles were shown images of dying patients and offered to doctors via a website urging them to either treat the images or stop reading them. The patients were encouraged to seek medical attention if they saw images of dying patients. For example, in the image below, a Black Death patient is seen by a doctor after being shown a series of images of infected people, some of whom are then brutally maimed in the image. The Black Death was a bacterial infection that began in 18 Imperial Chinese ports in the late 19th century, and spread to Europe, North Africa and Arabia.

A collaborative research team led by Microsoft Research is helping to map the virus’s spread using innovative technology that detects changes in the DNA of the infected and their surrounding environment.This kind of rapid response – quick action to detect and respond to emerging threats – is characteristic of 21st century technological change, but is becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile with traditional notions of public and private property, property rights and democratic government. A new kind of international law – transnational publics – is emerging that puts responsibility for a threat at a regional and local level. This kind of rapid publics are likely to be influenced by the data that is collected and analysed in relation to them, and to a large extent by the media that is presented with them. As a result, media reports of trends in a given geographic area may be misinterpreted and applied to other areas or regions. And although this may happen inadvertently, it can have devastating consequences.For example, the spread of infectious diseases may be exaggerated in certain urban settings, where a large number of people live in close</text>

Such media become increasingly sophisticated and capable, enabling a new purpose or business model. Examples of this type of adaptation are infrastructures that learn from their users and are able to adapt to new customer segments, and social media that constantly monitor activity and are able to connect with new audiences. Adaptive media play a central role in the consumption and use of information, whether textual, image or video.In this article, I briefly overview some of the ways in</text>

Researchers at Microsoft Research and Google DeepMind have been developing applications that use machine learning and big data to detect cultural trends such as increasing numbers of smartphone users, alcohol use and homophobic statements online.Using stochastic gradient-based image processing, the applications can be applied to detect malignant neoplasms, environmental degradation and viral outbreaks more rapidly than the diagnostics available through traditional scientific research.In the context of global health and pandemic preparedness, the potential applications of such technologies are vast and growing. In the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for example, commercial healthcare providers alone are not able to diagnose and respond to the threat effectively. A collaborative research team led by Microsoft Research is helping healthcare workers to identify and treat Ebola patients through an Ebola clinical trial dubbed Project Cyborg.Leaders in Machine Learning and Big Data have realised that in the age of the microbiome, which describes the microbial communities living in a given host, there is a near-universalised acceptance that something is amiss. A common belief among healthcare workers, researchers and computer scientists is that the frequent updating of healthcare information is itself a biennial tradition – a belief reinforced by the ubiquity of healthcare. This understanding of the microbiome as an evolving and ever-changing landscape that is impossible to comprehend or control has enormous implications for public health and biomedical research.In this new millennium, we can look forward to a world in which biomedical research and technology merge with one in which much of what we call ‘science fiction’ is no longer generated by the individual scientist but instead relies on the help of a network of data mining and predictive modelling algorithms. As the microbiome continues to be shown to be a remarkably versatile and adaptable</text>

In the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for example, commercial healthcare providers alone are not able to diagnose and respond to the threat effectively. A collaborative research team led by Microsoft Research is helping to map the Ebola virus using geo-tagging and machine learning to identify specific patients ahead of time, enabling healthcare providers to carry out surgical strikes before the outbreak becomes critical.In other Ebola cases, healthcare providers are using existing scientific tools to detect and treat the symptoms of the virus – a situation that requires close collaboration with medical professionals to be effective. A pilot project at Microsoft Research is testing a program that identifies and treats Ebola symptoms using Microsoft Cognitive Services, enabling healthcare providers to diagnose and treat the outbreak within 24 hours. And in Zaire, a team of Microsoft researchers is developing a vaccine using machine learning and Big Data to prevent the outbreak from becoming fatal.Microsoft Research is located at Microsoft Research Center, New York, USA. The team leads on critical areas of machine learning and data science. The types of problems that can be addressed include natural-language processing (ML) – the study of how human language is formed; text mining (TMT) – the study of how data is gathered and</text>

A collaborative research team led by Microsoft Research is helping the World Health Organization and other international partners create strategies to deploy in real-time to detect and respond to the outbreak.The emergence of new infectious diseases, unprecedented numbers of deaths and massive destruction around the globe are the direct result of unchecked growth, and the interaction of a multitude of factors – economic, political and social. But reducing the threat posed by these phenomena is only part of the equation. Rapid technological innovation is needed in order to affect widespread change and revolutionize resource allocation, economic systems and governance, making it possible to achieve transformative social and cultural change. In this context, understanding the causes and/or contributing factors that fuel such explosive growth is critical. Yet despite this mounting body of knowledge, little is known about how the human capacity for change impacts economic growth and wealth creation. In this context, growing up-front investments in basic research and infrastructure are critical, since they fund the operations of critical science institutions and enable access to critical knowledge. Yet in a capitalist world with ever-more powerful</text>

In the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for example, commercial healthcare providers alone are not able to diagnose and respond to the threat effectively. A collaborative research team led by Microsoft Research is helping to create a rapid response capability through a class-based curriculum on how to spot and respond to emerging infectious diseases through engaging with communities through storytelling, mapping and swarm intelligence.This type of collaborative research is becoming increasingly important; it is predicting, anticipating and mapping epidemics in real-time – all in the name of survival. In the Ebola outbreak, commercial healthcare providers are not only failing patients, but also contributing to the spread of disease through infected healthcare workers. In the US, healthcare providers alone are not screening healthcare workers enough or keeping up with patient updates, so infections continue to happen. Infections in the healthcare system are highly contagious and can be detected and treated with antibiotics; however, in the Ebola outbreak, the pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions that developed the diagnostic tools for the market are also failing patients and contributing to the spread of disease. Researchers at Microsoft Research have developed a class of algorithms that can spot and respond to anomalies in image processing – such as changing text size, brightness or shape</text>

A collaborative research team led by Microsoft Research is helping to develop vaccines and therapeutics through a pilot project at Microsoft Research 'Infrastructure' in Aberdeen, Scotland. The project, 'HIV Surveillance and Risk Assessment' was recently awarded a Microsoft Research 'Genius' grant to accelerate the development of effective surveillance and risk assessment capabilities.The potential of such technologies to detect and respond to emerging epidemics is immense, and understanding how cultural factors interact in the transmission of infectious diseases is critical. However, until now the mechanisms linking cultural practices to epidemic outbreaks have largely been theoretical and speculative. That is, cultural theorists have tended to develop and apply their theoretical and theoretical musings to existing, everyday phenomena – epidemics, for example – rather than attempting to implement effective interventions that render social change possible. In this article, I employ mathematical, biological and economic principles of social science to argue that the social, economic and cultural factors that shape health and wellness have a significant impact on how we inhabit and perceive the worlds we create, and how we function in them.</text>
