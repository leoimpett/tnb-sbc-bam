This was seen as a conflictual potential new curatorial format, and the race was recognised as the contested stage of the exhibition. As a consequence, and contrary to the project’s stated mission, the curatorial race was not placed in the chronological order of the artist’s career, but rather in the order of the artist’s art in the museum. The race was seen by the curatorial race as a contest for positions on a rotating rotating basis, with the positions of the artworks representing a contest to the world of virtual reality (VR). Curators were seen competing for positions on the rotating basis of position, as well as for the public’s affection, by offering</text>

Yet in contemporary language, use-value is relative. In the modern language of economics, use-value is defined as the ability to create value – something that can and must be produced in some way.

But the biennial and the subsequent 2000 edition of the Biennial Register reflect a more dominant cultural force, one that exerts a significant influence on the area’s architecture and urban transformation.  The Biennial Register 2003–2005 The Biennial was formed in 2006 and took the art world by storm. Its popularity and accessibility led many artists to explore the region, and its production of urban change marked a turning point in the development of the region.  The popularity of the event, and the events that it represented, was directly proportional to the development of the biennial, and the subsequent record-breaking numbers of visitors. The record-breaking number of visitors in the two years following the formation of the Biennial was even more marked, with more than ten times the number of artists, many of whom arrived via plane or charter. The biennial’s own social media following was important in generating awareness of the project, as well as generating media coverage</text>

The presence of the Dewitt Art Gallery and the Granby Four Stores in the 17th Century building, and the Smith Richardson Homebaked in the early 20th Century, played important roles in the area's economy. The Granby Four Stores managed the neighbourhood bakery and the Homebaked baked goods were exported to cities in the US and Europe. The Smith Richardson opened the bakery as a department store, and over the years the bakery hosted Midsummer and One Day parades to mark the end of the nineteenth century. The Granby Four Stores tried to take over the bakery, but the courts took over, and eventually the Midsummer and One Day marchers joined forces and formed the One Day ­Union. In the early 1920s, the bakery hosted Wimbledon carnival, and the Granby Four Stores opened the bakery as a branch of the Union Storey. By the 1930s, the bakery was a major employer, and the Granby Four Stores established a store next door. The Granby Four Stores' storefront was a major feature</text>

The presence of the Dewitt Art Gallery and the Granby Four Stores in the 17th Century building, and the Smith Richardson Homebaked in the early 20th Century, played important roles in the city’s development. But now that dynamic is replaced with the other, more pervasive, cultural force of the 21st Century: technology, media, finance, and big data. The biennial has largely failed to impact the area, although it’s worth noting that the number of reviews on TripAdvisor of Homebaked in the area has quadrupled in the past 10 years alone.  The neighbourhood has been turned into a destination, and there’s a good chance that the biennial will be remembered for some time to come as a turning point in the city’s history, but for now, it’s too late to reverse the processes that brought down the community buildings. The city has made some inroads towards rebuilding them, but they’re too late to reverse the historical trends that brought down the neighbourhood. The city has to do much more to engage the area in a meaningful way to influence change, and to change the dynamic between now</text>

A pivotal role in this transformation can be attributed to the work of local artist Peter Saville. He instilled a love of the arts and a desire to share the wealth of knowledge with the local people, two things that would later be shared by the Biennial, the Dewitt Art Gallery and the community. Peter Saville was born in 1863.  He earned a B.A. from McGill University, a minor from the Welsh Academy, an M.A. from McGill University, and a Ph.D. from Columbia University.  He was a professor of English and Film Studies at McGill University from 1920 to 1928, and taught at the Deaf Academy, Columbia University, and the University of Alberta. He was also the director of the Deaf Arts Centre, and the National Association of the Deaf. His work is largely concerned with the conditions of community life for people with different kinds of voice,</text>

Art was also a big part of the 1867 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, but these were overshadowed by the real estate boom and the creation of modern Olympic parks and venues.  Art was often used in the community to unite people, but the biennial and the Olympic host city both saw an increase in racial and ethnic diversity, while the 1918 Montreal Olympics saw a sharp decrease.  Art and biennial curatorial eyelands can be found in virtually every major art centre of the world today, but the biennial has largely retired as an artistic offering in the host city.  A new generation of biennials is emerging on the scene, and their curatorial fixation on the historic as opposed to contemporary art forms seems to be part of a broader trend. It is also a trend that is being sustained by the curatorial hand of the biennial in the city.  The biennial has largely retained its artistic edge, although newer</text>

The Granby Four Stores and the Smith Richardson home were the first acts of the community to be invited to be a part of the new wave of artists and visitors to the area.  The Smith Richardson home was a local favourite, and her True Confessions, a ficto-rhythmic poem in which she confessed many things, became a staple of the Granby community radio programme.  The Granby Four Stores and the Smith Richardson home are the most recognisable figures in the area.  The Granby Four Stores were founded in 1883 by Horace Greeley, Peter Weibel, Herman Götz, Walter Kaufmann and Max Nord, and the Nord name comes from a chain of department stores in Berlin.  The name ‘Granby Four’ is Scottish and derives from the Gaelic for Four Corners in Dublin, where three quarters of the population lived.</text>

Local artists, including William Halliday, Andrew N. Ward and Peter Reed formed the dominant creative force in the area. The emergence of Silk and Velvet in the early 1900s as sophisticated fashion choices and fine home decor choices helped to establish the local community as a sought-after tourist target. These cultural interventions were supplemented by an extensive public school system and a skilled working class of neighbourhood dwellers who brought expertise on retraining housing, retailing and service industries to the local area. The emergence of Housing and Urban Development Canada in the early twentieth century opened doors to postgraduate studies in urban studies and architecture, and the creation of One Toronto, a</text>

The presence of the Dewitt Art Gallery and the Granby Four Stores in the 17th Century building, and the Smith Richardson Homebaked in the early 20th Century, played important roles in the economic and social fabric of the area. But the inclusion of the Dewitt Art Gallery and the Granby Four Stores in the 18th Century buildings, and the panorama of houses that once lined the streets, provided the framework for a system that was mores-impregnable.  The introduction of photography into the biennial circuit in the early to mid-1990s was a game-changer for the city, and the curatorial turn around the biennial, which began with a series of retrospectives and followed with numerous video archival and textual productions. As curatorial ambitions broadened and filmed practices began to be smuggled in, and now illegal, and now curatorial pedagogy began to be developed within organised and organised play. The curatorial turn is a process that can be traced to Wadsworth, Wadsworth (1987) and Wadsworth &amp; Co. (1988-91), both based in London,</text>

It was the Biennial that instilled that sense of wonder and imagination that would later be exported to other parts of Canada, and continues to inform how the arts are employed and presented in the region. When I started work on the Chronicle in 1989, the Dewitt Art Gallery was still in use, and the Community Arts Centre was an institution of the far right. But the Biennial and the subsequent Open Mic concert had a huge cultural impact in turning the defenceless local population against the forces of capitalist modernity and ushering into being a counter culture movement. These cultural practices were built on a foundation of fear.

Art’s own momentum can be used as a weapon, and the biennial could be a vehicle that enables the unleashing of that creative energy.  	In the end, the fun should be in the making of the things that are possible, not in trying to impose one theory on others. That is, of course, the whole mission of the biennial, to be creative enablers rather than writers and producers. And it is a role that WOWfest was ideally placed to play. It was an ideal platform to experiment with the possibilities of a biennial that were not confined within the walls of the city, and it provided the public with valuable knowledge that they could use to make their own creative choices.

In the wake of these global trends, it is easy to forget that the Valley was not always the way it is today.In the 1930s and 1940s, the Valley experienced a much more robust and visible anti-establishment, ‘Big Apple’ narrative. The dominance of the image of the Valley in popular and popular culture was produced by writers like Ernest Hemingway, Zora Neale Hurston and Upton Sinclair. These authors ‘promoted the idea that the Pacific Ocean is an island, surrounded by marshes and shallow waters, and that the Valley is an island of arable land and farms, surrounded by […] a picturesque scenery of sand and rocks, and subject to the vagaries of global trade […]’[2] Literary texts, fiction and painting alike were encouraged to take the Valley seriously – a position that was sustained by auteur Victor Hugo, whose novel ‘The Jungle Book’ was based in large measure on the author’s story. In fact, the Valley was so widely imagined as a fictitious place – the sort of place where bad guys live by night and eat by day – that in its pre-</text>

In the wake of these global trends, it is easy to forget that the Valley was not always the way it is today.In the 1930s and 1940s, the Valley was a destination for British merchant ships, during which time millions of migrants flocked to the region to work the port factories. The port was a major hub for the trans-shipment of British manufactured goods, and the construction of an impressive array of new runways and runways was planned to accommodate several hundred million passengers in the years to come. The port’s continued closure during the war years was attributed to a combination of poor planning and bad luck – the latter being the result of overbuilding on the grounds – but the former is a myth. In truth, the port was a major hub for the trans-shipment of British manufactured goods after the war, and the Valley a major staging post for the big war. The loss of life-supporting infrastructure – power plants, refineries, water treatment plants – was also a myth, since the war effort required such massive investment in infrastructure that it was almost completely submerged in the post-war period. Instead, the Valley became a</text>

In the wake of these global trends, it is easy to forget that the Valley was not always the way it is today.In the 1930s and 1940s, the Valley experienced a much more propitious economic and urban development environment. The ‘petro-zone’ emerged as a way to combine the economic potential of the city with the cultural immediacy of the rural, and the latter was seen by many in the Valley as a potential future. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the city continued to grow despite its economic mismanagement, and the region was hit hard by the effects of deserization. The decline in population and inflation-busting policies in the early to mid-1960s however, meant that the urban component of the ‘petro-zone’ was no longer the main driver of economic activity. In the 1970s and 1980s the city tried hard to regather the historical sites and draw vibrant cultural institutions from elsewhere in the country and abroad, but these efforts were often sidelined by the priorities of the current economic core. As a result, the ‘core’ now dominates the urban development in the Valley,</text>

In the wake of these global trends, it is easy to forget that the Valley was not always the way it is today.In the 1930s and 1940s, the Valley experienced a different kind of gentrification – one driven by the logic of nationalistic nationalism. The Nazis came to power in Germany and with it, in theory, the end of the Valley’s dream of a post-war cultural renaissance. Art is still routinely screened through the panoply of cultural resources available in the region, but the social and economic conditions of post-Nazi Europe are such that art is less readily available than it was during the height of the Holocaust. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city actively promoted itself as a destination for art and artistic activity, and the arts were used as a political tool through which the state could project power and influence behaviour. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city actively promoted itself as a cultural mecca thanks to a thriving local arts scene. In the 1990s and 2000s, the City of Industry tried to project itself as a major art centre thanks to a large biennale and museum commissioning structure. But these</text>

In the wake of these global trends, it is easy to forget that the Valley was not always the way it is today.In the 1930s and 1940s, the Valley experienced a much more robust and socially conscious economy than it does today, and its rapid growth was fueled by a combination of public works and a creative class of artists who arrived via the newly invented ‘middle class’. These artists included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman, and many others. After World War II, the city bounced back, becoming a major international port and hub for trans-shipment of goods including art and fashion, as well as a centre for international trade. As a result, the city experienced a sustained flow of goods and people – a trickle effect, in other words. The loss of population in the city was a concern of the city’s planners, and as a consequence the city experienced a significant urban sprawl, particularly in the early part of the twentieth century. The City was divided into zones A and B, with A1 being the city as a whole. Zone B1 became known as the ‘Silo Zone</text>

During these decades, the city experienced a series of anti-Semitic and racist acts, including the infamous Los Angeles Pits, which were partially perpetrated by Asian-Americans. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Nazis occupied Eastern Europe and sought to destroy the very identity of the European aesthetic form, replacing it with an antisemitic national aesthetic. The NAZIs also established what came to be called the ‘Golden Horde’ – a proto-fascist White supremacist intellectual and social grouping based in the ‘Khrushchev Khasin region’ of Transcaucasia. The Horde included writers such as Irving Kristol, who wrote Weapon of Mathaiyum – a revision of his Nazi propaganda textbook – which synthesized Nazi and NAZI thought.[2]The rise of modern nationalism in the early twentieth century was a consequence of the explosive growth of the global capitalist economy, and the pet</text>

In the wake of these global trends, it is easy to forget that the Valley was not always the way it is today.In the 1930s and 1940s, the Valley experienced a rapid growth spurt that challenged established notions of what was considered aesthetically pleasing to the dominant powers of the region. As a result, the City of Industry and its environs was quick to declare war on anything that threatened its industrial supremacy. In the wake of these declarations, artists, writers and other artistic elites fled the city to greener pastures, while the working class and lower strata of society flocked to the newly minted ‘Emerald City’ – a sort of proto-Twitter – where artists, writers and other prominent cultural figures could express their creativity and connect with the city’s youth. It was during this critical years that the WTO came into being, and with it, unsurprisingly, a great deal of cultural activity – including a great deal of art – – – reflecting the global circulations generated by the global circulation of money. In a city such as London, which is surrounded by the financial system, this activity came to symbolize everything that</text>

The Chinese Theater was established in 1931, and the Chinese Exposition began in 1939. These are brief biographies of two artists who are perhaps more representative of the changing face of the Valley: Gunnar Myrdalsdottir (1890–1971) was a poet, novelist, journalist and founder of the public radio broadcaster NRK, and his wife Emma (1914–79) was a journalist and journalist. Myrdalsdottir was born in Gothenburg, Sweden, and immigrated to America in 1939. He wrote several books on the War in the 1930s and 1940s, including From Slavery to Freedom (1937) and From Slavery to Democracy (1939).

The decline in population and rapid expansion of the non-Jewish Asian population in the mid-1950s sparked a vibrant and sustained local Jewish community, which in turn, increasingly looked to the Jewish community for support. In the early 1960s the Kookmin Association was founded, and in the early years of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Korean-American workers formed part of the executive council. In the early 1960s the Kookmin’s primary goal was to look for employment in a port city, and in the late 1950s and early 1960s the Kookmin’s interest shifted to developing the Port of Los Angeles as a port city alongside the East Bay Expressway as a means to facilitate the transportation of oil and raw materials.

In the wake of these global trends, it is easy to forget that the Valley was not always the way it is today.In the 1930s and 1940s, the Valley experienced a rapid growth spurt as artists, writers and the local community embraced the ‘new’ image of the area. The proliferation of movies set in the Valley during this time, as well as the ‘world’’ in the form of the ‘City’ and ‘Japan’, gave the impression that the Valley was a glamorous oasis of suburban fantasy indistinguishable from any other suburban fantasy. In the 1950s and early 1960s, a diverse range of artists, writers and community groups converged in the San Fernando Valley to explore the vernacular, its discontents and the connections between aesthetic creativity and economic development. These communities established their own biennale, but the main focus of interest during this time was the redevelopment of the Valley itself. These efforts spanned a broad range of cultural practices, including photography, sculpture, performance, house and garden, dance, community gardens, games and crafts, public art and community films.The Biennial as</text>

It seems like an opportunity to view the issues from a range of perspectives, to come up with your own unique, perhaps even inspirational perspective. And perhaps, in the end, this is what the Biennial were up to, ‘seeing what works and doesn’t work in the world as it exists today’.  	But there was a problem with that idea: what is the Welsh Streets project today? Where is the Welsh Streets project when the Biennial is nowhere to be found? When the Welsh Streets project was put on hold, and now? When the Welsh Streets have been sold? When the Welsh Streets no longer exist? When the Welsh Streets are neither here nor there anymore? When is the next Welsh Streets project put on hold? 	These are questions that continue</text>

But the decision to relocate the Welsh Streets hub to the Welsh Streets in Belfast seems to render the Welsh Streets inessential to the hub’s intended urban function. The Welsh Streets is an urban abstraction, a place where art’s actuality is mediated through apparent appearances and phantom links. It is not possible to replicate the art institution in the Welsh Streets, whereas a city can. Art is produced and celebrated in the Welsh Streets, but it is produced and celebrated elsewhere. Places like Anfield, by and large, are not places where art is produced and celebrated. 	But the Biennial does have a place in the Welsh Streets, and in the city in general. As we saw, it is possible to create an artist-run biennial in the Welsh Streets, whereas a city can easily abolish such an institution. We actually see this in the Biennial’s impact map, which  </text>

But here’s the thing: the Biennial in Bristol is a great idea that backfired spectacularly. Its inception was ill-advised, to put it mildly. Its stated aim (one hopes) was to celebrate the art of Northern Ireland, but its real intent was to showcase the art of the region as a whole. Take Away: the intended effect is to obscure the true nature of the region, discouraging people from coming to the Welsh Streets, where the Biennial was supposed to be held, and thereby ensuring that the Biennial will never again be able to do so. 	But that was the whole intention all along. The problem with the Welsh Streets is that it is still a place where people walk down, even though it is nearly empty. And in the Biennial’s defense, it is still a place where art is displayed, even though it is filled</text>

Surely, this is the only way that the Biennial could have been in Belfast in 2015, and it is equally plausible that it was in Liverpool in 2015, but for a number of reasons – the first being the 2016 Queen’s Birthday Honours Ceremony in Liverpool, which was disrupted by violence, and which has been repeated. Thankfully, no-one was hurt in either case. 	So, again, the question becomes: how would a biennial affect its location, its community of users, and its relationship to its local environment? While Liverpool Biennial may have relocated to California, and may no longer be based in London, its proximity to its local community and to the Museum of Modern Art, where it is currently undertaking a major renovation, makes it a necessity for this city.

Perhaps, as the artist Terry Gilliam suggests (regardless of how much influential and provocative his work can be), the Biennial could be structured around the sporadic and declarative publication of a journal, or even a book, which it maintains in its archive. 	And what of the place of art in the 21st century? Do the Welsh Streets and Welsh Streets Gallery represent the true, historic art form? It is certainly the case that the Welsh Streets is the site of major, world-renowned art shows, and the Welsh Streets Gallery is where significant numbers of people live in Belfast, so perhaps we can speak of the historical Welsh Streets as if it were a modern-day Mecca of art’s display, and</text>

But a few lines later, in the very next line, we learn that the Biennial was indeed initially supposed to be in London. But the Chronicle of London, the city’s oldest and largest newspaper,  rejected a proposal from the Biennial to publish an issue of its flagship newspaper, the Standard, in London. So the Biennial in Bristol was originally slated to be in Liverpool, but publication was eventually delayed until the following May. The decision to relocate the art institution from its traditional hub in London to its current location in the Welsh Streets in Belfast seems particularly ill-considered, to put it mildly. Surely, the designers’ and artists’ would have us believe that the Welsh Streets is a more naturalised version of its former self, as it exists now, where it is still possible to visit and sample a variety of wares. 	But is there really such a thing as ‘welsh Streets’? If so, where does one find the appropriate epithet? If there is, then Cardiff Bay might just be a few streets away from home. Art’s current vernacular may be defined by the presence of traces of ‘real life’ in otherwise sterile spaces, but the roots of its current popularity can be found in places where real life is actively discouraged or removed. The failure to attract large numbers of tourists has certainly been a factor in the proliferation of art’s current monstrosities, but the real motivation for such attractions may well be the same as its motivations for the phantoms of today: the accumulation of consumer goods, culture-identity bills, awards, critical acclaim, tours and advertising campaigns. The failure to connect with contemporary art, and the subsequent refusal to create for the future may well be the driving force of a cultural revolution that leads</text>

But the decision to relocate the Biennial to the Welsh Streets seems even more misguided when taken as a whole, as a whole set of things. For one thing, the decision to publish a Welsh Streets issue of its flagship newspaper in its traditional location in the Welsh Streets is hardly a ringing endorsement of the city as a place to live and work. 	Secondly, and more fundamentally, the decision to relocate the Biennial to the Welsh Streets seems even more misguided when taken as a whole, as a whole set of things, as a whole set of shared histories and anxieties and ambitions. 	Thirdly, and most fundamentally, the decision to relocate the Biennial to the Welsh Streets seems even more misguided when taken as a whole, as a whole set of shared histories and aspirations. 	I come to this through two sets of separations: the cultural and the material. The cultural is the separation that exists between what is imagined to</text>

And perhaps the Biennial would still publish the varied and stylised art offerings in the Welsh Streets, in a style that closely approximates the original Welsh Streets art, but with a pro-Israeli tilt. 	But such is the nature of ‘biennial news’: it is written by journalists, and so, at the very least, it is from the journalist who pretends to be an informed and informed Welsh Streets resident. And such is the ‘welsh streets’ story, which is told, told again and again, repeated hundreds of times on the radio and countless times on the bus. And so we are transported back and forth between the Welsh Streets and the Welsh Streets Museum, through the Welsh Streets Arts Forum, the Welsh Streets Journal, the Welsh Streets Home Tour, the Welsh Streets Home Tour 2 and the Welsh Streets Arts Forum 3. And we are transported to 2011, when the Welsh Streets were again a staging ground for</text>

The October issue of the Standard rejected the idea of the ‘standard' (defined as the city’s physical characteristics) as opposed to the ‘narrative’ (defined as an imagined community of admirers and patrons). Instead, the editors’ narrative stated that Belfast’s ‘stately old fashioned’ buildings were poorly suited to the digital revolution, and that the city needed to embrace the ‘infrastructures’ and ‘malls’ of Silicon Valley. The editors’ preferred, however, to leave it to the communities to decide what type of narrative architecture and urban redevelopment they wanted to see built. 	In a larger perspective, this stance towards the increasingly irrelevant but persistent urban/suburban arena is also evident in the December 2015 issue of Architectural Design Review, where the editors declared that they were now more interested in the ‘h</text>

But the move from the traditional art market place to the realm of artisanal, to that of home-grown, and from home to the bustling metropolis, is a question that has been with us all along, and will probably be with us all around the world. It’s a question of when, not if. Art as a social practice has often been seen as an end in itself, a question mark over any future opportunities. But the reality is that many new creative practices spring from the wreckage of an institution that is no longer able to sustain them, and that is often slow to recover from the damage done by its own recurrent crises of habit. We needn’t romanticise institutions anymore. We need to reimagine how they operate through the common good, and those around them. Visit Liverpool Biennial, next Saturday 14 and 17 October, 2018.

The advent of   	Postmodernism really came into its own in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it certainly came into its own in New York and London. But I think the critical mass that came along in the last decade or so is the critical mass that is needed to really see how the arts are interrelated and what it means to be an arts organisation. Doing good works of art isn’t easy, and it’s not instantaneously apparent to people who don’t already know so much about the world of art. But I do think that the new critical mass that’s emerging is people who understand that the art form they live in is inherently a ‘complex social system’ where identity isn’t static, but constantly evolves and muddles along the way to change. It’s people who understand that the art form they’ve been part of for a very long time is inherently a complex social system where space is scarce and ephemeral, but also where power plays a huge role in shaping what is and is not visible. Doing good works of art</text>

The advent of   	Postmodernism really came into its own in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it certainly came into its own in New York and London. But I don’t think the advent of 3-D modelling in the 1980s was the critical mass to send 3-D-models downtown and into the mainstream, because the ‘third’ was already downtown by the time of the ‘twelfth’ (although I do love the irony of the fact that the third is now the outer limit of what can be done with 3-D modelling).  And I think that the third was always a problem for artists, that it’s what made artists like Rubens, Andrew Griffin and Thomas Dekker unique, that it’s what made them able to set up shop in massive retail districts, and that it’s what made them able to populate their artworlds with ­replica shopping bags full of objects. It’s what made their artworks unique, and made them unique in their own way.Postmodernism was about systems breaking down, and artists like Debord were</text>

The advent of   	Postmodernism really came into its own in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it certainly came into its own in New York and London, but in terms of what it stood for, I think that the 3-D modelling and the 3-D printing really did impact everything. Everything from the way art was conceived and presented to the way people actually looked at art, and I think that a lot of that is because of the postmodernism that emerged in the 1980s and early 1990s. If you remove the 3-D modelling and the 3-D printing from the picture, you get a picture that is much more like an actual house. There are a lot of similarities between the way a contemporary house is designed and an oldenen time house, but the advent of 3-D modelling and the 3-D printing really came into its own in the 1980s, and it really came into its own in New York and London, but in terms of what it stood for, I think that the postmodernism that emerged in the 1980s and early 1990s really impacts everything.

The advent of   	Postmodernism really came into its own in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it certainly came into its own in New York and London, but it’s not true in all cities. Some countries have Postmodernisms and some don’t. And I think that’s where art’s power is concentrated. Power is concentrated in places with a certain amount of democracy and human rights. When the political and economic systems that produce and support those systems break down, the artists who put them in motion have a really hard job. When I first started out, I didn’t have a critical mass of followers, but I’ve always prided myself on knowing how to draw people. So power, I think, is not concentrated in a specific community of people. It’s more of a collective. And I think that power is a really slippery thing to control. When you give it away for free, especially when you give it away in places like New York and London, you also give away some of your most valuable resources – your perception of reality, your ability to</text>

The advent of   	Postmodernism really came into its own in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it certainly came into its own in New York and Paris, which are very different cities from the city where I live. But the fact that artists have to be mobile (with their works published on sites like Instagram and Facebook) is still a huge issue for me, and it still affects the way in which an artist can be funded, and the way in which art is distributed. In the 1990s, the artist was primarily interested in distribution, and the fact that 3-D modelling was the new way to do it, so there was a big gap between the wealthy cities and the rest of the country. And there was a gap between the artist and the viewer, who was primarily interested in the visual arts. But now there’s a huge gap between the artist and the viewer, who is also interested in the art of living.  So there’s a convergence of interests, and the fact that I live in the city limits me very much. But I’m not sure I follow the same audiences, or</text>

The advent of   	Postmodernism really came into its own in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it certainly came into its own in New York and London. But I don’t think the advent of 3-D modelling or Postmodernism is what really changed the game in the 1990s. The advent of 3-D modelling or Postmodernism is what brought art and visual arts back into the mainstream. The emergence of the internet is important, but I think the big bang that came about in the 1990s really did change everything. If you can send objects online, then you can also reshape them. And the ability to send images or videos online is a critical component of the internet, and it’s why artists are drawn to the internet as an expressive medium. It’s why Damien Hirst chose the New York Museum as his art venue. It’s why Kyrri Stoljar and his team chose to work in Greenwich, so that their work could be found and appreciated by a global audience. It’s why the sculpture team at Tate Britain chose to work in Liverpool. It’</text>

The advent of   	Postmodernism really came into its own in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it certainly came into its own in New York and London, but it’s really the advent of the internet and social media that’s really bringing art and visual arts to life on a global basis. It’s bringing art closer to audiences, and especially to people who might be engaged with art, and that’s really important. The advent of 3-D modelling really did change everything. The way art was made globally now required huge volumes of post-processing. Art directors all over the world were relying on computers to manage the art campaigns. When the internet was invented in 1991 in Britain, it’s clear that ‘a lot of people weren’t aware that art was still made using paper and charcoal as a primary medium’. The advent of social media and blogs in the 1980s also changed everything. Blogs and social media brought artists and fans closer together, and that’s really exciting.

The advent of Botanical Gardens in Greenwich, CT and MOCAD in the US really came into their own with the advent of these three-dimensional models, and now we have these urban-dwelling dinosaurs called ‘plant-based art institutions’, which is all fine and dandy on a technical level, but on a societal level what has really happened is that the cultural critic who wrote the first thing that came to mind when he or she thought of an art institution has now become something like an icon of the institution. The institutions that emerged after that ‘golden age’ – World War Z, The Network, The Sopranos, The Wire, to name only a few – have all become quite recognizable, and as a result, have a financial incentive to be seen as part of the cultural canon. And if the icon is the point, then the point is always perceived as</text>

The advent of   	Postmodernism really came into its own in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it certainly came into its own in New York and Venice, but it seems as though the 3-D-model has become increasingly important in the 17th-century modernist tradition. As a visual artist, I find the postmodernist 3-D model a very interesting one, and I’m drawn to this particular dimension of the medium. But at the same time, I’m drawn to the fact that a lot of the visual arts practitioners in the 1990s were also artists, and that’s why the 3-D-figure is so interesting: because it’s a reminder that you don’t necessarily belong to a particular tradition, but you do have a cultural value embedded in you, and that is deeply moving and resonant. 	But now, a decade later, we’re seeing the effects of this kind of visual valence; we’re seeing artists struggling with the very notion of place, and we’re seeing cultural valences that are no longer static or</text>

So, really, the ubiquity of art today is a consequence of the advent of social media and blogs in different cities around the world, and especially in New York and London, where art is more often than not displayed alongside other art forms, including physical and virtual art forms. New cultural forms are born. And they live. And they change. And they grow old. And all the signs are pointing to the same place: We are currently experiencing a kind of temporality that can no longer be ignored – a kind of postmodernism that can no longer ignore the past, and that is already eroding our cultural values and pushing us backwards into the future. And we are all complicit in that erosion.  	So, there are different kinds of art, and there are different kinds of art per se. And there are different kinds of temporality, and art has to be</text>

The project was conceived as a collaborative process between the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, with additional content coming from the New York Public Library and the Museum of Modern Art, Philadelphia. More than a biennial itself, this project is a collaboration between the museums, the biennial as a curatorial tool, and the local community. It seeks to develop a shared vocabulary and methodology for the curatorial production of this kind of work through a field-based, multi-disciplinary participatory process. The project was conceived as a way to explore the larger social and cultural landscape of New York City through the specific curatorial lens of its art institution, while also questioning how art and culture intersect with the broader socio-cultural landscape of the city. These questions run counter to the prevailing assumptions and ideologies of contemporary art, which are largely produced and defended by the museums and their curatorial officials. The project thus seeks to render the museum and the curatorial personified through a diversity of cultural and historical point of view. The project was also conceived as a way to endow this new curatorial approach with cultural values and ethos consistent with the diverse cultural practices of the city at large.

The second phase of the project, entitled Participatory Development, focuses on the development of the local curatorial agenda following the workshop series. Our project proposes a multi-year, multi-edition biennial that brings together the local curatorial agenda with the curatorial content of another art institution, creating a hybrid experience between art and art institutions.

The project was developed with the Museum of Modern Art's Mexico City office and the Museum of Contemporary Art's Venice, Italy, as key locations and followed the curatorial agenda of the museums in their respective regions. The focus of the first phase of the project, entitled Participatory Development, takes place in several cities in the Mexican state of Veracruz, where artists, writers and community organisers take part in a co-production project with the city government. The project was co-ordinated by the Museum of Modern Art's Office of Cultural Affairs, Mexico City, with the Museum of Contemporary Art’s Office of Cultural Affairs, New York. The artworks, ranging from installation to thatch and board, are created as props in the project, which is driven by the Office of Cultural Affairs, Mexico City. In phase</text>

The project was conceived as a collaborative process between the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, with additional content coming from the New York Public Library and the Museum of Modern Art, Philadelphia. More than just a museum, the Biennial would be a site for the curatorial agenda to be activated and implemented in a participatory process with local communities, constructed from the ground up with new spatial forms and constructed alongside of the urban fabric of New York City. Our proposal calls for the installation of public realm-like installations, including public realm chairs, to be placed strategically throughout the city, also including a public realm plaza and a public realm flagstone. The Biennial would be a site for a network of such participatory practices, including new modes of access and cultural exchange, new media of production, and new ways of inhabiting the places where they take place. The proposal is begotten from conversations with various curators, art administrators, artists' associations and community organizers who collectively witnessed the devastation and destruction wreaked by neoliberalism and were coming together to challenge the authorities. The project would be their response with a decentralized agenda that operates at a regional, local and even national level. 	</text>

The project was conceived as a collaborative process between the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, with additional content coming from the New York Public Library and the Museum of Modern Art, Philadelphia. More than a biennial, it seeks to interrogate the relationship between biennial and major art museum, and between biennial and post-major art museum. In this sense, it is an extension of the Museum of Modern Art’s ongoing, long-term curatorial programme, which involves research-based, event-based and curatorial approaches to the significant curatorial content of the museum. The project is made possible through the generous funding of the New Museum, a division of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. This catalogues the major content of the museum, with special attention to the recent curatorial highlights. It is based on the curatorial agenda of the museum, and takes into consideration the curatorial priorities of local communities. The project is a response to the biennial phenomenon, which begins with the introduction of a new curatorial style and ends with the maintenance of an established curatorial identity.

As an artist interested in the curatorial, I began to engage in a parallel research process, drawing on my curatorial training and curatorial philosophy. I began to understand the important role artists play in bringing together what would otherwise be distinct curatorial approaches, and in creating a context in which curatorial action is possible. This could happen through the use of technology, as was demonstrated by the ​ 	Integrative Arts Project, which sought to automate the postulation of knowledge about areas of the art world through the deployment of advanced computer models. The project was initiated and co-located at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, with the mission of bringing together artists with the curatorial, performing research into the areas of art and culture in the museum through a collaborative, multi-disciplinary research project.

More than a biennial, this new edition is an important entry point into the ART (Artistic Resources and Archives) system, marking the first time this has been done in New York. The new edition will contain a large number of documents that constitute the curatorial agenda of another art institution; it will also include curatorial interventions into the curatorial process in the understanding of another art form. The curatorial interventionality will be punctured through the various forms of this new art form, including through the curatorial actions of a biennial. The curatorial interventions in the new art form will be those that foster understanding and participation, on the one side, and the curatorial actions of an art institution on the other. This is the curatorial intervention that happens at the biennial, that is dynamic and unexpected and, on the same level, that breaks new ground.

    should be curated and oriented towards the user’s interests, not the other way around. This is one of the reasons why apps are free: because they meet the needs of the users, not because the users meet the needs of the app creators.

The web is the most fundamental app, but it is also the most invisible, because it does not connect with the user’s senses (except perhaps through the magic of the cloud).

It is easy to write an app that does not make a difference in the world around it, but if the world around it is written by a company that hopes to make money through advertising, then the world must be a company that hopes to make money by writing laws. And in recent years, this kind of thinking has pervaded the design world, with conspicuous consumption now at the centre and ever more obvious signs of engagement now being supplemented by social media. The world is social media, and social media is beautiful. But the web is beautiful in ways that are difficult to quantify and understand. The explosion of data which accompanied the app store and the constant shifting of platforms on which to be entertained is as painful for the user as it is for the artisans who produce the content. And whilst the user may place faith in the machine, she/he is also susceptible to the</text>

And these kinds of integrations happen all the time in modern society: Google’s self-image as a search engine, Facebook’s worship of users as consumers and Twitter’s passionate promotion of its users as engaged members of a passionate community. And this kind of stuff happens all the time in the world of design, but it is especially evident in the field of architecture. The field of architecture has been around for a very long time, and its contemporary manifestations date all the way to the 1980s. So not only are the historical precedents written, but the contemporary ones are also written. And this kind of writing is becoming increasingly rare, whereas in the past there was a tendency for the art world to declare itself enamoured with historical designs and phenomena and peer into its users’ minds. So the contemporary avant garde, or art in its abstraction, has arrived. And here, then, the dilemmas of the contemporary artist. Is the task too vast, too daunting, or even too unappealing? If the answer to either of these questions is ‘</text>

And these kinds of integrations happen all the time in modern society: Google’s self-image as a service provider, Facebook’s reach and influence, Uber’s need to prove itself and its valuation, Twitter’s immense influence and ubiquity. And of course, there is the ever-present need to publish and connect with the web, which is what social media does. All of these things are designed to make the user experience as transparent as possible, to make it easier for the user to access information and to make it safer for the user to access information. But what makes the user experience really interesting is what happens in the background, or what the company does behind the scenes. And this is where the power of the artist comes in: artistically, the artist’s contribution can be as subtle as a icon or as dramatic as a website. The difference is that a website can define the terms and conditions of engagement, so that the user understands the relationship more fully.

But in the age of the web, there is a danger that these kinds of narratives will also become narrations, and that there will be no place left for non-connectedness, no place left for non-linearity, and certainly not for what Hilary Putman would call ‘total absence of continuity’.11. Social media and urbanism, 1845–1918. Note the parallel trends. Do we live in a world where the inhabitants of large metropolises are producing and using information at unprecedented rates, or are we still trapped in the modes of small-scale subsistence farming and fishing that emerged during the industrial revolution? The spread of science-based publishing during the nineteenth century was accompanied by a proliferation of literary forms that encouraged or glamorised scientific inquiry. So it is that the metropolis is becoming ever more digitally literate, and increasingly</text>

So the invisible web app, the one that pays no attention to the web browser, pays huge sums of money to acquire a global reputation, to be able to count millions of users and to become a source of value – a kind of corporate conscience. And these kinds of integrations happen all the time in modern society: Google’s self-image as a source of value is built upon the fact that people search for 'Google' in almost every search, and that people flock to the company’s sites year-round, year-round, because people want to be 'Googleified'. So the web app becomes a kind of embedded cultural system that transmits certain kinds of values to others – in this case, to people who build and run online services. And this kind of embedding occurs at many levels: the web app communicates with sites all over the world, and with each other, and with other kinds of embedded systems that humans construct, all the way up to the very core of the web server itself. And so we can imagine the web app as a kind of cultural condensation of information flows, and this kind of condensation is of necessity a transnational phenomenon. And so we can understand the web app as something that not only arrives here via the narrow gate of nation, but also requires transnational transnational transnational bureaucracies</text>

And these kinds of integrations happen all the time in modern society: Google’s self-image as a global brand, Facebook’s self-presentation as a way of connecting with users, YouTube’s emotional impact on users, Instagram’s ability to connect with collectors and the media, Twitter’s users who rally round to support a journalist’s work, Pinterest’s users who discover new art online and so forth. All these phenomena can be understood as applications of the same principle: the web is a source of value all on its own, and the only way to understand it is to use it. And this is why in modern society the web is so fundamental: because without the web, there can’t be apps, meaning without value, and without apps, there can’t be progress.Modern society is deeply divided between those who possess the means to do something with their bodies (technologists), and those who lack such means (primarily those in advanced technological societies). Thus it is quite natural for a technologist to inhabit the public</text>

And these kinds of integrations happen all the time in modern society: Google’s self-image as a search engine, Facebook’s need to connect with its users, Twitter’s need to connect with its community of followers. But these kinds of claims are only ever likely to be partial, because the claims themselves are also built upon a political economy of appearances and misunderstandings. The reason why app developers can build apps that deliberately seek to deceive and to muddle the user is that the user is already tricked into thinking that the app provides a solution. The problem with the web is not just that it is inconvenient and time-consuming to download and install, but that it is also that it is impossible to decipher what the hell is going on behind the scenes. Because the app itself provides no real solution, but only the appearance of one, but the appearance nonetheless remains elusive. So the appearance of a solution is used as a political tool, and the user is encouraged to consume more of it in order to access more of the solution. And this is what app developers do. They publish absurd</text>

And these kinds of integrations happen all the time in modern society: Google’s self-image as a search engine, Facebook’s reach, and Wikipedia’s immense institutional memory. But what makes the web different from other kinds of social media is that the users of the web app don’t pay any attention to the users of the social networks: they only interact with the content that the social networks produce. And this kind of simulation is exactly what Warren Fredrickson and I did in our research project, because we wanted to know what would happen if we put our research ideas into practice. So the first time that I did this kind of web app, in 2004, I didn’t have a user interface, I had to learn HTML, I had to learn Javascript, and I had to master the arcane syntax that is involved in creating a social network. But the beauty of the web is that you can do a lot of things on the web that you couldn’t do on a desktop or in a browser. So this kind of interactive model is exactly what the</text>

And these kinds of calculations happen all the time in the real world: in the financial sector, in the insurance industry, in the real estate market, in the media sector, in the legal sector, in academia, in lobbying, and so on. So the question becomes: what does the web app do? And the way to find out is to use the internet app that comes with your mobile phone, to look at the websites that have been built using HTML and CSS3. You can use your mobile phone as a kind of a ‘virtual billboard’ – looking at websites that are no longer online, but exist somewhere, in the real world – and that causes a stir in the local community. The way to understand this is to adopt a kind of internet app that looks for information in ‘the cloud’,</text>

And one might add to this the other kinds of user-centred narratives that emerge from the web: the desire for authenticity from the very fabric of the web; the desire for meaning from the very act of creating a web page. All of these things are products of the web as a media and digital interface, but unlike in previous centuries, the web is no longer the dominant form of interfaceisation. The web is becoming an infinite medium through which information and ideas are produced and disseminated. And one might add to this the fact that the web is increasingly interactive: blogs, instant news feeds, social media presences everywhere we look, search engines, online video streaming services – all of these things are products of the web in the age of media outlets and online video giants.

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’, and to consider the fact that many of them are run by for-profit or non-profit entities that often have close ties to government and other powerful actors. As a consequence, it is easy to forget that these ‘design thinkers’ often work for for-profit or non-profit entities or are volunteers within them, and that this is a ‘complex problem’ that requires a number of interrelated solutions. 	Moreover, it is easy to forget that many of these solutions are emerging primarily from within or alongside of the digital divide. It is now common for artists to be trained as social workers or researchers within non-profit arts institutions or non-profit research institutes, and sometimes even within these, but also within non-profit digital agencies, or as academics within these fields. These arrangements may be more convenient for the artist, since they do not conflict with the artist’s work-ethic and so may be more easily communicated.</text>

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’. These constitute a category that is relatively new and has recently begun to gain currency. More and more, we are encountering, reading and reflecting on these new ‘infrastructures’, which are their online and offline characteristics as well as their symbolic content. Our understanding of ‘culture as media’ is being redefined, and this redirection is being made through media, including media that are made to be shared and shared by many. Our concept of the ‘culturally significant media entity’ is being redrawn accordingly. Culturally significant media entities are those media that are representative of something or many ideas or concepts, and that are of lasting value to their audiences. This redefinition is being made through what sociologist Helga Nowotny refers to as a ‘culturally responsive media approach’. This refers to media that are responsive to the cultural changes taking place in their environments, and especially those media that are made to be shared</text>

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’, and the change that they can undergo should we enter into a new ‘information society’. Digital technologies have democratised access to data, enabling virtually any data to be captured, stored and transmitted. Digital technologies have democratised access to infrastructures, enabling them to be reconfigured and adapted to meet any changing needs and desires, whether that means automating traffic, manufacturing processes or even just about anything that needs to be automated or adapted to human processes. This raises the question: what are the tensions between the capacities of sites to recover cultural effects, and the level of infrastructure required to support such efforts? What are the forms of resistance that can emerge through the current economic and ecological crisis, and what can we as practitioners of this crucial art form learn from and from each other?

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’. We live and work within them. We inhabit them and derive meaning from them. The question becomes: how do we conceive of a future for these regions, or cities, or even whole continents, in which we inhabit? In the digital age, this future is a city that is a virtualised version of itself, a ‘big data hub’ that constantly collects data and transmits it to various locations throughout the city. In the age of virtual reality, this future may well be indistinguishable from what we inhabit today. 	Virtual reality is a type of spectacle that seeks to alter the intrinsic aesthetic sense of the medium through means that manipulate perception. It is art that seeks to render reality as malleable as possible in order to exploit its potential. Art is a potentially powerful tool, capable of disrupting what M. C. Escher would call the ‘realness’ of space and rendering it in spectacular and sometimes disturbing ways. Art is art because it</text>

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’, and the changes that have come about in the technological literature and discourse since we started thinking about this as a curatorial practice. We’ll start with the physical, the ‘infrastructures’ that we inhabit and which often times are co-constituted with each other, and then move to the virtual, the ‘infrastructures’ that other technologies create and are used in tandem with each other. This will allow us to create a ‘concept of things’ in the temporal resolution of which will enable us to conceive of the things we will find in the future, not in terms of their existing forms but of new virtualities that are created when and if technologies manifest. This concept will enable us to see past the physical and understand the virtualities that are playing out right now in the world. This is a ‘concept of things’ in the temporal resolution of which will enable the spatiality of things to act</text>

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’, and their interrelated but distinct ways of constituting communities, societies and cultures. These ‘infrastructures’ make up what Joseph Stiglitz calls ‘the new capitalist order’. In a Stiglitzian way of putting it, we are all part of a transnational transnational array of industries and economic actors that constitute the new ‘global economy’.1 	Today, we import most of what we produce from all over the world, and our products almost entirely come from the developed world. The reason is simple: most of the goods we produce today are manufactured in China and other developing nations, and international trade with these nations becomes very important in keeping our populations alive and our populations well supplied with goods and services. As a consequence, it is the goods and services that are produced in these cities that are of value in the new ‘economy’; they become essential, and international trade becomes a necessity.</text>

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’. These constitute a category that is often conflated, and which often has very different, though related and intertwined purposes and functions. In this discourse, infrastructures refer to those cities and localities whose development is directly or indirectly dependent on the infrastructures of other cities and regions. They are closely related to the ‘infrastructure’ – the physical and virtual infrastructure of cities – and constitute a category that is often misconstrued or misinterpreted. In fact, infrastructure is frequently misconstrued, or even creates its own contradictions. 	In a recent TED talk, Franny George referred to ‘infrastructure’ as a synonim of ‘public realm’ and ‘public realm’, implying that contemporary urban space is infrastructure, although ‘public realm’ is usually preferred.

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’.

Digital technologies, which increasingly constrain human access, are expected to produce ever-larger quantities of data and data updates at ever-higher speeds and densities. The volume and speed of data processing that can be accessed suggests that large-scale data-processing and analytics may play a part in the production of ever-more immersive virtual or augmented environments. This is not just some dystopian scenario; recent innovations in computer networking, satellite imagery and acceleration often make for truly breathtaking images.

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’, and to consider the curatorial and educational role of such infrastructures in the context of such technologies. In this context, the biennial can contribute to bringing these technologies into the public sphere through research, analysis and documentation, while simultaneously providing an understanding of how to build upon their potentialities and enabling relations between the different sectors of society. 	In the biennial, the curator takes the lead in creating a shared understanding of a topic, bringing disparate perspectives and expertise to bear on an ongoing project. This is done through research-based, critical research that seeks to uncover a topic’s history, which may or may not align with the curator’s own position. This type of research is often done through un-biased, non-commercial means, such as asking leading questions of a community that may not necessarily align with the curator’s own position, soliciting financial contributions from a public or an artistic context. 	The function of the</text>

In this sense, it provides a fresh perspective on an old and persistent problem: how to reconcile the curatorial, aesthetic and educational responsibilities in the same project. It also proposes new curatorial approaches, through research-based, community-based and collaborative approaches. In this sense, it is a hybrid curatorial and educational/artistic curatorial process.

It is time to consider the complex infrastructures that are the products of the digital technologies that we call ‘infrastructures’. These include not only physical infrastructure (infrastructure includes buildings and networks), but also virtual infrastructures ‘created’ by and for the digital society. Virtual infrastructures include not only virtual representations of the past, but also virtual representations of the future. While the virtual is the operative operative paradigm here, the real is only ever partially real. This is exemplified by the virtual reproducibility of the work of art and design done on a micro- and nano-level using algorithms, data and software. 	The virtual replicas do not represent, nor are they confined to, what was originally intended to be reproduced; rather, they reconceive and augment what was originally intended to be reproduced. This is an important distinction to make when considering the work of art and design that is being made today. As biennials, we’re experiencing a moment in which art and design are no longer equated with a fixed template that can only</text>

I’m interested in the ways in which the film (and the media it is part of) attempts to represent the world as if it were located in a particular city. I’m interested in how the city is designed to support or exacerbate the experiences of racialised or marginalised people of colour. I’m interested in the cultural practices that take place during filming, and especially in the moments of silence preceding and during the filming of the film. I’m interested in the ways in which the city is constructed in relation to racialised and marginalised people of colour.  In this context, the way in which the film is made and the way in which it is presented could also be contested.

I’m interested in the ways in which the film presents topics that are of concern to British Muslims, and in particular, to Muslims in Britain. These topics are relevant to our concerns, but they don’t necessarily map into a single position or set of positions. I’m interested in understanding how the representation of Muslims in media, cultural and political contexts can be improved.My interest in the film Arrival stems from the fact that, in the wake of the Paris attacks, the UK is undergoing a public debate about its own vulnerability and responsibility as a result of terrorism. I wanted to know if the themes of the film, which are rooted in notions of belonging, identity, community and destiny, resonate with British Muslims. So I went online and found the subtitles of the film. I selected the scene where Zahra Al Sahlawi, the character played by Amy Adams, is asked whether she believes in ‘hermeticism’ and, in response, her statement</text>

I want to highlight some of the ways in which the film makes use of science and its tools; others will probably interest you too.The film opens with a scene in an old laboratory where Kate Hudson (Amy Adams), played by Amy Lind, investigates the effects of mass migration on an island nation. Lab-like structures are the wrong size for the island’s population, with people crammed together in cramped quarters; outbreaks of disease are rife, and the genetic potential for such an outbreak is over-engineered. A team of scientists led by Prof Claudia Rankine (Sally Hawkins) sets out to investigate the situation, gathering data from a variety of sources including floating islands, satellites, trees and even DNA extracted from the flesh of recently dead animals. The film then cuts to a beach, where a group of scientists lead by Prof John Russell Hstone (Chris Wainwright) conduct a series of experiments in an attempt to find out what lies in store for the island once the waves sub</text>

I’ll cover two topics: the production of trust in media and the politics of immigration, and the role of the press in curating a city’s future.I. Media trust and credibilityThe film Arrival (2017) revolves around a journalist (Ana Laura Lopéz de la Torre) who is kidnapped by a terrorist group on her way to cover a terrorist attack in the city of Buenos Aires. In a distressing scene, the journalist is forced to reveal the name of the group that hired her to work as a reporter, and the place of her origin. Although initially disbelieving, her captors eventually relent and allow her to come home. As a result of this pivotal episode, many Argentines take issue with the role that the media plays in reporting on terrorism and defend the journalists who were kidnapped. In this context, the film’s depiction of the kidnapping is particularly revealing. It allows the audience to see the logic of the government’</text>

I’m interested in the ways in which the film, and its setting, creates the possibility of questioning, of questioning things we’ve believed to be true for a long time.I can think of several reasons why people might be interested in the film. One is that, in the film, we learn about a future that is a lot like the present one: big questions about the future are raised, and questions about how to live together in harmony. The idea that we’re transported to a future where big questions are raised is very pertinent and resonates with people. On an emotional level, the idea that we’re transported to a past when big questions are raised is emotional too. But that’s just setting. There have been other cultural interventions in the past that may have contributed to a deeper level of emotional engagement and understanding. Marc Raicovich’s particular approach to the notion of future anxieties is interesting. He defines the word ‘</text>

I’m interested in how the film is approaching the topic of immigration, because for many people, coming to the United States as an immigrant is the beginning of a story that is very much shaped by the story that is told here. I want to ask, how does the experience of being kidnapped and taken captive in the American dream shape the story told by the protagonist? How does the trauma of being trafficked in the sex industry shape the narrative told by the protagonist? And, finally, how does the trauma of war shape the narratives told by the protagonists? Let’s say the American dream is built on the back of slavery, and that the trauma of slavery is still with us today. Let’s say that in the film, the protagonist is framed as a villain who did terrible things in order to save the world. How does the trauma of slavery shape the trauma of war?Let’s start by thinking about what we can learn from studying the traumas of</text>

I’m interested in how the film comes to consider displacement and migration, and how this affects the notion of place and nationality. In the film, the character Melisandre (Actress) is rescued by a group of other characters led by Sebastian (Musician), who lead them to an island. They discover that the island is in dire need of construction, and that only a small minority of people are able to afford to build houses or run businesses.Melisandre and Sebastian are rescued by a mysterious figure known only as ‘The Stranger’ who wants to take over the world. What we do know is that Melisandre is indeed the rightful leader of the group, and that she intends to use her powers to establish a new world order in Middle-Earth. We also know that The Stranger is actually a monstrous evil wizard who created the creature ‘Erebor’ in order to steal the elven-stone from Lake Gundabad’s Stone of Creation</text>

I’m interested in how the film represents immigration, migration flows, and climate change, but also in what the film makes of this new situation – how it attempts to bring this all together in a way that is accessible to and relevant to the people who make up the film.I want to start by saying that I think that the Sustainable Cities Laboratory is a really interesting place to be, because you start by questioning things you don’t know. You don’t know what a housing crisis looks like in Dublin, you don’t know what a desalination crisis looks like in Dublin, you don’t know what a mega-drought looks like in Dublin. You start by asking questions and coming away with a set of questions that aren’t necessarily the answers to everything.In the Sustainable Cities Laboratory, we’re asking what, if anything, can be done to create a climate that is as comfortable for humanity as possible?

These are questions of location, of cityscapes and their built environments, of information and culture production, and of power and control. I’m interested in how the film interrogates modern urbanity, especially through the character of Max Fisher, who works for the news agency AFP. What we think of as ‘home’ is actually an enormous amount of work – far more of a construction than we realise – and we rarely think of the impact that housing has on communities or the disruption that it causes. In this film, we see how displacement and homelessness are caused by an economy that produces far less value than the goods and services that go into it. As the director Tiziana Terranova says, ‘Where there’s housing, there’s also a displacement of people: what we call ‘affordable housing’ consists of people who cannot find affordable housing.’ In The Resident, she writes: �Being displaced doesn’t have</text>

I’m interested in how this film affects the notion of time and the relation between culture and the media; the impact it has on our conceptions of history and the future; and the possibility that the film may have some influence on policymakers’ thinking about how to allocate scarce public space.While the narrative of Arrival (2017) is very specific, the questions that arise in analysing it are open to many interpretations. For me, the key questions are: what does it mean to be ‘present’ in the now? What does it mean to be ‘present’ in the present? And what does it mean to ‘influence transformational change?’ (referring to the film’s present, but also to cultural practices of change that need to happen in order to create a more ‘transformed’ form of society?).There are a few other films that come to mind as examples of ‘influencing change’</text>

The potential interactions between AI and the arts are also immense. Artists could theoretically interface with systems that monitor and control artistic performance, making performance a fully automated process. This would mean that the interaction between AI and the arts would be seamless and censorship-free. However, this is also a very risky thing to do. First, it would open the floodgates to malicious AI systems, and second, the interaction would become mainstream only at the margins. Art would play second fiddle to techno-utopianism's first mover. This is why in the AI race, the technologists are often seen racing alongside the technophobes and prejudice-ridden dilethans. This is also why in the AI race, the victors often invent mechanisms that cater to the whims of the weaker members of society. For example, in the AI race, the technologist-godlike figure Elon Musk is credited with the concept of electric cars, but in reality he and his ilk only dream of the kind of infrastructure that would allow AI to rule the world.Art and techno-utopianism</text>

This could be through symposia, festivals, art tours, guided or self-guided tours, or even photography. There were also specific requests for works that addressed the event in a more personal way. For example, requests for works that addressed the historical role of AI in visual culture came from a variety of subjects, and included requests for work that addressed the personal impact of AI on artists and the context of AI. The requests were received and considered, and a list of candidates was developed. The projects were then voted on by the membership of the Symposium into one of four broad categories: historical, curatorial, architectural or technical.

In a 2015 study, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated that the global impact of AI would be equivalent to changing the meaning of ‘90 to 99% of the world’s GDP. In an attempt to better understand the extent of this potential, I convened a working group of artists, curators, researchers and educators to explore how the implications of AI might be connected with the arts and cultural sectors. The meeting took place in the film maker Paul McCarthy’s home near to the National Theatre in London. The group included Peter Brook, Director of the National Theatre and former Curator of Works on Paper at the Victoria and Albert Museum; Anne Kübler-Ross, Curator</text>

The Biennial has a long-term research agenda that is driven by a collective of dedicated staff who produce and conduct research projects throughout the year. Their research focuses include the following: understanding of biennials as a global art form; biennial art and cultural production; biennial research and evaluation; and biennial production and analysis. In addition to their own research, these artists and their teams work with museums, galleries, archives, grassroots art organisations, businesses, law firms, PR firms, social scientists and others to collect and analyse cultural resources, collect data and make inferences about cultural outcomes.Artists who regularly collaborate with the Biennial include Ben Whittaker (curator of the Universal) and Ella</text>

This could have potentially far reaching cultural effects. The researchers behind LIDAR visited the Biennial and the Tate Modern and invited artists to develop an environment around the exhibition that engages with art’s place in society. This could mean partnering with other art institutions, or it could mean developing unique collaborative processes with artists to create a separate entity from the biennial and Tate Modern, while maintaining a relationship with the wider art world.In some ways, the researchers behind the project are asking artists to become enablers of a potentially transformative AI. The question is whether the mechanisms enabling this kind of technological creativity are already embedded in the socio-political system and whether or not they can be changed. In other words, what artists can or cannot do with regards to art or those who perform it determines</text>

This is the direction in which the AI is expected to take.Emboldened by the promise of a brighter future, artists seized on the opportunity to explore creative perforations. Choreographer Maya Angelou, for example, used the opportunity to perform a series of holiday songs that combined elements of African languages with elements from Christmas songs. The resulting magic amounted to hundreds of thousands of downloads. The impact of these songs was felt far beyond Africa and was heard on European radar screens. Acts of love – both secular and religious – played a part in the evolution of human culture.Should AI eradicate human error and create a more optimal world, then cultural practices would unfold in unpredictable and unpredictable ways. The main obstacle to this happening today is a lack of information</text>
    <text>an AI curated the exhibition with artistes, curators, and architects who collaborated with the exhibition on a local and a global level. The main objective of the project was to foster an understanding of the technologies and artistic practices of AI, while also asking: what can AI do for us?Artists were invited to contribute to the conversation by creating an environment in which the conversation could happen. The researchers behind LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) visited every corner of the UK and invited artists to create a scene around an imagined Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that detects objects using sound and light. These systems are capable of recognising significant numbers of distinct shapes and sizes, and can distinguish between human and machine languages, among other things. The potential applications of this technology are broad and deep. AI could lead to a reduction in human error, as well as enabling new forms of artistic and curatorial creativity. The potential interactions between AI and the arts are also immense. Artists could theoretically interface with systems that record and analyse art and artefacts, as well as between art and AI, and between the two.Artists were also invited to create engaging and interesting environments around the systems that analyse and predict art. One of the main objectives of the conference was to explore how art can be made more expressive and dynamic through the incorporation of new audio and visual technologies. New media has contributed to a dynamic interaction between artist and audience, which can be understood as a combination of both an artist’s work and live events such as competitions and installations. New media has also brought with it new ways of participating, which can be understood as a combination of both a participatory and curatorial approach. New media has enabled a new form of artistic practice that is not confined to the artist’s usual mediums of performance and discourse. New media has also encouraged a critical discourse on art and the processes involved in producing it, both inside and outside art galleries. The conference brought together leading artistic bodies from diverse fields</text>

This is an incredibly exciting area of research and a frontier that we as artists and artists-in-waiting will need to explore fully.Curatorial engagements with AI have been going on already. That's why it’s so exciting when a new generation of artists develops creative approaches to the systems that are the result of AI; they are able to perceive a potential new form of artistic and curatorial interaction between AI and the arts. This is precisely what happened with the Liverpool Biennial 2016, which was curated by Christine Bentham and accompanied by a series of interactive activities that explored the possibilities of AI in art and culture. One of the activities was an installation entitled The Fourth Wheel that stood outside the Bluecoat gallery in Liverpool as part of the Biennial’s Art and Art’s Social journey.

The collaborative online publication also enabled the art to be delivered in a way that reflected the site’s character – with a capital – through a mode of public transport that linked to the arts education website and the arts education podcast. The site also allowed the site to connect to other resources, including the arts councils of Canada and the Canadian arts institutes. Through a process of user testing, the two sites iterated on the idea of a bilingual arts and culture publication. The two publications became what is now known as the Metro Arts/CADet website and the CADet art site. The user-centred online publication became what is now known as the North Star Arts/CADet. The user-centred arts and culture site was what the artist Adam Szymczyk would later call the ‘leap into existence’ of the two new entities. The new artistic and user-cent</text>

The arts education website drew on the mutual resources of the two sites, as well as the expertise of the artists and the site users. The collaborative online publication provided a platform for the voices of artists to be heard, while the city in its ongoing urban renewal process continued to be rebuilt. In the intervening years, the arts and culture websites evolved into what are now considered ‘platforms’ by their users. In this model, the site is effectively a node in an ecosystem of sharing and exchanging, and the sharing of content is facilitated through the sharing of nodes. This was a tipping point in the early development of the sharing economy: the sharing of urban resources and culture became a new game-changer. While the sharing economy is a new development in many ways (its underlying economics are still quite primitive), it has transformed the sharing of wealth and social power. The sharing of urban resources and culture is no longer confined to those with access to capital or a steady job; the sharing of wealth and social power, then, is a direct consequence of all those who participate in the sharing economy. The sharing economy has democratised the sharing of wealth and social power, but it has also ushered in a new class of</text>

The collaborative online publication provided a platform for the voices of artists to be heard, while also enabling dialogue between the two sites as a means to explore collaborative practices and explore the intersection of art and urbanism. In doing so, it helped to establish a shared language for artists and art to be able to communicate with each other. In doing so, it introduced a new audience to the work and art both in its pages and its culture. The online publication of art and urban development in numerous languages has always been a strategy for the urbanization of emerging economies. In recent years, it has become a strategy for the cultural absorption of the cities. This is especially true in the digital age, where artists and content producers have access to ever larger databases of biographical, political and urban data than ever existed in the sites where an artwork was found. This access to data has led to a new level of urbanization of emerging markets, but also to cultural colonialism and totalitarianism where the data is used to constrain the practices of artistic and cultural citizens. In these conditions, any cultural project is</text>

The collaborative online publication allowed voices to be incorporated into the publication’s design process, while encouraging a dialogue that solicited diverse opinions and perspectives. 	The name of the project came from a ad campaign that ran in the Montreal Gazette in the weeks immediately following the 2001 terror attacks. The ad read: ‘Get Involved’ and ‘Think Local’. The slogan reflected the city’s obvious unity in confronting a common threat. The ad reflected the city’s ambition to ‘become a city again’. The inclusion of a multicultural register of concerns drew attention to the city’s heterogeneity and possible new identities.

The arts education website drew on the mutual resources of the two sites, as well as the expertise of the artists and the site users. The collaborative online publication provided a platform for the voices of artists to be heard, while the museum generation, who were already artists, took over the role of curators, administrators and journalists. The rapid growth of the website coincided with the rapid decline in circulation of the magazine, which coincided with a sharp curatorial initiative that sought to eliminate language as a factor in the production of art. The elimination of grammar as a factor addressed the fact that some readers might identify with the 'language of the arts' – in the sense that they’d like to see art produced in languages that are not tokenised and colonised. The curatorial initiative launched in 2012 with the mission to ‘preserve and build bridges’ between the arts and the social was informed by the need to present an accessible and fascinating publication for a relatively narrow audience. The exhibition format evolved to accommodate a wider range of curators, including the curators who came later. The curatorial initiative was strategically driven by the artist Jimmy Choo, who has a project titled ‘The Curator’ in</text>

The collaborative online publication provided a platform for the voices of artists to be heard, while the hands-on, qualitative journalism project connected the artists with the city’s urban fabric. The collaborative arts publication and its participatory online format allowed the voices of a geographically broad range of Canadians to be brought to the fore, while also inviting in-depth, contextual analysis from a multidisciplinary team of urbanists and urbanographers. The curatorial direction of the arts and culture reporting on the site reflected the site’s historic centre’s tendency towards the present, its enthusiasm for presentism and conformity. The museum was positioned near the city’s core, but with a focus on the past while highlighting the ambitious goals that still need to be met. It was an ideal setting for a possible museum or museum collection, but with its curatorial focus and public gallery missions, it was also a good candidate for a second mens-art store. The site also has a good mix of uses, from a residential one (home to a large residence and community of users</text>

And then, of course, there was the print publication. I’m not sure I had a particularly strong cultural-linguistic orientation, but I think I could have been an artist with a biennial or an exhibitionary budget and a habit of printing books with political, social, or urban messages. I did have a particular love of maps, and in that vein, had an interest in the social. I also loved imagining places and cultures other than Montreal, and wanted to bring that to the table as well. I felt that the mapping project made some connections with the urban context of Montreal, but also with the biennial and historical survey printmaking that was happening at the time. I also didn’t connect the two. I still don’t think I identified with the urban-sculpture camp, but I was open to changing my mind. The fact that it was</text>

The collaborative online publication provided a platform for the voices of artists to be heard, while the hands-on site-based participatory project allowed voices to be organised and participated in. The collaborative online publication and collaborative site-based participatory project exist in a new phase of their development: the biennial. The online publication of a biennial follows on the publication of a poetry journal and is intended to be an accessible and participatory form of art and cultural exchange. It contains original artworks and images from the site and is curated by, in my opinion, the best curator of contemporary art in the world right now, California-based artist Marcel Lesage. The online publication of a poetry journal follows on the publication of a children’s literary journal and is an essential part of the art and culture biennial. It is the canonical voice of the artist, the voice of the reader, the voice of the city. It is a global voice. It speaks to the imperative importance of art being made in communities and is that voice heard by the biennial that it one day</text>

The collaborative online publication provided a platform for the voices of artists to be heard, while enabling a richer exchange of ideas and cultures between the two sites through the sharing of information and culture. What was once a strictly pedagogical publishing platform was transformed into a more cultural producing and user-friendly site. The cooperative ethos that emerged from this process was reciprocated by the two sites in that it encouraged mutual aid and collaboration between artists and site users. For example, the pedagogical aspects of the site were reciprocated by the two arts education web sites. When Nancy and I started the cooperative, the mutual aid and collaboration between users and artists was an integral part of the website design and content development process. The pedagogical aspects of the site were in some cases integrated with the utopian aspects of the utopic digital future envisioned by the media and technologists in charge of creating it. For example, the San Francisco-based media company Apple’s Genius Bar offered a service to artists to access a personalised version of the service through which they could design their artwork, naming it</text>

The collaborative online publication provided a platform for the voices of artists to be heard, while simultaneously offering a site for the voices of artists to be nurtured and empowered. Through a participatory process, we placed an emphasis on nurturing the voices of indigenous peoples, in order to ensure that a more inclusive form of cultural practice could be developed. In doing so, we also invited community artists to collaborate with us in creating a work that would be shared between the two sites, while also supporting the voices of marginalised and exploited communities. The collaborative nature of the process allowed us to generate new modes of cultural expression for the site, while also supporting the growth of knowledge about and within the locality. This model of mutual access to cultural resources and sites enabled us to simultaneously access and participate in the cultural and economic cycles of the city. It also allowed us to observe how the art and cultural resources of the city impacted on the work produced by artists, while allowing for a degree of creativity within the project that was not constrained by the economic conditions, political situations or power structures of the city.

The idea that the biennale is a pastiche of features from ‘the present’ is a feature of the art biennale, where the features of the present are also reproduced. In other words, the biennale is not a pastiche of what is and what should be.3 What is perhaps missing from this equation, however, is imagination. We do not live in an imagined present, and so we do not share the space and time of the contemporary. We do not live in a ‘present’ imagined by curators, artists, writers and others – not even in the arts world. So what does the biennale offer us in exchange for this shared space and time? The answer is that it makes us ‘real’ – it gives us the space and the time to be alive in the here and now. In other words, it is a kind of capital ship, bringing us through the seas of capitalism and making us �</text>

It is this kind of ambiguity and this kind of moving through of narrative structures – this is the kind of ambiguity and this kind of moving through of narrative structures that we still struggle with, and which even the biennial may not always be able to fully inhabit –that contributes to the magic of the biennial, to the magic of its repetition, to the magic of its placement in any particular location, and which in turn contributes to its magic. In this sense, the word ‘biennial’ has a kind of snakebite quality to it, as though the ancient reptilian forms that created it and which it sought to bury alive – that is, the older, snake-like forms that it tried to destroy – are still around, but have somehow been rendered invisible, or at least not visible as often as they should have been.3.

This is partly due to the fact that, while the Biennale has a budget, it does not have the power to dictate what works and what doesn’</text>

The biennial that I designed and co-curated, and that many others have done before me, is a kind of museum that lives and dies on the museum collector’s memory. It is not a museum, in the usual museum sense, but it is a museum on a very particular memory. It is not a museum of ideas, but a museum of feelings. And it is a museum of very particular kinds of feelings. Biennials are collections of particular kinds of feelings. And yet they are also objects of a particular kind of feeling. Collection after collection after collection of art and art’s many different kinds of emotions gather in one place, and this is a very moving and powerful place to be in, especially for someone</text>

One might also ask whether the original mission of the biennale was to be seen as an art gallery, as the biennale today is primarily seen as an exhibitionary venue. I would argue that the original mission of the biennale was to be seen as a kind of temporary art institution, privileged to look back at the past and the future with a kind of visitation. I.e. the mission of the biennale as a cultural tourist attraction should be seen as the unifying mission of the art world in the twenty-first century. In other words, the original mission of the biennale should be seen as an art institution that actively seeks to revisit the past and to create a mode of engagement with the past that goes beyond merely being there. The biennale should actively seek to imagine itself,</text>

In other words, the curatorial function has to be taken seriously, or else it is a kind of self-defeating redundancy. The problem with biennials is that they become part of a larger artefact, part of a narrative that is no longer original and original – even if this is the mission of the original story. For example, the Biennale of Sydney is a ‘legacy’ of the past, but its original mission was to be a ‘front for…? (sic) anaphoric version of itself’.2 Similarly, the Biennale of St Petersburg was originally called ‘the Medieval Biennale’, but as the biennale evolved, its true mission became to be a ‘re-narration of the past’, a kind of echo of the city that it could inhabit in the present. The problem with the Biennale of Sydney, then, is that it is continually reinventing itself, trying to figure out how to live up to the original mission, but doing so at the expense of the original history of the place, its original meaning. In doing so, it is becoming something that is very much like the institution that it is created to supplant, but in doing so it is losing its original character and identity.

Even more fundamentally, the fact that the biennale was founded in London and later in Berlin meant that it could not be ‘a catalyst for change in the city’, as its present mission would suggest.4 Biennials, then, operate at a very low level, but their impact is felt far beyond the city in regions outside the city. The Biennale of Sydney, for example, had the gravitas of a major art museum, but its real mission was to be a ‘legacy’ of the past. At the same time, the fact that the biennale was founded in London and later in Berlin meant that it could not ‘impact the city’ in</text>

There are of course strong anti-biennial voices, but the fact of the matter is that today we live in a biennale that is almost entirely occupied by the needs of human society, and rarely, if ever, considers the past or considers the role it might have in shaping what is and isn’t possible anymore. What might be done with the curatorial role in this sense, which is increasingly common in biennials but is becoming increasingly rare in museums? I think that there is a chance that the museum that is built on research and discovery might one day be able to build a biennale around research and discovery, in such a way that it intermingles with its research, and even engages with its research, in ways</text>

The Cultural Logic of Luxury Ruins. Irit and Peter Herman, trans. Evelyn Staeheli and Steven M. Cohn, Blackwell, Oxford, 1991, p.195.4  This kind of re-narration is familiar to people with a basic knowledge of archaeology, ethnology or history; it is characteristic of the archaeological condition, and the kind of archaeology that will become ever more technologically mediated. The British Museum’s excavations in the Sinai Peninsula in the British Museum vaults in 2012–13, for example, are a good illustration of how the economic logic of archaeological finds can be used to produce a discourse around the past as well as the present.5  The problem with the biennial as such, then, is</text>

A kind of ‘past participle’ is what Raymond Williams meant when he said that the Medieval Biennale was like a ‘soft eraser, or a fresh air fresco’.3 As biennials have become more institutionalised, and as a kind of contemporary museum of the past that is regularly (though unrepresentatively) visited, it is this kind of ‘past participle’ that is often quoted when discussing the Medieval Biennale. But if we begin to read the larger context of the institutionally metered biennial, we begin to see that the original purpose of the biennial was always to offer a kind of temporary exhibition of the past in the present, to house and archive the traces of an artefact in the present (and perhaps to celebrate the fact that the biennials are artefacts, not cultural objects). The impulse behind the biennial is to offer a kind of ‘time-limited’ exhibition of</text>

However, the intense and long-term relationship she had with the community also meant that she didn’t want to become just another artist either. She wanted to be involved in something bigger. So the community came to her, offered to take over the art centre if she became an arts administrator, and she did that. And then the next step was to start working directly with the community.  So, over the years, she would initiate conversations with groups of people who normally only see themselves as stakeholders in the area, such as the residents, community organisers, artists, schoolchildren, and so on. But she would also introduce people to other creative activities such as  	cooking classes,  	rhymes with schools and so on. She would partner with a local non-profit organisation and offer them space and support for projects that they would then lead. She would observe, make connections and learn from their experiences.

She didn’t want to lose the trust of the community, and she certainly didn’t want to become just another artist. However, she also didn’t want to become just another artist either. She wanted to be an artist who could change lives, and she did that in many different ways: by creating opportunities and empowering people, by engaging with the political and social implications of place and culture, by understanding the social relationships between people, and above all by remaining true to her identity as a community activist. She continued to do so, and they remained good friends despite their differences. In fact, I still respect her so much that I am able to work with her and her family. She was an artist who understood complexity. Her work was often absurdist and absurdist, and the fact that she was HIV positive is testament to that. Her activism and commitment to understanding the complexities of the world were two things that I admired in anyone, and I saw both in my work. But understanding the complexities of HIV/AIDS is different from understanding simple physics, or even understanding chemistry.

She developed a very close working relationship with Community Land Trust, an organisation that promotes and manages the interests of the M40 community. In the 1980s and 1990s, Community Land Trust had an important role in changing the face of housing in the district. In the early days, the organisation arranged for artists to come and work on long term leases on the site. It was a creative funding source for artists to come and work locally.  	But the emergence of social housing and the urbanisation of the area, as she saw it, meant that Community Land Trust had to be much more organised and deliberate, much more deliberate that the artist’s studio would allow. And so she began to develop a project management approach, which is still very much an element of her work today. She invited the local community to be part of the journey, to be part of the future of the building. She also developed a project-specificity</text>

I guess what I found most difficult was how to convince her that the system was actually working, and that she could actually produce change. I had to convince her that the system was actually working for the good. She would have to change her ways, and face the consequences. However, in the end she did everything I said she needed to do to become just another artist. She was an artist, and through hard work and commitment she could become something more than just an artist. 	She has to face these things now, in order to fully grasp what she has done, and the system has to give her the tools to engage in these new kinds of change.

Her relationship to the community was fragile at best. She was developing a relationship with the community in order to change the world, but it soon became apparent that the community wasn’t going to let her get away with it. She was severely criticised by the community for daring to undertake a cultural experiment without their knowledge or consent, and she ended up withdrawing from the project.  Her relationship to the community was further complicated by the fact that she had been living in the neighbourhood for several years prior to this, and she had a daughter who was five when she started, making cultural enquiries and so forth.

She became involved in creating an alternative development that would allow the neighbourhood to be part of a larger, more sustainable solution. She had to put in a lot of thought and effort into crafting a plan that would actually work, because once you started implementing things, you didn’t stop. You never quite know when something might be useful, but once you start implementing it, it’s very difficult to un-implement.  	In the end, this all came down to one question: will the neighbourhood be integrated into the new development? If so, will the neighbourhood be a part of the new development? If not, will the neighbourhood be a part of the old? If so, will the neighbourhood become something else? If not, will the neighbourhood remain a part of the same thing? 	She faced these kinds of questions in her head, and</text>

She did quite a bit of travelling herself, and she did it all with the support of the artist’s trust fund. It was a mix of public and private funding. She travelled extensively, and her work was always accompanied by a team of local artists. She performed in a very specific niche, and she had a very particular brand of political and cultural messaging. She was very successful at appealing to the public imagination as much as possible, and at least partly because the art world was captivated by her. She was the Barbra Streisand of visual art.  	She was in many ways a classic artist in her own right, but her main interest in life at the time was political.

But I don’t think she realised how much of her work was actually about building up the trust of the community, and how much was really about flaunting the power of the gallery. She had to be able to read that flaunting was beneficial to the community as a whole, and not just to herself. I think she underestimated the importance of trust, and the kinds of people who would be drawn to her.

I can see why people choose to live here: to work, to play, to come to school every day. I can also see why people choose to come to the Arts Council every two years: to be taken on a guided tour, to meet the artist and learn more about her work, to be taken on an art and culture course, to be taken on an art fair. And I’m sure that these things are good, but at the same time I feel like they are very different from what artists or curators might do. It’s as if the Arts Council was created as a place for the artist to tell her story and for the community to be able to step back and freely let their creativity run</text>

It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews show, the Biennale is able to find new ways of connecting with artists and audiences because of the intimacy and mutual respect that artists build up with one another. In other words, what the Biennale does best is embeds art, creates a shared context and invites artists to inhabit that shared space in meaningful ways.This is precisely what the Biennale did well during the 1990s and early 2000s, and it remains to this day one of the most powerful ways in which the exhibitionary complex is able to connect with the city. The Biennale has a unique vantage point from which to appreciate the power of its artifice: as a social event that embeds art within the social whole, the Biennale simultaneously establishes an art form (the art is intrinsically visual) and gives rise to a collective imagination (the biennalee is a cultural organisation, a visual community).

It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs tells us, the art world can be expected to evolve into something like the biennale. In other words, the art world can and will change, just as surely as any other industry sector.This is the modern biennale. (All images courtesy of the Biennale.)This was the case for Maria Hlavajova, who was first introduced to the art world in the 1990s through the Biennale, through which artists were invited to participate in the exhibitions. She explains that the Biennale then sought to establish a long-term relationship with its local artworld, knowing that a biennale is only ever intended to be a short-term solution to a transient problem. Rather, the Biennale sought to establish a ‘permanent bond’ with the city and its infrastructure, so that artists would return every two years or so to explore the same exhibitionally-selected city. For this reason, the Biennale was</text>

It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews show, art is often seen as a last resort. This is why, as Stojanovićs research shows, when a Biennale does engage with the city, it often locates practices that are deeply embedded in the social fabric of the city and actively engages with those who inhabit those social spaces.Some of what the Biennale does is deeply flawed and naive. But as the Guardian’s research reveals, the real challenge for the Biennale as an organisation is how to confront these deep and often unresolved social questions in a way that is not compromised by a desire to replicate itself and thrive. In other words, the real innovation of the Biennale is what it does in its relatively unregulated space of permanent art installations, temporary exhibitions, and frequent programming, to disturb and disturb ourselves in uneasy ways, making art there and then, and then having art happen elsewhere.This is a programme of programming that has been running since 2012, and</text>

As Maria Hlavajova’s research reveals, artists were already acutely aware that their presence was highly unlikely to be well-received and that, as a result, many artists chose to work elsewhere. But this is precisely why, as Stojanovićs interviews show, the Biennale has always found a way to find new ways of engaging and creating meaning in the contemporary art world. It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews show, the art world has a deeply embedded and collective understanding of its own.‘Thinking about the past, looking backwards to see where art can or cannot take place’ is a core tenet of the Biennale. It’s a way of seeing the world through a socially engaged lens. But it’s also a way to seeing the world through the prism of an artist’s right to a particular project and audience. If the Biennale is to retain its contemporary character and function, it’s imperative that it starts by asking, as the Guardian article so sensibly puts it: ‘Where is Art?’.That question cannot be answered with absolute certainty, but in the end, the answer is always going to be the same: there is no place for art, either present or projected, in a city.

It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews show, art is seen as a last resort, a necessary evil.During the Biennale’s 2014 Santa Monica Museum of Modern Art visit, I came away from the experience feeling less like a museum visitor and more like a museum activist. In the museum, I was part of a team that was constantly asking, ‘What can the museum do?’ This was a unique and inspiring experience, because the museum was able to take a project from the community and put it into a museum form, while the artists were able to reactivate the project from the inside out and put it into their practice. This is an area where the Biennale and the art world can learn from each other and make creative work in the same way that artists and curators routinely do.However, the Biennale and the art world have to work together to achieve projects, and the reason why art institutions are so invested in their collections is that they have to</text>

But this is precisely why, as Stojanovićs interviews show, the Biennale has always found a way to find new ways of engaging and creating meaning in the contemporary art world. It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews also show, the art world is quick to notice when a place does something innovative and new. So, the Biennale, and the place that it supports, can and should do extraordinary things. But this is precisely what contemporary art institutions are doing and are doing increasingly. Stojanović’s interviews of artists, fellow artists and curators reveal a wide range of emotions runningg through the exhibition’s participants. These range from anger to elation to sheer bewilderment. Sometimes, the anger is directed at the systems that are creating contemporary art (Stojanović’s words are a blend of seasoned contemporary artist and curators, as well as curators from the past). But there are deep divisions that need to be addressed, and work such as Stojanović’s, and those that follow, are less about the art as such and more about the contemporary condition that artists are thrust into.

But this is precisely why, as Stojanovićs interviews show, the Biennale has always found a way to find new ways of engaging and creating meaning in the contemporary art world. It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews show, the art world is often deeply embedded in the cultural life of the other (society). In other words, the art world isn’t necessarily embedded in the geographical centre but is frequently embedded in the social and political life of the city. For example, Norman Mailer famously labelled the German cities of the 1980s the ‘graffiti generation’, a reference to the ‘post-ultra-modernist’ wave of artists who came after it. In the 1980s and 1990s, the biennale was always an entry point into the modernist sub-field of postmodernism, which in turn, defined the aesthetics of the post-Fordist period. Mailer was, in fact, a proto-postmodernist (he wrote art was a capitalist productivity and capitalism was the solution to postmodernism). The idea that art should be produced in a capitalist productive society is what Stojanovićs research</text>

It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews show, art is often valued for its social significance – for its place in the social world. If the Biennale were to cease to be, and to become merely another art institution, its artists would have to find other art forms to embed themselves in and because, as the Guardian’s Stojanovićs research shows, that’s unlikely to happen. It’s more the other way around: the Biennale would cease to be an art form and art institutions would form part of a new cultural complex that would be a new kind of urbanisation, a new urbanisation based on knowledge and experience, on knowledge from where art would come.In fact, the whole point of the Biennale is to embed itself in the city and inhabit its places – to be present in places it calls home. And this has always been the case, since the Biennale is itself a ‘form’ rather than a �</text>

It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews show, the tasks of art and activism simultaneously present and demand that artists be present everywhere possible forms of social organisation are being facilitated. As a cultural organisation, the Biennale has a crucial role to play in creating a different kind of understanding of our urban environments and their civic-political contexts. It’s an organisation that, as its name suggests, seeks to replicate the urban experience of the Renaissance, and it’s an organisation that, as its website promises, does just that: creating a ‘reparative and influential cultural practice that responds to the social, economic and urban contexts of the contemporary urban environment’.1. The Biennale as an EventSince its beginnings in 1875, the Biennale has provided a platform for a range of cultural activities, including lectures, performances, films, exhibitions, concerts, debates, and much more.

It’s because, as Stojanovićs research shows, art is often deeply embedded in the social life of the city and because, as Stojanovićs interviews show, artists take the view that, absent an art institution, their work will be performed at a later date in venues that are more like each other.The Biennale has always been aware of its limits and has always been searching for new ways of operating. As its website proclaims, ‘Today, art is more readily accessible in many places than ever before’. But, as the Guardian’s research soon shows, this is only true for a relatively small slice of the urban population: almost half the population live in the larger metropolises around the Biennale, and the rest live in smaller towns and cities elsewhere in the biennale, such as Padua, which is located in the smaller city of Kashgar. The rest live in either the larger city or the smaller town. While the number of visitors has steadily increased throughout its history, it is important to note that in the 21st century fewer than half the people</text>
