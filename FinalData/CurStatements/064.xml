The reason is that, increasingly, information is gathered and exchanged across platforms – social media, mapping, satellite imagery and the Internet of things (smart devices, cars, pipes, wires) – that enable communication across a vast geographical area. This raises the question: what constitutes an ‘event’? In an attempt to answer this question, I turn to the local historian and archivist, David Harvey, who suggests a term that captures both the event and the marker of the social: ‘a gathering, a pattern, a set of characteristics, a set of behaviours, a set of ideas’. As an echo of John Berger’s, but without its connectedness, the term ‘event’ articulates the movement of the collective memory, but also the specific place and time of the gathering.4 While I prefer the term ‘event’ to those such as ‘meme’ or ‘image’ that are more evocative, David points out that the gathering itself is a marker and a source of meaning and identity: it is a ‘marker’ that stands for years, and hence, in turn, stands</text>

The reason is that, increasingly, information is gathered and exchanged across platforms – social media, mapping, satellite imagery and the Internet of things (smart devices, cars, pipes, wires) – that construct knowledge about human behaviour from a vast number of sensors. In this sense, the sharing of information is facilitated through the technologies that create and grow ever bigger, interconnected and diverse collections of data.The explosion of data-collecting drones and car-mounted radars is fundamentally understood to yield new kinds of data-collecting spectacles. Such technologies see photography and still photography as equally valid as satellite imaging, and can therefore gather vast amounts of data on a single point of view. For this reason, photographers are trained to shoot from a distance, avoiding confrontation and potentially enabling the sharing of valuable information. For example, when a photographer takes his or her place in a photograph, the photographer is exposed to a range of variables that are beyond the photographer’s control, including the speed and angle of sound, the state of the air, as well as the angle and speed of the image being taken. As a result, the photographer may be exposed to object noise, flare, reflections and</text>

So while we might wish to think of the 21st century in terms of ‘postcolonial movements’, we actually live in a ‘white supremacist, neo-colonial era’.2  If you turn up to a neo-classical music festival in the UK, you are already culturally colonised. If you turn up to an anti-capitalist protest in Hong Kong, you are already culturally colonised. If you turn up to a Black Lives Matter protest in America, you are already culturally colonised. If you turn up to a Green Moment in Liverpool, you are already culturally colonised. If you turn up to a People’s Park Earth Day protest in New York, you are already culturally colonised.

The reason is that, increasingly, information is gathered and exchanged across platforms – social media, mapping, satellite imagery and the Internet of things (smart devices, cars, pipes, wires) – that create a picture of the world in advance based on pre-determined criteria. Moreover, the complexity of the sharing economy – which involves sharing but also the creation of new forms of labour – makes it difficult to identify and exploit when sharing. As a result, the public is often left holding the bag when faced with a new technology that removes jobs or threatens existing ones, but it is also left with the job of policing what is shared and who has access to it.In an effort to address these problems, a growing number of socially engaged practitioners are turning to blockchain technology to enforce collaborative action between parties – that is, algorithms that detect similarities and differences, decide how to connect, and enforce the integrity of the shared resource – through the use of smart contracts. These smart contracts are executed in a public blockchain that records the outcomes and intentions of interactions among participants, establishing and defending the public ledger. In effect, they are a public ledger that records the actions of all stakeholders, ensuring that actions are</text>

So while the sharing of information is facilitated through platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, it is more critical to look for ways to imagine new modes of sociality that take into account the knowledge that is accumulated as a result of mass media and urbanisation.

She focuses on the past three decades in an attempt to trace the influence of mass media, which she believes has become a dominant force in shaping urban environments. She argues that although cities produce large amounts of waste and materials (including valuable intellectual capital), they also play an essential role in producing social and spatial complexity by virtue of their large size, their intimate relation to one another, and their dependence on one another. The importance of the urban in this process, she maintains, is becoming increasingly unrecogn</text>

The reason is that, increasingly, information is gathered and exchanged across platforms – social media, mapping, satellite imagery and the Internet of things (smart devices, cars, pipes, wires) – that create and facilitate connections between people and things. Therefore, it is not always possible to identify a specific event that triggered an event you were invited to witness. For example, the London Bridge and Tooting bomb hoax may have been technically brilliant, but as soon as the information became public, people stopped caring about such things and started inventing reasons to hate each other.  One solution to this ongoing problem of identity is the growing sector of the private sector that studies, manufactures and contributes to knowledge sharing. This sector is often described as ‘infrastructure’, but it is actually quite subtle and it does not wish to be identified as such. It prefers to be referred to as the Enterprise, and its mission statement includes the following: ‘We build knowledge, not just of the things we understand, but of the things we don’t understand. That is, we build knowledge into infrastructure so that when disasters strike, it is not because of things we have not designed or cannot</text>

But if the events of an event are not taken seriously, or even if they happen to be real, then how are the people who take part in such events to become enfused and enfused enough to go on an event that is not taken as seriously as it is? That is, how are the values of the local to be shared with the values of globalized social media?The events of the London Bridge and Tooting bomb hoax may have been fabricated, but their effects are nonetheless felt in the borough. The Borough of Tooting, which encompasses parts of London, was selected as a site for the redevelopment of Tottenham Court Road, which is bisected by the Thames River and provides access to part of the bank of the river. This development will create 180 new homes for semi-detached owners and scramble the local community of around 2,000 people into new homes around new restaurants, shops and cultural venues.

Yet despite these new modes of access and consumption, the sharing of information remains elusive. This is partly due to the presence of mass media and social media that proliferate globally, but also to the fact that, increasingly, information is prioritised over information-gathering. As a result, it is not always possible to identify the events that triggered an event you were invited to witness. For example, in the London Bridge and Tooting bomb hoax, the public was slow to identify the people responsible, despite the fact that they had access to photos and video evidence that proved conclusively that the 22nd London Bridge and Tooting Community Centre was a criminal enterprise. The reason is that, increasingly, information is gathered and exchanged across platforms – social media, mapping, satellite imagery and the Internet of things (smart devices, cars, pipes, wires) – that facilitate and facilitate information in myriad ways. As a result, it is nearly impossible to draw a clear line between what is socially imagined as possible and actually happening. Inventing the Cure 	In 1798, Étienne Balibar proposed that there is a cure to malignant information: create environments in which the transmission of infectious diseases can be prevented. Inventing the Cure was written and first published in 1799, more than a century before Thomas Jefferson ­–‑–‑ known as Jefferson from Jefferson Davis to Jefferson Antoine Dubuffet to simply Jefferson from Paris to begin with. Yet today we still lack any truly effective treatments for a host of infectious diseases, from malaria to HIV/AIDS. Why are people unable to perceive that there are effective treatments available? One possibility is that the social costs and benefits of de-emphasising transmission remain. In addition, it may be that the social costs and benefits of de-emphasising transmission are not shared equally.</text>

But the sharing of information is not always voluntary. vested rights : the ability to share resources, perform actions or engage in ‘mores’

Much has been written about the sharing economy, but few understand its true potential. Sharing economy platforms permit individuals to share resources and engage in ‘mores’ – sharing, exchange and creativity. The sharing of money, property, houses, cars, homes, cars, homes – even houses – allows individuals and communities to co-exist peacefully and harmoniously. Sharing is empowering, and in its purest form, creating. However, sharing is only part of the equation when it comes to sharing. Cooperation and collaboration are necessary to achieve truly shared outcomes, and sharing is also essential in achieving shared prosperity. As sharing platforms proliferate, so do their capacities to transform everyday life, creating ever larger and more complex new worlds for us to inhabit, and to occasionally to escape to.  	The sharing</text>

These connectors are what make our present world possible, but they also create the possibility of new worlds. In other words, the world as we inhabit it may be caused by factors beyond our control – including, perhaps, the actions of intelligent devices.This is the frame from ‘The Social Life of a Capitalist City’, by Njabulo S. Ndebele, published in the African Journal of Political Culture in 2007. It is a powerful indictment of the way in which African cities are governed and how the economic logic of urbanisation contributes to fuelling the narrative of urban development across the continent. It is a powerful reminder that, throughout much of that history, the African cities that emerged out of the economic crisis have often been at odds with one another.

Surveying is a natural extension of the site, capturing and mapping the urban environment in and around Doha. The Biennale has been surveying the area regularly for several years now, and has developed a natural resource-based surveying system that collects data about the area and the buildings that are part of the Biennale. The system collects data on buildings, infrastructure, public art and much more. This kind of in-depth surveying is normally done for scientific or engineering purposes, but with the Biennale, the local residents and artists take over the system and begin to make it useful, making it useful for others as well. This kind of collaborative, democratic self-improvement happens naturally within the Biennale, but as a site for art and community it challenges expectations and professionalism-at-large. </text>

As part of the project, participants will have the opportunity to work directly with local communities through a project called `Smart Dubai Initiative’. This initiative is a response to the fact that most of the buildings in the city are over 1,000 years old and lack maintenance. It was conceived as a research project, and the results will be presented in a special exhibition as part of the Dubai Biennale, where they will be remembered and discussed. 	The role of the Biennale in the future urban landscape may well be played by individuals with a particular set of skills and analytical approach.

The selection was made up of twenty-five artists selected from a shortlist of seventy-five. The artists were asked to create spaces that recall the spatial relations of the past but also present, in an attempt to capture the urgency and spatial relations of the present. The choices included: direct contact with the historical context of the Venice Biennale through Sonja Kuftinek’s excavations in the streets of Venice; works that explore the connection between architecture and the environment (sculpture, landscape, architecture); works that utilise digital media to connect the past with the present (pictures, videos, songs); and last but not least, curatorial actions that make the spatial relations of the past visible alongside the relations of the present. The choices were then compared to the expectations of the biennalee, its partner organisation, and the museum. The choice of twenty-five</text>

The space is a fitting subject for the project, since it is a living exemplar of the contemporary art form – a composite of contemporary art and antiquities gathered together for a single occasion, often with surprising traces of the past. The project has tapped into the museum’s curatorial cycle, while the curator continues to lead the biennalee. The biennalee, itself, presents a complex set of interrelated encounters. Its diverse series of visits, offers the opportunity to explore a city from different points of view. For Venice, the city is a collection of its inhabitants. For the Biennale, the city is a collection of objects collected and arranged for a single purpose. The museums, with their collections, collections, collections, collections, and the ever present assortment of displays, are a large part of this double identity. The collection, its collection, its collection, is the city. The collection and display are the city</text>

The exhibition was presented in the old style of art-historical photography that captured the social world of the biennalee, but in the new style of art as travel photography. I was invited to participate in a research project at the Max Planck Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin, that sought to understand the role that biennials may play in contemporary art today, and how they may have played earlier in their histories.

The idea of stack and unpack was first proposed by English architect and urbanist Thomas Heatherwick, and is derived from his book Landscape architecture from 1908–1945 (University of Chicago Press, 1985). It was also inspired by the stack of newspapers that came with the ‘first post from an E.P.C. [Electric Power Research Laboratory] mailer announcing an upcoming power plant’, which in turn, was inspired by an idea from paleo-astronomy that the solar plexus was a perfect stack of stacked up solar panels.

[2] The Biennale’s website describes the project as follows:&quot;The Venice Biennale is an international art-historical and cultural journey into the city of the Renaissance, where art and art are the objects of exchange, and the very being of the artist and her art form is reduced to the exchange of her name and image.“‘Through the exhibition, the Biennale seeks to tell the story of the city and its arts’ active part in the history of humanity. It is a story that is as captivating for the observer as it is for the knowing.’[3] The exhibition was curated as part</text>

At the same time, the biennalee and the biennalee merge their disparate works, creating a shared experience of the city. Some might call this ‘underwater urbanism’. It is an approach to the city that seeks to capture its narrative through a of its elements, while simultaneously stimulating a collective imagination with imaginative material and symbolic means. It is an artistic synthesis that draws on the museum and the biennalee’s collections and current exhibition programs to tell a city’s urban story. It is a space for a collective imagination to be formed through a shared experience.  The exhibition was curated in collaboration with the Frank Gehry Foundation and the Italian Council for Cultural Relations, and the Venice Biennalee was supported by the Italian Government’s Cultural Affairs Ministry, the Italian Council for Scientific Research, the European Commission and the Italian Council for Science</text>

The exhibition was organized as an immersive multimedia experience, with text and images that projected directly onto the Venice Biennale site, as well as other locations in the Biennale, and invited questions and comments from the audience. As a result, the exhibition became both a museum exhibit and a ‘living museum’, actively preserving the biennale’s original mission, but also questioning and questioning the museum as an institution, as the exhibition proceeded. In this sense, it fulfilled two functions in the biennale’s portfolio: preserving the original mission of the biennale as an event in Venice, and questioning how the biennalee could be more of a museum. It invited art to be preserved, and it invited the preservation of that art to take place alongside the preservation of the biennale’s own historical mission, but at the</text>

Another dimension for an artistic or curatorial curatorial intervention is provided by the curator or curator’s audience. For instance, the performance of a work might be experienced as a curatorial intervention, since the audience is the point of entry into the museum or gallery (since the work is not viewable outside of the context of the gallery or museum). The audience is the site of significances and experiences that are specific to the work and thus can influence what is and is not seen. 	Another possibility for an artistic or curatorial curatorial intervention is provided by the visitor. The visitor is the point of entry into the museum or gallery where the experience of the museum is created (since the museum is not viewable without the visitor). So, the museum becomes a site for the encounter and significances of which the visitor is the point of arrival. The museum becomes a place of transience, in which the visitor is constantly confronted with new and different forms of historical and contemporary art, and thus</text>

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another aspect of the ‘public sphere’ described above is the promotion of civic engagement and participation as a public good. Public engagement generates public knowledge, which in turn generates public action. Creative action draws upon the collective knowledge of diverse stakeholders in the city, including citizens, professionals, artists, academics, citizens, stakeholders and others. Creative publics then seek to understand and address diverse modes of participation, including their political, economic and civic outcomes. Creative practitioners then seek to translate diverse publics into engaged and engaged communities through collaborative processes that seek to discover common ground, develop new solutions and identify new ways of interacting. 	‘Leveraging the potential of multidisciplinary art and curatorial practice to address pressing social and cultural challenges of our time, the Biennale sought to develop innovative ways of engaging all segments of the population, irrespective of their socio-economic circumstances, political allegiance or geographical positions. It is important to stress that the exhibitionary form is not limited to museums, art</text>

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another aspect of the biennial form that could be considered is the use of new curatorial and art educational strategies to encourage a more open exchange of ideas and information between art practitioners, curators, researchers and artists. For instance, the publication of a new artistic practice at the Tate Modern might result in a lecture or workshop delivered at a museum, art school, art society or other art institution, attended by a curated audience, with or without formal training, presenting an alternative perspective or opening a new way of thinking about an art practice. New curatorial actions and strategies might call for the production of a 'test-tube' of sorts, a collection of work produced in consultation with researchers at the Tate Modern, in order to encourage a deeper level of participation from visitors to the museum, school, or institution. 	Another area ripe for the development of a biennial could be the production of ‘living monuments’, monuments to an art practice or a culture. A monument to an art practice</text>

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another dimension to the exhibitionary form is the curatorial action itself, which could be conceptualised as a staged process or event. 	The curatorial action could be staged as a mini-exhibition, an episodic series, or as a live-action programme. 	Generally speaking, there are two main types of biennials: those that occur on a regular basis and those that occur infrequently or only intermittently. 	A biennial is a ‘regular’ exhibitionary form that has recently become rarer and rarer. It was once every two years at the Venice Biennale Museum and the Japanese Art Biennale (Tokyo, Japan; 2016–2019) and is now happening less than once a year at the Taiwan’s Taipei Biennale, Taiwan; biennials at the New York and Venice Biennales; and biennials at the Hong Kong and North Korean biennials.

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another aspect of biennials that is of increasing relevance in our age of information and hypermedia is the growing of their collections and the exchange of collections. There are currently over 6,500 art collections in existence and over 3,000 museums with over 2,000 individual collection plans. Although this number includes cultural items, such as objects of art or music, the collection dynamic shifts towards those objects that serve as a form of exchange and a store of value, such as food or clothing. Over the past decade, the number of individuals creating and maintaining a collection has outpaced the number of museums, which has forced many curators to create new collections or archives. This dynamic often leads to a repetition of the same publishing and museuming practices, with the same curatorial approach to each new artifact of value generated. The collection would potentially be seen as a kind of metainterface – an interface between arts and commerce – and a possible new curatorial paradigm for the art, architecture and design presented in</text>

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another aspect to be addressed in the journal is the social. The journal would publish additional curatorial actions and curatorial moves that would allow the public to know what is happening in the city, both inside and outside the building. In the case of a planned art academy, an art institution or any other type of curatorial institution, the knowledge and engagement would come through the actions and narratives provided by the journal. The journal would publish the latest news, observations, recommendations, proposals and other curatorial information in a publicly visible location. It would also publish curatorial actions and curatorial moves that are not necessarily connected to news or observations, but that can nonetheless be seen as part of a systemically generated, ongoing and sometimes subversive process. 	The form of the journal would evolve, too. Assembled by a curatorial committee comprising researchers from the Artistic department, the architecture and urban design department, the newspaper department, the planning and development department, the legal department, and the accountants,</text>

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another aspect of the biennial format is the growing function of curatorial residence. As the number of exhibitions has increased, the number living and working in curatorial positions has also increased. This trend is particularly evident in the art world; in 2013 alone, the biennials became more widely seen as the pre-eminent forms of contemporary art access in a globalised, post-Twitter world. In an increasingly urbanised world with increasingly dispersed urban populations, the biennial is the single most visible and representative form of cultural exchange in the city. It is a conspicuous cultural commodity, a ritualised encounter for art lovers to document the art’s everyday life in a city, and it is a form of cultural capital to be found in a city. 	But in the current globalised world of the biennial, the biennial is dwarfed by the museum, which has rapidly expanded its exhibitionary form into an art form. The biennial is a transient cultural phenomenon with very specific</text>

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another aspect of the biennial that is increasingly relevant is the increasing number of art institutions and galleries of various kinds capitalising on the reputation of the museum as a venue for their exhibitions and programming. Gallery collections, especially those housed in cities, are the primary venue for such programmes, but collections from any institution is welcome, as is the case with curatorial appointments. Gallery collections, once almost exclusively represented at major museums and the archive, are becoming increasingly visible and data-driven, and this is further emphasized in the digitised collections that are the offspring of the biennial. The biennial is the ultimate venue for this data intensive exhibitionary form, and the increasing digitisation of art history and cultural resources. Gallery collections, including those housed in museums, are particularly vulnerable to this changing exhibitionary context. Gallery collections that are established and actively used are particularly at risk, as is evident from the widespread circulation of art materials online and in the proliferation of online art services. The proliferation of online art services and</text>

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another action that could be taken with the full authority, if not all of the necessary partners, is the building of a biennial around the Brooklyn Museum of Art, which has been exploring the possibility of a biennial stretching back to the 1950s. The Brooklyn Museum of Art’s proposal has been put on hold while a new leadership team develops a new exhibitionary model for the museum. If implemented, this new exhibitionary model would create a parallel to the history-making that the Brooklyn Museum of Art began with its 2003 Biennale of New Art, but would also place an increased emphasis on the work of the museum’s curatorial and research communities. It is likely that the new exhibitionary model would place an even greater emphasis on the work of the museum’s curatorial and research communities, with some curatorial actions taking on a collaborative or collaborative approach with artists, curators and researchers. 	It is also possible that the new exhibitionary model would place an even</text>

In this regard, the exhibitionary form would be extended to include research-based and archival curatorial actions, drawing upon the existing art curatorial toolkit and the new cultural system theory to understand and address the political, economic and social dimensions of contemporary urbanisation. 	Another curatorial action could result from an exhibitionary format, in that it would draw upon the research and archival collections of the Museum of Modern Art in the US, and on the collections of Leeds and Liverpool Biennial, UK. Such an exhibitionary format would also permit the collection to be incorporated into the curatorial thinking and representational mission of the Museum of Modern Art, while remaining distinct from museum-level curatorial actions and processes. Such an arrangement would enable the curatorial action to take elements of this collection and weave them into a larger narrative or narrative structure that operates independently of the collection. 	Such a narrative could emphasize the importance and borrow from the collections of artists, historians and journalists with a particular focus on those with a direct or immediate relationship to the current issues, controversies and issues of the city. It could also foster a relationship between the curatorial and the news cycle, so as to create a virtual media gap closing in on the actual gap. 	Such a narrative could</text>

These studies often arise as a result of the direct intervention of arts organisations into the often mired development process, such as when the UK’s Arts Council established a project in the 1980s to revitalise the Brick Lane area in London after years of wastage and neglect. While the arts organisations that emerged from the block grant process in the 1990s have had a significant impact on the city’s cultural landscape, it is important to note that many of these same organisations that were initially sceptical of the arts performing a role in a sustainable way in the 1980s have since come out strongly in favour of the arts organisations performing a role in all spheres of civic life. 	Small wonder, then, that the Arts Council, having recently been re-established as a co-operative new art gallery organisation, is currently discussing the possibility of creating a new arts organisation, or that the former Block Grant might wish to create a new Block Grant, if the other is no longer</text>

While it is true that in many cases, such projects can be characterised by an obsession with the future or an urgent need to repair or rebuild infrastructure, there is a growing body of research that increasingly characterises them as instrumental in the pursuit of socially and environmentally sustainable development. 	And while in some cases, such as the New York City programme that urbanists started in the 1970s, regeneration seems like a necessary by-product of new economic and urban growth, in others, like Liverpool, it is a tool for the social and economic regeneration of the city at large. 	In the context of urbanisation in general, regeneration refers to the process of creating new urban space and a process of its management. It is a process whereby a new (urbanising) urban space is created through research and development into new uses for old places, and a process of its recycling of resources. It is a process that in many cases is quite automatic, enabling rapid growth and new uses without any particular intention or management capabilities. 	However, while the focus of such initiatives has tended to be on the people or organisations that implement the programmes, research centres and so forth, neglect has been much more predominant.

Urban-research-based approaches to regeneration might be seen as being at an inflection point, in that the fixation on the immediate is starting to wear thin. The protagonists in these works are typically drawn from the urban-research community and their research institutions, but there is growing recognition that this is an extremely short-sighted approach to thinking about how infrastructure should be organised in the city. 	For example, the bio-industrial complex was originally conceived as a mechanism to produce and exploit raw materials, mainly fossil fuels, as raw materials were gathered from the polluted sites of activity. Today, such methods are applied in the context of the biennale itself, in which raw materials are systematically pulled from the landscape in an endless loop. New York’s Central Park, which for decades housed one of the largest oil reserves in the United States, is a case in point. Originally established as a wildlife refuge and national historic site, the park is increasingly being used as a site for</text>

One of the most significant and influential books on this subject is Environmental Scarcity: The End of Oil and the Rise of Creative Destruction by Bernard Stiegler, Daniel Coleman and others. It is the latest in a trilogy of works that began with The End of Oil and Fossil Fuels: The End of Catastrophes and the Rise of Creative Destruction in 2004.1 The End of Oil and its many manifestations is the subject of numerous books, documentaries and performances, as well as numerous grassroots and nongovernmental campaigns. The recent Netflix documentary series  	Making the End of Oil on the end of oil and the benefits of our reliance on it is a perfect example of a socially engaged work that is no longer tied to an oil company. It shows that there are other forms of economic and social production that can be developed without the use of fossil fuels and that social and ecological change can be brought about through work within non-profit organisations. </text>

This growing research draws upon a number of disciplines, including urban studies, urban and regional studies, architecture, landscape architecture, urban theory, political economy, and related fields, and urban and regional forms of media. It also exposes urban problems from a number of different perspectives, and proposes solutions that are not confined to the immediate concern of the city’s inhabitants. For instance, in the age of Google-driven city regeneration schemes, it is important that urban problems are examined and addressed in a multi-disciplinary way, and not confined to the narrow confines of a single discipline. It is also imperative that such an approach is taken in a city that is not solely reliant on one particular set of professions or professions categories. 	In fact, it is often claimed that in a relatively exclusive set of cities, such as New York and London, the pursuit of information technologies is the leading cause of city growth, and that this is a pre-requisite for subsequent cities to be populated and</text>

Policy-makers, local and national, need to pay more attention to the kinds of contextual information that research-based projects are bringing to bear on their decisions and actions. The kinds of art-making, local and global that is enabling new forms of social and political change are enabling research-based art to play a more significant role in this process. Research-based art has a unique place in our desire to know and understand. It is a right, a set of rights, a set of responsibilities. It is not some abstract concept, it is not some ‘given’, it is not something that is given or expected to be given. It is an act of faith, a way of life, and it is a source of wonder, delight and sometimes pain. 	But, just as importantly, it is a source of vulnerability, vulnerability that can be taken advantage of.

Local artists, community organisers and designers were active in the 1970s and 1980s, and continue to be creative practitioners, innovators, and educators. While their efforts were often thwarted by powerful governmental and corporate interests, their work has often been influential in changing perceptions and in inspiring action. The current biennial format and the interactive media of its content is a direct result of the work of artists and activists who between 1970 and 1980 developed a local, national and international following through direct action and in-depth documentation. 	In the early 1970s, artists such as Mumia Abu Jamal, Tayvon Froese, Marianne Moore, Wendy Harpe, Mary Turner and many others engaged with the contemporary predicament of the African diaspora by staging intensive long-term ‘recreational’ activities in communities all over the United States, including in communities of colour. Their writings and performances continue to generate fresh perspectives and</text>

These days, this is generally understood as a generally shared and de-prioritised interest in infrastructure and urbanisation. 	So, in summary, our urban-research-based model recognises the importance of the local in the establishment of the city and its politics, but also the emergent importance of the ‘regeneration’ that emerges from the city’s decaying infrastructure. The need to form local ‘representatives’ and forge links with other localities arises, and is often used by the state to take control of ‘public space’, to repurpose and redistribute the city’s resources and in urban-deregulation projects, such as those led by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2000-2005), as well as by wealthy corporate interests.

The new dynamic of collaborative research-intensive projects with artists and the arts-policy makers, curators and artists themselves, was introduced. The project was part of a new generation of artists who were more open to engaging with other kinds of artists, engaging with the politics and complexities of local community arts projects, and emerging from this process with creative approaches to artistic production and public engagement. These artists and their curators were encouraged to experiment with new approaches to art projects, engaging audiences through storytelling, archiving, narration, production, performance, and curation in hitherto underground art forms, such as puppetry, haute couture, street theatre and performance, greeting cards, street performances and virtual tours. The project brought together artists, designers, writers and community organisers to consider how art could be produced, hosted, curated and executed in a way that actively engages people’s imaginations and politics.

The new dynamic of collaborative research-intensive projects with artists and arts institutions took root in the project, which soon became a locus of exchange between the local and the global arts communities. The project’s multi-disciplinary nature helped it to present its points of view across a range of stakeholders and audiences. For example, the discussions on the land use, culture and regeneration of the Port of Christchurch and the Port of Waitemata brought together researchers from Christchurch University, Otago Art Gallery, Pacific Art Gallery, and the Museum of Art and Design. Together they presented multiple perspectives on the challenges and opportunities of re-constituting a major art institution in Christchurch. And, as part of the postgraduate programme in Cultural Studies, the artists and curators working on the project were able to access the expertise and networks of cultural and art historians and legal scholars to build new strategies and tactics for engaging audiences outside of the art institution.Excerpt from ‘Cultural Capital of the Future?’, by Nico Hämäl</text>

The AHRC was established in 1887, and its mission is to promote a national heritage by encouraging the sharing and exchange of cultural and historic resources. The AHRC has a historical collection of more than 20,000 objects, some of which are in great demand, due to their provenance: in the current economic climate, they are a necessity for many communities.

The new dynamic of collaborative research-intensive projects with artists and venues in the city really helped to set the project apart from the older, more institutionalised forms of cultural organising.In addition to the usual curatorial agenda, the Postmedia team also set up a social and collaborative agenda through social outlets such as lectures, performances, meetings, free period, film-making and 'liking' online communities. The project received great response from the public, but also great insights from the curators, who allowed the public to shape the project’s direction and approach. These types of curatorial interaction are very valuable in influencing cultural change, and the insights they produce can significantly shape how cultural resources are used and consumed in a city. For example, the collaborative research process between artists, curators, researchers and the local community that resulted in the creation of the Apis project allowed the public to shape the project’s use of space, and the practices around how to distribute art and culture.

The new dynamic of collaborative research-intensive projects with artists and communities took root in the project, as new forms of interaction emerged between the researcher and the people who created the art, culture, or heritage. The project was part of the DH/PH project ‘Postmedia’ (2012-2017) that established a new generation of artists as post-exhibition artists, and explored the role of the biennale in creating new artistic forms through research, writing, and experiential activities. The collaborative research process, which harnessed collaborative learning as a modus operandi, was developed through a multi-year, multi-edition programme of research-intensive projects, which required artists, curators, artists' collective members and others with creative skills to participate in a collaborative, multi-disciplinary, multi-edition process through which new creative forms could be formed. Detached from the politics of the museum and the politics of the city, the projects were designed to be accessible to those unable to access art or be transported to worlds beyond the museum walls</text>

The new dynamic of collaborative research-intensive projects with artists and curators from around the world was complemented by an entirely new curatorial approach. This multi-disciplinary curatorial approach incorporated research from a number of disciplines, including art, history, archival research, architecture, media, design, media and performance, as well as literature, media and performance. The project was also supported by the New Zealand Arts Council, and the New Zealand Museum’s Art and Exhibition Research Centre, as partners in a new multi-year, worldwide programme of projects exploring art and art history.The project was led by Anne Kuttner of the Museum of Contemporary Art, with Joan Roughgut of the New Media Arts Project and Jack Burnham of the Institute for Art and Media, London, UK.

The new dynamic of collaborative research-intensive projects with artists and curators from a range of disciplines, encouraged a new generation of artists and creative practitioners to explore new situations and engage with old, old ways of doing things. The project received a special mention for its innovative and powerful approach to the new medium of social media, which engaged a wider public and connected people directly through a public conversation.

The new dynamic of collaborative research-intensive projects with artists and curators across the globe was designed to support the collaborative work of art-historical and archival research, and to support the work of those engaged in creating online publics through which new knowledge is generated and new ways of understanding are developed. In this new landscape of sharing, new knowledge is created through the sharing of different forms of it, both old and new – knowledge that inevitably has to pass through different modes of interaction and transmission in order to reach new people and make new connections. For many of us, this means learning how to make some things easier for others, whether that’s bettering the lives of people with disabilities through better tools, activities or just plain better working conditions; or making it easier for people to come to see art by artists in ways not provided by the art gallery; or making it easier for people to access knowledge through better documentation; or making it easier for communities to share best practices through better peer review mechanisms; or making it easier for people to discover art</text>

They reflect the politics of contingency, the politics of division, the politics of the contingency of global resources.  In a famous line from Capital, Marx writes: ‘The contradiction – which characterises all commodity forms – runs counter to the tendency of capital to expand and to absorb (read: fill up) ever more of the world into its pockets.’[10] ‘Every commodity form turns into ‘capital’ when the means of production become accessible to ever greater numbers of people.’[11] ‘When money becomes ‘domestically useful for production purposes only, rather than representing an actual (and expanding) transfer of wealth from the hands of the working class to the hands of a centralized state’, Marx wonders why money – which, by its very nature, seeks to cover all forms of life with a single transparent unit – turns out to be such a poor store of wealth.  To grasp the full extent of this failure, we need to look more deeply into the systems that shape our everyday commodities. We need to know what Marx means when he calls them �</text>

They reflect the politics of contingency, the politics of division, the politics of the contingency of global resources.  In a famous 1936 essay entitled ‘Conservation and Materialism’, French logician Christophe Blanchard draws our attention to the fact that the logic of accumulation depends on the circulation of commodities. These are the materials that enable the economy to be sustained – the objects that give the appearance of permanence to the system that designates them as commodities. Materialism depends on the circulation of images of things, objects and ideas – images of the things, images of images and images of the things. Blanchard’s logic of conservation of images of the world as images of things dictates that if images of things become scarce, then images of images of images of things will have to be produced in order to fill the voids that a low oil and commodity economy leaves behind.‘Animated maps of the world are produced in large part because images of images are cheap and images of images are ubiquitous.’[10]  And yet ‘materialism’ doesn’t</text>

In a famous 1932 essay entitled ‘Conservation and Materialism – or, Economic and Logistical Causes of the Cultural Terrain – Paul Ricoeur reflects on the entwined histories of art and commerce that result from the inescapable contradictions of capitalism. He begins by tracing the emergence of new economic forms that would later be called ‘materialism’ and, more significantly, the materialism of the New Economy. Later he develops these causes and effects into the politics of ecological destruction that continue to plague us to this very day.

They reflect the politics of contingency, the politics of division, the politics of the contingency of global resources.  In a famous 1936 essay, Damon Taylor frames the contingency of global resources as the politics of possibility. ‘The tendency towards ever greater specialization and consumption […] pushes many social groups to the edge of crisis’. In the wake of this tendency, social groups are often forced to the breaking point – to crisis points – as resource scarcity and poverty become acute.’[10] Or to be more specific, the pace of change associated with it. And here we can move from the case of the nomadic whale to the tracking and sensorium of the future urbanist.  A nomadic whale is an animal with a daily commute of roughly 1,000 km (600 mi) – traveling from north to south across the ocean. It’s possible that the sensorium of the future urbanist will be able to accomplish the same distance between Shanghai and Beijing in a day, but the sensorium of the nomadic whale will have to do much better.

In a famous 1946 essay ‘Consumption, or Crisis of Conscience’, philosopher Henri Lefebvre lays out the political economy of contingency in great detail. Consensus, or what he calls ‘a consensus of opinion’, is defined as ‘the collective opinion of a community of opinion-forming social beings – universally held to be correct by a majority of human beings on a given day’. Thus, the Consensus of opinion – or what he calls ‘the common opinion – has political effects beyond the confines of the site where it is expressed … [and] beyond the site of its production, that is, of facts and figures, which are the site of political struggle.’[10] And this political-economic-terrestrial frame of reference for contingency is what Lefebvre is referring to.  And yet, as we have seen, the politics of contingency are complex and dynamic. The question of who counts as human and who is not human</text>

In a famous 1944 essay ‘On Precipitation’, Joseph Conrad imagined a landscape so beautiful and picturesque that the sea would render the land ‘immaculate and […] almost angel-like’, whereupon, after encountering the elements, ‘the sifted earth would be swept into the sky and made to look like diamonds’. How to Know About Climate Change  To understand climate change in greater detail, it is necessary to understand what is meant by ‘global warming’. It is this broader meaning that has led to the observed and projected increase in mean global temperatures over the past fifty years. The ocean absorbs and dissipates heat rapidly, contributing to the observed and projected increase in sea levels. Therefore, the ocean ‘has a statistical chance of adding 441 million barrels of oil per day (bbl/day) to global supplies of oil, while a potential 642,000 barrels per day (qtr/day) of oil could be produced from</text>

In a famous 1968 essay on the concept of contingency, the Scottish mathematician Murray Gell-Mann frames the contingency of a world as a kind of mathematical equation: assuming (predictably) that the future is a set of numbers, and that numbers represent ‘stuff’ that can be made into objects and put into place as tools for the management of space and time. Gell-Mann’s work is an elaborate kind of mathematical anthropology, taking up much of his time. It’s an immense work of metaphysics, mapping the properties of matter, energy and human behaviour as relations between humans and the environment. It’s an enormous work of mathematics, building on the foundations of geometry and statistics. But in the larger scheme of things, it’s primarily about contingency – about what can and cannot be done in the world because the future is unpredictable. When applied to a real world, it’s a kind of mathematical formula that tells you when something can</text>

In a famous passage from Thomas Malthus’s Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith writes: Smith then pointed out that the great misfortune of large numbers of people is that they must constantly move to find something to consume. ‘The poor,&quot; he added, ‘have this continual need, which new comers add to their list of grievances: to be able to afford a burger, a pair of shoes, or even a tin of chewing gum is a new addition to the list of  	wishes of the old’.  Smith then proposes a solution: ‘The poor should own the means of production.’[10]  He proposes a program of collectivism – the politics of distribution of wealth – in which people acquire political rights through the redistribution of wealth.  Smith also proposes a form of economic nationalism – the politics of distribution of wealth and politics of consumption – that would see the establishment of a People’s Bank to oversee the bank’s lending activities</text>

In a famous phrase from John Nash’s Discourse on the Beautiful City, Walter Benjamin noted that the task of imagining a just world was more difficult than constructing it – more so, in fact, since the imagined beauty of a given city depended on so many other factors, including the existing order of global cities.[10]  The Discourse on the Beautiful City thus narrates the politics of contingency, the politics of displacement, and the politics of the contingency of resources – framing the appearance of aesthetic beauty in particular terms. It is a discourse that, at the same time, questions the ontological validity of such beauty and the possibility of such beauty in the first place. It tells stories that capture the politics of contingency, the politics of beauty, and the politics of beauty that inhabit the places where such beauty is produced. It engages with the appearance of beauty in the first place, and then tells stories about how that beauty emerges through various narratives.

The parameters would need to meet the needs of the artist, but also the public. They would need to be transparent about who is contributing to the project, and to whom. They would need to offer mechanisms for withdrawing, and also for reporting flaws and tampering to ensure that the system is not tampered with. The parameters would need to be flexible in their implementation, and also self-healing. This last capability is critical to the success of the system, since any deviation can have catastrophic results.

A Smart Card is attached to a reader that records data collected during the tour of the Jericho Valley, and is used to control the system. The reader collects data about the tour, and outputs it to a terminal on site control. The data is sent via cable to a server in Israel, where it is analysed by a research team led by Prof. Nir Bar-El at Goldschmidt Medical Centre in Haifa. The research team is employed by the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa to monitor the Smart Cards. Their work is published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The system needed to offer ways of interacting with the data, and also offer ways of understanding the data.[2] The parameters would need to be configurable to allow users to modify the behaviour of the system. The most straightforward way to do this is to simply add more data to the end of the data stream, called Element 8. The interesting feature of Element 8 is that it is possible to simultaneously collect and present different data sets at different scales. This allows the audience to be continually challenged by different data streams, and also allows the system to be adapted and replaced with new technological means. In other words, while the parameters in Element 8 may be modified at any moment, they cannot be undone. The system also needs to offer ways of understanding the data, and be able to detect malleability and other types of malleability risks.To achieve these two ends of understanding and tweaking the parameters of the system were the focus of the project.

The in-depth investigation into the different kinds of art possible in a public setting would see artists, curators and art educators invited to contribute to the curatorial register, while the artists, art educators and art system administrators would send proposals to the artists, art system administrators and art historians present in the exhibition.

In such cases, the biennial becomes a museum, and not just any museum: a place where art is systematically acquired and where art is systematically destroyed.In this historical moment, it’s worth recalling that the biennial was originally conceived as a stop-gap measure: a way to show off the art of the moment to distract from the news of impending destruction.

In the twenty-first century, the biennial is a museum of art.Both the biennial and the museum move towards greater in-depth documentation of their respective artworks. This growing documentation, however, does not necessarily involve full-scale reconstructions or paintings, but should rather rely on works that can be retrieved or brought back to life. The biennial is no longer the primary venue for art production in North America; New York and other major cities are now important hub sites for art-producing regions worldwide. Nevertheless, these geographic locations play a pivotal role in the exhibitionary circuit. If a city is to sustain its artworld reputation, it’s necessary to have a biennale that is consistently present in the city, and that brings artistic practices into the everyday mix. This is no easy task, since the biennial has shifted geographically, abandoning its roots as a city institution. But the museum has to maintain a presence in the city, and in a city that has recently been visited by the biennale. In other</text>

Here, the biennial becomes not just a collection of objects, but a site of actively made and actively destroyed work.Here, the biennial is able to show its age, its transformations, and its performers, showing both the forces of history and the forces of culture at the same time. It’s one might say, in other words, a museum of the inchoate, which is to say, the stuff of historical interest but also a site of destruction. And here, the museum penetrates the soil of the biennial in order to reveal its contents, revealing the knots and turns and longings and frustrations of the inchoate, showing how art is made alive in the wreckage of the biennial.The museum is a place of trauma and it shows in the biennial’s third project, the present-day Amsterdam/Museo Mayor, the city’s largest inchoate collection, which opened last year.

It is a place where contemporary art is invited in and the art of the past is actively employed in some way or another. It is a place where contemporary art meets its maker’s dream, where the contemporary artist is expected to meet the dream maker’s ideal, and where art made for the present is actively sought after. It is a place where biennials can be counted on to deliver, and to some extent even to create, something of value. The important thing is that they can deliver it in a way that is both transient and that is mutually beneficial to both the collector and the public. And of course, there must be a profit to be made somewhere. The biennial must be a financial success. It must be a vehicle that maximises the organisation of time and the materials and methods of art-making available to us, and it must be able to do this while caring about the quality of its image, and its real-</text>

In the twentieth century, the biennial became a vehicle through which curatorial leanings were actively shaped and shaped. In the twenty-first century, the biennial is a museum of art, and a place where art can and will be acquired.The biennial as a museum of acquisition and consumption is no longer the dominant paradigm for understanding and understanding contemporary art, but many other, more nuanced, forms of understanding and consumption are also valid here. For example, the rise of neoliberalism and the capitalist transition in the twentieth century, and the subsequent fall of many working-class communities, and the growing gap between rich and poor communities, and the growing commodification of all forms of cultural capital – cultural capital: the very social capital of the modern left – are deeply related to this biennial dynamic. And it is important to note that not all the biennials of the past were created equal. There are distinctively modern biennials, such as the Venice Biennale and the Tate Modern, which simultaneously engage with the contemporary art market through a curatorial strategy of institutionalising contemporary art in a museum, exhibiting the practices of artists who are artists in</text>

It is a place where contemporary art is actively created and actively objects are exhibited. It is a place where art is actively consumed and actively objectified.And it is a place where art can be made to be consumable with consumable media.  The biennial is a museum of consumable art, a consumable media, in the sense that it contains within itself the same kind of substance that would eventually become consumable through art – namely, images of art. It is a media that can and should be used up – that is, discarded in favour of more fundamental museum collections. And it is a media that can and should be made to cease to be consumable with consumable forms of art.  This last concept is a mantra for contemporary art collectors and curators everywhere. It represents a way to read the museum as a living, evolving, ever-expanding archive of art that is incapable of absorbing or replicating its form. It embodies a</text>

In the twenty-first century, the biennial is a museum of destruction.While the biennial may seem an unlikely future for the city, there are signs that some curators are starting to question whether the art museum should be allowed to take over the museum. In a recent collection of photographs, Nasser Rabbati photographs six biennials from different periods in the twentieth century: Venice, San Francisco, New York, Lahore and Bahrain. The biennials, he says, ‘represent the most marked changes in art’s historical position, since no museum can possibly display all the works that have been produced during each such historical period’. ‘And yet’ he continues, pointing to the sixteenth-century Russian mosaic, which he has covered with photographs since 2001. ‘It is impossible to accurately depict the vivid historical context of these artists’ works, which are produced in different periods across different cities, but we can learn something from comparing the images.’This sounds like an argument against the</text>

In the twenty-first century, the biennial is a museum of art being made today. In either case, it provides a possible perspective on the art of the moment in the form of exhibits, curatorial pronouncements, and/or a collection of objects lying around, ready to be discovered and used again.This kind of historical ‘materiality’ lends itself to biennialic studies. In a major biennial—the Venice Biennale being the most obvious—artistic directors from all over Europe converged to discuss the art of the place in a common language. This commonality is what makes it possible for artists from different disciplines to come together, to exchange ideas and engage with one another. It creates a kind of ‘dialogueuality of interest’ that transcends art and art history, a kind of historical ‘liveness’ that transcends art and culture, and it enables us to understand how the biennale can connect with the particular subject matter addressed.

But it is not a museum. It is, rather, a vehicle that, at various points in its history, has actively participated in the production of the contemporary, and, in so doing, has actively participated in the destruction of the contemporary.In a recent exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, curator Adam Szymczyk reflected on the rise of the biennial, and on the way in which the museum had become a product of the biennial. The exhibition, entitled The Biennale of Art and Architecture, examined the history of the biennial from its first publication in the New York Times in 1893, to the year it was awarded the US National Landmark Preservation Prize in 1995. It also examined the different forms of the biennial, focusing on the three exhibitionary forms that have come to define the biennial: the biennale, the museum, and the tourist.

In the twenty-first century, the biennial is a museum of art’s past, the collection of curiosities and specimens of art that it can hold.This shift in museum structure and curatorial leanings is often credited to the biennial as a whole, but I think it’s also due to the biennial as a curatorial technique: the historical significance of the institution can be found in its use of collections, and especially its use of collections from the twentieth century. We tend to think of the biennial as being, or having been. But it’s more that it contains within itself the historical material of the twentieth century, and through collections, to work through the social and political circumstances and contemporary art of the century, and vice versa. And so, through collections, the biennial can excavate the social, political and organisational conditions that produced and followed up the contemporary forms of art in the same way that museums and other curatorial forms can.

Under the heading of ‘Common Defence’, the statement is repeated verbatim, albeit with a note of emphases.4 The narrow focus on the Crown and the people – Crown subjects, or citizens – is a way of framing the broader question that confronts us as we contemplate the new bureaucracies that are emerging across the country, powerless in the face of an allegedly common enemy. Can the bureaucrat be marginalized as a mediaeval process’sowden’ – a process that began with the Norman Turnpike’s painting of a stag in N.W.

[W]e, the Crown and the people take the position that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Charter, we, the people (here, apparently, means the Crown and the people), are collectively and severally responsible for the common defence of Canada.

The term ‘common defence’ is used synonymously with ‘home’, as in the common law, but this usage is increasingly being questioned.4 In 2011, a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada decision declared that the charter provision that created the common defence – the right to bear arms – extended not only to federal citizens, but also to persons lawfully present in Canada (subject to certain exceptions).5 The Court reasoned that because the common defence includes the individual right to arms, &quot;[t]he common defence encompasses not only the right to arms, but also the entire range of behaviour that one may assume, aims at acquiring, and aims</text>

… , including Crown entities, are responsible for the care and defence of Canadian interests internationally.5

The 2010 amendments to the Code do not define what constitutes a ‘defence’, although a common defence – one recognised by all Canadians – is one that is taken seriously by those with authority.6 The term ‘common’ refers to what is presumed to be in common between the parties to a dispute; it is not defined by law. In the absence of a precise definition of what is considered ‘common’ in a given context, it is unclear what the threshold is for distinguishing between legitimate expressions of political opinion and outright falsehoods, or between legitimate expressions of legitimate rage and outright violence.

Under the heading of ‘Common Defence’, the statement is repeated verbatim, in bold type, in the CRTC’s electronic books as part of its mandate letter to cable television providers.4 Cable television providers, in turn, file statistics on the status of their subscribers, cable television subscribers, and the number of households with access to television sets. The numbers are reported, along with the channels shown, in the cable system’s bulletin board system, which is visible from the street. In the United States, the National Cable and Telecommunications Company, which includes Charter Communications, recently reported that the number of subscribers reached an all-time high of over 690,000, marking the largest quarterly increase in company history.5 Cable television systems operating in some European countries have reported increases in subscribers reaching over 1 million.6 Many cable operators have adopted innovative strategies to expand their reach, engaging local communities in targeted advertising campaigns, training staff to deliver cable television to remote communities, and offering financial incentives to businesses that want to set up satellite or cable systems.7</text>

Under the heading of ‘Common Defence’, the statement is repeated verbatim:

The common defence – that is, the rights and freedoms enumerated in the Charter – are, by their nature, indeterminate. And as such, they include a potential for expansion in the event of a changing situation, such as war. Thus, while the rights and freedoms listed in the Charter may include a potential for expansion in the event of a changing political situation, they cannot be assumed or assumed to be static.4

This is a classic statement of the rights of nations to be constrained by the laws of nations – not those rights enumerated in the Charter, specifically, but all rights, including the rights to life, liberty and security of person. In this context, the right to life – enumerated in the Charter – becomes a question of survival. In 1960, the Canadian Charter was amended to add a right to appeal to the Federal Court of Canada, where a constitutional challenge to the prohibition on the indefinite detention of persons located in Canada was pending.5</text>

These three statements have been repeated countless times since their publication in 1985,8 including by archival periodicals such as the Globe and Mail and The Canadian Merchant, which at one time regularly reprinted them.2  The Globe and Mail and The Canadian Merchant, like The Toronto Star and other periodicals in Toronto, were founded in 1887 by William Crook and William Kerr. Their aim was to carry articles from The Toronto</text>

[T]he federal government has an obligation to provide for the common defence, including the common defence of Canada.2

The plain, banal, but nonetheless significant statement, as stated by the Treasury Board, is that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Charter, the federal government has a fiscal responsibility to provide for the common defence of Canada. The fundamental premise of this obligation – recognized by successive Canadian majorities – is that there must be common defence between the Crown and the people.3

Under the heading of ‘Common Defence’, the statement is repeated verbatim, without expanding or diverging from the original text.4 The view of the Treasury Board is that there is a fundamental difference between what is considered a common defence – the shared commitment to collective defence between the Crown and the people – and what is considered a public realm, such as a city or a borough.5 This view is shared by the majority of Canadians, but considerable divergence exists between different Canadian cities and regions.6  One of the few exceptions to this generalisation is Toronto, which sees its public realm as a city, although the city is a complex urban system with diverse regional and Island identities.7  One could ask: what is it that distinguishes a city from a borough? In answering this question, we can distinguish between two kinds of municipalities: those with a wholly provincial character, such as Toronto or Vancouver, and those with a partly provincial character, such as Montreal.8  One could also ask: what is it that distinguishes a public realm from a private one?

Under the heading of ‘Common Defence’, the statement is repeated verbatim:

[W]ith the objective of promoting the security of Canada and its territorial integrity, [the] common defence is the responsibility of the Crown.4

This is not a new formulation; it was first articulated by Justice Murray Sinclair in R. v. Nunavut Permanent Bank of Canada, 18 Nanog, supra, at p. 903. But the proposition that there is a universal, intergovernmental shared defence between the Crown and the people is new and has become so since the 1990s that it is difficult to imagine what the Crown would or could possibly do in the event of a public emergency.5 The assumption, as always, is that the Crown has the last word in this regard, and if the government acts in emergency circumstances, it is assumed that the people have the last word either way. In the event of a national emergency, the government is reminded again and again that it has  Fifth Amendment rights – those rights were not created nor can they be</text>

She did not mince words in describing the overwhelming amount of power, money and wealth generated by the museum today. She also spoke about the historical underpinnings of the museum’s economic models and the cultural production of poverty as a production for white supremacy. She saw a parallel with the exploitative business of tourism today. She stressed how the museum had played a pivotal role in creating and maintaining the social compact necessary for white supremacy, capitalism and patriarchy to be forged and continue to exist. But as museum attendance began to decline in the late 1990s and early 2000s, this dynamic was questioned.

She did not mince words: ‘People’s Cultural Attitudes had been built on a lie, a nightmare, a conflict. It’s amazing how some of those who came to [my] shows … didn’t know that I’d been working in the wake of it.’ In response, she drew comparisons between the biennial movement and the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, using the numbers: ‘Thirty-two million people now call themselves patients in the NHS.’[…] The biennial, she emphasised, was a ‘niche item’, a ‘gift from nature’ that needed to be claimed. But in the decades since, as biennials decline in number and size – the Tate record breaking in 2017 alone – the real work of art accumulation has become evident in far greater areas of the world. That happened in part because biennials began to be sites of accumulation for large numbers of objects, in</text>

She did not mince words when describing her engagement with the subject matter as being so out of the blue, and people were so quick to judge her for it. 'People Say I Have No Right To Art' was one of many responses to that kind of talk. She continued:I didn’t know what art was at the time. I didn’t know that there were crises all around the world. I didn’t know that the social conditions were such that an artist’s work, even if it’s non-intellectual, can still be a transformational tool. I didn’t know that there were artists all over the world who were using the same kind of language, the same idea, the same concept, and had the same politics. I didn’t know that there were artists all over the world who were creating symposia around particular periods in their history, like with Maya Angelou or Junot Diaz’s recent example. David</text>

She did not mince words in expressing how the Tate had let down its audience and its community, and how the decision to host the event in its current form had created a climate of resistance. She also spoke about the role that the Tate had in creating the crisis of identity that would later be referred to as the Biennial Crisis. She made a strong argument about the need for the local community to take responsibility for their social, cultural and economic futures, and for art institutions to change their internal structures and engage with the communities that are their clients. In a nutshell, she argued that the future of art and the biennial is in the hands of communities.Community Arts? Yes, indeed!Community Arts? Then why are some communities more adept at art than others?Is there a way to create a community gallery that would be engaging, interactive and ecologically sustainable? If so, why not just open a gallery? Why are some communities more adept at arts production than others?Is it down to shared experiences, such</text>

She did not mince words when describing the growing sense of crisis in the public realm that she found herself in, both at home and internationally. She claimed that the art world had largely failed her, and that she had to find a new field of engagement. She did not name any artists, but several other artists have their work displayed at the Venice Biennale, including Don Soderbaum, Silas Western, Rob Baucom and Yvonne Rainer.  The new generation of biennials are an eclectic bunch, but their common thread is their commitment to the history and the practice of the art form, whether that's in the form of a festival, a regular exhibition or a studio exhibition. I think that part of the reason why biennials are so prevalent and continue to deliver such powerful returns to art funders is that they follow a structure to enable them to engage with and perhaps even contribute to the formation of an identity for their areas of exhibition, whether that's a</text>

She did not mince words in her description of the subject matter: ‘It is not a church or a museum, it is a country and a people and a city and a river and everything is connected.’ She went on to say that it was as if ‘we didn’t build our cities or build ourselves anymore’. Social practice, urbanists and urban historians have been quick to point out that Smith’s city exemplifies the logic of excess. After decades of mired in economic decline and mired in conflict, conflict, violence and ecological destruction, London now finds itself at the verge of a major regeneration project. In the new ‘smart growth’ phase, a quarter of a million new flats are planned on the outskirts of the city. By 2040, almost all of them’ will be owned by the mid-sized companies that will control almost all of the affordable housing. The question of who owns what remaining affordable housing becomes even more complicated when the</text>

(2) how to use the excess to address the real or perceived threat from present and emerging crises? At the time, many in the biennial movement shared some of these concerns, although to a lesser extent. For example, Peter Osborne, the artist who initiated the London Biennial and made it a worldwide phenomenon, expressed concern about the growing number of people without identity and about the fragility of the cultural system. 'Crisis of Identity', as Osborne called it, became the basis for a new generation of artists to be born.Speaking at the London Biennial in early 2016, Patti Smith, whose work you can still see at the Tate, spoke about how her engagement with the subject matter came as a surprise to many people. She did not mince words in describing how the museum had failed her: ‘It’s a classic case of over-hyping and the like.’ She went on to say that many of her peers in the art world had been inspired by her work and felt a kinship with the audience. ‘There are people here for whom art is as real as life itself. And that is a difficult thing to reconcile with the idea that art isn’t real life in the first place?’[2] Smith goes on to make the distinction between ‘deeply embedded cultural values’ and ‘deep[i]rt-based collectivist societies’, and between the two. Deep embedded cultural values are those that live inside us and guide our actions, while deeply embedded collectivist societies are those that emerge externally and impose their values on others. The difficulty with defining either ‘deeply embedded’ or ‘deeply embedded’ values is that they</text>

She did not mince words when describing her engagement with the subject matter as a whole. She stated:I didn’t expect so much vitriolic abuse and I didn’t expect the Biennial to be this way. I thought it was going to be an interesting one to explore the notion of the museum as a place of encounter between artist and audience. And I think the abuse that it has received, the hatred and the violence that has been aimed at it, and the fact that the Biennial is the only institution in London that is hosting a major art exhibition at the moment, … it is difficult to imagine what that encounter would be like without the Biennial. I can only imagine it as a very pointed ideological and political statement that is intended to be taken seriously and not taken by others as just another exhibitionary occasion.  [Emphasis added.][4]  The question that remains, however, is what can be learned from the event? What can be learnt from the present and future</text>

She did not mince words when describing the extent of the ecological crisis: ‘It just seems like a big, abstract problem that nobody has been able to wrap their heads around. It just doesn’t seem possible to look away from this problem or that.’ She went on to call for a return to the primacy of natural resources, and the primacy of art and culture in this process of resource accumulation. Science, she said, was now more important than ever.

She did not mince words when she referred to the ‘biennial as a modern museum that should never have been founded’. In fact, she went so far as to call it a ‘ficto-mathemagic museum’. And she has continued to do so, today, nearly twenty years after the event.In my opinion, the biennial is still, in many ways, a museum, although its current exhibitionary format may be more appropriate for a non-biennial. It is, for example, more suitable for a non-biennial to exhibit a show that is not pre-programmed with a narrative or a static image. It is more suitable for a non-biennial to foster dialogue and exchange between different groups. And it is more suitable for a non-biennial to foster a dialogue between diverse social groups. But these are all things that a museum does best. It shows, it talks, it engages with, it invites, it constitutes and it</text>
