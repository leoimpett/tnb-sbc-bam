In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism in specific places. This is consistent with the idea, articulated by Foucalt and others, that ‘public sphere’ is a ‘complex social construction’ that is both ‘found in the historical sites of contemporary conflict and catastrophe and is ultimately determined by economic, political and environmental factors.’[4] In fact, Foucalt is far from the only one to ponder such a notion, which has been advanced by various well-informed commentators on recent global infrastructures. Among them, few seem to have considered, much less to have considered, the fact that the infrastructures they are commenting on weren’t designed by, with the sole mandate to build roads, follow the money, and lie to Canadians about which to follow in the next crisis – not to mention the citizens of London, New York and other megacities that have been designed with an eye on the future rather than the present – but which nonetheless</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism in the interests of the people. This is consistent with the way in which capitalism operates, where people acquire structures and rights through accumulation: as ownership in the form of housing, land and buildings, and the provision of services, including services that aid in the making of things – goods and assets – and that help to support the reproduction of the species. In this way, the public realm can’t be understood in isolation. The public realm needs to be taken to include both the rich and the poor, as a social totality. In the 1990s, the poor and the vulnerable were housed in overcrowded and dilapidated housing projects; now, the poor and the vulnerable are dispersed throughout various destinations in North America and Europe. There is no single perfect model for how to achieve this social totality, but over the past decades various efforts have sought to leverage the political, economic and jurisdictional powers that are devolved to address this situation. The European model of the �</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism as a whole. In other words, the public realm isn’t a single building or collection of buildings, but rather a set of assets shared by many people in a given city. This is in sharp contrast to the typically bureaucratic and temporal nature of the public realm, which is generally understood as the outcome of a single institution or person – a political party, mayor, state legislature, etc. – having a say in what’s made up into that realm.[2] In other words, the public realm is both geographically defined (the location of resources) and is also culturally specific (it’s where ideas come from and through which we move).  In this way, the public realm establishes and depends on the cultural practices that take place within it. Cultural resources (assets) are given shape and function through the production of cultural practices. This is why those who live in the city tend to contribute to cultural resources collection activities such as the annual Art</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism in a specific place. This second mode of democratic management of the public realm – the cooperative – has been described as ‘capitalist’ in its tendency to produce by way of subversion rather than through the logic of property.[16] It is important to note here that the cooperative was neither created nor a part of the contemporary capitalist epoch, unlike other kinds of public realms, such as the city or the village. It is a cooperative of workers' and community’s representatives, established to the extent that such rights were available and was thus structured with a democratic provision of resources reserved for workers only. Thus, unlike other kinds of public realms, the cooperative didn’t attain a kind of privatising externalisation of resources, as the market place inevitably allowed. Rather, the cooperative ensured that resources were distributed according to working-class and community needs, and that workers and communities actually did own parts of the infrastructure of the city. So while the market place</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of space and the exchange of goods and knowledge.[5] The question of political and social agency arises, however, as to what kind of relationship those with a particular set of values are to the fact of existing: to what kind of threshold does the politics of creativity and agency lay? The answer to that is a difficult one to convey through a set of numbers and metrics, but one that must be found within oneself. In an ideal scenario, the very definition of what it means to be ‘in’ with others, to be part of a collective, would extend to all. However, as we know from personal experience, that’s not always possible, nor is it always possible within contemporary conditions. In fact, in contemporary conditions, the act of creating or becoming ‘public’ can be characterised by the very fluidity with which contemporary forms of economic exchange and political organisation inevitably conspire to create an abundance of space and a multiplicity of cultures, substances and practices</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism in that place. This is what democratic societies do. And it is what the public realm is trying to achieve. If it fails, it’s because the political, legal and economic systems that generate the space and make it up are stacked against us, or because there isn’t enough public space available or desirable. And the public realm doesn’t invent public space; it has to be created through struggle and organising. The public realm needs to be exploitable and democratic, but it also needs to be a space in which ideas and creativity can be realised. This is why the public realm is so critical to the struggle for social change and democracy. It creates the conditions that radical pedagogy and the politics of space-making can generate and sustain a politics of social transformation. But it doesn’t create the space or the public realm. That would be bureaucratic and materialism. The public realm is a product of long-term struggles and compromises</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism in that place.  The public realm idea started out in the US, with the introduction of the ‘Ten Commandments’ section of the Ten Commandments monument at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, and in the West Bank city of Ramallah, and has been echoed in other places around the world.  The concept has spread to other parts of the world, becoming increasingly popular in places where people feel that their public realm isn’t enough, and where a public realm is a clear idea of who that person is, and why they are doing what they are doing. The public realm is the ideal in many ways, although in many places the public realm is too abstract and empty to sustain life as a concrete space. Public beacons are scattered and rare; they are tools for us to use when we need to make space for ourselves in the city, but rarely do we use them. The public realm is the exact opposite of prisoner’s dilemma –</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism in a specific area. 	As a public realm, Portland offers many features that are characteristic of an urban commons, such as the fact that buildings are held together primarily by their use – meaning that they are easily extricated and repurposed; that is, reuse is the operative principle – whereas in private ownership the use of a building is more often the result of negotiation and negotiation with neighbouring organisations (including for-profit and non-profit housing developers) over the use of the building, with competing demands and priorities. As such, it offers public realms the characteristics of an urban commons, while retaining the distinctive features of an exclusive club. 	The concept of an exclusive club was particularly influential in the design of transit shelters for the LGBT community in Vancouver. Many of the pioneers of this kind of design were urbanists, including Manuel Cardoso, François Gaon, Andrea Shea, Renee Jacobs, Max Landis</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism in defined spaces. Such a scenario is part of what democracy looks like, but is also a criticality – it is what gives institutionalised power, including its drive to legislate – and is necessary for a public realm to be established. The reason why democratic power is necessary for such a public realm is that, absent it, institutionalised power would inevitably revert to the people, who would inevitably repeat the historical mistakes of colonialism and racism, and so would inevitably become what Derrida would call a ‘rejection of history’ of the planet. Indeed, recent research suggests that, in a city as large as New York, the human capital generated by a public realm would be a source of enormous technological innovation, enabling the city to function more like a giant synthetic organism that can absorb and harness all those with a talent for creating value. And yet, in a city as large as New York, the production of that human capital is itself a dynamic process</text>

In other words, the public realm wasn’t created by a specific idea in one place, but rather through a long process of provision and democratic control exercised through the production of architecture and urbanism in specified spaces. This is consistent with the concept of public realm described above, which is both individualised and global.  So, for example, the public realm in New York is a product of multiple infrastructures, each contributing to make the city what it is. It comes about as a consequence of many infrastructures converging on a city through their activities at the World Trade Centre, where activities take the form of ‘partnerships’ with research institutions, local authorities and others including artists' institutions providing staff and support for the ongoing exhibition. The partners then invest in new infrastructures, creating new urban clusters and other modes of economic circulation that further develop the city through what is sometimes called the New Economy.  A public realm is a production of infrastructural infrastructures and the infrastructures that support them, and it is a point of intersection where infrastructures converge with cities (and other</text>

Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding in a manner that is much more reminiscent of the glory days of city life – the golden age of urban development that began in earnest around the turn of the twentieth century – highlighting the economic degeneracy that is taking place everywhere in the world. In either crisis, the task of regeneration is made more difficult by the inability of local authorities to create new ‘safe cities’9 and the proliferation of unplanned ‘urban growth areas’10 – areas that are virtually indistinguishable from existing suburban zones, but with a much greater concentration of industry and commercial centres. These developments are seen by many local authorities as essential in meeting the increasingly complex challenges that face the area – challenges that, as the news stories about Flint, Hurley and Moore Lakeman reveal, are legion.Nevertheless, it is precisely because such challenges are viewed as infrastructural in nature that they can be counted on to self-regenerate in the face of disruption and change – challenges that are far easier to absorb and</text>

Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding just as heavily as it was in the crisis of the city in the late 1970s and early 1980s. That is, there is a vast discrepancy between the financial crisis in 2007 and the crisis of the city in the late 1970s. And it is becoming increasingly difficult to actually get into the city, to actually move around in it and so the contradictions are being compounded.  	The big question for the future urban explorer is what will become of the large and growing collections of unreality that are brought into the city? How will urban spaces be generated around a concept such as ‘embraced’ness, rather than around the contradictory qualities that are defined as urban? What will become of the collection once it has become a collection? How will the collection be reproduced? How will urban spaces be produced through the collection? These are questions with no easy answers and many urban theorists have their fingers crossed that the contradictions will be resolved in the future by the cooperative and mutual aid movements that</text>

Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding just as heavily as it was in the crisis of the city in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In both crises, governments step in to prop up failing cities through tax-supported schemes like the ‘London Bubble’ and the ‘Tobin’ Elephant Deal’. Those who remain in power, however, quickly find themselves needing to find other ways to prop up the city’s fragile economic fortunes. The loss of market access and high regulatory costs associated with the Elephant in the Richer’s Pudding are clearly seen by many commentators as a hindrance to innovation.9  The regulatory capture of the Downtown Eastside and its surrounding area has been well documented.10 However, the decision to grant tax-exempt status to a non-profit arts organization is seen by some as an attempt to subsidise ‘private development’ rather than encourage it.

Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding in a way that seems to be helping to generate the capacity for new business formation – albeit at a much faster rate than in the early 1970s. Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding in ways that seem to be helping to generate capacity for future business formation – although most likely, the answer to the question that seems to animate policymakers and capital alike is: what is the role of art museums in addressing the challenges of a postindustrial society? I will return to this in a moment.But the point is that new ideas have a way of emerging, or catching on, that are not always obvious and can therefore sometimes be decisive. And some of the decisions that are being made now, whether about the future of our cities or the future of capitalism, are as much about the future of ideas as about the future of cities.

Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding much more slowly than in the crisis of the city. The great financial misadventures of the 1980s and 1990s were fuelled by exuberant market ideologues and their eclectic array of lenders, many of whom have since receded into the background. Perhaps it is even the case that the rapid changes that characterise the contemporary mode of economic life in postindustrialised regions require the recurrence of nostalgic notions of the good old days. But the recurrence of such concepts in a social context seems increasingly rare.

Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding in the United States and elsewhere, while the global economy as a whole is proving more difficult to comprehend. Perhaps it is that the contradictory demands of rapid growth and massive government spending are creating conditions in which new ways of living are less likely. Do I wish to suggest that these crises are being engineered by nonstate actors? Perhaps it is true that in the current period of crisis capitalism is producing ever more via the back door, where governments and nonstate actors are being recruited to fill ever more precarious jobs, while nonstate actors are being pulled into ever larger bureaucracies as the economy implodes around them. But this is no solution to the problem of ever-greater government involvement in the economy. Current trends suggest that even with the back door, there is always the risk that too much money is spent too soon. And this is to be expected when the economy is so overloaded with debt and social problems end up piling up in the social and fiscal deficit. Current trends also suggest that as the</text>

Perhaps it is time for governments everywhere to try something new and different – something like what the late sociologist Henri Lefebvre tried to do with the French working class in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He sought to engage a working-class but militant segment of the population with a proposition simple: ‘Work harder and play it smarter’. If the working class could be brought into the political process, it would mean engaging them in a debate that wasn’t confined to the confines of their country, and challenging them to engage in a broader public debate about the world through which they were immersed.  This would involve not just experts but also everyday people like you and me, engaging with</text>

This was seen by some commentators as a potential new business model, even though, as the Economist put it in 2006, the main purpose of museums was to provide places to ‘reanimate and store dead things’.8  The problem with deindustrialising cities is that they trap wealth in the form of immovable assets – buildings, roads, parks – that can never be used and so end up costing ever more in maintenance. In an attempt to attract businesses and investment to economically depressed areas, new ideas have come to represent the solutions to this problem. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the global economic crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding just as heavily as it was in the crisis of the city in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In both crises, government debt skyrockets, corporate profits plunge and social indicators deteriorate. Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding in a manner similar to that of the city. Perhaps it is even possible that the converging of these two crises presents an opportunity for cities to recover in their own image. Unfortunately, this is the present global economic order – extraordinary advances in science and technology mean that cities are no longer the bulk of the global economy – and thus it is easy to lose sight of the city’s true significance and instead focus on the machines that drive urban development and make it possible for us to have lives here. 	Ordinary people, artists, writers, musicians, architects – they all felt the impacts of this new world. The financial crisis hit particularly hard to those who worked in finance, but it also caused great damage to those who worked in other spheres. The loss of value created in the financial sector was conveyed to customers in the form of higher prices and fewer choices. In many ways, this is part of the job description of a financial planner – it is what they do. But it was</text>

Perhaps it is also no coincidence that the financial crisis that began in 2007 is now unfolding at a faster rate in parts of the world where the cost of living is much more volatile.  In my view, the primary role of museums is to serve as repositories of value – symbols – for their times. They are places where ideas are exchanged and ideas are embodied in objects. They are places where ideas are constantly being invented, and in this process, they are also a place where new ideas are constantly being defeated.  That is, museums are often precursors to new ideas – ones that have the potential to be realized but are currently thwarted by institutional inertia and political will. So it is that today, as in many parts of the world, we continue to invest in institutions and bureaucracies that not only hinder but actually create their own defeatism.  A growing body of research now suggests that the primary role of museums should be actively engaged in contesting climate change and other environmental  challenges.    A growing body of research now suggests that the primary role of museums should be actively</text>

In this context, the project reflects the fact that in the 21st century, cultural capital is the domain of a globalised elite, increasingly autonomous, and increasingly technological-savvy. It is a domain in which significant cultural resources are shared, but also in which significant differences exist, especially between the places where the actors within the cultural frame gather and exchange. 	To participate in this domain, participants have to be able to put their cultural weight behind decisive actions that have a measurable impact. The World Biennial Congress and the European Capital of Culture, Infrastructure and Human Settlements programme have shown that it is possible to create an environment in which the artists, curators and architects can put their cultural weight behind decisive decisions. The biennial as a recurring, long-term investment could be shown to deliver tangible, though low-impact, benefits, even if these are cultural in nature.

Its themes are those of a regenerating city, one’s way of being is shaped by the city’s processes of urbanization, and art, culture and society are made possible through the city’s processes of repair and regeneration. 	For Sol Sol Shaffi, artist, writer and researcher, and his team, the question is simple: how can artistic practices take root in urban environments when so much of what’s being done to us as artists and artists is directed, condoned and even organised around the world? Art, he believes, has a fundamental but limited place in a city where so many other practices are more readily accessible and resonate with us; practices that are rooted in deeper values, ethical commitments and relational orientations.

The commission’s 2015 budget proposal suggests that a new capital to address the challenges of our time includes  	new museums and art institutions; new cultural centres; and a cultural hyperspace that gathers diverse forms of cultural practice into one geographical space. The new space must also foster a new epoch in which art, acting as a social and spatial act, becomes a core constituent part of the cultural landscape. This new cultural sector, if it is to survive, will have to develop innovative ways of structuring their practice. The capital of the future’s future urban centres will have to address the changing needs of a rapidly expanding population, which means an ever-expanding urban centre core.

At the same time, the project is part of the commission’s larger remit, through the ‘visionary partnership’ it established with the Venice Biennale and the Italian Cultural Council, to explore ‘how cultural activities can play an essential role in shaping social change’.[25] I believe that there are two ways of thinking about cultural institutions: their institutional forms, and the particular processes that create and encourage them. 	The institutional form of the cultural institution is a ‘systemic contradiction’. It is not accidental that the Biennale was also an ‘institutional contradiction’: both the Biennale and the Biennale itself, by continually breaking the law and constantly breaching the publics they were entrusted with, wound up being established under the guise of ‘cultural events’.

The project’s continuing institutional and public support comes from the commission, which is grateful to the artist and her collaborators for their valuable contribution. 	The institutional links between visual art and sustainability are complex and need to be negotiated, and so it is with the project. It is possible to promote sustainability while simultaneously restricting access to it, and it is also possible to make it both transparent and impossible to penetrate it completely. The decision to make the work public and to make it about a city is a contextual choice that needs to be negotiated through other factors. It is not a given that the institution or the city will embrace the project, since they do not want to. However, the choice to make the work so that it can be viewed by a global audience and made part of a museum collection will be a decision that has a significant impact on the cultural practices of the future city.

All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit less traumatic for the local art world than when the project was started, and the biennial format that art students and artists used with the community could be seen as a last resort. The fact that the Biennial moved away from its roots as a cultural festival and started producing tangible art through the buying of produce and building of community gardens seems to have mitigated some of the negative perceptions of the area. The institutional engagement with the Biennial format may have exacerbated the sense of crisis in the area, and the dramaturgy that emerged may have been more representative of the real life that existed in the city than the art of the future abstract culture imagined by the Biennial.This profile is taken from the book Real Life in Port Townsend: Art's Emergency Response to Crisis, edited by Daniel Coleman and Carl DeCerteau, and published by Zone Books, 2016.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is an artist and writer whose work deals with the impact of climate change</text>

All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit more organic than the Biennial and its curatorial team, and the new generation of artists were able to react quickly to this new urban situation. This also helps to explain why the Biennial managed to sell out its first two editions, because the community was already embedded in the project through the curatorial and art-education programs already established. The fact that the Biennial was able to engage the local community through direct action and build a real relationship shows that the project was already sustainable in the long term. This is another aspect of ‘infrastructure’ – the way infrastructure is remade and reimagined through the various modes of discourse, which is characteristic of the ‘utopian’ thinking that underpins the project.Port Townsend is a unique case study because it has been able to simultaneously articulate and execute an ambitious ‘utopian’ agenda through different media: the administration’s own words, the art installations installed in local shops and public spaces, initiatives from the</text>

All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit more visible in the news than other projects that came out of it. The fact that the Biennale was also about combating climate change played a big part in that. The Biennale also changed the shape of the Biennale. It became a ‘metainterface’, where the curators sat on beanbags, and the artists stuck out sticks. The name stuck. In retrospect, the Biennale came around when the Biennale suddenly became visible again, and the Biennale became conscious of the new shape it was in. The new model it sought to serve, to its donors and supporters, was visible only at the Biennale. The Biennale sought to manufacture a myth around itself, and the new position it was in. The new policy it wanted to impose on the city was seen by some as a good idea, and the Biennale sought to engineer a narrative around itself. In the end, the Biennale and its arts</text>

All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit more organic and democratic than the Biennale that year, in part because the residents of the neighbourhood were involved from the beginning. The Biennale should always take into account the community, but the sheer scale of the project and the presence of Welsh Streets Artists Collective made it clear that the Biennale wasn’t just making art for the people: it was also doing social work, since the Biennale was creating a new model for socially engaged art. The fact that the Biennale was also engaging directly with the local community through community meetings and events also proved useful, since it allowed the Biennale to generate awareness of the neighbourhood through stories told at the meetings. Ultimately, the Biennale’s involvement with the Welsh Streets community was more about politics and the representation of power in the area than it was about art and the artist’s intentions.

The next morning, an overwhelming number of the building’s residents showed up to reclaim it. They had taken over the building by 9 a.m., and were still there the entire time. These actions turned the building into a site for direct action, which in turn, created a new situation that could be used in the future to fight gentrification and urban renewal.The conversation surrounding the building also transformed the local food market, with new restaurants opening up on the street. Some of the artists who worked with the community on the project also opened new businesses with the community. All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit more complicated than the artist’s abstract idea of a machine, and the people involved in that project were much more involved than we initially imagined. We should stress that these kinds of long-term participatory practices are not only about the people who create the artwork, but also about the people who use it. The kinds of social change that result from long-term participatory practices are often quite radical, and can even become transformative. We are lucky to be living in such a way, but there are many artists whose works we have embedded in our cultural landscape today. These are but a few examples: Mary Steenburgen, Rainer Maria Stefan, Maria Hlavajova, Pintu Harjiana, Maria Hlavajova &amp; Sara Sánchez-Ortiz, Portofino, Venice, 2009.

All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit more organic than some people might think. And, as the Biennial grew bigger and more influential, a lot of the work we did was also more activist-oriented. We started to do things on the site that would be socially engaged and urban renewal might come to that neighbourhood. I imagine that some of the seeds that we planted would have been quite radical. The fact that these things happened despite the Biennial and its billionaire donors is a radical thing. Despite the fact that the Biennial was awarded a $1.5 billion dollar development deal, we3TCD actually shrunk our work force as a result of these projects. Our urban renewal projects were so effective, in fact, that the Biennial didn’t build any new venues or host any events at all. Its development arm, the Downtown Development Company, continued to fund art-related activities in the neighbourhood. And the Biennial’s social purpose continued to be fulfilled in the form of events and projects it organised with the</text>

All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit more organic than some people initially imagined. The fact that the Biennial was also commissioned to work with the local community on a project in which a large number of arts students were also present also allowed the project to progress more organically. As the art students slowly withdrew from the project, the organic side of things started to creep back in. Inspired by the success of the Biennial project, a number of the students formed a second art commissioning company: the artists’ residency program was rebranded as a ‘follow the artist’ residency, and the art school itself as a ‘follow the art school’ school. The new bodies that emerged to address gentrification and urban renewal started to meet regularly with the new management team, who in turn started organising regular tours. The Biennial was invited back in 2018, but it took until 2031 before the city council re-chosen an independent curator to oversee the art school’s activities. In the intervening period, the</text>

All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit more positive than one would think from the outside. The creation of direct action through grassroots art projects in neighbourhoods, even when these are initiated by and for the rich, has often been seen by some as a counterintuitive approach to the increasing power of capital. Nevertheless, this was the art movement that created the conditions for direct action and generated the conditions for social change, and it continues to play a crucial role in envisioning a future for the community. Perhaps it is time to ask: what might a future in the making for the people and communities of Port Townsend look like? Let me tell you what I think I know: the future may not be like the past. Maybe what we need is a new past.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is Associate Professor of Art and a Co-Director of the Center for Art, Ideas &amp; Culture at the Brooklyn College of Arts.

All in all, the development of the Community Arts movement in Port Townsend was quite a bit more stable than I had imagined it would be. The main challenge for me, in fact, was to be present in the face of such sustained creative action. The situation called for sustained creativity, and was largely determined by the individual commitment of a small core of artists. The challenge for the Biennial as a whole is to build long-term relationships with communities in an area that are active users of its cultural assets, and who have a say in how their cultural assets are used. The Biennial needs to be able to rely on these users in future, and to be flexible in how it uses those users. The challenge for the artist is to build long-term relationships with communities in the area, and to be able to provide that experience with the community that is most authentic to the artist.I would like to end with an example of a community that has been a long-term partner of the Biennial, and whose engagement with the Biennial has been a significant factor in the development of</text>

The project, which explored how the academy might work alongside industry and in so doing contribute to creating that city’s future, produced innovative proposals that attempted to articulate a future with greater connectivity, sustainability and empowerment for the future city.

Its revival is a conversation to be had with stakeholders in the UK's national infrastructure (highways, ports, railways), and with international engineers, civil servants and others with a view to understanding how to best use the infrastructure they come to. While the use of the term ‘infrastructure’ should be regularly reviewed and updated (with frequent articles and podcasts focusing on the state of infrastructure in the UK and internationally), the term ‘infrastructures’ is relatively new. This article aims to add to the body of work already on file at the British Academy, with a view to bringing the full range of expertise and perspectives to bear on the problem of infrastructure repair, restoration and creation.

In a recent issue of  	Geographical Research Letters 	, Geoff Cox, O.S. (University of Alberta), Canada, and his research associates from the U.S. and Canada, used GPS collars and satellites to trace the movement of tepid water from the Gulf of Mexico to an underground storage tank at the University of Alberta’s School of Earth, Mineral and Environmental Sciences. They found that the movement of tepid water coincided with the movement of large volumes of Arctic tundra into the gulf, which then condensed into a river that fed into the Mississippi River. 	The research has been accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 	The geologists should be able to access the data, analyze the data and produce a working</text>

The social, economic and ecological benefits of such a system would be staggering. It would free us from hunger and thirst, spur economic growth and alleviate conflict. It would also enable us to control our energy supply and manage our resources, creating a level playing field in competition for resources between nations and regions. 	Such is the  	implicit idea that comes from the deep within us all. But how do we actually implement such a ‘game-changing’ transformation of our globalised economy? The answer, as always, is geoengineering. 	Geoengineering is the applied science and engineering that attempts to influence the course of climate through the application of specific technologies.

A public realm would be possible in the form of a city or region, but it would be a self-sustaining, self-sustaining ‘green city’ – a city that can be reinvigorated by the knowledge that it has created, but that will continue to provide for its inhabitants as new technologies empower it to do so. 	In the event of a city’s decline or collapse, such a city would be able to regrow from the effects of its overheated growth, but would have to be actively engaged in rebuilding itself. The role of the local would have to evolve from knowledge-producing to being creatively engaged in the creation of new solutions.

These recommendations are aimed at generating a dialogue with artists, curators, educators and other stakeholders in a quest for cultural co-determination and the establishment of common values and norms. Their proposal is one that is sustainable in its composition, but challenges the prevailing order in a way that is collectively responsive to the needs and interests of the people whose cultural assets are being remade in the image of urbanisation.

We live in the age of the biennial, and the museum is the contemporary successor to the Ancient Near East and Medieval Europe, which postbellum southern Europe hosted. The museum is the contemporary successor to the museum, the Greek and Roman museum, which in turn hosted the museum in the Middle Ages. The former was a museum of the past, a place of remembrance and the display of objects from the past, a place of exhibition and ephemera – objects from all over the world. The latter was a museum of the present, a place where objects from all over the world can be found and appreciated.

This implies a modern scientific and technical culture, and a public engaged in data-intensive pursuits, increasingly sophisticated in its understanding of the world. It is a trade that seeks to manufacture universal aesthetics around a particular technological reality. Modern art has become ever more like other art forms through modern artifice: more accessible, more global, more corporatised. And yet, despite this, it is art that seeks to claim such a right. How then, can art simultaneously claim both space and assert its rightful place? How, I wondered, does the trick work in the modern  	context? What is lost in translation?

Timestamps are made by publishing the precise moment, date and time of a specific event, usually a recording or audio recording, that is relevant at the moment in time. The advent of reliable digital recording has made the possible access to this kind of chronicle a reality. 	Timestamps are used in the service of historical research and literary criticism, as well as in the contemporary production of identity documents and migration traces. They are made publicly visible in a persistent way, constantly informing those who record, analyse, or otherwise access historical records through its content, relevance and accessibility. 	In both the English and the Spanish language, this term is often translated as ‘the timestamp of the past’. 	In the case of the use of the term in relation to the use of social media, it is useful to categorise these two senses of ‘the timestamp of the past’: (1) the human-readable timestamp that records the exact instant in time when an event occurred, and (2) a textual version of the timestamp that is always appended to the end of a statement or document that refers to an event in the past. 	</text>

Timestamps are made by publishing the precise moment, date and time of a specific event, usually a recording or audio recording, that is relevant at the moment in time. The advent of reliable, online sources for the historical record is often cited as a factor in the increasing ubiquity of the  	Timestamp; a record of the exact moment when each of us entered the New York Public Library, for example, is a particularly interesting timestamp that can be found online. 	Timestamps have been a form of digital document since at least the 1990s, but their contemporary popularity is due to technological innovations such as the smartphone and online video, which make it easier to capture and share precise, contemporaneous time-stages. 	In fact, the smartphone is so named because it records time ‘tagged’ to specific places and contacts, such as a person’s GPS position and the time of day. By tagging information about physical objects with precise coordinates, the smartphone provides a record of exactly when and where each of these things were taken, done and delivered.

Timestamps are a global language of encounters between people, places and events that happen to be contemporaneous with the occurrence of an event: Bill Bryson’s megastuditions for the megastructure of his eponymous book, ‘The Long Emergency’, and the events of 9/11 are illustrative. Bryson, an author best known for his work on climate change and for the HBO series ‘Real People’, makes a compelling case that we’re living through ‘the Episodic, or ‘permanent, ‘or ‘in-between’ moments that can no longer be counted upon to deliver on the promise of a new beginning.

The following curators have a combined twenty-seven years' curatorial and educational experience: Sandy Volz (Director, Tate Modern), Peter Carr (Director, Tate Modern), Peter Haggerty (Director, Tate Modern) and Sophie Hope Coleman (Director, Tate Modern). Some of these have a long-standing relationship with the Museum of Modern Art, where they did a number of projects, and some have a long-standing relationship with Tate Modern, where they held courses in the future Chronicle Gallery. 1  	Timestamp 	The term  	Timestamp is used synonymously with  	Modern. 	Timestamps are made by publishing the precise moment, date and time of a specific event, usually a recording or audio recording, that is relevant at the moment in time. The advent of the computer and mobile phones, as well as the proliferation of digital cameras has made it easier and more accessible to document and record everyday events. This makes it possible to document not only the events themselves, but also the places where they take place – where they happen, who observes them, and with whom they take place, and for what reason. 2  	Timestamps are increasingly being used to document the social and political contexts of urban and urban-dwelling populations. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the New York Times ran an issue of its then monthly magazine  	Standard &amp; Morning Standard (subscription required) devoted to its pages, its images and its place in the city. The journal article appeared in print in 2001, and was followed by two podcasts: ‘Times New York’s ‘Times Square’ and ‘Times Square Pussy Cats’.

The biennalee opened with a virtual coin toss: the artist selected a coin from a bowl of coloured metal to represent the biennalee’s mission. The artist, Jean Paul McEnroe, presented the coin as a ‘living coin’, naming the museum as a museum of art and the city as a site for art’s perpetual public acts of remembrance. Within moments, two competing coins were tossed, with one character representing the city of New York and the other the city of Biennalee. The coin toss signaled the beginning of the event, with McEnroe introducing the coin tosser as his fictional Australian avatar. McEnroe would go on to make several films about the city and the elements, most notably ‘The Flintstones’ (1976), which starred Richard Layzell as the titular character. The film was based on a short story by John L. Sullivan that was first published in 1883.</text>

The biennalee provided an ideal platform to develop and test the positions and initiatives of the artist-curator team, the art historian and the art critic, while also enabling the artist-designer team to develop a project with the art institution of their choice. The project was an opportunity to test the capacities of the various art institutions to host, organize, and engage with a biennalee, and to develop strategies for the exhibition of contemporary art in the event. The project also allowed the artists and art historians to exchange information and findings. While the interests and purposes of the Biennalee were different from those of the museum, their collaboration and exchange of ideas and data allowed the exploration of overlapping and diverging historical and contemporary themes, in an event that also sought to address current and potential artworld issues and concerns. The exchanges incorporated the advice and analysis of contemporary art historians, contemporary artworld curators, and art protégés. For example,</text>

The exhibition itself would build on these two parallel narratives, helping to articulate the principles that underpinned the biennalee’s logic and narrative. With the support of the biennalee, the artist(s) responsible for the idea could leverage their position to initiate a cultural revolution within the art world, or at least that is the impression that the biennalee and its curatorial handiwork projects have attempted to leverage. The Biennalee also attempted to leverage its position as the pinnacle art institution in the city to establish an independent cultural policy that would override the city’s traditional curatorial handiwork and seek to create a fully participatory art institution. This cannot be achieved through the traditional curatorial handiwork, since the city would have to consent in advance</text>

But the biennalee also offered a way to consider art as a political act, and the political dimension of artistic activity as a function of a complex interaction of economic, cultural and spatial power structures. The ability to engage politically with the world through the art world was crucial to the emergence of critical art.The Biennalee was a success because it allowed the artists and designers to become involved in the construction of the site and to affect the outcome of the project. The site was designed with accessibility as a goal in mind, creating a hybrid site suitable for walking, running, transit and other modes of accessibility. The Biennalee was a success because of the team that worked with city planners, artists, architects and other stakeholders to come up with a design that would balance the needs of the users of the site, while also preserving the architectural heritage of the area. But the realisation of these goals actually delayed the project by up to a year. This cultural capitalisation of</text>

The journals served as the place for this more nuanced mode of engagement to be developed, while the longer essay form allowed for more in-depth reflection. In the end, the aim of the event was to create an environment in which the participants and the overall narrative of the event could be developed in a way that would be both accessible and thought-provoking. When the biennalee was expanded to include a global perspective, a specific curatorial agenda was also changed: the biennalee now reflected on the past through the present rather than the future, and its curatorial actions reflected this shift. The biennalee also introduced a new generation of artists to the art world, and promoted their participation in curatorial action through activities such as performances, group shows, lectures</text>

The biennalee was also a unique opportunity to experiment with the newly articulated concept of the art biennalee, itself an interesting departure from previous curatorial approaches. The new curators employed a hybrid approach to the concept that incorporated elements of history, archival materials, archival images, archival reports, archival sketches, and archival documents. These materials and methods were used to interrogate the ways in which a biennalee is different from other art forms, and to ask, ‘what if?’ The authors of these reports and works presented their findings in a 2014 report that was published in conjunction with the Venice Biennale. In that report, the authors make clear that, despite the diversity of the subject matter addressed, the primary audience of the report is art biennials, and that ‘the next Venice Biennale may follow the path of the next Middle East [or] North African [or] Indian Ocean [and</text>

Each artist was also given an individualised involvement, with full control over the narrative, in-depth narrative design and production, and invaluable input into the process. The biennalee was dynamic, unpredictable and in many ways, counter intuitive: the artworks on display, the curatorial language, the interactive tours, the itinerary – in an urban setting, this was all possible because the biennalee was connected to the city through a shared everyday environment. But perhaps the most significant element of the biennalee was its institutionalisation. It was, according to some curators, necessary for the biennalee to be interdisciplinary in its focus, in order to provide the required critical mass to generate institutional change. At the time, this was seen as a precondition for changing the art world, and today it is generally agreed that art institutions need to be globally visible and widely accessible, at a minimum to foster critical thinking and foster imagination.

The writing delivered by the artists and designers was informed by a range of different cultural influences: from the biennial itself, its money and resources, to the biennalee as an institution, and, finally, to the contemporary art world and contemporary art’s audience. As such, the artworks displayed during the biennalee were not representations of an art museum or museum of modern art; rather, they were artefacts of a different kind – artefacts of archiving, archival and ‘hidden’ art. This aspect was emphasised in the biennalee’s website: ‘Art’s archiving, recording and ‘processing’ of artistic memory continues. We are artists, and we get to know and remember art through artefacts such as objects, locations, records and trailblazing artists and curators like Woody Allen, Moira Kenny, Roita Scheller, Maria Hlavajova, Robert H MacDonald</text>

But I don’t think that the level of the local artist or the level of the museum would necessarily align. When you remove the museum from the equation, the level of the grassroots organisation necessarily aligns with the level of the museum. What I would like to do is to create an environment in which artists can have that space-time relation at a lower level than the museum, where the level of the artist is less detectable, and where the needs of the community are more transparent.

I imagine that the level of the artist would have been much more aware of the needs of the community and the art world would have responded accordingly. The fact that it happened at all is a significant step, and it shows that there is still a lot of room for the community to be creative and innovative in how it is represented and produced. The level of the art world would have responded by setting up partnerships with non-profit arts organisations that would have been more attuned to the needs and aspirations of the local community. For example, the Liverpool Biennial would not have been able to produce its own content and community-based art projects through its funding streams, so it’s interesting that the Biennial’s own funding of the arts was significantly curtailed when it was first proposed, because it showed that the art could be done without the support of the art world.</text>

The Portobello Workshop closed in 1985 and was demolished in 1993, but the name and the image of the workshop survive in the building of a new art centre in Toxteth, which is almost exactly opposite to the workshop in Anfield. The new curator’s exhibition for the Biennial in Liverpool is Going Public: The Untold Story of the Palestinian Art Carpet, which documents the workshop’s early history. The new curator’s message is that the story of the Palestinian art carpet is a story worth telling, and that the art gallery is a place where that story can be told.DDownload this article as PDFJamal</text>

I imagine that the curator’s role would be much more focussed on engaging the local community through engaging their stories, engaging their interests, and inviting them into a conversation about what the art world could be like if it had that power.

It’s to connect with an audience, and by that I mean engage them in something that is meaningful, engaging, and allows them to imagine themselves there.

Have the different levels of the biennialised art world – the level of the local artist, the level of the museum and the level of the urban artists – interacted with each other? If so, how? Does the level of the artist matter? Does the level of the museum matter? Does the level of the urban artist matter? If so, then Liverpool is a perfect microcosm of how the different levels of the art world have responded to the same art exhibition. In Liverpool, the level of the artist mattered, and the level of the museum and the level of the urban artist mattered too. But the level of the viewer mattered less: the level of the artist mattered more. The level of the viewer was the level of the artist. This is what I mean when I say that the level of the viewer is the level of the artist. It’s not just that the viewer knows what the artist’s level is; the viewer knows it because that’s what artists do. They’ve all experienced the same level of the art world pressure, and yet different levels of</text>

The Biennial has been invited to develop a new research and design project exploring the role of the museum in the community through a series of events in October 2015. The project will investigate how the architecture of Anfield is the legacy of colonial colonialist policy and how the historical relationship between the city and the island is altered through the building of six new museums and galleries on the island of England. The six galleries and museums will be located in the area of the former Anfield/Liverpool Football Club stadium, which is bisected by the M6 motorway. The proposed works will be situated in the historic streetscape and act as a kind of buffer between the football ground and the city. The biennial will be led by Deborah Morgan, a curator with a</text>

Probably, in public or private, some participants took issue with many of your remarks.I liked what you said about the relationship between biennials and their local artworlds. We’re thinking about this in relation to Liverpool.

I think that in the coming decades, we’ll be able to wirelessly access all of the stored data on the phone, so that there’s no question about where the data is.

Human biology is such that when genes are spliced into a new sequence, the resulting change is going to be additive rather than subtractive. And since the new sequence is going to be inserted back into the tree, there is a risk that the changing of the gene pool isn’t going to be very happy. We are creating a new genome every day, constantly mutating it in the face of very real threats.Human biology is also such that there are going to be big changes to the underlying physics of the world. You’re going to see some really interesting things happening to trees that aren’t there already. You are going to see massive new species emerging out of thin air. I don’t think that is cool. I think that is destructive. And I don’t think that is cool with the technology that we have.</text>

It brings to mind another quote from Bernard Stiegler: ‘Nature is not a parking space». If you take away the parking space, what does that make? It’s an interesting point of departure for thinking about the infrastructure of cities. It’s true that in the past we tended to treat the urban as a fixed landscape that we could always point to and say, well, that’s where all the resources were. But that comes with the ‘nature-human dynamic’ that Stiegler was talking about. Cities today are more and more like islands, with pockets of dense development and the constant need for emergency repairs. There’s no guarantee that infrastructure will always be there for support, but it’s important to note that even with such infrastructure, economic activity tends to happen in the island form. If you remove the island form of the city, you basically end up with a tropical island. Then there’s the second dynamic that</text>

It’s as if we humans have become so embedded in the web of connectivity that we can no longer perceive the forest for the eucalyptus trees. If you take away the human element from the metaphor, we already know what the ecologies are all about. I think that was an interesting one to bring up in the group, because there was a disconnect between what was being imagined by the artist and the realities of the ecologies. For example, when the artist was imagining a forest for the city, the trees certainly served as a prop in the piece – a way to say ‘here’ and ‘here’ is indeed where we are located. However, the reality is that in the city, trees are used as mulch or available real estate by developers. They provide little in the way of value except as a material support system for buildings and a political board that adop</text>

It also gave birth to new legal and political systems that assumed greater political and social powers. A fourth industrial revolution is still underway, and it’s this fourth revolution that is shaping what can and cannot be done with our planet. By the way, Erdos is a lawyer.He’d be best served by doing a Google Image Search for ‘Planetarium’ and searching for ‘Eiffel Tower’ and ‘St George's Church’ and ‘Royal Albert Hall’ and ‘Royal Observatory’ and ‘Royal Greenwich Observatory’ and ‘Royal Astronomical Society’ and ‘Royal Greenwich Observatory’ and ‘Royal Greenwich Observatory’ and ‘Royal Society for the Study of Astronomy’ and ‘Royal</text>

The story goes that the spy ship opened fire, but there is not enough historical context to back up that up. Perhaps, the deep state has instilled this sense of impunity in us, and we are too busy trying to figure out what the hell that means for the rest of us to fire back.The other thing that struck me while thinking about how we produce and consume technology is the extent to which it is connected to geopolitics and economic imperialism, and how that ties into one of the questions of the 21st century: what is it that makes us human? I think that comes up quite a bit in contemporary environmental discourse. There is a way in which we are all interconnected, and that is a good thing.

I think the explosion of smartphones is just another example of this needle getting caught up in the massive transnational telecommunications industry that we have built. It’s no exaggeration to suggest that Apple has over 400,000 employees. When you consider just the people who design and operate the phones, it’s clear that these numbers are compiled from thousands of lines of programming that users write into their phones. It’s no exaggeration to say that Google has over 8,000 employees. The point is that these numbers are compiled from the ground up.

It brings to mind another quote from Bill Nye: ‘If nature isn’t going to do it, then at least someone else will.’ That seems so simple and direct, but it’s also something that happens all the time in the tech world. It’s not always obvious what that someone else is going to do, but the fact that they have to is a fundamental aspect of the growing up of technology.The thing is, though, that there are far more opportunities for disruption in the service of art and culture than in the service of industrial production. I don’t mean in the negative sense of techno-utopianism: the disruptive effect of AI and other machine learning might well be more positive than negative. I mean in the sense that it might be possible to engage in what Baucom called ‘artificially curated’ biannual exhibitions that aim to disturb convention and formalise the unusual.

When I started work on the Delhi Metro Rail project, the BM and the DM jointly owned the project. There was no union for them to speak of. The project was a joint venture between the BM and the Delhi Metro Railways, a private company. So the question that people had was, who has the right to speak for the project? BM: Yes, there was a big difference between the past when people used to come to the Biennale and the present. The past was congested with meetings of the AAP, which was why the Art Board and the Artisans were in such disarray. The present is much more mobile, and people are coming to the exhibitions because they have been inspired by the stories told at the festival, by the ARTisans, by their friends and family.

When is the last time you had a meaningful interaction with a person who is not the person you think they are? BM: I think that is an interesting point of reference. I do remember one particular conversation that I had with a curator in the early 1990s who had a very different take on things. He was doing research for a biography that he was writing at the time, and he was interviewing key figures in the non-profit sector who had all said the same thing: there is no alternative to privatising infrastructure. The only way to make it sustainable is to cut services and raise taxes, so the only way to do it is to cut services and raise more taxes. As I recall, he was thinking about the massive federal government projects that were being put in place at the time, like the interstate highway system or the urban-research institute. He was thinking, am I imagining things? These were all projects that were clearly being put into motion</text>

The BM is asking, how much does each of us own? The DM is asking, how much does each of us desire for our own consumption? When one of us is dying, the other one is asking, what now? These are long, complex questions, and I think the answer to them is going to be complicated. But I think what we are finding is that the problems that we are confronting are really intractable, and that there are ways of coming to agreement about how to move forward that are not going to result in a return to the past. A lot of what is being proposed is simply not possible. This is one example.  The other is one of my favorite quotations from Arundhati Roy: The biennial is the mass extinction of the American cultural landscape. It is a form of cultural imperialism that is being devoured by a humanistic society. And as soon as the biennial is no longer a</text>

For example, the Asian Infrastructure project started by the BM, the Delhi Metro Rail project started by the DM, and by and large, any kind of infrastructure projects that are being mooted across the globe are by and large being pulled on behalf of governments and non-profit bodies. So the question that people have is, what does it mean when all bets are on one person? When all bets are on one person? When is it always going to be that way? If all bets are on the same person, then that creates a much bigger potential pool of people who can be affected by the loss of life. So a biennial that engages with these kinds of questions, that is not necessarily about the usual in-the-making, long-term prognosis of a city, but is rather about the acuteness of the problem, the state of emergency that a city is in, and how it is affected by events – how it is affected by its vulnerability, and vulnerability – and how that affects the potential of that city to be a centre for creative activity and innovation? I think that is a question that has not been enough addressed. I think that the biennial format has unfortunately tended to ignore this deeper, more fundamental problem with our current form of city-building, or made it something that it is not: a problem that can be addressed with the least amount of intervention. I think that the very</text>

When one person can and should make all those bets? When one person can and should not? That is, of course, assuming that the community has any agency in the first place. But the fact of the bet being taken by governments and non-profits, and that is what is happening all over the world, creates a radically different kind of agency from what we might experience in our everyday lives.  	As biennials become more institutionalized, the stakes get higher: what used to be termed the grassroots (or public) is turning into something more and more identified with the museum and its collections. And what is happening in Bengaluru now is just another manifestation of this in all of India: the biennial is the museum of the future, and while it may be an institution that is developing into what it means to be a biennial, it is a museum developing into what it means to be a museum.

And how does one balance that against the fact that people are dying in ways that are beyond their control? In many ways, it is the ability to become embroiled in a very personal, very moving thing that is the true measure of the success of a project. And when that is the case, the biennial can really go places. But it cannot, and cannot, become a place in which the interests of the few and the many are ever in alignment.It is true that biennials tend to have a very particular set of institutional interests, and in general, the interests of art are those of the artist. And it is true that biennials have a particular relationship to their sites of production – which is to say, a particular relationship to the place where they are made, and how they are made there. But that is not all that institutionalises a biennial. It is more that, in the main, institutions always want what is</text>

And this is true whether the system is public or private. As I have noted, the private sphere tends to be much more responsive to the interests of a community, while the public sphere tends to perversely allocate resources in a way that tends to make things worse. The reason for this is that the interests of the wealthy tend to override those of the masses. When the rich person in question spends more of their fortune on a project in developing a particular area, than they do on buying land in an area, or on hiring people to build structures for a site, the local people tend to take matters of community</text>

She was invited by the museum to explore the so-called ‘fourth wall’ – the boundary between the museum and the city. The idea was that visitors to the museum would step through a small passage leading to the site of an exhibition, and then step through another passage leading to the site of another exhibition. In each of the three biennials, a similar set of spaces was selected. Visitors to the museum, through the museum itself or other means, entered the city through the selected sites. In each case, the biennials were organised as a ‘school’, with each representing an area of the city rich in cultural resources and full of historical stories. The idea was that each area had its own cultural department, which could draw visitors from far and wide to explore its past, present and future. In the case of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (S.F.M.A.), the site selection process began early in the morning, as visitors were beginning to arrive early. I.D.P.P.S. –  	</text>

She was invited by the museum to explore the so-called ‘fourth wall’ – the location of the museum where artistically significant texts are discovered – and the potential of the site to host a biennale. Her 2014 solo show, ‘Tinker Belles and Taffy’, featured works created through the exchange of culture for the purposes of the exhibition. In 2015, Njabulo Ndebele made a similar connection between contemporary art and the location of an international art fair: ‘The Biennale’, Johannesburg’s first edition, established a common currency between contemporary art and the international art fair of the same name. ‘Tinkering’ is the art of changing one’s aesthetic environment to accommodate artworks of different kinds, in other words, artworks that have a special social use in and for the community. �We explore these ideas through the example of the San Francisco Biennale, which became international in character and, through its exchange on the international art fair market, the subject</text>

She was invited by the museum to explore the so-called ‘fourth wall’ – the boundary between the museum and the real world. In the museum, the fourth wall is generally regarded as having been breached, and there is a growing consensus that the breach will not be repaired in time for the next Venice Biennale. In Piddock’s case, the breaking of the fourth wall is a precondition for the subsequent emergence of a ‘political action committee’ (E. Fred Burton Foundation, 2014).  	[i]  In the case of an artist-led cultural exchange, the work is not necessarily intended to serve any political purpose, but rather to reveal contradictions, to expose hidden or obscured agendas.  	[ii] Søren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Anxiety (1879), in Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 42, No. 2, p.285.Download this article as PDFAna Laura López de la TorreAna Laura López de la Torre is Professor of</text>

She was invited by the museum to explore the so-called ‘fourth wall’ – the boundary between the museum and the city, between the museum and the museum collection – by way of a ‘gaze’ at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which separates the museum from the city.[1] In this gaze, the visitor is invited to ‘peek inside a city’s closed and policed medieval silo, which is run by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (S.F.M.A.) and its collection of fine art objects. Although the silos are housed in separate buildings, they share common architecture, corridors, materials and fittings, and the same curatorial approach, so visitors can ‘step back’ into the city through the silos and take a closer look at the past. Through a combination of archival research and the assistance of a local historian, Piddock was able to uncover the story of the silos through the purchase of a book, Making the City Stable: The Political and</text>

She was invited by the museum to explore the so-called ‘fourth wall’ – the area in and around the MOCAD headquarters that separate the museum from the city. Here, the biennale is able to experiment with the idea of the ‘present’ and the juxtaposition of contemporary and museum art, showcasing the differences between the two forms. The tour was also part of the commissioning process for the Museum of Contemporary Art’s exhibition, Art After Moore, that year.Art after Moore (2016–17) is the result of a two-year, $3.5 million project by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to catalogue and present the extensive archive of American artworks made in the context of the city during the 1970s and 1980s, which includes nearly 4,000 objects from the MOCAD archives, as well as a large number of archival materials and drawings. It is the first major archival release from the MOCAD vaults, and the only one from the Moore archive. Art after Moore is the result of</text>

She was invited by the museum to explore the so-called ‘fourth wall’ – the virtual wall surrounding the museum that blocks access to the museum and its collections. While the physical wall is a fiction, the notion of the fictional wall is always real, and the notion of the virtual wall is a precondition for the actualization of any fiction. In the context of the 2016 Venice Biennale, Anna Piddock’s tour was a ‘reality check’ for artists and curators facing similar challenges. Many of the artists who participated in the tour returned for its production, but it is the curators who have been actively engaged in the production of the event, and so a critical body of exhibition design has emerged alongside the artist’s exhibition space. For a broader overview of this, see ‘Art as a Political-Situationist Narrative’.  In the event, the ‘third’ was used to introduce the new work that was displayed alongside elements from the previous works in a series of ‘painting and</text>

She was invited by the museum to explore the so-called ‘fourth wall’ – the line separating the museum from the present – and the wall behind the Biennale, where the artist’s works are displayed. She visited the museum twice a week between September and December 2014. The third time she visited the museum in January 2015. Her tour was part of the Biennale, and part of a public ‘crowdsurfing’ event that year. During this time, the museum was seeking ways to support the artist’s humanitarian work, and the biennale was finding new ways to support the work of the art collective it was commissioning to develop a new series of works based around the themes of the 2014 Venice Biennale – including the need for such a work to be commissioned. The museum was also looking for ways to support an artist’s proposal to create ‘a longer-term relationship’ with the museum through the commissioning of an ‘asset lock’ with the group.

The project was conceived by the Museum of Modern Art's Exploratorium and part of the museum’s Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, exploring the literary, cinematic and architectural histories of the US, foreign and urban environments. Artistic Director of the Exploratorium, Peter Schjeldahl, said of the project:It’s a trip down memory lane – a journey through the places and events that made us uncomfortable as visitors to the museum, but that made us want to be able to point to something and say, ‘That’s us.’ It’s the moment of our hero’s, or perhaps our critic’s</text>

She was invited by the museum to explore the so-called ‘fourth wall’ – the line between the museum and the city in the event that the museum is moved – and her music. The performance, which began in the museum’s Victoria and Edward Galer Human-Centred Theater, evolved into a multimedia installation in the museum, where participants took part in a scavenger hunt for relics of the museum’s past. Anna was one of the artists chosen to participate in the project, and her work appeared in various places, including on a stainless-steel statue outside the museum, in part to document the events that took place during the San Francisco Biennale.Birds of Paradise is the story of two Africanized women who, after an initial encounter on a desert island, embark on a perilous journey into the interior of Mauritius. Drawing on their own imaginations and the work of other artists, they encounter the paradoxes of island life – its people, their language, its customs – and the inequality and oppression of contemporary life on Mauritius.
