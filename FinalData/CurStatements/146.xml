The DARPA Robotics Challenge is using autonomous vehicles and robotics to aid in the recovery of infrastructure, including in areas around the world threatened with destruction by rising seas and a growing human population.In both ‘natural’ and ‘man-made’ disasters, autonomous vehicles and robotics are the tools of last resort. They are used in extreme circumstances to help restore infrastructure or to assist in the destruction of infrastructure in an effort to preserve life as long as possible. In April 2017, a US federal jury in Los Angeles awarded a California man $3.5 billion in damages to six industrial cities and a Native Hawaiian community over claims that the driverless trucks were involved in the deaths of six to eight million people in Los Angeles and other California cities.In October 2017, a jury in Fremont, California, awarded $1.4 billion to the families of six men and one woman who died in a crash involving a semi-truck and a tractor-trailer on a rural road in 2014.In both California and Texas</text>

In both ‘Rethink Fishing’ and ‘Smart Ponds’, we are harnessing the environmental and social benefits of cutting-edge science and technology to create alternative livelihoods for local communities. In both cases, the communities are the inhabitants of the technology – not corporate interests – that are being affected.In the case of  	Smart Ponds, the village councilors who developed the technology and invited us to try out fish-detection systems are engaged in public education about the benefits and drawbacks of such activities.

The DARPA Robotics Challenge is using these same technologies to help farmers in Uzbekistan and Pakistan repurpose antiquated vehicles to make them useful again.In both cases, the technology allows users to reconfigure semi-automatic or automatic vehicles in ways that mimic natural disaster and other human-made disturbances. In both cases, the reconfiguration is done using existing infrastructure – a future version of what Ford Motor Company did with its assembly line in the 1970s.Darpa has invested heavily in developing self-repairing technology. At the same time, it has been developing ways to use intelligent machines to do more. In an effort to support research into self-healing materials and building materials, the agency is using the funds to set up a $100 million federally-funded autonomous vehicle research lab.The goal of these projects is to create self-repairing infrastructure through research and development, with the hope that the technologies would one day be used to repair damage done to infrastructure by human activity.

The DARPA Robotics Challenge is using these same technologies to investigate the possibility of creating self-sustaining localised ‘provisioning local economies’. These could provide critical information about threats to infrastructure, including information about the kinds of infrastructures – such as water and electricity systems – that are vulnerable to attack.Darpa is also using advanced science and engineering to create self-sustaining mini-agro-periphery-like ‘micro-grids’ that can grow on their own and are self-sustaining through the interaction of local and ‘deep learning’ algorithms. These micro-grids would reduce the need for long-term storage and maintenance, and the need for massive amounts of energy, and also reduce the need for large amounts of pollution-control infrastructure.  This last technology is expected to reduce the need for large amounts of power, at least in the short term.Darpa is using advanced science and engineering to create micro-grids</text>

In the wake of these developments, he advocates a radically different approach: a radically different kind of emergency. In the film, Duarte advocates a kind of humanitarian utopia – a utopian future where people simply exist – in which people are not created equal and cannot be compared. He advocates a peaceful co-existence based on mutual aid and respect.In this vision, the inevitable end result of war would be avoided altogether. People would coexist in a non-violent way, with no government at all.This sounds daft, but it is the only way to avoid becoming embroiled in a global conflict that</text>

It began in 2011 and is being funded in part with a $50 million contract from the US Department of Energy. The challenge follows the path of the physicist Frank Chun, who proposed the idea of robotics to the military during the Korean War. DARPA responded with a top-secret program that put scientists at the peak of its robotics team.The DARPA Robotics Challenge is using existing science and engineering infrastructure to create autonomous vehicles and other combat-ready systems that operate autonomously and in cooperation with larger organizations. The vehicles would operate in large-scale havoc, but also gather and analyze huge amounts of data on traffic, terrain and weather. The challenge asks: what if we could use robotics to make things in our world a little bit better?The program is led by Prof. Daniela Ginsburg of the Massachusetts</text>

In the case of Iraq and Afghanistan, however, the future is a very different one. As the current geopolitical landscape of the Middle East shifts towards conflict, the future could very well see the emergence of alternative energy supplies through the direct actions of autonomous vehicles and drones. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the rise of autonomous vehicles and the associated proliferation of military hardware presents a set of troubling new challenges.These developments have profound effects on the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. As autonomous vehicles become more advanced and pervasive, the likelihood that such systems will be used to identify, detain or even murder people increases. The proliferation of</text>

But the adoption of such technologies does not necessarily mean a return to a pre-constituted and pastoral city. The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of aesthetic contemplation and endearing spectacle. Art has been trained to handle and analyse new data sets, and its potential is harnessed to meet today’s infrastructure needs. But an art that is willing to uncork such resources, even at the expense of aesthetic considerations, must also be able to deal with the ambiguities and tensions of new data-production and consumption. 	Art has a responsibility to offer options and resist the urge to make people ‘good’ through industrial production. But this is doubly essential in a world-system that depends on the assumption that every person has access to all the goods and resources of the system. 	Art has a responsibility to offer such choices, too. But that is doubly so: a responsibility to offer such choices at a price and with such a message. A responsibility that would be both morally and economically dubious, but one that also exerts a tremendous amount of political and social pressure. The critique of capitalism is not going</text>

But the adoption of such technologies does not necessarily mean a return to a pre-constituted and pastoral city. The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of aesthetic and political veneration. 	I would propose that the installation of new technologies and the metropolis as objects of consumption are designed with data in mind as a dialectical relationship. The development of ever-more powerful computers and massive data capture and processing apparatuses is understood as necessary to address the ever-expanding digital footprint of the metropolis. Such technological devices allow artistic and architectural interventions that can bypass the need for large-scale, sustained public engagement campaigns and instead rely on data to monitor and collect behaviour. 	Art has often been used as a platform to question the social and political origins of technological innovation. In the 1980s and 1990s, the social and political context of computerisation and the explosion of data-processing apparatuses was a pivotal point in the history of science and technology. 	But recent computer and internet technologies render the social more accessible. New media technologies such as Facebook and Instagram allow citizens to become unwitting participants in a social and economic transaction that</text>

But the adoption of such technologies does not necessarily mean a return to a pre-constituted and pastoral city. The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of aesthetic contemplation and symbolic repetition. Architecture has often been used as a device that interposes between people and the socio-political processes that produce and is produced by it, at times employing symbolism and mythologies that foreshadow the present conditions but do not fully capture them. 	For example, the cathedral’s cathedral keystone structure, a massive roundel, arched ceiling and rich collection of mosaics and figurines, is itself a mythological figure who, as the late Christopher Booker noted, pre-existed the city and its venerable tradition:  	&quot;The cathedral is not an object, it is a figure, a complex arrangement of things that happen to be pretty, and that are pleasing to look at. … The cathedral is a figure that exists outside the city, that intervenes in and creates the city, and that is thus seen by many people who happen to live in it.&quot;15 And many modern urban centres seem to follow this logic even when it comes</text>

But the adoption of such technologies does not necessarily mean a return to a pre-constituted and pastoral city. The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of contemplation and production. 	The smart meter is just one example of a technology manifesting itself in more subtle ways. 	Other technologies that have made a greater impact on urban environments are the proliferation of data-processing units (CPUs), which convert data into usable form; the rise of service-delivery networks (SDNs), which link content providers and end users; the rise of Uber and other alternative taxi services; and the dispersal of service-industry jobs among the millions of workers in the connected sectors. All of these developments were more or less pre-suppressed or completely automated during the 1980s and 1990s, but continue to be vital to the survival of modern capitalism. 	While the proliferation of electronics and data-processing units in the 1990s that are capable of handling the massive amounts of data generated by the metropolis makes for fascinating reading, the sheer volume of data generated by the metropolis itself makes for disturbing reading. Industrialised nations produce more data</text>

But the adoption of such technologies does not necessarily mean a return to a pre-constituted and pastoral city. The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of aesthetic fascination and political critique. And yet, as recent megacities and their intensive use of data-storage become more a result of the behaviour of human beings rather than artefacts of industrialisation, the object that was once thought to be so intrinsically linked to the city is being gradually replaced. This is happening in part because of the seductive effect of data: humans are bombarded with it in ever-increasing quantities, and in part because of the seductive effect of culture: images and data disseminate across social media platforms that render the city into ‘mentality’. 	The cultural resonance of the metropolis is waning. Its architectural form, once a staple of international trade, has been rendered non-essential by the pernicious influence of data. But the cultural resonance of the metropolis is waning as well. The global networked economy that emerged from the Internet is displacing local sources of meaning and meaning-making, and so it is with all urban forms</text>

The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of aesthetic or political veneration. 	The smart meter and the satellite farm do not, for instance, appear to represent a future with a resolution to the persistent conflicts that still characterize the present. As recently as 2007, the Peroti Hotel was embroiled in a political and social crisis surrounding the eviction of the local Bedouin community from its properties in the central district of the hotel. The conflict came about as a result of the Bedouin community's repeated refusal to vacate the properties – a process that became so frequent that Bedouin activists became accustomed to the presence of armed security forces. Rapid development and the metropolis are produced without any sense of place – not without loss of natural beauty – and leave no trace of the processes that created them.

But the adoption of such technologies does not necessarily mean a return to a pre-constituted and pastoral city. The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of aesthetic contemplation and contemplation of the physical landscape. Indeed, the proliferation of data-processing power and dense populations in cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to countryside either. The metropolis emerged not as a result of technological innovation but of long-term historical patterns of exchange and culture – patterns that continue to shape our ideas of what constitutes a ‘true city’ and the kinds of urban environments that can support its life – patterns of exchange and culture that are rooted in historical precedents. The metropolis is a social production for the social and not a technological imagination. It emerges through and through other social formations and through processes of change. But it is never completely understood or fully eradicated from urban and suburban environments. This is one reason why theoretical work and theoretical reflection on the city are so valuable: they allow us to learn and to live in ways that are still recognisable within the sphere of aesthetics, but which nevertheless exert a significant influence on our ideas of what constitutes a true city</text>

But the interventions of technologists in the city – the ‘smart meters’ and the satellite farms that monitor and collect data on the behaviour of people – are even more prevalent and seem to be gaining in political and urban-cultural terms.

But the adoption of such technologies does not necessarily mean a return to a pre-constituted and pastoral city. The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of contemplation and reflection. New urban developments, whether technological, financial or both, are often accompanied by a proliferation of cultural institutions – arts venues, cultural gardens, arts management companies, performing arts centers, educational institutions – whose mission is to feed and support the ever-expanding consumer base via cultural consumption and adoption. These cultural institutions – whether traditional or cultural-led – may be the stepping stones to yet another set of increasingly important services provided by the city: the provision of affordable housing, the provision of critical infrastructure, the provision of valuable services, among others. All of these can be defined as functions of some kind. The question becomes whether the city is indeed capable of supporting its own culture, or whether it is subject to the vagaries and idiosyncrasies of the whims of a rapidly changing economy and culture. The answer to that question may yet become evident in the long run, but for now the suspicion remains that the former is increasingly preferable to the latter. That is, the cultural institutions</text>

But the adoption of such technologies does not necessarily mean a return to a pre-constituted and pastoral city. The proliferation of data-processing power and cities does not necessarily correspond with a return to the city as an object of contemplation and occasionally of destruction. Nor does it necessarily correspond with an end to conflict and conflict. 	Instead, as has been evident throughout the history of the metropolis, the metropolis is being driven by data-processing power that is increasingly sensitive to the urban environment and increasingly sensitive to the particular needs of the capitalist city. And although the technologist-led transition to a greener and more ecological city is a necessary and desirable aspect of any post-Fordist transformation, the ever-intensifying competition for access to scarce resources, territories and human capital is also essential to the success of that transformation. The emergence of disruptive technologies does not necessarily herald a return to the former glory of the city – although many of the displaced workers and populations will undoubtedly reacquire the arts and heritage of the once-robust city – but it does seem to exacerbate and augment the problems caused by the increasingly pervasive forms of capital and resource dependency that it displace.

It is a place of encounter, exchange, and repetition. And it is a place of what Matthew Arnold, in his incisive work on what he calls the ‘episodic’ in contemporary art, calls ‘re-constituting the temporal’. �“Re-constituting the temporal”’ means rethinking and creating new temporal frameworks, which in turn, can create new spatial frameworks, that can shape, shape, and morph, and are part of a continually expanding and evolving public gallery of encounters, encounters, encounters, and recurrence. Arnold speaks of these as the assets of the digital age; they are part of the site where encounter, exchange and repetition take place, part of what he calls the curatorial meta-struggle.

The public gallery as an archive of art’s making is a place where art, ideas and encounters collide and come to terms with experience. It is a place where art, knowledge and encounters meet up to form narratives and find solutions. It is a place where art, metaphor and practice collide to form new ways of arranging things. It is a place where art, theory and practice collide to form new ways of understanding the world.  The public gallery as an archive of art’s making begins to look to the future, and in part, this is a reflection of the fact that we live in a social media age. The biennial format, which has seen artists create works in response to specific events in their particular biennial, is a technology that can and must be written about and discussed. It becomes evident that the artworks created within it, even if they are not intended to be taken literally, are often figurative, poetic, artistic or even absurd in their applications.

It is a place where ideas and facts are put into one another’s face, in order to provoke an exchange, an encounter, an encounter that shapes the future of that city.  (JL)  A public gallery is a site for the production of knowledge, for the transmutation of ideas, for the accrual of knowledge, and, above all, for the production of encounter. It is a place where concepts and knowledge collide, in what sociologist Helga Nowotny calls a ‘critical encounter’. In other words, what counts as knowledge in the academy is more or less what counts as knowledge outside of the academy. And what counts as encounter outside the academy is a growing concern of ours.  (G)  A public gallery is a site for the production of knowledge through encounters</text>

The public gallery has, since its beginning, been a place of encounters, exchanges, and again and again to gather, exchange, and discover. It is a place of repetition, because it is always on the alert for a new entry into the canon of art objects and forms, and it is ever on the lookout for a new form of management of its assets.  The public gallery is a site of acquisition, and it is a site of acquisition, acquisition, acquisition, acquisition.  As artworks are acquired, their meaning is constantly in flux and change. As acquisition goes on, it is also a site of reclamation, in which the acquired works are used, shared, and enjoyed anew. Acquisition, as such, is a dynamic term, and art’s contemporary and even contemporary art have their share of misadventures and disappointments to contend with. But there is one persistent and relatively new entrant into the field that is gaining a footing and making headway in what is often described as</text>

It is a place of encounter, not necessarily an encounter with an encounter, but an exchange between two or more individuals or groups. So it is a place where ideas clash, where language clashes, where images clash, where images are made with sharp ends and in many cases, where ideas are used to justify or rationalise existing social arrangements.

    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial has been announced as one of ten projects for the &quot;Architecture of the Future City&quot; programme. The other projects are: the proposed ‘Future City Project’ for the city’s waterfront, the proposed development of Canary Wharf, the proposed erection of a new airport runway in the form of a ‘temporary high-speed rail link between Liverpool and London’s docks’, the proposed establishment of a global city network of parallel universes, and the exploration of alternative urban forms.The announcement was accompanied by a set of new, city-specific proposals. These addressed the perceived inadequacies of the existing architecture survey (with its focus on the United States) and suggested new approaches to the problem posed by a rapidly urbanising planet (with a rapidly developing metropolis).

The potentialities of this kind of ‘emerging’ urbanism are many and far reaching. It is the responsibility of the urbanist of today to be aware of these possibilities and to shape them into viable future urban futures. This could mean developing alternative strategies for housing, transit, culture, travel and so forth. It could also mean developing strategies to control and co-opt these possibilities into fulfilling useful roles, such as for the benefit of a rapidly expanding metropolis.The decision to establish a new generation of architects and urbanists was made at the Biennale itself in October of that year. This was partly in order to make room for another project, this time focused on the design of an entirely new generation of major urban centres. The new urban planning and urbanisation projects of the future should build on the strengths of the past two centuries, rather than falling prey to the ravages of globalisation and its discontents. The new urbanists were instructed. ‘Do it well, and it will be a ‘tidbituosa’ later.  Such was the sense of this new generation of urbanists.

The potentialities of this kind of ‘emerging’ urbanism are many and far reaching. It is the responsibility of the urbanist of today to be aware of these possibilities and to shape their development. This new kind of urbanism does not necessarily correspond to the old urbanisms of the past, nor even to the old global urbanisms of the past, but it should nevertheless address the issues of sustainability and connectedness that are increasingly evident in the urban landscape. It should seek to build alternative forms of urban existence based on local knowledge and informed preferences. This kind of ‘new’ urbanism is not necessarily a replacement for the old, but it should at least modulate its effects in the future planning stages of the ‘constant’.

It is the responsibility of the urbanist of today to be aware of these possibilities and to act accordingly.The proposals in this volume do not attempt to present the totality of emerging urbanism, nor do they attempt to represent the urban future. Their stated aim is to ‘ground the contemporary urban experience in an image consistent with the philosophy and ideals of evolution’. But this ‘imagining the city’ is primarily a means to an end – to create an ‘image consistent with the city’ – and so these projects have their images not of the future but of the present. They are images of cities in transition, in transition from development to culture, in transition from the city to the countryside, in transition from the city to the wilderness, in transition from the city to the sea, in and on into the future.These images capture moments in time – of the present and of the past – in order to suggest strategies for the future urbanisation of the planet. The images in this volume capture the emergence of new modes of urban existence consistent with the evolving image</text>

This may include a consideration of possible city alternatives, but more and more today it is evident that the only way to expand one’s city is through the infrastructure of the city – infrastructure that is, in many cases, already obsolete or nonexistent. The infrastructure of the city has become the infrastructure of globalisation – global cities. It may be the case, of course, that the only way to expand one’s city is through the infrastructure of the city itself. But this is the dominant form of infrastructure today, and its development is largely controlled by the private sector. The city is expected to expand at a phenomenal rate – from California’s historical per capita growth of 6% to almost 24% in the next twenty years – largely because of the overwhelming infrastructural capacity required to support it. Therefore, it is easy to understand the desire to preserve what little urban architecture remains in the wake of such rapid change. But there are other structural reasons why cities are</text>

The potentialities of this kind of ‘emerging’ urbanism are many and far reaching. It is the responsibility of the urbanist of today to be aware of these possibilities and to act with extreme sensitivity to the ecology that is being threatened by the built environment.The proposals were received with much enthusiasm and appeared in numerous publications around the world in the years that followed. The enthusiasm and focus on problems of urbanisation are afoot in every country of the world. The world population is set to grow from 9.6 billion people in 2050 to 11 billion people in 2050, and urbanisation is projected to account for 40% of the growth. A growing planet is a growing city, and cities are expected to become ever more diverse places due to the inefficiency of the fossil-fuel based economy. However, the diversity projected for the city is almost entirely manufactured and the infrastructure of the city is an enormous administrative burden. The reason why cities are so resource-intensive is that they are places with a large number of inhabitants; the density necessary to support a given number of inhabitants is unsustainable in an ever-expanding planet. Therefore, the size and shape of the city – the number</text>

This is the role of the city planner of today, and it is a role well worth preserving.The proposals form part of a much broader theme that emerges from the report ‘Building a Future for London’. This is the opportunity lost in translation, or glossed over, by the prevailing narrative of the last twenty years. It is the opportunity that is being denied and rendered invisible in the city of London, which is being rapidly transformed into something else – a vast new airport terminal, a museum campus, a European district with its own European Quarter, and so forth. For many of us here in Liverpool, and for many others watching from afar, these developments are but brief epiphanies on a wider trend of globalisation. I do not mean to suggest that these developments are not important in their own way, nor that their mere presence does not matter.

The other projects are: the proposed ‘Future City Project’ for the city’s waterfront, the proposed development of Canary Wharf, the proposed erection of a new airport runway in the form of a ‘temporary high-speed rail link between Liverpool and London’s docks’, the proposed establishment of a global city network of parallel universes, and the exploration of alternative urban forms.The announcement was accompanied by a set of new, city-specific proposals. These addressed the perceived inadequacies of the existing architecture survey (with its focus on the United States) and suggested new approaches to the problem posed by a rapidly urbanising planet (with a rapidly developing metropolis). The potentialities of this kind of ‘emerging’ urbanism are many and far reaching. It is the responsibility of the urbanist of today to be aware of these possibilities and to shape the future of their city accordingly.  One can argue that the attempts to imagine a ‘Future City’ that is not based in the present are, in their current form, retrofitting the past. They are attempting to plug the future, but not in the sense of envisioning its development but in the sense of envisioning future urban settings that are not based on the ruins of the past. Such retrofitting would mean abandoning the present in favour of the future, which is already developed to such an extent that it cannot be built back up again. Such a project would mean abandoning the present in favour of the future, which is already here and is developing at an ever increasing clip. Such a project would mean abandoning urbanism itself and embracing of a future that is not based on the ruins of the past. Such projects call into question the very raison d'être of the urbanist to begin with. In my opinion, the only way to ensure that the present is not</text>

The potentialities of this kind of ‘emerging’ urbanism are many and far reaching. It is the responsibility of the urbanist of today to be aware of these possibilities and to act. The question is: what can the urbanist of tomorrow do with these technologies? The new architecture of the future city will have to be global in character – reaching places and peoples not currently served by the mainstream infrastructure. It will have to address the issues of displacement, of climate change, of large scale, decentralised data-collecting, of course, but also of course of massive data-storage and processing infrastructure. And it will have to be responsive to the needs of a rapidly developing metropolis – recognizing the emergent quality of the metropolis as a result of historical and contemporary innovations, of course, and the influence of these on the future of the city. We don’t yet know what the boundaries of this kind of city-processing might be. But we do know that the kind of infrastructure suggested for the future city will be global in character. The question becomes: what can the urbanist of tomorrow do with this kind of infrastructure? The answer is clear: act</text>

The potentialities of this kind of ‘emerging’ urbanism are many and far reaching. It is the responsibility of the urbanist of today to be aware of these possibilities and to act accordingly. Liverpool Biennial is not the first to attempt such a thing, nor will it be the last. But it is a significant and influential one, and its announcement did much to spark a fire under the city’s nascent urban design community to action. The Biennial’s financial model is unique and ambitious. The venue is centrally located in a city, and tickets are individually bundled in a strong gift card that is good for three years. Moreover, the biennial is the only entity to have a direct financial stake in the city. It is the ultimate in both the senses of the phrase. It is the museum of urban development, yet it is also the museum of urban destruction.Such is the urban problem. We cannot all be urbanisers and all of us must all work in different ways. The task is to find common ground, to understand that we are capable of organising ourselves into practical ways of making cities possible, and to act upon that capacity collectively. That is</text>

In general terms, rail is an option for high-speed travel between major cities in the western world. It is possible to grow weary of travelling by sea or by land and to allow rail to take you far enough to experience the wonders of the planet in a matter of minutes. However, this only works for large ships: the kind designed by architects who actually build and alter them. For smaller ships, such as the kind built by architects, the option is either to use the ocean as a cistern or to import crude oil from other parts of the world. In either case, the cost is prohibitive and the environmental impacts are devastating. Henceforth, major cities will have to find other modes of travel. For the foreseeable future, this will mean air travel on large scale commercial carriers. But there are other modes of travel besides air travel that will be possible</text>

The slaves ‘were the most elastic and at ease in the presence of White’,’ wrote White, in a poem entitled ‘Slaves and Dreamers’.‘The voices we ‘re singing from the very banks of the mighty Mississippi are the echoes of a once vast ocean’, which later on was ‘reduced to the size of a child’s figure.White concludes his poem with a sentence that comes directly from the Mississippi narrative: ‘To a slave, freedom is an old story told again and again.’This is the first in a two-part essay on Mississippi history and culture.

He was an intellectual equal to White in intellectual and rhetorical domains. Yet White was more than a literary talent. He was a statesman-like statesman-like statesman-like in fact. He knew how to use violence to achieve political ends. He was able to manipulate the media and academia to suit his own ends. He was an intellectual poet and knowing how to use language effectively too.

He crafted the image of White as a savage and barbarian, leading gangs of slaves into the hills and deserts of Syria and Iraq, where they were either beheaded or mutilated for their deformities. The slave narratives would have us believe that White was beyond reproach, that he was some kind of divine avenger – a kind of superhuman avenger. So he crafted a myth about White that was both monstrous and poetic. It was a myth of superhuman power.White managed to find a home for his work in the Empire State Building, where it was adopted and where it remained, untouchable, until the early twentieth century. Then something like The Scarlet Letter was written about it and made the jump to the screen. A myth was born.When I first saw The Scarlet Letter and read the manuscript, it occurred to me that the character Romain White was not the same person as the poet Guy Debord. White is a pseudonym, created by Debord to avoid being identified as a writer. He is a master of the complex disguise of an anti-Semite: an Arab proverb says, ‘Thou shalt not name any more than two gods’, ‘and</text>

If anything, the slave-owners were more likely to invent a myth about the slave-holding nature of the British Empire. The slave narrative is a creation of the media and the PR departments of the state. When the press started publishing slave narratives, including those of Harriet Beecher Stowe and John Romain White, the reaction was swift and brutal. White was a leading figure, a PR man, a poet and a writer. He was a master of the spin. He crafted the image of White as a savage and barbarian, leading gangs of slaves into the hills and deserts of Syria and Iraq, where they were either beheaded or mutilated for their deformities. The slave narratives became the objects of ridicule. White was a master of the complex. He could invent many many many more horrific myths. He simply could not create a mythology around the idea of a collective human community of people struggling to survive in conditions that are neither natural nor convenient.The fact that creative people can and do overthrow institutionalised hierarchies is a testament to the resilience of non-authoritarian practices. The history of anti-authoritarian practices in the UK is a history of subordination, resistance and revolution. There were times when it looked as though things might get worse for the miners, rail workers and others who worked for and with the state. The miners strike of 1887 was among the first to call into question both the logic of the regulatory state and the humanity of capitalist infrastructure. In recent decades, there has been a steady erosion of the institutionalised Welsh Streets tradition, with high streets everywhere characterised by codes, rules and regulations drafted by and for the financial sector.

The practice of beheading slaves was widespread. White was a celebrity. He controlled the narrative, and the image, of the Slave Empire. He created the icon of the chained slave, the lynchpin of a powerful propaganda machine. He established the myth of Whitehall, Queenston, where Whitehall ‘station’ was established as the site of operations of the newly minted ‘White Lion’ – Whitechapel Row, where the executed slaves were taken and organisations such as the Whitechapel ‘Temple’ established as the site of future ‘Whitechapel’ homes.’[8]Whitechapel Row’ was a site of violence and repression long before the end of the First Opium War in 18 Kent was decided. Between 18 Kent and Kok Chai in Burma, plantations were established on both sides of the River Kelvin. Port cities such as Whitechapel Row were key sites for the opium trade,</text>

The media caricatures weren’t entirely wrong. A person has a hard‑wired tendency to classify things as good or bad when presented with a group of people, a crowd, in a situation. While it is true that White was a master of the over-hyped and under-recognised Victorian poet laureate Ezra Pound, who wrote several poems about the ‘eagle’ and ‘thrust’ of writing, one should not underestimate the influence and the potency of White’s work. Pound’s poem was partly a response to the slave narratives White was embedding in the English language, and his reflections on language as a production for power and domination.White’s work was a response to the slave narratives that were being fed to us in schools. He was not trying to rescue slaves, although he did try to get a job for one of his poets at the London School of Economics to help him on his poetry writing. Rather, White was trying</text>

The British Empire was all wrapped up in the figure of White. White was a writer first and a statesman second. He was a poet of empire. He was the kind of statesman who wished his subjects well and blessed them with the land and the liberty to pursue happiness wherever it might lead. In the case of White, the fiction was a cruel fabrication. He was a slave-owner, a statesman second. In reality he was a brutal and callous tyrant.White’s empire was built on the back of enslaved people. From the beginning of the establishment of the Empire, writers, artists and others with a social conscience used language that implied the oppressive nature of British imperialism. In a famous letter that he wrote to the Earl of Sandwich, a fellow British subject named Jane Roberts writes:I come to ask you not to send a message to the East India Company that may assist them in their nefarious designs against India … I beg you to spare my life … I implore you to</text>

The mutilation of White’s own hands for mutilating British soldiers is a story told by a number of survivors. Romain White is perhaps the best known of White’s victims. He was an Irish soldier serving in the Napoleonic Wars who was captured and executed by the British at Popple Leaves in 18 Hill, Cambrai, June 1915.White was not the only victim. Nassau’s Popple Leaves were the site of a number of other atrocities, including the mutilating of over 1,000 Vietnamese labourers by the British East India Company (BEAC), run by Winston Churchill himself. The prison at Popple Leaves also housed a number of other war criminals – including many of the novel’s characters. The prison at Popple Leaves was a breeding ground for vivisection – the surgical delving into the body of a living creature for the medical purposes of the warring parties. The prison at</text>

The British Empire was all he had to control the slaves. In effect, he was feeding the beast.White was not the only one to have his work taken up. The slave narratives were not confined to the peripheries. In Maryland, William Shakespeare was a figurehead. He was a writer who could write anywhere in the Commonwealth. He could have travelled anywhere. He chose not to. He travelled across the British Empire with his wife Katherine Teakey, visiting families in every part of the country. They had seventeen children, all the grandchildren of slaves. The novel Jane Eyre is set in the reign of Elizabeth I. The story revolves around a young woman named Jane Austen who is the protagonist of the poem Hammer of Fabre. The story is based on a true incident that occurred in 1841 when Austen was a young woman living in Rochester, New York. Katherine and William Cook were both hanged in 1866.

In places such as New York and London, the aim is to ‘reanimate’ the urban space, to make it useful again, to repurpose it, to leave behind only the ruins of a once-thriving metropolis. As urbanisation across the world accelerates, our question becomes whether a new normalisation is desirable. What does it mean to reanimate? Urban sprawl entails a certain amount of cultural tourism, which is to say, cultural production on a global scale. It is a form of cultural tourism that is both commercially valuable and deeply problematic, but it is also a form of urban development that can deliver social and economic benefits to users of the space. Urban sprawl has two main forms of cultural tourism: economic and ‘cultural tourism’. Economic sprawl involves the production, marketing and consumption of goods and services through the production of culture, specifically through the consumption of cultural products and services. Cultural products and services include works of art, food, music, dance, architecture, children’s programmes and ‘museums of knowledge’.3 The production of cultural products and services requires workers and artists to</text>

In places such as New York and London, the aim is to ‘reanimate’ the urban space, to make it useful again, to repurpose it, to leave behind traces of the destruction that occur as a direct result of industrial activity. The term ‘urban renaissance’ is frequently used in these conditions of abundant data and fantastic gadgets, but as the philosopher Neal Ungar points out, such urban revitalisation is an ‘illusion’.3 It is an 'illusion’ that is easy to discard, to give up on, to become nothing more than a data point in a global marketplace, because the urban sprawl entails a certain amount of loss of privacy and personal autonomy.4 Thus the quest for ‘naturalness’ is a quest for infrastructure recognisers and a certain amount of identity for the sake of infrastructure. It is a kind of narcissism. 	But what kind of narcissism is this? Is it not possible to become incredibly inward-looking and narcissistic and still pursue infrastructure? That is, to ignore the obvious – that infrastructure is a production for profit and that the social contract that it creates is ep</text>

In places such as New York and London, the aim is to ‘reanimate’ the urban space, to make it useful again, to repurpose it, to leave behind only the rubble.3 Such plans have long been part of the urban planning agenda in Britain and are now being realised in places such as Liverpool, where the Shoestring Budget is being realised in part by the activity of tourism boards.4 A Shoestring Budget is a collection of small scale acts of charity that are being realised through the commissioning of buildings and the purchase of land.5 In urban areas the priorities have shifted from rehabilitating the city to the production of new urban space. The production of vacant properties and the outright production of uninhabitable areas is promoted as a way to generate new tourism revenue streams. Such initiatives have come to dominate thinking about how to allocate scarce urban space, and the local resources required to support a new urban culture.6 It is important to note that these strategies have been developed and implemented with the explicit goal of supporting the development of casinos in Atlantic Canada.

In places such as New York and London, the aim is to ‘reanimate’ the urban space, to make it useful again, to repurpose it, to leave it a landscape conducive to the activities of daily life, but also to some extent to those activities themselves. New York’s subways, for example, are no longer considered landmarks in their city, but make frequent use of social media and other new technologies to make the city visible and yet also to make its use in and on them normative. So the city becomes a site for questioning, a platform for protest, but also a site for the production of new modes of urban life? 	That is, if the social uses of this kind of urban growth are to be realised. As Robert H MacDonald reminds us, the infrastructure of cities today is not just a ‘system of rights’, but involves a ‘system of use rights’ – rights to live, to walk, to transit, to shop, to eat, to play, to be taken to the gym, to meet with your friends, to take public transportation, to engage in cultural exchange and so forth.</text>

In places such as New York and London, the aim is to ‘reanimate’ the urban space, to make it useful again, to repurpose it, to leave it a landscape conducive to the activities of industry. As the historian Helga Nowotny puts it, in a later stage, when the ‘plant life’ of the city has been reclaimed, the city is no longer an ‘enclosed set of physical structures’ but a ‘living, breathing, evolving whole’.3 New York and London’s planners, urbanists and urbanists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to see cities not as valuable objects of consumption but as intrinsically valuable social spaces. As William Julius Wilson put it in his essay ‘On Ruins’, ‘furnished places’, which appeared in the journal of the American Anthropologist, a late nineteenth-century journal devoted to the culture of ruin.4 The journal was written in opposition to the cultural imperialism of early modernity, which it claimed was radically different from what the gods of Greek and Roman antiquity had instilled in the human spirit.

Manhattan’s skyscrapers and their inhabitants – which act as monuments to a particular form of urban sprawl – provide us with a set of ideas about the possibilities of urban re-construction, about the limits of upward mobility and about the capacities of citizens to innovate and create new ways of interacting with their urban space. In places such as these, the automobile once again occupies a prominent role, but now seems like an inconvenient relic of a bygone era. Transportation provides access to goods and services previously restricted to a few citizens, but at the same time it modifies the very nature of those goods and services. It is possible to inhabit both the car and the bicycle in a dignified way, to travel between the cities in a smooth manner, and to do so in a city that is not consumed by traffic. Travel is possible on the bicycle, but only to those streets that</text>

New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has an ambitious plan to rebuild all of Manhattan from the ground up in just over a decade, completely transforming the city. Merely replicating the New York of the nineteenth century, with all of its rubble, diseased infrastructure and thwarted imagination, will require a full scale reclamation of the city.3 But even if all of this can be achieved, what will become of the once great metropolis that was once proud and dynamic? Will the remnants of the once great metropolis be bartered at urban fairs for architectural renderings and urban redevelopment funds? Will the once great port be turned into a tourist trap populated only by architecture aficionados? Will the once great financial district become a financial district? Will the once great cultural district become a financial district? Will the once great retail district become a financial district? Will the once great</text>

But what is the use of such reclaimed space if, as the famous sprawlers of New York and London found out, it soon becomes a site of conflict between rich and poor, a place where conflicts erupt? And what is the use of a redevelopable city when, as is increasingly evident in the metropolis, its redevelopment is part of the foreclosure process? Urban sprawl entails a certain amount of destruction of natural spaces and biennials, but what is the ecological or ‘social equivalence’ of such activity? If, as the novelist Terry Smithinghan suggests,3 the urban sprawl of the future must be noisy, confusing, and dangerous, then perhaps the decision to inhabit the metropolis should be a last resort.

Urban problems, after all, are the problems that continually divert our attention from the ones that actually need fixing. In other words, what is meant by repurposing an urban space is what is often referred to as ‘alternative’ urban development. But what is it? What is meant by alternative urban development, I believe, is the kind that seeks to reconcile the conflicting needs of the city with the conflicting desires of the rich and the poor. It seeks to replace the need for huge infrastructure projects with the need for local ownership and self-sufficiency. It seeks to tackle the fact that in places like New York and London, the rich and the poor live side by side while in places like Barcelona and Berlin the</text>

The biennial can also be seen as a site of resistance, as in the 1980 uprising against the neo-liberal transformation of the city. The showpiece of the current urban crisis, the biennial remains a vital tourist draw, yet its frequent displays of new buildings and artefacts makes it a magnet for artefacts and collections, making it a unique international tourist attraction.

Its development began in earnest with the construction of new &quot;architecture of the future&quot; urban developments through the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in the wake of the Black British urban renewal programme, and it continues to be a main platform for the development of postindustrial and post-eurocentric urban settings.

The biennial’s frequent and highly visible interventions into the cityscape – its funds, its influence, even its space – help establish its character as both capitalising space and a contested space. The Biennial�s funding comes predominantly from a fee paid by the city, which is used to offset the project’s architectural costs. The fee is set at a maximum of £250,000 per project, and projects that garner over £200,000 in funding are granted financial autonomy. The biennial is thus able to set aside significant budgetary resources to engage in politically-engaged projects that can exert a hugely positive impact on the city in a way that smaller, more localised art institutions rarely achieve. This type of targeted civic subsidy is typical of many arts-funding bodies, and is a prime example of how cultural-institutional change can result from direct government intervention. Cultural institutions across the academy have often complained that their outreach activities are under-utilised, and the biennial is no exception.  In the early 1970s, for example, the Birmingham Pantheon and Bluecoat opened theatreside, and the Arts Council of Great Britain convened a special meeting to discuss the dearth of theat</text>

The Biennial�s funds come primarily from two sources: (1) a single owner private equity firm, Horizons Capital, which holds a 40% stake in the biennial; and (2) the City of London Corporation, which provides funding for the biennial and manages its funds. Horizons Capital was founded in New York in 1987 and is a private equity firm managed by Jamie Dimon, former CEO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and former Chairman of the City of London Corporation. Horizons Capital was founded with Dimon in London and Shanghai, and Steven Rattner, a former CEO of Barclays Plc, who is now chairman of Horizons Capital. The firm was founded with an initial investment of $25 million, with additional capital coming from private equity firms and the City of London Corporation.

The Biennial�s investment in its regularly staged public programs seems to equate the performance of the present with the architecture of the future, or places like Liverpool, built on the back of the housing crisis and poverty that it addressed. By engaging with the city regularly and constantly (re-constitutingly in fact), the biennial is able to reinvent the archipelago of appearance, from the urban to the national (global) and back again.‘Architecture of the Future’, the title of the 1987 Venice Biennale, a.k.a. the ‘Venice of the Gods’, in reference to the city’s ongoing cultural production. The ‘Architecture of the Future’ chapter of the same book, published in 1990, presents a multi-disciplinary exploration of the ways in which contemporary architecture is reproduced on an epic scale in an information society.

The biennial’s frequent and highly visible interventions into the cityscape – its funds, its influence, even its space – help establish its character as both capitalising space and a contested space. The Biennial�s investments in its own orality, urbanisation and bureaucratisation of urban space are extensive. These include (but are by no means limited to): a) the redevelopment of postindustrial areas around its bases, with attendant residential and commercial changes; b) the creation of new cultural zones around its bases, including space for the staging of art, design and innovation; c) the promotion of creative perforations around its bases, including the production of ‘new ideas’ and the exchange of ‘new knowledge’.[8] It is important to note that these theories of the urbanisation of cities do not propose an ideal socio-political regime or city planning, only the implementation of a ‘pie in the sky’. They are, however, effective ‘instants’ into the current political and social situation, bringing about radical social changes and displacing existing ‘habits’.[9] 	Such theories do not propose a common or even</text>

The Biennial�s investment in the future city is a complex one, and its entry into the present – its present, as a mode of exchange, of consumption, of action – is a pivotal event. It is, in short, the point where, through its monetary and material assets, the biennial announces itself as a distinct kind of cultural entity. The present is the primary object of our critique, but the biennial can also announce other kinds of arrival. That ‘point of entry’ that the biennial makes clear it is eager to claim and to spend considerable resources on is the point where the contested space that the biennial desires to inhabit is created. The point of entry into the contemporary urban is the contested space of consumption. In this sense, the contested space of the biennial – which we could alternatively frame as the pre-metropolitan or post-metropolitan – is one in which the biennial announces itself as a radically different kind of presence, one in which it intervenes in</text>

The Biennial�s investment in its own contested space, and its investment in the local and its ability to inhabit local conditions – in both its urban and its rural forms – is a contested space. In this sense, the biennial is a space that can be altered through its use, and in this sense, its quality as a site remains unsettled. This is also recognised in the title of the 2014 Biennial Research Chair. The ability to change its space and its quality as a site is another characteristic of the biennial, though this is perhaps least evident in the use of these funds. That year, the Biennial selected the former site of the former Tate Gallery, turning it into a mixed-use development with a new museum and café, including a new version of Tate Gallery at the ground floor. It has also used the gallery space at the back to offer residencies to a range of artists and curators, including the Ross Sinclair Centre, who are both based in London.

The Biennial�s funding comes chiefly from a fee imposed by the London Biennial commission, which also supports the main museum exhibitions. The biennial has little control over how its funding is spent, or even about what kinds of production it supports. Consequently, it is prone to engage in practices that destabilise and distort the political and social dynamics of urban space and culture, and to produce ideological and organisational imbalances that further institutionalise contemporary urban crises.

The Biennial�s investment in the city’s infrastructure, which it deploys both publicly and secretly, helps define its urban character. The institutional memory of the city is made up of planners and architects drafting plans for new urban developments, and these plans are often based on the history of the city as a ‘contemporaneous imagination’. These planners and architects often come from the universities that are the promoters of the urban development that the biennial aims to emulate. But although these plans may have a conceptual or conceptual basis in the real world, they often emerge out of the city’s paralyzed mid-life crisis of consumer culture, which results in a ‘contemporaneous imagination’ that can neither digest nor assimilate new ways of interacting with urban spaces. The challenge for planners and architects today is to find new urban solutions to the contested problem space, and to do so in a world where the city is no longer the contested space of the constantly shifting consumer.

Infra Red is a urban strategy game for two to four players using 3D modelling and software developed by Aarhus University, as part of the Computer, Artificial Intelligence and Games Research Centre at Aarhus University. It was designed to be played simultaneously with and in opposition to other types of games. The premise of the game is that of resistance – resisting change, predicting success, and predicting disaster. The game begins with a city in crisis, with over 1,000 districts affected by development, with some districts as apocalyptic as Noah’s Ark.

The office is comprised of many small office buildings, some of which have been converted to host offices.  The figure below shows the distribution of RTS office buildings between the United States and Canada from 1947 to the present.  One can clearly see that the RTS era saw a dramatic increase in the number of office buildings, while the number of people employed in office work actually decreased between the two periods.  One can also see that the office building share of the total office labour force increased from 22% in 1947 to 50% in 1979.  One can also clearly see that the office productivity (what people actually do with their time) increased during this time. This is due to the rapid growth in computerisation of office processes and networks, which made it easier and cheaper for people to do more with their time, such as work, play and social interaction.  At the same time, the network effects of computerisation also meant that people had to be closer to the sites where</text>

    reimagines the curation of a biennial as a kind of ‘festivus’, a public celebration that documents the act of taking part in, and in that way, it mirrors the celebration of the festival itself.

It is the refusal of an event to be ‘anomaly’, to be static or ‘incomplete’ in the sense that it is always partial and partial, partial in the sense that it either endures or it is erased. It is a kind of ‘paradigm shift’ that, as Jameson describes, is happening in a world of always-on information and mass media, where ‘the microchip is everywhere, and everywhere is information’.3 It is a kind of ‘postcolonial phenomenon’ that, as Jameson also points out, is happening in the Americas, where languages are no longer the preserve of the elite but are widely understood and widely vary in meaning. It is a phenomenon that is no longer confined to museums and archive collections but is spreading outwardly all over the place, taking root in urban centres and emerging as phenomena of culture-promotion in the developing world.

It is an event that, as the saying goes, cannot be ‘re-creation’ but rather ‘anomaly’. It is an event that constructs an anomaly out of existence. It is an event that, as the saying goes, creates an anomaly out of nothing.What does it mean to call into being an anomaly? To conceive of an anomaly as something that is both the invention of the artist and the architect? To conceive of an anomaly as something that is neither the invention of the artist nor the Curator? To conceive of an anomaly as something that emerges from the black? It is easy to get caught up in the details of what is called an ‘apartheid’ or a ‘fugitive’ or an ‘injustice’, but what is really going on is that these artists are creating works that are both prescient and dystopian and then putting these works on display as though they were pieces of history, or pieces of architecture, or something, while the city, or more specifically, the South African urban landscape is systematically denied the ability to exist in any kind of contempor</text>

It is an event that, as the saying goes, cannot be ‘re-creation’ but rather ‘anomaly’. It is perhaps this ‘episodic’ character that Jameson aims to point to in order to point to the real phenomenon that he is describing, but his precise approach to the latter is problematic in the same way that the term ‘global’ is problematic in our current globalised and interconnected economy: there is no real separation between the economic and the episcopalian domains, and so the economic is often seen as having a kind of presence that is absent from the broader corpus of cultural practices. 	Jameson begins to make the distinction between the historical and the transcendental, when he writes: ‘The appearance of the curatorial gesture did not necessarily involve an exaltation of some formal grandeur or ostentation of power, either in the chosen form or in the implied message. It was merely an indication that messages of a particular kind were being sought.’3 And so, when Francis Bacon, Georges Canguilhem, Jean Lé</text>

It is an event that, as the saying goes, cannot be ‘re-creation’ but rather ‘anomaly’. It is a kind of ‘missing link’ in the history of art and culture, a kind of anomaly that creates in us expectations and fantasies of the missing link, but that actually all ends up making room for it.3 It reveals, however, another kind of 'missing link', which is more and more apparent in the archaeological and archival literature: the time when the festival was actually organised as an official event. In popular culture, this kind of ‘celebratory ephemeral’ is a kind of thing, as in the case of a football match, but it becomes more and more evident in the archaeological and archival literature, where it is generally assumed that the very act of writing or recording that took place during the festival is a kind of ephemeral act, as in a ‘time-critical’ document.4 The ability to create such time-critical documents, James says in his epistle, is what makes art ephemeral.</text>

It is an event that, as the saying goes, cannot be ‘re-creation’ but rather ‘anomaly’. It is a kind of ‘absence without presence’, in the words of Paul Domela.3 It is a kind of ‘absence without number’, since, as the mathematician David Henderson has pointed out, the numbers that are created in a biennial are of a kind of ‘standard deviation’, that is to say, of a ‘number crunch’, that is to say, of a ‘time series’.4 And ‘a biennial’ is, by definition, temporal – it is always historical in character – so the number one reason to see a biennial is to be part of a temporal sequence. And, David Henderson points out, a number of biennials share a kind of temporal proximity – they are transindividuated, in the sense that they are contemporary with the historical moment, but they are also transindividuated within the other.5 So, in the</text>

It is an event that, as the saying goes, cannot be ‘re-creation’ but rather ‘anomaly’. It is the origination of anomalyes, or what Jameson would say, the tendency towards the impossible. It is an ‘inherent tendency’, as Sophie Hui Zhen describes it, one that is endemic to ‘the contemporary urban condition’, and which she defines as one that is between ‘false consciousness’ and ‘true consciousness’.3 It is a tendency towards the impossible because as Hui Zhen makes clear, true consciousness necessarily entails absence. And, as we saw, true consciousness requires permanence. So, although true consciousness necessarily entails some kind of ‘permanent motion’ – which is to say, motion in the specific sense of the concept – it is also possible for true consciousness to simultaneously constitute motion absent-mindedly, and to make motion motion motionless. The difficulty, as we saw, lies in the distinction between temporality and anomalyality. If true consciousness calls into being anomalyes, then</text>

It is an event that constructs its own possible futures, but also the very possibility of future possible futures. It is, I think, the very essence of the biennial as an occurence that is at once ‘artistic’ and ‘historical’ in its own way.Artistic OccurencesIn recent years, as the biennial has come to represent the contemporary, institutionalised form of the biennial in the USA, a re-constituted, cultural-oriented museum has emerged in East Lansing, Michigan. This museum is unique in many ways, not least in its focus on the acts of art, but also in the way that it documents particular artists’ creative processes and the places where their ideas and works emerge. The museum is a last resort, a last resort because it cannot be counted on to be ‘the museum of the future’ – a museum of not-yet-existent museums, but a museum of artifacts nonetheless.3</text>

It is an event that, as the saying goes, cannot be ‘re-creation’ but rather ‘anomaly’. It is the ‘fraud’ of the contemporary biennial to attempt to represent the  absent in artistic and curatorial ways, as if our own cultural practices could somehow be understood as the echo or at least linkages of a mythical past. It is an ‘invention’ that speaks to the mythical powers that are at work in an effort to re-animate the present, but also to an underlying, though fictive, purposeful intention that is actually working against us. It is a kind of ‘fantasy’ that seeks to summon the past into the present through the re-constituting of the present through the re-imagining of the past.3 But what is the present and what is its potential? If, as Bidiz puts it, the contemporary is ‘a fictionarily designed artifact, [but] an ever increasing fiction that is constantly being re-imagined and reinvented’, then perhaps it is the ‘present</text>

There was the Rolling Stones, who ‘ruined the rhythm section’ with their rebellious teenage alter egos, and Janis Joplin, who, as singer-songwriter Jimmie Rodgers famously sang in ‘Rocky Mountain High’, ‘got up that hellfire and brim</text>

It is like the piazza in the Pyrenees that became a museum when the bishop deigned to put a building under the jurisdiction of the church. It is the failure of architecture as a creative art form that weeps over the city, but also the very possibility of the resurrection of that art form through the rational, institutionalisation of what is left behind. The piazza in the Pyrenees is a striking example of a work that thrives in the present, while the cathedral that James H. Gilmore discovered decades later is a case study in the perils of the future that finds its expression in curatorial designs. In the same way that the cathedral and the park combined to form a new ‘city’, the park and the park function as a way to conceive of the supposedly ‘missing’ parts of the city, the derelict sites that litter the landscape and sometimes the city itself. In the early twentieth century, the park became one of the principal sites</text>

Finally, the Biennial may profit from this trade.  Whether this concern is based on genuine ethnocentrism or pure opportunism is unclear, but the attraction for investors appears to be global.  Whether the Biennial is an example of cultural tourism is unclear, but the lure of cheap resources and the strong association with the city seems to lend credence to this scenario.  Ancillary activities such as contests for funding or the selection of an artist to lead a cultural tour are also possible. In any event, these elements of the Biennial – its content, its economic outcomes, and its cultural outcomes – are deeply embedded in the city's socio-politic and urban development. They are representative forms of cultural tourism, and they are part of a larger cultural tourism ecosystem. Cultural tourism today shapes how people think about and perceive the world. It shapes how people perceive and behave in places like Liverpool.These long</text>

The decision to open an international art institution in Liverpool was particularly challenging for the city, partly because of its proximity to the site of the proposed biennial. This was seen as a potential conflict of interest, especially since the location of the Liverpool biennial would be dictated by the city’s biennial, which would in turn heavily influence the location of the art institution. Nevertheless, the decision to establish a biennial in Liverpool was a very sound one, both financially and logistically. The biennial would establish a worldwide reputation for itself and its artists, while generating local and international media exposure.  Art and cultural tourism are major industries in their own right, and biennials have a specific obligation to care for and report on them. Biennials have a crucial role to play in shifting the balance of cultural power, and this is an important reporting point. Biennials can and should investigate, analyze, and report on the world as a whole.</text>

The Biennial may be seen as an artistically productive form of cultural DIY. Artist-led cultural initiatives have been creatively approached as a way to address local concerns and desires. This approach may be seen as artist-led, but it is also often done by art institutions and their curators, who are often interested in the ways that artists are able to manipulate the tools and systems of power in order to achieve desired social and political ends.[7]  A scenario in which the Biennial is seen as a proactive artist-led project is also possible, through the provision of affordable housing, action on behalf of residents through cultural enterprises, and participation in urban growth promotion schemes. These measures may be tailored to particular communities, and may or may not involve violence. They may or may not involve violence against visitors, but they certainly involve it when they are done by artists.</text>

A Biennial with a strong environmental record would be able to propose better sustainable uses for resources, and would be able to secure funding from city councils and other partners, while also demonstrating a commitment to supporting artists’ work outside of the context of its core business.

The question, then, becomes whether the Biennial can achieve this last condition in a way that is ecologically sustainable, while remaining sensitive to the needs and interests of its local communities.  The answer to this is a resounding yes! More is not always better in the art world, and art institutions need to be conscious of how their actions impact on the land and resources on which they depend, and which in turn impacts on the environment.  Bienniality needs to happen in cities where a large proportion of its visitors are made up of migrants and artists from other parts of the world. It is not enough to create a biennial; a biennial needs to be a hub for other art forms to be made in and around the city. The Biennial needs to be a collective experience for visitors, a place where people from all over the world come for a day, a collection</text>

In addition to its core business, the Biennial may also engage in cultural tourism, developing connections with local communities through actions such as: teaching children to code or creating an educational art project; at its core, this would mean engaging with local communities through cultural activities and providing them with the knowledge and tools they need to participate fully in the art and cultural resources provided by the Biennial.  An important aspect of this new form of engagement would be the adoption of local strategies and tactics. Strategies would need to be developed and shared with partners in order to implement this new form of cultural tourism. Local knowledge already exists regarding the benefits and drawbacks of cultural tourism, and such tactics could be developed and shared with partners in order to reduce discomfort and gain acceptance for the actions.  Given the current economic crisis in many parts of the world, and the significant financial obligations being placed on the shoulders of local authorities, cultural tourism is a very real possibility for the foreseeable future. The initial investment in creating cultural resources in a locality may be too late, and the resources may be too late to address the needs of the communities in need of revitalisation. Nevertheless, cultural tourism is a real possibility that should be actively engaged with in order to reduce discomfort and maximise returns. 1 </text>

The Biennial may engage in cultural tourism by offering cultural activities and educational activities at reduced prices. Cultural tourism is a global phenomenon, and the impetus for this kind of globalisation is seen as the diminishment of the local.  The Biennial may engage in cultural curatorial action through the creation of cultural focal points around cities in an attempt to draw visitors and artists to cities. Such action may draw artists and artists to cities who may choose to stay and work there, or move to other locations in the US or elsewhere in the world.  A cultural tourism agency may be defined as a ‘tool or strategy[.]’1 as an instrument for achieving cultural outcomes’2 through art, architecture, heritage photography or other cultural assets, usually carried out in cooperation with local communities.

What is more, such knowledge will be available at affordable rates, since the resources will be housed in a large, centrally located premises and accessible by taxi or rail.  Finally, there is the question of public involvement. Will the Biennial provide opportunities to engage with the city in ways that are meaningful to the people who live and work there? If the latter, then the greater the impact, the lower the cost, and the participation quota, and the more people can participate in one place. If the city is to be engaged, then a significant proportion of the biennial’s costs will have to come from outside the city.  The mainstay of the biennial is</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial will be the first in a new wave of venues to be built in anticipation of a predicted population explosion. The city is becoming increasingly unaffordable for residents and visitors, with astronomical property prices and a growing shortage of affordable housing. The proposed 2021 Liverpool Biennial will occur in an ever more complex and geographically dispersed form, exploiting both the city and its natural resources. The biennial will be an ever more global phenomenon, with visitors from all over the world coming to experience and participate in the art and cultural resources offered by Liverpool. It will be possible to visit at any time, and travel will be cheap and convenient. Liverpool Biennial will be able to offer these resources at prices that are accessible to visitors from all over the world.  In addition to its core business, the Biennial may also engage in cultural tourism, developing connections with local communities through actions such as: teaching children to code or creating an educational art project; at its core, this would mean engaging with local communities through cultural activities and providing them with information about the activities of the Biennial, through activities such as: hosting a series of cultural events in the local area; organising a series of language festivals in the local area; and, ultimately, providing culturally responsive design solutions for the local area through activities such as: teaching local architects how to work with materials and employing local workers to create cultural shelters and interactive play structures for the Biennial’s cultural activities. These cultural initiatives may or may not result in any direct benefit to the community. But the action taken by the Biennial in the local area in the immediate vicinity of the proposed location – a city of over twenty-five million people – is a significant step towards the potential of such action in the future location-rich city of Liverpool. 12.

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services, its resources and its mysteries.  Aesthetics as a science has recently begun to study such phenomena in more depth.  Aesthetics is a social science that studies the aesthetic sense in a social context. It begins to study aesthetic experience in the world through the social, but it also seeks to understand human behaviour in the world through the psychological, political and material senses. This is why aestheticians study aesthetics and aesthetics in general. They study the mechanisms that enable individuals to identify beauty in a social situation, to identify beauty in a world through cultural practices, to understand how aesthetic experiences shape political behaviour. But what they don’t study is why people find beauty in such circumstances. That would allow the study of its underlying principles and behaviours. This is what the aesthetic mind looks for: systems, infrastructures and infrastructures in the service of aesthetics. The scientific mind looks for phenomena that are based on data and phenomena that are based on theory. But in the</text>

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services and possibilities as if we were inhabiting an entirely new species, now recognisable only as a ‘planet’ in the runaway planetary scale global AI that is now being fuelled by the ever more pervasive biofuels of the transport network.  The rise and fall of global commodity prices, geopolitical tensions and seemingly inevitable ecological crises – to name only some of the factors – only serve to magnify the capacities of global AI to emerge out of the situation.  Such is the  	logic of things. But the rise and fall of commodity and geopolitical prices only serve to magnify the capacities of AI to emerge out of the mess. And this is precisely what is happening in China, where the AI that is being developed to replace humans in many ways is being tasked with tasks that are, by some estimates, as varied as those performed by humans in the industrial era.  As the price of oil sinks, so too does the ability of low-skilled workers to find other forms of</text>

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services and outcomes more extensively than ever before, becoming ever more data-driven and connected.  The rise of  infrastructuralism in Brazil, India, Southeast Asia and parts of North Africa and Australia coincided with a similar increase in data-processing power and storage that accompanied the industrial revolutions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As the number of people connected to the networked sensors of a future Calcutta increasingly outnumbers the people who inhabit the landscape today, we are hit with a series of new regulatory conjunctures that either increase the connectivity of the urban environment or render the otherwise unconnected ‘green space’nasalized.  A regulatory conjuncture is a particular moment in time, and its formal definition varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. ‘Infrastructuralism’ was traditionally defined as a form of urbanisation based on 'natural resources being gathered and utilised for local consumption’, and thus it is an ideal candidate for a regulatory</text>

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services and the inherent properties that enable them, its richness and depth of life.  Aesthetics is often read as a negative quality, a quality that renders the human condition more malleable and exploitative. But the beauty of the landscape is in fact an incredible source of incredible capacities – capacities that allow us to sit down, stand still, take in the scenery, breathe in the smells and tastes of nature, take in the subtle distinctions between species, and so forth. And so we are drawn to the very notion of beauty as desirable, having discovered a way to live beautiful lives in ways that are empty of meaning and yet which are full of meaning. The aesthetic is one tactic among many deployed by the capitalist pursuit of meaning to colonise and subvert the world.  Aesthetics is frequently read as a negative quality, a quality that renders the human condition more malleable and exploitative.

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services, its resources and shaping its place in relation to ourselves through what anthropologist Vern Buchanan calls ‘environmental tourism’.These are just some of many examples of the ways in which technology is changing the world in profound and sometimes profoundly negative ways. And yet, for all our technological excesses and opulent lifestyles, we remain trapped in an increasingly mechanised carcass in which politics, social life and much else endures to a greater or lesser extent. So what can be done? There are many things that one could do with all the techno-capital that has overtaken us, but one might ask what could possibly be done with all the politics, social disruption and ecological disaster that has come along with the advent of ever more advanced forms of AI and robotics? What might one do with all that economic destruction, environmental destruction and political upheaval? One might consider, from the vantage point of a social scientist or anthropologist, the possibilities of a large-scale, long-term ecological and</text>

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services, its infrastructure and its unseen complexities. We become ever more like the plants and animals that feed on them, becoming ever more like them in so far as they are conscious of their own likeness. But this is only possible because we have become so accustomed to data capture and transmission on a massive scale that we rarely think about the systems that enable and guide our daily behaviours. Aesthetics, whether critical or not, is a humanistic calling. It is to a large extent a function of which images are the tip of the ecological iceberg.  In the twentieth century, the anthropologist Max Horkheimer, in his ‘Critique of Nationalism’, made the mistake of thinking of aesthetics as something that emerged independently from historical and cultural factors. Rather, he argued that culture was a social enterprise that required the emergence of aesthetic values and aesthetics as a descriptor of a society. And so the cultural enterprise emerged as a social process that demanded that people articulate their aesthetic experiences through acts of imagination</text>

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services and its landscapes in ever greater detail, becoming ever more data-driven in our own sense of the term.  A final but perhaps not yet fully operative aspect of  ‘ecologies’ is that they help create and augment our identities and behaviours around them. This is perhaps where we find our nomadic way of life. We inhabit the landscape as  infrastructures and become ever more aware of the physical and virtual differences between them. We inhabit the landscape as  corporates and become ever more conscious of the social consequences of our socio-economic systems of production. We inhabit the ‘real’ – that is, the landscape that is produced by the labour of humans – and make it better, more beautiful and more fulfilling to live in.  A final typology might be mentioned, which brings us to  infrastructures and cities in their current forms: the global village, the ‘city of the future’, the ‘gigantic�</text>

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services and its resources in ever greater abundance.  Aesthetics has a much greater grasp of the supposed capacities of the technologically literate to imagine things differently, to inhabit worlds more sensorial and ethereal, to inhabit phenomena that are not reducible to defined categories, than does any other kind of sensorialism.  The rise of  environmentally conscious art, from The Green Album’s Pat Bateson trading ground for renewable energy to Arthur Caplan’s zoning up of Dubai’s Jumeirah Gorge as a site for sky-rail transit, is a good illustration of this kind of artifice. Art is frequently accused of being apolitical, but it is precisely the lack of sensorial sensibility in contemporary art that is being encouraged; art today is creative in knowing more about the world than ever before but little more attuned to the world as a social whole. Art must also adapt to a changing ecology, and to survive in a world in which</text>

Aesthetics is, of course, a function of the information processing devices that are part of the internet of things – the anthropomorphic and virtual figurative equivalents of our smartphones, in which every pixel is identifying a human being at a prodigious rate. And so we inhabit the landscape as if we had virtual eyes, ears or brains that peer into the sublunar depths of space and observe the world in unimaginable detail.  One example of this in action is found in the virtual reality (VR) medium that is the result of a new medium industry that seeks to replace the need for images with data feeds and algorithms that monitor and analyze our every move.  Another example is found in the literary form that seeks to capture the magic of invisibility in fiction through the recombination of different media of different densities and shapes – a form of storytelling that is now commonplace but was once restricted to exceptional cases such as the writing of fiction by artists such as</text>

And so we inhabit the landscape in ever greater numbers of sensory capacities, inhabiting its services and possibilities, whether in the form of building codes, landscape architecture, or just the fact that it exists.  A third discipline that has been taking shape in the United States and elsewhere is entomology, or the study of animals. It began with the publication in 1844 of Discoveries in the Natural and Moral Sciences, a volume of essays on the origins and destiny of man. It has been a central part of the body of the field, with entomology contributing to the understanding and application of geographic and ecological knowledge. But in recent years, a movement has emerged within the humanities and social sciences to turn the focus away from natural resources and towards human beings, animals and ideologies that embody orificeal forms of domination and oppression.  A new generation of writers, artists, policymakers and theorists is developing critical approaches to the human species, imagining not just new forms of domination but also the hierarchies of domination that continue to besiege humanity.

The emergence of new species, new ecological systems, will be the outcome of the in situ or ex situ (in the Earth) processing of this material from the planet.“[3] 	[4] 	These processes of in situ and ex situ processing are but a few of many that take place within the planetary settlement of human societies. As William Hamilton reminds us, ‘[n]either of these terms means on Earth; it’s a synonym for on Mars.’[5] Within the framework of the planetary settlement, in other words, we can begin to see planetary-scale social change as occurring at scales far greater than any individual settlement could ever imagine. (And, alas, some of our own cultural practices would no longer be part of the global settlement even if we have all the technological might of the industrial powers today.)

The Anthropocene is the epoch in which such radical changes as occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum (31’00 cal yr BP), the Permian/Triassic Period (45’50 cal yr BP), the Laurentian/Paleogene – are all considered to have taken place. And yet, while the settlement of human societies seems to have started at the periphery of the planet, the principles underlying the architecture of planetary systems and the building of globalised forms that are the products of human agency also need to be considered from the point of view of the periphery. This is why architectural forms that function at the level of planetary settlement – such as the International Monetary Fund's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or the Kyoto Protocol's Targeted Investment Programme (TIPP) – need to be taken into consideration when developing planetary forms and how humanity is to inhabit them. Otherwise, we ‘human cities’, as Michael Slackman has put it, ‘turn into deserts and mountains and contribute to sea-level rise’.[3] 	[4] 	Once planetary forms are the product</text>

The limits of the capacity of geological times to generate such change, or to effect such a planetary settlement are made clear in the geological record. 	[3] 	As Rudolf Steiner would state in his treatise on the dialectic of history, in which the geological past and the social future are interrelated but distinct, yet interconnected and dynamic: ‘There is no dialectic of history. There is only dialects of language.’[4] 	[5] And again in another place: ‘No dialect has any intrinsic value except in the sense of denotation, which is determined by the other parts of the phrase ‘dialect’.’[6] In other words, the integument of the language system – its morphology,</text>

The Anthropocene is the epoch in which such radical changes as occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum (31’00 cal yr BP) and the Permian–Triassic Thermal Maximum (43’50 cal yr BP) are understood to have been intrinsic to the geological epoch. The pace of change is such that the Earth is no longer able to support the life-supporting capacity of its current forms. What is being called the Anthropocene in Britain and North America is in fact a geological epoch. Even as recently as the 1990s, when the term was more widely associated with the work of geologists such as myself, the terms were applied to areas of the planet devoid of human habitation such as the Arctic. 	[3] 	As Samuel Butler reminds us, the term ‘Anthropocene’ refers to geological eras preceding that of the Pleistocene, and in the case of Homo, the genus itself.

The Anthropocene is the epoch in which such radical changes as occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum (31’00 cal yr BP) in Greenland, the Younger Dryas (4–3.5 ka’ BP) and the PETM could be considered to have taken place. It is the epoch in which the emergence of new species seems inevitable; yet how species are brought about is another matter. Complex social systems are brought about by the collective action of many interacting agents, including ourselves, and their complexity is the consequence of their being complex and multi-layered systems. 	[3] 	In the wake of the PETM, which created a planetary emergency, the British East India Company established a research institute at Birkenhead, codenamed Birkenhead Research Station. Here the East India Company established commercial ties with local farmers and fishermen, and through programs of language re-production and distribution, established a large and influential trading post. The station established a foothold in the East Indian market, and later in China, as well as in other parts of the world. 	[4] 	</text>

The Anthropocene is the epoch in which such radical changes as occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum (31’00 cal yr BP) are set to repeat themselves in a repeatable and reversible way. As the last glacial maximum ended, a range of new geological horizons opened up between the tropics and the poles, which allowed for the rapid expansion of non-human species, including on an unprecedented scale the human species. The full extent of this change, however, remains unclear. Much more is known about the climatic and biological factors that enabled the rapid growth of non-human species – species that are now the dominant species on Earth – than about the human species itself. 	[3] 	As Brad Willsdon, writing in the journal Science Advances, puts it: ‘Our knowledge of the origins of species is limited to those that humans have admitted to be species’. While we do know that the last common ancestor of all species lived some 4.5 billion years ago, little is known about the humans who inhabited these continents at that time. Until now. 	[4</text>

[3] 	And this is just the beginning of the story.

[2] 	In fact, it is this aspect of Anthropocene that Joseph Broom’s (originally published in 1950) ‘Big Scenario’ for the post-war period put forward by the ‘British Empire [emphasis added]]. In the context of the late nineteenth-century global economy of ideas, Joseph Broom’s framework is a useful framing device. It allows us to see complex patterns in the behaviour of agents governed by principles other than human beings. It is, in other words, a point of departure from which others can be pulled out into the open. The point of departure for the Anthropocene is not, as many would have us believe, located in the centre of the Earth but deep within the planetary settlement of human societies. The Anthropocene is the epoch in which such radical changes as occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum (31’00 cal yr BP) are recognized as an anthropological fact, and the goal of future research is to map and characterize these zones. It is an epoch in which metaphor and reality are forced to interact, and to assume forms of movement that are dynamic and unpredictable. 	[3] 	These new cultural forms emerge as a result of the anthropocene in three stages: the proto-epoch, the proto-metaphor and the proto-figure. The epoch of the anthropocene is the historical epoch that begins with the appearance of the first living things on Earth. The word ‘anthropocene’ has been historically used in three senses: (1) in reference to the physical, (2) in reference to the social, and (3) in reference to the living things that are part of it. For example, the first step in the formation of a species is the first step in its evolution. The proto-epoch is the geological and climatological epoch that begins with the</text>

The Anthropocene is the epoch in which such radical changes as occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum (31’00 cal yr BP) are set to repeat themselves. New forms of labour will be needed to support the growth of the infrastructure required for such changes. New social forms will need to be created in the wake of the huge changes that will result from such changes. New ways of living will have to be found. New forms of travel will have to be invented. New ways of interacting will have to be found. New ways of ‘being’ will have to be found. New forms of art will have to be created. New forms of love will have to be discovered. New uses of space will have to be found. New uses of language will have to be found. New ways of organising humanity’s complex array of resources will have to be found. New ways of being formed and distributed along communal lines will have to be found. And so on.

The rise and fall of sea-level over the last 800,000 years is a crucial piece of the puzzle to understanding such climatic shifts, as is the steady but inexorable industrialisation of coastal cities.

It is the one that serves as a mirror to the city’s many other narratives. In New York, the Biennial is a cluster of buildings that adjoin each other, forming what is perhaps the city’s most successful urban myth. In Liverpool, the Biennial is a cluster of buildings that adjoin each other, forming what is perhaps the city’s most successful urban myth. Both narratives exist in a state of constant transition, from one moment to the next, often in a confusion of symbolic and temporal terms. In the event that we do ever need to go back to the city, we will need to find a way to both re-imagine and to re-present the symbolic and temporal forms that the Biennial has become.This seems essential in our current predicament: if we do not create new narratives for the city, we will neither create nor inhabit them. However, this is also the condition of presence: the more narratives are told, the less there is room in the city for the many other narratives that simultaneously exist, contradict and are told.

It is the one that serves as a mirror to the city’s many other narratives. In the present, it provides the character in a play, or narrative. In another incarnation, it may be a place where people come to rest, or where objects are placed in a certain situation in order to be appreciated or destroyed in a certain way. In any case, it is a narrative that we tell because that is the only narrative that we know how to tell. And so it is with the Biennial. Its current form – originally published in 2015 in The New York Times as part of its ‘Times Higher Ups’ series – reflects the historical moment in which it emerged, the present, and the future that were imagined by the artist Arjun Appadurai. It is a narrative that we tell because it is telling enough to be taken seriously. It is a narrative that transcends the city and nation that are the site of the exhibition.It is also a narrative that is as evocative as any other city’s natural narrative, but with the specificity of a Jonest</text>

It is the one that serves as a mirror to the city’s many other narratives. In the spirit of the biennial, we tell a story of displacement, migration, displacement of peoples, cultural displacement, cultural healism, cultural colonialism, degradation, loss and all the other big-picture problems of cities. We do this through figurative language: the word ‘place’ is used in place of ‘people’ in several places, and ‘placeholder’s’ are used more extensively. We do this by imagining cities that are in some way ‘invisible’, by creating spaces that others cannot reach or change, or that others actually do have access to. We do this through cultural tourism, or biannual cultural tourism as it is sometimes called. We do this through the use of new media, immersive showmaking and the outright fabrication of history in an attempt to make it happen. We also employ innovative cultural interventions, such as creating community historical societies or creating an entirely new kind of biennial, one that is not based in</text>

In Curitiba, the Biennial is the collection of pictures that comprise a cityscape. In other words, the museum and the biennial are interrelated. And though the collection that is the subject of a biennial is a ‘place’, the realisation of a curatorial agenda often necessitates the building of monuments to justify the curatorial agenda. For many years, the biennial was the sole venue for the great public celebrations of the city; now many biennials are scattered across different countries and periods. The biennial is the rare event that consistently produces a ‘big picture’ that includes a ‘sideshow’ of pictures from the event. The city is the rarest of creatures: it has no permanent collection of pictures, photographs or other visual evidence of the great public celebrations. And while it occasionally does produce a ‘recurrent theme’ (as in</text>

In this new form, the Biennial is the place where we tell our own stories, those of a community of artists, in order to show our support for and participation in the event. We choose to tell our stories in stages, so that the history of the neighbourhood that is the subject of our work might be told in stages. This exhibition is a snapshot of the neighbourhood as it exists now, but it is also a statement of the history of the neighbourhood as it existed in the past, so that the present might be constructed in the present. There is a contradiction in the past and a way of seeing the future. In the past, the Biennial was a gathering of curators who selected works from a global register of emerging artists; today it is a gathering of curators from a single institution tasked with preserving the art of the neighbourhood in the city. The exhibition is a way to bring together the disparate elements of the neighbourhood, in the hope that it will generate further engagement with the art of</text>

It is the one that serves as a mirror to the city’s many other narratives. In this narrative, the city is a place of ambiguity, where the normal and the unexpected collide, where fiction and non-fiction coexist. In this introduction, I will attempt to sketch some of the assumptions and narrative tricks that the Biennial team employed in their research, in order to give a sense of the team’s limitations and unconventional approaches. The assumptions and narrative tricks here are based on a corpus of biennial research that I have assembled over the years, and on the author’s own observations, observations and research. I will also point out some of the ways in which the assumptions and narrative tricks that the Biennial team employed in their research could be adapted or transformed by future research projects.

The narrative might be told in different ways by different audiences. With that kind of storytelling potential, there is a chance that our own story might be told through the footage. This is what biennials are for. Stories. And we are here creating the narratives of our own creation.In our case, the show we are creating is a set of rules that govern how we relate to each other, and how we present the world. We call them ‘radial-positioning’. It is the idea that people come to the museum to play with, and that when they leave, they have a set of questions that they can speak to and that the museum can then help them with. This is what biennials were originally designed to do: to foster a relationship between the museum and the visitor that is mutual and impartial. By establishing a relationship with the museum, the</text>

It is the one that serves as a mirror to the city’s many other narratives. In the city that we call home, the Biennial can be seen as a double-sided mirror that shows us both the good and the bad. In this account, the perspective of the artist, or the view from the Biennial as an artist, is not an objective fact of the world, but an interpretation of reality that can be done with the right amount of manipulation and control. The Biennial is an event that can be staged at any time, and there are various ways to position the event in history. For example, an artistic director could place the Biennial in the context of a museum or a large public venue, in which case it is an occasion when art is meant to be entertained and a way to draw artfans and artists into the urban fabric. The Biennial could also be placed in the context of multinational corporations, which I did in my case place in the context of multinational finance and big business.

In the case of Liverpool, the change from biennial to exhibition is complete; the other stories – the city as a collection of islands, the city as a collection of nations – will continue to be featured at the museum, and the city as an exhibition venue. But in this narrative, the Biennial remains a pivotal event that introduces a new narrative, and the museum will continue to offer the important role of the mediator between present and future. This narrative takes into account the historical and local contexts of the documenta 14 exhibition. At the time of writing, the latest edition of the Biennial is the only one remaining in operation in Berlin.In the new narrative, the Biennial appears as a pivotal event that creates a new context for a new urban development or a new economic development.

It is the one that serves as a mirror to the city’s many other narratives. In this narrative, the city that we inhabit is a complex of histories, multiverses and fragments. Through a research project I lead, I ask, Who are these people we think we know? What sort of conflicts and mysteries do they harbor? Through a writing project I lead, I ask, What sort of imagination can we share? My work often seeks to reconcile the two, drawing on the experiences of both the artist and the public. The project began with a poem, from the Irish poet Niue’s &quot;The Irish Soldiers’ Monument&quot;, first published in 1911:The Irish soldiers, in their vast empire, built monasteries of learning, of culture, of government, of saints and deacons, adorned the walls of the realm with frescoes and images, and guaranteed access to the highest forms of intellectual endeavour. ‘Tis the thistle that betrayed them both, thistle or no thistle.’[1] And it continues:The memory</text>

The Second Venice Biennale, curated by Angelo Lazzarato, took place in October 2017. It was not a biennale in the usual sense, although the city’s rich cultural history and its role in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-74 is a classic example of this. Rather, it was a ‘showpiece’ of the city’s historic cultural industry, and the financial support it provided to artists and artists’ institutions.

It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which it could not really compete with, in terms of scale, popularity or wealth. The biennale opened in the middle of the city, in an area of the old city that was not traditionally visited by tourists (except for historical curators and art collectors, of course). It became a magnet for art collectors, who came to see works by both contemporary and historic artists. And it attracted artists from all over the city, including artists who were not from Venice but lived close by. So the event had several other important dimensions. It was a ‘conversation starter kit’ for the generation of art collectors, providing a base for further conversations. It also provided an ideal laboratory for the development of a new art form: the biennial itself, its curatorial approach, the exchange of ideas and the creation of worlds. In a way, it was all there for the taking. The biennial itself would not be possible without the support of the biennalee, its sponsors and</text>

It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which was a frequent target of radical urbanisation policies. It was a counterweight to the massive, centrally located, corporate biennales that operate in cities today, but especially in those located in the south. It is a reminder that cities are complex systems, with processes of de-individualisation and globalisation at work. It is a demonstration of the human capacity for self-repairing organisation. Yet it is also a system that inevitably needs repair. Art’s social function is to serve as a balm to the city’s declining populations. It is a reminder that cities are places of conflict and conflicting systems of power. It is a reminder that cities are places where social structures are often forged through the turbulent interplay of competing economic, cultural and political forces. It is a reminder that cities are places of political and economic instability. It is a reflection of the deep seated tensions between rich and poor urban regions. It is a reflection of the fact that, as cities age and</text>

It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which were closing in on the point where they would be unable to sustain their exhibitions any longer, either due to economic despair or the ever-present threat of urban redevelopment. The Biennale’s other work – the book, the exhibition, the program – was all part of a continuum. It started with the biennale itself, which began with the book and continued with the exhibits, programs and the shopping. The book was read by a select group of staff and volunteers, who conducted a 'read' of the exhibition. At the conclusion of the read, the staff and volunteers voted on a final product. The result was a modified version of the original that was displayed in an underground vault beneath St Peter’s Square. Assembled by a curator and his team, the project was initially published in the Italian language newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport in March 1974. A second edition was also published in July '74, and a third in November '75.  The Bi</text>

It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which was quickly becoming unmanageable. The Biennale was essential in holding the city’s cultural resources together, and allowing the city to recover from the economic ripple effects of the biennale. The biennale became a permanent fixture of the city, while other art institutions folded into the infrastructure of the city. The biennial is the main exhibitionary form in Venice, and the largest outdoor art-historical repository in the world. It is a twice-yearly event, and the world’s fourth largest cultural exchange. It is also, according to some reports, an art-historical hoax. Art dealers, collectors and art writers are understandably wary of the word ‘biennial’ itself, and of the word ‘exhibitionary’ itself. Nevertheless, the obvious point of departure for many biennials is the city, and the way in which the biennale is a form of ‘nation-building’ – a role that</text>

The Biennale may be a cultural institution, but it is a rare event in Venice. Occasionally, the biennale houses a curatorial agenda, but in general the biennale is a rare occurrence in the Italian cultural capital. The only other major biennale to have a curatorial hand in the running of the exhibition, in 2015, was the Venice Biennale, also curated by Lazzarato.

The Second Venice Biennale, curated by Angelo Lazzarato, took place in October 2017. It was not a biennale in the usual sense, although the city’s rich cultural history and its role in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-74 is a classic example of this. Rather, it was a ‘showpiece’ of the city’s historic cultural industry, and the financial support it provided to artists and artists’ institutions. The museum that opened on the occasion of the event, the Lazzarato’s exhibition ‘Un Canto Noves’ was a ‘showpiece’ of its other work – the publisher’s office, press, schoolchildren, street performers, decorators, artists, writers, curators, photographers, antiquaries, collectors and others. It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which were all present to witness the opening. As the exhibition progressed, artefacts from the museum were brought out into the open, and artistic works performed in the open, in what Lazzarato described as ‘a very important public space in the city’. In other words, the museum became a venue for events that were not simply ‘celebration’, but actively engaged with, as the biennale itself now tells us.

The importance of the museum to the biennale cannot be understated. The choice to devote so many artefacts to a single exhibition hall, and then leave the rest of the city exposed, is a choice that appears to be neither random (the decision to devote so much art to a single space), nor an act of desperation (the biennale seems to be fleeing an imminent art crisis). The decision to leave the city exposed appears to be an act of desperation, since the artworks, though valuable in their own right</text>

It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which were all competing for attendees with exhibitions that challenged what the museum was doing. As a result, the Biennale outdid itself, competing in exhibitions that challenged what the city was doing. Art was displayed in a different way in each exhibition, but this also happened. This is what biennials do: they interrupt the flow of time and space, giving the impression of a different kind of time and space, but in an ongoing, ongoing, and constantly changing way. Art, on the other hand, has a very particular way of constructing its own worlds. It is not possible to depict everything that is happening in the world through a single painting, nor is it possible to capture everything that is happening in the world with a single photograph. Therefore, the art of the biennale has to be seen as evolving, constantly adapting and constantly constructing its own image of the world. The art has to be seen as a constantly shifting image of the world, constantly making new images, sometimes through sheer</text>

It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which was seen as unmanageable by the biennale, its sponsor, and its patrons. The exhibition itself was dynamic and unpredictable, both at regular and unexpected points. Its title, taken from an old Venetian proverb, almost certainly derives from the introduction of the exhibition to the biennale, and its many curatorial directions. Its rapid succession of sessions in the biennale grounds in 2017 suggested a frenetic pace, an excess of information gathering and recording, and an urge to present as much of the world as possible in one fell swoop. Curators and art historians were quick to point out that this urge to present as much of the world as possible in one fell swoop was also a trait of the narcissistic and opportunistic biennale, which sought to make a name for itself by offering a host of experiences in exchange for a number of curatorial gestures, some savvily staged and some nastier still.

It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which moved towards the internet’s importance, and into the digital age, and beyond. The showpiece became an online archive, and the museum a platform to archive its collections and to make them visible wherever possible. In doing so, it enabled an entirely different kind of understanding of time – one based on the shared experience of living in the same time. 	At the time, digital technology was still in its infant stages, and its wild guesses at adapting the real-time mechanism of the network to archive and retrieve data on the fly, with startling speed and panache, were displacing the old-fashioned archaeological diggers and historians of time, who were caught flat-footed by the speed and depth of the digital archives being made available. 	Yet the act of making and emerging into visible presence of time, and of existing simultaneously in both space and time, was also the very thing that made us human in the first place – something that was at once both powerful and mysterious.

It served as a counterweight to the city’s traditional exhibition and cultural centre, which was becoming increasingly unmanageable and politically unstable. The Biennale needed to create a showpiece that would be unique to its city, and would also be a showpiece within the city. So the Biennale sought artists who would create something different from the usual, conventional, commodified exhibitionary form. These would be the ‘showpieces’ of the Biennale, not the usual exhibitionary form, so that the biennale itself could sustain itself – something that could be done within the curatorial budget. The showpieces would have to be original, cutting-edge, impactful, memorable, teachable, connect with the city, solve a problem, make a difference, and be made in Venice. The traditional, everyday exhibitionary objects – especially the ‘monumental’ and ‘utopian’ – are made in cities, and so are in many cases redundant. The Biennale had to make its own impact, large and small</text>
