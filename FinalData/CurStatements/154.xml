The biennial’s current status is uncertain, with some biennials increasingly relying on the goodwill of their exhibition hosts, while others have sought to exploit idiosyncratic, historical or marginal places of the city in their exhibitions. The biennial is a project-based venue that typically invests a great deal of energy in nurturing relationships with key partner arts institutions, often at the time of their choosing. In a city as big as Leeds, with a robust and valuable arts and cultural infrastructure, this investment would be highly visible. The city is the stage on which the artist-organisation has constructed a residency, offering flexible, multi-year options. In this sense, it can be seen as an investment in the city, in its arts and culture potential, while also providing a livelihood for artists and supporting the arts in some other ways. 	The biennial is a complex, multi-layered programme of activities, each corresponding to a different aspect of the city (culture, design, architecture). Each biennial presents an alternative to the conventions and</text>

The biennial’s current status is uncertain, with some artists and curators expressing fears that it is being over-drafted by curators with an agenda of their own. The exhibitionary format is a last resort, and it is up to curators and artists to organise, present and engage with it effectively.  The Biennial as an Event, or in this Case, an OccasionIf we take the example of the Venice Biennale as an instance, we can move from the organised, global market of biennials to the grassroots, local market of the biennial. Venice Biennale, as we know, is an extraordinary, even extraordinary occurrence. We do not know how it all began, but it is believed that the Italian artist Giancarlo Esposito decided to transform the traditional biennale format – the traditional art collector, the traditional collector, the traditional collector – into an event that would be of cultural relevance to his community. He did not invent the biennial, but he certainly established a standard that</text>

In recent years it has been active in supporting the biennial, contributing financially, producing artist-curated tours and producing a range of educational and outreach materials. The biennial’s current status is uncertain, but its potential is high: it can anchor the biennial within the city and stimulate a new kind of urban development, bringing artists and showcasing their work alongside the cityscape at an accessible level. The biennial may prove more influential in shaping the city than the city itself. This is partly down to the increasing visibility of artists and the increased quantity and variety of their work, which limits the city’s apparent border between the natural and the artistic worlds. In these ways, biennials may be able to exert a more powerful influence than earlier art forms, which were primarily concerned with the maintenance of artistic tastes and image. This effect may be even more pronounced in urban settings, where art is often depicted as a social and civic duty rather than an aesthetic one. The 1990 Venice Biennale may have been the most influential and commercially successful in terms of both quantity and quality of art being produced and exhibited in the city, but it is also the most lamentable for a number of reasons.</text>

The biennial’s current status is uncertain, with many curators questioning its commitment to the city and questioning its role in the city’s cultural landscape. While the biennial may have an important place in the art form, its growth and current cost are limiting, and its future seems to be uncertain. The biennial is a rare object in the art museum, and its future is uncertain for the same reason that its current form is: it operates in a highly restricted space and has a high price. In the foreseeable future, it will either have to compete with museums for visitors and financial resources, or else be absorbed by museums and relegated to a secondary position. In the present, its high price and limited geographical range make it a classic example of an art form that cannot expand without competing with other art forms, and thus it remains an obstacle to contemporary art’s march.

The biennial’s current status is uncertain, with many curators questioning the value of curating an exhibition in the city, and artists and artists’ organisations questioning the nature of the biennial itself. The biennial is a rare object that can be viewed as a capitalising event, and the small but significant number that has been curated represents a critical exception. It serves as a reminder to us all, and those around us, that despite our differences and our own frailties, we have much in common. The biennial is a rare object that is simultaneously present and penetrates contemporary art today, and simultaneously present and resists it. This combination of conditions is a rarity in the modern art museum – and often a decisive factor in its success – but is present in biennials of old. There is a fundamental lack of information about the biennial in most curatorial styles and in contemporary art’s interest is generally directed towards its visitors and visitors, while little is said about the audiences that comprise the art’s actual</text>

In recent years it has been active in supporting the biennial, contributing financially, producing artist-curated tours and producing a range of educational and outreach materials. The biennial’s current status is uncertain, and it is not clear what role the museum will play in the future. The biennial as a cultural practice is experiencing a demographic crunch. The number of artists and curators attending increased from 2007 to 2010, and the number of artists and curators participating in the biennial has remained stable. Current participation in the biennial market is driven by curatorial changes, which are in part a result of a change in audience behaviour. The biennial is a ritualised event, and curatorial narratives are written from top to bottom. This is true not only of the changes that occur with the biennial, but also of cultural tourism, which is driven by airlines and other equipment. Thus the boundaries between the art and airline industry are blurred, and a new industry is emerging, which has a clear interest in the art of transporting artists and their works. It is evident that biennials are culturally relevant in that they are visible and can be seen as a way to connect with the cultural assets that are</text>

In recent years it has been active in supporting the biennial, contributing financially, producing artist-curated tours and producing a range of educational and outreach materials. The biennial’s current status is uncertain, with some artists predicting a reduction in funding and others claiming a doubling down on the art of making art in the city. Nonetheless, the biennial provides a venue for the art to be made manifest in the real-life, perhaps even political-social changes that the city needs to enact in relation to the ongoing destructive economic, ecological and urban pressures on the city. Biennials can also act as a base for a number of projects, including those that aim to directly address the economic and material factors influencing the development of the city, or that seek to mobilize arts and culture within the political infrastructure of the city in a more general, societal or even local sense. The curatorial turn around the biennial in recent years has been a necessary but uneven development, characterised by curatorial activism (often motivated by economic perforations) and a willingness to consider new curatorial approaches that may be available to the institution. The biennial needs to become more than a curator of art and culture; it</text>

The biennial’s current status is uncertain, with some artists indicating that they are not interested in continuing as curators, while others actively seek out institutional or even commercial support for the project. The biennial’s position is complicated by the museum’s increasing commercialisation. It was once the flagship exhibition of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and has a long-term relationship with the United Artists Foundation. It has a significant and growing student body, numbering over 5,000 students, who are drawn to the art of the modern museum, and are active in the galleries and museums where the art is displayed, with projects that address the issues of community and social purpose that are central to the project. It would be naive to suggest that this relationship is innocent, or that the museum’s commercial logic alone is to blame for this shift. The biennial is a global phenomenon, and its logic of the museum as a key destination – a position that demands that it display works from a wide range of sites, with</text>

In the 1990s the museum was noticeably less dominant in the city, mainly because of the absence of a cultural tourism imperative, and the curatorial shift to a co-production and a co-curatorial role with local artist-run youth groups. In the following decades the museum gradually regained the dominant role, with its curatorial budget and presence emphasised. In recent years it has been active in supporting the biennial, contributing financially, producing artist-curated tours and producing a range of educational and outreach materials. The biennial’s current status is uncertain, with the US exhibiting increasing numbers of biennials, and a number of biennials operating in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe and North America. Its primary role appears to be supporting the development of biennials in the city, and in the relevant metropolises of the world. It is important to note, however, that the biennial has a much more limited historical narrative arc, with less emphasis placed on contemporaneity and more about the particularities of the moment. It is up to the generations to decide what is relevant and contemporary, and what is not. So, in the current social and political context, the biennial is likely to play a much more prominent role in the city in the years to come. The significance of this in the present context is underlined by the emergence of a new global urbanisation agenda which is being promoted by the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (2013–2020) and the Sustainable Urban Form (2013–2048)</text>

This project was initially presented as a work in progress, with photographs and documentation gradually emerging as the biennial progressed. The project was developed and curatorial role gradually shifted from photographing the exhibition as a whole, to breaking it into discrete episodes. At the same time, the museum was gradually moulding its position, both internally and externally, in relation to the city in relation to the biennial.

In recent years it has been active in supporting the biennial, contributing financially, producing artist-curated tours and producing a range of educational and outreach materials. The biennial’s current status is uncertain, with some curators openly questioning its ability to deliver on its promise, and exhibitions often being co-exhibitions with other artists’ projects. Despite this, the biennial remains an essential part of the art and arts equation in many cities, and today it is the largest international exhibition market for art and culture.The Biennial as an EventIn recent years biennials have increasingly come to represent the contemporary incarnation of the festival, a prototypical urban event that is now increasingly rare in contemporary forms. The biennial is a prototypical event, and it is this event that is repeated ad infinitum across contemporary art forms, from museums to marketplaces, online or in-person. It is the event that composes the cultural terrain and the biennial as a particular kind of cultural tussle, in that it is both the occasion and the object of continual repetition. It is the prototypicle of modernity reborn, and art is its latest embedding in contemporary life. But</text>

    The next Whitney Biennial is due to open in 2017. The biennial format, which the Swedish Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s, encourages dialogue between artists, the public and the natural environment through a collaborative, multi-disciplinary process. Artists, curators, artists' associations, architects, teachers, environmental campaigners and journalists take part in the dialogue through artist-organisations, civil society, research institutions, press organisations, academia, art galleries and grassroots art-making. Sweat equity is given to those organisations whose work contributes to the dialogue, while in the case of large-scale management schemes, it is given back to the developers when the schemes are mothballed. For more than twenty years, the biennial format was used in Sweden to celebrate the cultural output of the country’s far right, which included neo-nazi and white supremacist ideologies. During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices

During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices. The biennial format emerged as a way to accommodate a wide range of expertise and expertise-seekers, while protecting the identities of the artists and the communities they visited. The relationship between the biennial and the local community was further complicated by the fact that, during this time, artists were increasingly active in the area around them, participating in community events and programmes, meeting local residents and engaging with local communities. In 1969, the first Biennale of Sydney was curated by and opened by the artist Paul McCarthy, who continued to work with the organiser of the event, the National Theatre, until his death in 1974. The biennial format was also a platform for artists to experiment with new forms of patronage, as well as a way to develop distinctive art-histories through curatorial actions. A number of biennials during the 1970s and 1980s introduced new cultural forms and engaged with old questions of power and patronage. The most iconic of these was the ‘1914’</text>

During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices through participation, negotiation and inclusion. In 1980, a ‘cultural ghetto’ was created in and around Malmo, Sweden’s second-largest city, where neo-nazi, white supremacist and other radical groups active in the region gathered. Malmo was designated a city for new art and radical culture in 1984. During the 1980s, the city witnessed a radical transformation as a result of a city council agenda to redevelop the periphery of the city and industrial areas. The ‘central business district’ became a research centre for the city’s development, while the ‘Arena’ became a venue for concerts and exhibitions. During this time, Malmo experienced a rapid population explosion due to tax-funded public works and programmes, which created a city wall around the city and a virtual ghettoisation of its residents. By the 1990s, the Arena was experiencing a dilapidated condition as a result of budget shortfalls. Art projects were shelved in favour</text>

In 1984, the biennial itself became a local movement. In the 1990s, the biennial format was reorientated to take into account the specificities of the local community. In 2015, the museum and the biennial were both established in Stockholm in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.[16] Art and social practice: what have we become?

For more than twenty years, the biennial format was used in Sweden to celebrate the cultural output of the country’s far right, which included neo-nazi and white supremacist ideologies. During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices through in-depth studies of local communities. In 1980, the biennial format was further modified by the new museum law, which made it a state cultural objective, rather than a museum objective, to develop a permanent collection of cultural assets. So, biennials today have a public policy component, while museum-quality collections have a public act component. In the 1980s and 1990s, the biennial format was thought by some to be a way to simultaneously integrate art and the urban environment, while offering both a home for contemporary art and a return to the former ‘carnival’, where art and the urban environment met in a common context. While a museum‐quality collection like MoMA’s collection of art and architecture is a museum objective, a biennial collection like the MoMA’s collection of architecture and works of art is a city objective. The problem with the biennial collection in the 1980s and 1990s is that it became common for artists</text>

For more than twenty years, the biennial format was used in Sweden to celebrate the cultural output of the country’s far right, which included neo-nazi and white supremacist ideologies. During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices in a public realm. For example, the Biennale of Sydney was held in cooperation with ACT UP (founded in 1981) and led by artists Terry Gilliam, Peter Herman and Russ Stevenson. 	At the time, the political impact of the discursive was particularly acute in the cultural sphere. As early as the mid-1960s, the discourses of race, class and gender were used to justify and to some extent inaugurate the racist state sponsored neo-liberal economic policies of transition and modernization. The discourses of ‘race relations’ were used as a justification for the military-industrial complex’s centralisation, of course with a strong social dimension. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, artistic initiatives and their output were used as a weapon in a social struggle. In the run-up to the 2004 Olympic Games, the Biennale commissioned a number of artists to undertake creative projects in the wake of the Portoghesi’s Port</text>

During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices in the social and cultural sphere in an explicitly nationalist context.[3]In recent years, biennials have come to represent the triumph of democratic values in a country facing massive social and economic crises. The popularity of the biennial in cities across the globe has come as a consequence of a combination of factors, including the ubiquity of its location in major tourist destinations, the financial rewards associated with holding a permanent art collection, and the capacity of biennials to reliably generate substantial amounts of economic activity in a city. However, the biennial has also become a form of permanent exhibition in a city facing similar crises, and the emergence of a biennial culture is a major contributor to this transition. The biennial format has undergone a dramatic shift in the nineteenth century, when it was primarily a form of temporary exhibitionary exhibitionary exhibitionary exhibitionary exhibitions. It is now a dominant exhibitionary form with a global distribution network operating in over 100 countries, occurring in over 80% of the world�</text>

During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices in their communities. In 1974, the 56th International Biennale of Sweden (Banff) was held, and in 1978, the first Black-E and the Bold Alliance for Social Justice (Black-E) International Exhibition in Stockholm. The ban on the swastika and the anti-Semitic symbol Åkringa sent a clear message that the interests of the artistically-inclined were excluded. In a 1978 interview with Martin Nygaard, a frustrated Lyall resident complained that his place in the local art world was being taken by an army of aestheticians, photographers and art collectors. Art, he claimed, was a luxury reserved for privileged individuals. Nygaard, a prolific writer and critic, was no privileged person. He was a struggling journalist and a prolific contributor to the New York Times, a position he held from 1947 until his death in 1989. It is true that during this same period, Nygaard was a partner in the internationally</text>

During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices with workers, communities and other stakeholders, with participation in the art world at a smaller scale possible. In 1990, the biennale was restructured to better address contemporary art and artistic styles that were influencing modes of political and social change, while maintaining a more traditional, cathartic element. In 1994, the biennial was restructured to better address contemporary art and its impact on urban and regional change, while retaining its historical roots. In 2015, the biennale was restructured to better address contemporary art and its impact on global urbanisation, while retaining its historical roots. In 2017, the biennale format was re-shaped to better address artists' needs and audiences, while retaining its cathartic power. At the time of its creation, the name Biennale was generic and unrealisable; in the age of the biennial it is more relevant and real.

During this time, the biennial format was also a platform for artists to develop communitarian and democratic practices through an alternative to capitalism. In 1980, the Venice Biennale was one of many art biennials to adopt the format in an attempt to address the political situation in the city. The adoption of this new format coincided with a large-scale re-construction project led by artist and DA, Ingemar Solberg, which combined the ability to assemble large numbers of participants into an immersive experience through art and architecture, as well as the development of a ‘biennial’ by which many of these participants could claim a share. Art and the BiennaleIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Venice Biennale was run by the Biennale Foundation, a privately-owned organisation established in 1971. The foundation’s mandate was to coordinate the operations of the Biennale and to promote the exhibition as a ‘significant event’ in the city. In 1974, the Biennale was renamed to honor the twenty-fifth anniversary of the</text>

The Council of Europe’s recommendation that teaching materials should be objective, transparent and based on evidence is a good starting point, but it does not establish an idealised model of how to achieve ‘real life’ through art alone. The humanistic and democratic values that artists and designers strive for inevitably generate their own countervailing forces, and it is this dynamic that must be countered in different ways. As an introduction, here are a few practices and objects that capture the essence of what an artist or designer might aspire to achieve:1. A gallery of diverse styles and habitats, arranged according to their geographical isolation.2. An organic, self-organising forest that emerges from the galleries and the forest floor, providing a continuous cycle of renewing exhibits and exhibitions.3. The planting of trees in parks, squares or any open area that is not zoned residential or commercial, to be used for one of the many purposes of the city.4. The adoption, in planning, of park-like settings, where trees are often planted in close proximity to underground circulation routes, underground passageways and power lines, in an attempt to better integrate them into urban environments.5. The planting of trees in non-design parks, especially in the developing world, in an attempt to restore natural resources and forest cover to areas devastated by development.6. The planting of palms in parks in an attempt to restore natural resources and forest cover to areas that are lost to palm-oil production.7. The planting of yew trees in parks in an attempt to restore natural resources and forest cover to areas that are lost to agriculture.These are just a few examples of many that could be listed, but since they tend to escape our thinking, we do not usually do them. Nevertheless, they are typical of the over-hyped ‘heritage-led’ regeneration narrative that characterises much of the developing world’s urban regeneration.8. The planting of</text>

There’s no question of home anymore: you’re either at home with us or nowhere to be. How do we know that our home is good? Because our home is good: it’s being made by people who’ve put in a lot of effort and are ready to take on the challenges thrown at them. There’s a sense of exhilaration and power in the work we do, both as practitioners and artists: the sense of our home's resilience, its ability to stand on its own two legs. People often ask how we know what we’re doing. It’s a very powerful feeling. We’ve all felt that sense of empowerment when we first started, that we’re making things happen, that we’re changing the world. But what we do with that knowledge comes from our own experiences: learning to live, learning to love, learning to become what other places</text>

This is home.This concept of home also describes the way in which our current political and economic systems are designed to produce and support a defined set of behaviours and sets of needs – needs that are firmly embedded and will remain that way no matter what. So how can these dynamics be altered and disrupted? There are a few specific interventions that can be made at an early age, when people start to make infrastructural and institutional changes, in order to alter the dynamic between public and private, public and community. One of the most effective interventions for reducing vulnerability to the built environment is education. So how can interventions be made and how are they instilled in early childhood? One of the ways in which the Biennale can engage with this dynamic is by offering free or cheap educational programmes in schools, colleges or universities about the built environment, its benefits and responsibilities.

This is really exciting news for a city that’s struggling to regenerate while art galleries, once a staple of the city, are forced out of commission and replaced by new development, by which I mean ‘affordable housing’ or ‘partnerships’ that cater to local needs. It’s an acknowledgement that the art gallery is important in keeping the city’s character, but also in providing a kind of public realm, where people can come and explore the city without having to travel far or investing very much time in the city. This is one of the ways in which the gallery is displacing the artist, artist in this case being the late, great Peter Brook, whose work is fed into the built environment through planning, tourism, and other mechanisms. Another is the growing market for architectural curiosities, which is driven by developers desperate to get into the city’s cultural real estate and turn it into</text>

I think of the bakery as a microcosm of what’s possible for communities to be empowered by decentralisation. It’s a bakery with a community bakery, a bake-off of sorts between local and national artists, a gallery with a café and a home bakery, a place to unwind after a long day of work, and a space for discussion and debate. It’s a place where ideas circulate freely, and where ideas are actively sought after – not least by local residents looking for a bargain basement rental property to put their houses. But it’s also a place where people make decisions about how to spend their time – and have to be able to say what those decisions are – and that’s where decisions-makers reside. The words seem prescient as they were uttered by a city councilman while walking past a converted jeweller's shop on his way to work. The city has a future if it</text>

There’s no question of home anymore: you reach for the solar panel when you want a big solar panel, but now you’ve got to sacrifice some privacy. But even if you’re perfectly happy in your semi-permanent gallery and gallery of fine art, it’s still a biennale, it’s still a exhibition venue, it’s still a site for a community to be formed through mutual aid and collective learning. Art's place is no longer circumscribed by the rigid definition of what’s considered a home. It’s now a site for encounter, not necessarily a place where one finds one’s way to be accepted, but an encounter nonetheless. And this is why biennales, and indeed any type of large-scale exhibition, are so important, because they allow us to discover something new and in-depth about the place we come from and our place in the world</text>

The notion of home that’s still attached to a specific place in time – where does that place, where does it start, and where does it end up? — is losing relevance. We live in a city that’s becoming increasingly individualised, that’s no longer based on centrally planned economic development. We’re not born with houses or grand houses or any kind of equity, but we do have access to transport and property, and we do have the equity to buy a house – which is still unaffordable for many people. So in this sense, we have some equity in terms of what we can achieve as individuals, but also in terms of what we can't. I don’t think we've lost that argument yet, although I do think that some people have internalised that argument and are resisting the necessity of owning houses.

The community board is a hybrid institution too, often conflated with its green and low-carbon construction, but it’s also a corporate vehicle that serves as a middleman between the local and the urban, between the development corporation (DC) and the post-industry (HRC). It provides a buffer to sudden, unexpected increases in population density and scrambles the city’s finite natural resources, using the money raised by the general public to pay for projects that benefit a community of residents and small business owners.   A few years into  	The Green Lane initiative, the community board has begun to implement projects such as  	designing green spaces for the community garden, the community recreation ground and the street, installing solar panels and creating a dedicated  	design studio for community members’ use</text>

And in a way, that feels like a lost opportunity to lose yourself in the city. The opportunity to be a visitor or a resident, and to lose yourself in the city’s culture and history. I also feel like this lost opportunity is what creates the risk in gentrification: the feeling that somehow, somewhere out there, money talks. If you believe what the developers and the critics of the projects that are built around those projects, then you’re literally saying that the city is useless without these kinds of houses. And these are the gentrifiers: the city as a rental market, a marketplace without regulation, and a space for the rich to make mistakes and move away from those who’re less able to handle the consequences. So these criticisms of the projects that are being built around architecturally vacant sites are often used as a way to say, ‘Hey, this is another opportunity for the developer to make a quick buck.�</text>

The definition of home is no longer defined by the rigid parameters of the twentieth century, and while our city’s definition of home certainly includes industries of commodification, it also includes caring for one’s own self and the wellbeing of others. And so, in an increasingly globalised and integrated economy, we are witnessing a redefinition of how we measure and measure again what has, until now, been seen as the fundamental home of the modern economy. The home is back. And if you’re not familiar with the term ‘home page’ then you should probably start with this definition: the homepage of the internet is the point where all data – human, data, ideas, images, maps and more come to life. So, the actual physical place where all of this data happens to be located – where images, videos, data and more meet – is where the prefix ‘HARDETEXT’ usually finds itself after a website has been</text>

Every decision we make is rooted in a community’s collective will, and every action taken contributes to the creation of a better future for our neighbourhood or town. And yet it’s still not easy to accept that we create what we call ‘the city’ through our actions and decisions, and that cities actually become places where people live, work and play? In that case, what does it mean to be ‘home’? Taking Root  The word ‘home’ has been a source of much confusion in the context of the modern urbanisation process. It’s easy to understand the attraction of such a pejorative term when applied to neighbourhoods and urban landscapes defined by codes, regulations and political agency. But what does it mean to be ‘home’? When we talk about ‘the city’ as a relational concept, not an individual or household one, we create confusion by defining the city</text>

The sculpture was intended to stand in for the museum as a double, albeit complementary, unit. His installation, however, functions as both a museum and a shop. It is both a transfiguration and a monument, but it is neither. Jussi Parikkauskas’ transfiguration is a political act, designed to isolate and disempower the artist in such a way as to ensure that he does not engage with the present through symbolic or performative means. It is a political act through and through, and it is a fitting end to a political act. He is not an artist, and his work is not a work of art, but he is an artist nonetheless. His project and his exhibition run are effectively a ‘metaphor’ for the museum, a rhetorical trick through the museum’s physical and mental space that seeks to comprehends the unknown through the motif of the hidden subject. The art is placed in for the forgotten, while the forgotten sells the art. The exhibition runs parallel to the biennial, but it is the latter that ultimately emerges as the winner. It is a shift in the relative place of the artist and the museum,</text>

It is both a transfiguration and a monument. Panoramic photographs document the history of the United States and of the Western hemisphere from the end of the nineteenth century to the present. The images speak of landscapes that existed only in the imagination of western humans, of the unfree and the wild, of settlement and desert, of factories and the landscape itself. Panoramic photographs were made in Los Angeles in the early twentieth century, but here the images are from the point of view of people ‘born and brought up' in the region, taking place in the immediate vicinity. How can these historical images be relevant in the twenty-first century when the biennial format is contemporaneous with the urban landscape, but not at all contemporaneous with the urban environment, but clearly contemporaneous with a multitude of other sites and times? I believe that the identification of specific sites and times is essential to any ecological or urbanist understanding of how the dynamic is governed.

It is both a transfiguration and a monument to the metainterface, where its structured chaos and rigid materiality are erected in defiance of all that is sought in the city. Jussi Parikkauskas’ Transfiguration is a ‘wild card’ that can play any city- or even international-stage project. Its unpredictable and dynamic content can either play for those who know how to manage success and ambiguity well or it can lead to disaster. Its instability, in turn, can be used by those who would prefer to hide or hide from the challenges that lie ahead. The risk, then, is that what is built or intended to be a monument to memory or a symbolic gesture to future visitors may in fact lead to its demolition. The potential for destruction, and for that matter for destruction at a moment's notice, presents itself in the form of a wild card. The risk is that if something is not done, or is not expected to be done, then something may go wrong. The</text>

It is both a transfiguration and a monument to the museum, standing as it does outside the biennial venue, where it is auctioned off amongst the various art-related sectors of the city. Jussi parodies its monolithic mass of buyers and sellers with a series of micro-instalments that assemble in the public gallery space of the biennial. These micro-instances of the wallflower offer a window on the museum and the local community, allowing passage across the divide into the biennial experience, where one finds the assemblage of buyers and sellers in a disjointed and disjointed manner. Jussi goes on to argue that the ‘biennial’ should be several ‘differentiations’ and that it should respond to the various local needs and interests, incorporating those from both the museum and the community. This is to my mind the only consistent way in which the biennial has behaved since it was first proposed in 1991. There are other continuums and multiple modes of</text>

The biennial format will see works from the curatoriate presented in chronological order from the exhibition they appear in. This is in contrast to the present chronological order of museum collections, in which new works are presented in chronological order of their installation. This will render the biennial format obsolete, although it is worth noting that biennials themselves have responded to this change with varying degrees of enthusiasm and even hostility. Jussi Parikkauskas (2017) is an example to the contrary. His installation, Wallflower, which debuted as a solo project in February 2018, immediately sought to return to the biennial structure by positioning himself outside the biennial itself, through a double-sided transfiguration. The sculpture was intended to stand in for the museum as a double, albeit complementary, unit. His installation, however, functions as both a museum and a shop. It is both a transfiguration and a monument, but neither can do both. His installation is both a museum and a city, but neither can explore both. He is both a visitor and a museum curator, but neither is entrusted with the exclusive curatorial attention of the museum. He is both a curatorial priority and a museum critic, but neither is in a position to speak on the other's behalf. All of these positions are, however, clearly stated in the Biennial's 2017 Strategy, where biennials are referred to as ‘related but distinct groups’. Curators in this sense are not confined to the museum, and can actively participate in developing the museum and its representations through their work, commentary, and even presentation. The potential for this is emphasised in the 2017 Biennial, which incorporated research from the museum and the local community, as well as art students from the university and the gallery, with the curatorate led by Professor Hanno Kunoivisto conducting a ‘curatorial tour of</text>

The sculpture was intended to stand in for the museum as a double, albeit complementary, unit. His installation, however, functions as both a museum and a shop. It is both a transfiguration and a monument to the museum, standing as it does amid scattered artefacts, many of which are objects of cultural exchange between the two museums. Jussi parrots the biennial form in his own work, using it to explore the cultural links between the two museums. While he may be looking for exchange, his primary aim is to document the exchange between cultures through what he calls ‘documentary writing’. He writes:I write primarily about exchange, about the ways in which exchange can lead to understanding, and about the ways in which the exchange can break the monotony of routine and the routine of habit. But I also write about much more important subjects, including the ways in which exchange can and cannot bring about the anticipated benefits of exchange. For example, I’ve often felt that when it comes to climate change, we are less interested in the politics of CO2 than in the needs of absorbing energy. And this lack of politics in our thinking may be one of</text>

It is both a transfiguration and a monument, but it is neither. The realisation of these contradictory ends, or, to be more specific, the failure to realise them, is the root of much biennial exhibitionary failure. There is no inherent conflict between the performance of art and the performance of art as art, only and never a conflict between the two. When looking at a large gallery of contemporary art, we can still recognise some of these past exhibitions, for example, but the vast majority of biennials we encounter today, aside from New York and London, have no artistic orientation. That is, they do not see art as a performance, and art as a specific type of material, which is often used for a specific purpose and with specific properties, is a convention that has been generating increasing frequency, as biennials seek to be more cultural and ethno-linguistic than ever, and in many cases, inimical to the interests of their art-world clients. Art lovers need to</text>

It is both a transfiguration and a monument to the museum, and both are artefacts of a museum. While it is true that Parikkauskas sought to return to the biennial as a ‘primary organizing principle’, his project is no longer anchored in the biennial itself as a particular product or format. Rather, it is an installation that emerges independently of the biennial it is placed within. It is a different project that seeks to understand the role that art can play in social change, one that seeks to address the fact that many artists are engaged in activities that are typically associated with museums and archives, but which are in fact almost entirely outside the museum environment. Art and the social change that results from it are two sides of the same coin. While it is true that biennials have positions of great power and influence, the social and political power that comes with being the museum or archival collections for a particular generation, particularly within the last twenty years, is such that the power that comes with</text>

Jussi Parikkauskas’ Wallflower is intended to stand in for the museum as a double, albeit complementary, unit. It is a museum, documenting the history of a specific place and time, while simultaneously offering a service in the form of a transfiguration – that is, a technique or set of techniques for evoking a specific historical context through which a particular cultural practice emerges. The word ‘transfiguration’ has been shortened several times throughout this article, to become more synonymous with what it really means: what it actually does. While Jussi Parikkauskas’ work in Berlin and Los Angeles is a trip across the historical transfiguration map, his work in Helsinki is a trip across the cultural transfiguration map. His new work for the Royal Academy of Arts and Museum of Modern Art, New York, is a visit to an ancient and now now largely</text>

His choice to insert himself between the museum and the biennial was a deliberate one, taking into consideration the latter's history and present curatorial style – a curatorial style that seeks to intervene in the former as little as possible. At the same time, his installation deliberately introduces a new mode of perception, one in which the past and the future do not coincide. Art and art have often been used as a means to protest against the control exercised by powerful cultural institutions, and Jussi Parikkauskas presents a case study in this inimitable form of protest.  His fascination for the past, a love of travel and a deep knowledge of all things rural are just some of the traits that have made him interesting and powerful in the biennial context. He is the author of From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Art, Resistance and Secular Urbanization (2018) and is currently researching the Counter Culture: Anti-Intellectualism Anthology.

In the contemporary context, it is important to recognise that in an increasingly urbanised country like Brazil, this kind of ‘episodic’ is deeply problematic. While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘peripheral’ remains underdeveloped, under-studied and mired in poverty. In many cities, the ‘peripheral’ is a monorail station, a port terminal or a busy international airport. In many cities, it is even a port city. But in many other cities, the ‘peripheral’ is a sprawling metropolis with an intricate network of subways, subways and elevated highways, running parallel to the city’s main drag but in some cases even further out. Facing this urbanisation and the proliferation of infrastructure that supports it, the ‘peripheral’ has several options: it can shrink, it can uproot itself, it can surrender its urbanity to the city’s infrastructure, but none of these are cheap or easy. If the ‘peripheral’ is to retain its urbanity, it needs strong cultural institutions and an active civic life, which at the present time</text>

In the contemporary context, it is important to recognise that in an increasingly urbanised country like Brazil, this kind of ‘episodic’ is deeply problematic. While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘peripheral’ is getting smaller, while the ‘central’ is getting bigger. As a result, the city is experiencing a multi-decade ‘leap’ that is increasingly seen as necessary to ensure the city’s continuity and the global spread of its culture. As a result, the ‘peripheral’ is experiencing a rapid change that is both characterised by high levels of inequality and a huge urban crisis, fueled by a biennial that is seen as a solution to the problem it is experiencing at an accelerated pace. While the biennial may offer a good initial investment, its primary purpose in the city of a given age is circumscribed by the need to constantly renew it and by the need to be able to adapt to new forms of capital formation and urbanisation in the context of the ever-expanding metropolis. As such, Brazil’s own cultural imperialism, if there is such a thing, is a far cry from</text>

In the contemporary context, it is important to recognise that in an increasingly urbanised country like Brazil, this kind of ‘episodic’ is deeply problematic. While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘periphery’ is getting smaller and the region is becoming increasingly ruralised. And while the city’s growth is good for the planet as a whole, it is becoming ever more difficult to live in the city or rural areas because of the rapid growth of cities and the suburbanisation of rural areas, which is taking place all over the country. So while the biennial or large-scale international art exhibition may seem like a great big bang for the urban urban cultural sector in the national capitals, in most cases this is precisely what is happening. The city is a large, growing part of the globalised economy, but it is also a ‘giant machine’, meaning that it must somehow work through some kind of internal logic or system that generates art, whether that is the ‘market’, the ‘manufacturing dynamic’, the ‘value added’ or any number of other factors. In other words, the biennial is a �</text>

In the contemporary context, it is important to recognise that in an increasingly urbanised country like Brazil, this kind of ‘episodic’ is deeply problematic. While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘peripheral’ is shrinking. The rapid growth of the peripherals creates its own kind of temporalism, which in turn makes it harder to imagine the city anymore. The ‘peripheral’ is the last word on the planet before the Anthropocene, and while it is the last word, it is also the present in which the struggle for existence takes place. In other words, the ‘last word’ is the place where the struggle for existence takes place on a global scale.  So while the ‘stern transition’ to the city in most of the world is happening at an incredible pace, in Brazil it is happening at a rate that could still be considered a slow death. And while there is a biennial left, it is likely that Brazil will lose its place in a few years, as the rest of the world catches up and starts to produce very different kinds of art from Brazil. In any case, the fact that the biennial was</text>

In the contemporary context, it is important to recognise that in an increasingly urbanised country like Brazil, this kind of ‘episodic’ is deeply problematic. While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘peripheral’ is getting older and passing into the void that is being created by the explosion of ‘digital’ experiences, media and technology everywhere. As a city, the ‘peripheral’ is getting smaller and the urbanisation occurring in the city is happening at a faster clip. While the biennial may claim to be a curator’s office, it is also a curator’s gallery, a place where art is displayed at a pace and in a manner that is continuous with the artist’s expectations. In this sense, it is a museum in the traditional sense, but it also exhibits the city’s real tricks of the urban game — tricks that the art dealer and museum would surely employ if they could pull off such a thing.  So, while it claims to be a ‘comprehensive survey of the biennial landscape’,2   it is also a ‘comprehensive study of the contemporary</text>

While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘peripheral’ remains underdeveloped, under-illuminated or otherwise unexciting. In many cities, the ‘peripheral’ is over-dramatic, overrun with art collectors or has other urban effects that are detrimental to the city’s self-image and future prospects. While some might say that the introduction of art biennials in economically vibrant regions like Brazil is a logical extension of the city’s current practice of collecting and preserving assets, in other cases the ‘current’ practice of biennials may be an aberration that needs to be addressed. This is particularly true in the developing world where cities are often accused of being stuck in an ‘urban‑ness’ trap. However, there are other factors that can exert an influence on the development of the ‘current’ and the propensity to build, to engage citizens, to attract investment and to create opportunities for all.

In the contemporary context, it is important to recognise that in an increasingly urbanised country like Brazil, this kind of ‘episodic’ is deeply problematic. While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘present’ is changing. With an ever larger and more diverse population, the city is in many ways an ever-changing exhibition platform, offering a new (and sometimes spectacular) exhibition a week.  But this kind of ‘episodic’ also has a kind of ‘present’ that is regularly interrupted, even though it is often the case that the interruption occurs when the exhibition is on display for a short period of time, usually a matter of weeks or months. This kind of temporal complication is a kind of ‘fusion of times’, a kind of ‘time-critical mass’ that is most easily observed in artist studios and art institutions, and which is a kind of continuous (but brief) recording of a particular event or movement. It is a kind of ‘eventual’ that captures the imagination and behaviours of people all over the world when it occurs, and a kind of ‘storytelling’ that is rapid when</text>

While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘frontier’ is slowly sinking into the city’s peripheral spaces and landscapes. And while the city is a core part of the Brazilian economy, its growth is uneven and often stunted by corruption, power struggles, and nationalism are rife in the vast majority of the country. So while the city may indeed be a place where you can find adventure, wonder and strangeness, its trajectory is also one of rapid economic decline, of malaise, despair and racial injustice. And while it may be true that in the past decade the city has burst at the seams,2  ‘there is no future for this city in the form or the time’,3 in the present it is evident that the city is slowly sinking back into the past, becoming what architecturally and ethnically Gentoo-like Brazil can only dream of.  The strangest and most fascinating turn of events has undoubtedly been the large scale and prolonged construction projects that have become routine in Brazil over the past</text>

In the contemporary context, it is important to recognise that in an increasingly urbanised country like Brazil, this kind of ‘episodic’ is deeply problematic. While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘frontier’ is contracting. When the city is big and prosperous, the ‘frontier’ is the site of enormous metropolises with all their built and natural resources, but when the city is poor and embattled, the ‘frontier’ offers the chance to live on a modest income, free from the encroachments of developed capitalism and imperialism. If the frontier is always on the move, then the city has become that much too present.  As an exhibitionary form, the biennial has become critical to the development of all these different kinds of ‘frontiers’ and ‘indispensable parts’ of the world. In this sense, then, the biennial form is essential to the realisation of artistic, urban and cultural resources; a resource that is both abundant and inexhaustible.  The biennial form is also essential for the financial survival of many curatorial practices, for instance, but its rapid proliferation on a global</text>

While the city is growing in size and in most other places around the world, the ‘periphery’ is losing its identity. The urban centre is becoming ever more corporatised, and with it more technologically empowered. As the city expands, so does its infrastructural capacity, which today is mainly dependent on the city’s economic performance. If the periphery is increasingly visible only as an external node in a globalised urbanisation process, then the city is increasingly visible only as an internal node within that process. In an increasingly globalised country like Brazil, the infrastructuralisation of the city is closely related to the neoliberalisation of services, and in turn, the financialisation of urban infrastructure. Brazil has been a world leader in the development of infrastructure and urbanisation – developing roads, bridges, tunnels, ports and all the rest – but as roads, bridges, tunnels and ports developed in parallel, infrastructure and urbanisation in Brazil came to depend on a handful of mega projects and quick fixes.

The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes that its curatorial proposal not only incorporate art from a geographically diverse region into a multi-format exhibitionary form, but that it should be a catalyst for the creation of new art through a multi-disciplinary dialogue. The curatorial proposal is the most visible element in the exhibitionary complex, but the multi-disciplinary discussion that results from it is more subtle and complex. The curatorial proposal is carefully considered in the context of the art, but it is far more substantive in its effects. It has the greatest influence when it comes to changing art’s perception and action. The Pan-African Art Biennial opens its curatorial plan on 14 and 15 March 2016 in Cairo, Egypt.

Although the town itself does not participate in the curatorial process, the museum that it houses participates in the story of the town through a number of different media outlets.

The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes a biennial that takes the form of an exhibition, as in a museum, but it takes a particular curatorial vision into consideration when deciding what to include or exclude from the exhibitionary form. The curator is the ultimate arbiter of what is or is not considered art and contemporary. Curators in this sense constitute a heterogeneous group who jointly own the precise forms and contents of contemporary art and contemporary culture. The question is how art can take part in this collaborative process. The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes that its curatorial proposal be considered in an interdisciplinary context, taking into consideration not only the curator’s artistic perspective, but also the context, the community of artists, the communities that are part of the local artworld or the urban environment, the role that art can or cannot play, and other factors. In this sense, the biennial is asking artists and curators to consider the social and cultural dimensions of contemporary artmaking as a way to think about art and its social effects and to create an artworld according to the new social dynamics and patterns that are emerging globally.

Curators in this sense constitute a heterogeneous group who jointly own the precise forms and contents of contemporary art and contemporary culture. The question is how art can take part in this collaborative process. The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes that its curatorial proposal be fully participatory, meaning that it participates in the making of art itself. The proposal itself calls for an artist to be selected through an open call to a future instalment, and asks that the art be realized as a curatorial intervention into the making of art. The open call results in a show that is ideologically diverse in its presentation of art, but all artworks are given equal weight in relation to the proposal. The open call results in the appearance of a proposal that is not mutually exclusive with the existing art form or the contemporary artist. Every artist who participates in the open call receives a payment of R$50,000 (US$45,000). The Pan-African Art Biennial is led by Prof. Michel deCerteau (France) and Dr. Amy Lawless (United Kingdom). The curator is selected through a shortlist of applicants, which is a combination of eminent contemporary and historically oriented artists.

Curators in this sense constitute a heterogeneous group who jointly own the precise forms and contents of contemporary art and contemporary culture. The question is how art can take part in this collaborative process. The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes that its curatorial proposal be based on a cultural geography survey of West Africa. This cultural geography is drawn upon the latest literature on the continent, current events and their places in the world, together with archival documents and ethnographic reports. It also considers current trends in art and contemporary art’s place in African cultural landscapes. Finally, the cultural geography section of the proposal includes a request that the exhibitionary form be made active in reconfiguring West Africa through ethnographic, archival and linguistic research.1 This last demand is a way of asking whether the Pan-African Art Biennial is operating outside the system that it is ostensibly addressing, or whether it is actually addressing the system as a whole. Are its curatorial proposals operating outside the constraints of the current art market in order to foster a more equitable distribution of art and its products? For example, what is the role of a cultural geographer when the current art market is dominated by a single nation-state? Is there an alternative market for African art</text>

Curators in this sense constitute a heterogeneous group who jointly own the precise forms and contents of contemporary art and contemporary culture. The question is how art can take part in this collaborative process. The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes that its curatorial proposal be an amalgamation of several other curatorial projects that collectively make up what the organisers would call a ‘regional art school’. The proposed school would draw upon the curatorial thinking of previous biennials, including the ‘Curatorial Alliance’ that the Biennial has led in founding nations. This curatorial thinking has evolved in tandem with the increasing public funding of art services, which has enabled a proliferation of art schools across the continent. The curatorial proposal is an inclusive one, proposing ‘totaling to date of over one hundred predominantly African and African-American arts schools within fifty-five cities across North and South Africa, as well as international destinations throughout Europe, Asia and America’s largest cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Taipei. The proposal is also an inclusive one, proposing ‘regardless of region, of other cultural forms, including but not limited to, indigenous peoples, languages’ and cultures.

The question is how art can take part in this collaborative process. The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes that its curatorial proposal be one of negotiation. A negotiated form of participation entails compromise and negotiation. Its mediators aim to gather diverse opinions and position themselves in negotiation with the powerful cultural interests of their respective countries. The proposal is not a proposal to abolish art museums entirely but aims to foster a mutually agreeable co-existence between art and communities through art that is representative and authentic to their respective contexts. Indeed, the idea is to support and facilitate the cultural activities of the local communities in their respective places by providing the venues, the equipment, the funding, and the life-supporting activities through which local communities can develop their own cultural practices. If such capacities are not already in place, the mediators would do well to ensure they have the capacity to participate in this new art-based multi-system that is emerging in their respective localities. Art, as art in its various forms, is an inherently political act. It is deeply embedded in the historically constituted social world and is expected to perform in the real life situations</text>

The question is how art can take part in this collaborative process. The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes that its curatorial proposal be drawn up in coordination with the national art departments, and with other art institutions, to enable the participation of all art users, including local artists, while enabling dialogue, exchange, and debate on the exhibitionary form between local artists, art biennials and other art institutions. The proposal is intended to reactivate a neglected space for art and artists in the city, and to do so in a way that is both sensitive to the potential downsides and heights of this kind of interactive art-making.Whilst the creative and useful actions suggested by this proposal are valuable in bringing art closer to urban environments, they inevitably place a premium on the participation of artists and their audiences in the production of contemporary and experimental art within the curatorial fantasy. Such a fantasy would need to provide greater accessibility to contemporary and experimental art, and it would also require an equally compelling rationale to justify the curatorial actions taken here.

The regional agenda will be developed through the commissioning of artworks, the selection and installation of cultural assets, and the provision of support for cultural institutions and their activities. The proposal is to be incorporated into the local art budget (KAB), the annual budget of the KAB, and disseminated through local artists and arts organizations. The proposal is to be framed within the framework of an art critic’s diary that will accompany each of the fourteenth and fifteenth editions of the KAB. The diary will be a record of the curatorial events of the previous twelve months. It will include photographs, biennials, lists, and chronologies of art’s previous interventions in the region. It will also include a chronology of art’s proposed art practices in the region. The diary will tell the story of the art’s creation, the cur</text>

The Pan-African Art Biennial proposes that its curatorial proposal be an 'episodic’ form: it is a set of rules governing what can and cannot be put on display. Such a proposal represents a compromise, but its ambition and the plans that it documents are ambitious indeed. The curatorial agenda and the currant’s own position on what can and cannot be exhibited really does determine what is or is not allowed onto display. For example, the curator may decide that a work that is part of the Biennial format is not in fact part of a museum piece, but rather it is an example of contemporary art and thus subject to being stacked against the wall by contemporary art museums. Or the curator may decide that a piece is not contemporary, but rather of a museum piece, and thus it cannot be displayed in a museum. Curators are creative problem-solvers who work collaboratively with communities to come up with creative solutions to thornier problems.

    reimagines the curation of a biennial as a ‘curatorial nightmare’, one in which biennials have become objects of aesthetic review, and the curatorial is one in which aesthetics reign supreme. How is this possible? Perhaps we could trace the appearance of this notion back to the early modern age of aestheticised review, when aesthetic judgement was ascribed a significant place in the cultural formation of the modern nation. During this period, aesthetic forms were considered the arbiters of aesthetic outcomes, and aesthetic judgements were matters of public record. The proliferation of bookshops, and the frequent reading of a book by a select group of authors, in turn, lent the bookish impulse a mythological quality. And, well into the twentieth century, a generation of Americans were led to believe that literature could be read in almost any setting, that it could be set in a single location, and that it could occur across multiple settings.

This notion of multiple settings is fundamentally at odds with the notion of nationhood, which fundamentally seeks to establish a shared history and future. The nation state, in other words, is understood as dependent upon a shared set of relations, or spaces, and the biennial is understood as an event that locates in a particular national space. The new biennial that I propose is no more than an updated form of the old biennial, in that it seeks to assemble from different points of view a single, perhaps entwined set of histories and fictions. It is interested in the relations of art and culture in a globalised society, and its relations to the particularity and fluidity of time. And, within this context, it can be used to explore the relations between art and nature, between art and elements of the social, and between art and elements of the invisible. It can be both the archetype and the limit of the artist’s work. These are, I believe, the kinds of questions that a multi-disciplinary team led by Professors Ambasz and</text>

This notion of multiple settings is fundamentally at odds with the notion of nationhood, which fundamentally concerns itself with the particular forms of cultural organisation that constitute the nation. Modern nation-states, in the view of some contemporary curators, are too easily identifiable, oriented and constituted out of urban centres; and, in recent decades, this tendency has become increasingly apparent in art forms. Contemporary art, on the contrary, should be seen not so much as an aesthetic form for a broad range of readers, but a kind of art for a particular kind of reader: the curatorial is the principal audience for contemporary art. The contemporary art-buying public is made up of several things in mind when it comes to art-world encounters: what kind of reader would be attracted by contemporary art? What kinds of readers would be attracted by the kinds of art that the art market now produced? What kinds of readers would be attracted to the kinds of art that the art market projected? Curators, it seems to me, are placed at the apex of this marketer gaze, and their job is to</text>

This notion of multiple settings is fundamentally at odds with the notion of nationhood, which fundamentally locates the individual in a particular setting. So, again, biennials entered a mythical international framework, and the biennial became an object of aesthetic review, and a part of that aesthetic review. And, well, that's how biennials began to be defined, and continue to be defined, outside of America.For the first twenty-five years of the modern biennial, the Venice Biennale was remarkably apolitical. It staged its first World War, and the Venice International Exhibition was the site of its first major war damage. But as the Cold War heated up, and as biennials everywhere became ever more visible in the mediaeval splendour of the twentieth century, and especially in the twentieth century in the form of art barges docked in Port of London dockside pavilions, and international conferences, and major exhibitions, and major trade fairs, and major museums all over the globe, culminating in the 2008 Beijing Biennale, which was the largest</text>

And, even more fundamentally, the notion of nationhood as an established historical order is fundamentally at odds with the notion of aesthetic sensibility, which fundamentally entails that one construes beauty as intrinsically belonging to a particular nation or ethnic group. Why are these ideas so fundamentally at odds?Because, for the biennial to emerge from its initial purveyors of historical and archival materials, it must first acquire a set of values, and then reconcile these with the judgments of a public that is moving towards a more sensual and material form of cultural organisation. In her research on the exhibition ‘Unfixing the Image: Modern Curating and the Crisis of Imagination’, Laurie Peake points to the fixed images of art that ‘perish in the presence of the changing face of images’, and encourages us to reconsider the role of art in the social circumstances of the contemporary condition.

This notion of multiple settings is fundamentally at odds with the notion of nationhood, which fundamentally relates to a set of characteristics or traits that define the national character. National identity is the organizing principle of a particular setting. And so, when Francis Bacon, in his Essays Concerning Natural Religion, utters the maxim ‘God made all things equal’, he is not elevating the status of man over anything more basic. Rather, Bacon is saying that God made the setting in which the actions of man would be judged, and that these settings would be judged in some way.Apostle John Henry Newman, An Act to Add Cursors to the Copyright of Poems, Poems, and Strips, 1619, in John Henry Newman, An Act to Add Cursors to the Copyright of Poems, Poems, and Strips, 1619, ed.

This notion of multiple settings is fundamentally at odds with the notion of nationhood, which fundamentally identifies the location of one's place of habitual residence. As Christopher Booker, a writer and scholar on the twentieth century and subsequent forms of nationhood, documents constructively: ‘The real animating force of nationhood, then, is precisely the opposite of an aesthetic force: it preaches, not so much about the place as about the distance.’ Nationhood, he writes, ‘requires that we remember that we are not so much at home among those nations that we call home as among those nations that we call strangers’, and that we must strive to establish what the latter mean by ‘homeland’.1 Of course, this is at odds with what we would now call the ‘nation’, which is increasingly constituted by the hybrid of the nonstate and the stateless nomadic social formations that are now called hybrid nomads.2 And yet Booker’s poignancy is seductive, as is his argument that we are</text>

…the idea that Americans are a fixed and unique people with inherent racial identities … came to define the person and place in which one could pursue art and expression.2

While the impulse to establish one’sopic world view is certainly there, the very notion of a singular identity is being challenged by the spread of cultural difference, and by the constant questioning of one’s place in it.And, well, we’ve all become what we see through a telescope: individuals who look out at the world through our defined roles, and who then act on those roles. Of course, roles still have to be defined and defined in order to be applicable to all situations. The role of a biennial is to be a repository of knowledge, and to that end, it’s job is to maintain a public image of what a biennial is capable of becoming. It’s also to foster an understanding of the current state of knowledge in a given area, and to do so in a way that is accessible to as many people as possible.

In the twentieth century, the entwined narratives of art and aesthetics increasingly combined nationalistic and ethnocentric notions of aestheticisation. And, as we know, the biennial has frequently been used as a platform for the very political action that this century sought to counter.10. Biennials as biennials in other respects, and the limits to which they are willing to push the envelope of national identity. –Karl JaspersThis limit is a limit on the extent to which the biennial can inhabit the territory of its sponsors, and on the limit of what it can achieve within the confines of the biennial itself. Biennials are territorially aware entities – conscious or unconscious sponsors – that simultaneously retain their original form of the biennial and actively seek to shape its parameters. As biennials, they simultaneously possess and sublimate these sponsors, and seek to dominate its outcome through its arrangements</text>

So the art department started to collaborate with the PR firm DLA Piper, who organised the artists and organisations involved, and with the PR giant, who arranged the interviews.The project was global in scope and had an impact that was unanticipated. We were on the cusp of having a retrospective in Venice, when Monica Ross, the Director of Public Programs at the CA, arrived to organise the program. She introduced the project to Susanne Posel, who was the Director of Artistic Affairs at the LA County Museum, who agreed to host the project in their galleries. LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was very fruitful and unexpected. The project is still going strong – 500 works in various states of completion.The next step was to start the construction of the Biennale itself. The plan was to open in 70 cities around the world, and the projects were to be located in those cities. The question that came up during our first board of the Biennale was where the art should be located. In a general sense, the challenge was to create a space in which the exhibition of the art could take place, but also in which the exhibition of the art could be produced and distributed. In the United States, this meant finding a place in which the art could be displayed, but also distributed in ways that are ecologically sound and socially useful. In other words, the exhibition of the art should be interactive, interactive and dynamic – engaged with by the public and art professionals alike, but also powerfully integrated into the city.I see this challenge as having two parts: the interactive part comes from the</text>

LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was very fruitful. The programme was developed into a cultural festival called  	Performances / Performances in Venice, which was also organised by the CA. Performances/Performances in Venice was a cultural experience, in that it was very much about the past in relation to the present. In the vein of Wanderlust, it was a time when the past was transported to the present, and the future was imagined in relation to the present.  	In these performances, the audience was represented through performances in the gallery that occurred independently of one another, and were informed by means of interactive media such as magazines, newspapers and radio. The performances were text and video, and used various artefacts from the gallery as props. The primary aim of the project was to explore the relationships between art and history, while at the same time questioning the relationship between contemporary art and the past. In the case of video, it was a question of making works that recall the</text>

LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was very fruitful. The performance of the project in the arts venues around the country was extraordinary; the significance of this cannot be understated. The performance of the project in the mainstream media was un-scripted and uncritical. The narrative of the project was often accompanied by a provocatively styled image that challenged prevailing ideas and discourses. For example, the viral video of the project ‘Beach Party’ was accompanied by a headline that read ‘This is the Beach’; ‘Playground’ followed by a succession of images of children enjoying the natural beauty of the area. The use of photography and the social media platforms that emerged in the 1990s, such as Facebook and Twitter, provided the political, legal and economic framework that allowed for the institutionalisation of the project and the perpetuation of its narratives.After almost twenty years, we are still grappling with the mechanisms that enabled the Beach Party to happen, and to this day the ongoing debate about the place of</text>

LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was very promising. In fact, the Partnership Agreements between the Art Department and the LA County Museum allowed us to explore the idea of the Cultural Landscape Architecture project, which would have involved a cultural centre developing infrastructure around the development of the land, and the creation of a Cultural Landscape Architecture. This was a big opportunity for the Arts Department, whose work often addresses the need for infrastructure around a cultural context. The project was developed into a masterplan that would have seen part of the building converted to apartments for the city, and a community of artists, community organisers and young people developing a new version of the building around their work. At the time, this was also seen by some residents as a way of stimulating the private and the organic space developments that were taking place on the site. The new plan called for the demolition of much of the community land and buildings, and the creation of new local sustainable development initiatives. The proposed actions included the establishment of a Community Land Trust, which would have given</text>

LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was very fruitful. The opportunity to produce a curatorial micro-site was also welcomed, and the opportunity to develop a cultural strategy around the project was explored. There was a sense that the project was international in scope and in many ways this was a strength: there were artists from all over the world who came to work with the artists on the project, and this relationship would continue into the future. But the most interesting and progressive thing for me was the opportunity to come into the studio and work with the younger generation of artists who were involved in the project at an early age, such as the young artists who were involved in the canvas project or the young artists who worked in the public realm. These artists had a lot of experience and were able to pick up things from the older generation, and this made the experience more authentic – the older they got, the more they had to absorb into the project. The most dynamic and dynamic they had to be was when they were involved in the project as artists themselves</text>

LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was very evident. Although the project had started in Venice, the notion of the performance went global, and not just for the gallery experience: the relationship between the art department and the gallery was very different from what we had imagined. A space like the AVMA gallery would host a regular programme of performances, and the cultural programme would offer art from different contexts. For the project, the LA Centre for the Performing Arts also invited us to develop a cultural strategy around the gallery experience, and the involvement of the artists, in the same sense that we had developed an engagement strategy. Here, the gallery is seen as a site of exchange between audiences from different places, and the biennale is seen as an event where the exchange is facilitated between the different audiences. The gallery experiences the exchange as a place of exchange, and this exchange is seen not only as an exchange between art and critics, but also as an exchange between audiences from different places. This exchange is why the AVMA gallery and the CA</text>

She introduced the project to Susanne Posel, who was the Director of Artistic Affairs at the LA County Museum, who agreed to host the project in their galleries. LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was extremely fruitful. The programme, which was developed in parallel, expanded the political and the social dimensions of the project, and the artists found a new home at the CA. With the help of Susanne, the artists formed a cooperative, which later became the Museum of Playmaking in Venice. The Cooperative was a success, and the Museum of Playmaking grew, and now it is a museum of contemporary art. The Museum of Playmaking was also instrumental in getting the Community Arts movement started in the city, and the cooperative movement has continued to be an important organising principle for the movement. The Museum of Playmaking has its own arts education programme, which is offered in all the galleries, and which is very much about engagement and participation. The cooperative has developed a long-term relationship with the gallery that ensures that the piece is chosen at random in the programme, and in the future they organise an annual street fair, which is popular with tourists.

LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was very exciting. The development of the project was also very interesting in the context of the exhibition business, where an artist’s curatorial style and the way he worked with the artist and his/her team was seen as a strength. The artist was able to articulate the enormity of the challenge and the power of his/her project, despite the fact that he/she was often confronted with the daunting task of organising an entire art exhibition on the same day in the same location. The challenge was to create a cultural programme that would be accessible, but also trustworthy, and pose a threat to the status quo, as we discovered in the exhibition catalogue – not to mention the fact that the artist was often the only person able to carry it out. Although the artist and his team undoubtedly strived to deliver a culturally responsive project, there was a sense that their real strength lay in their toolkit: the tools themselves provided the platform and the will to take risks, whereas the people delivering the art</text>

LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was immediate. The relationship between the art department and the gallery sector has evolved, and the contribution of the latter has much to contribute to the development of the former. The importance of the art department has also increased, since the development of criticality through the production of high-quality content is now the norm. The importance of the art department in the contemporary practice of contemporary art has also increased, since the mainstreaming of criticality through media is now the norm. Art has become a necessary artifice, but now it is also a propitious combination of other media elements. The key is the production of high-quality art and images that are accessible to a broad range of people. In the past, the art department or the museum was the place where ideas and proposals were received and acted upon, but the key now is the sharing of ideas and the production of shared images. What is required is an increase in the quantity and quality of cultural exchange, because the only way to expand cultural-processing capacity</text>

LA Centre for the Performing Arts was invited to develop a cultural programme around the project, and the collaboration between the two organisations was very fruitful. The performance project was developed into a 'playground' for the dialogue, and the two galleries were used as a forum to explore the project through the media landscape. The project was a success, and now we need to find art resources and collaborations for the project. The media landscape has changed, and it is now possible to develop a project globally through social media, but the challenge is to keep the project relevant and the narrative relevant. The media landscape is constantly shifting, which makes it more difficult to define the exact essence of what is imagined to be possible through a particular media, and more difficult to engage the public through a media. The challenge for the future is to remain true to the essence of what is being proposed, while meeting the demands of the communities most likely to engage with such projects. The media landscape produces new media uses, and as a consequence, it is always evolving. We need to create new media utilising our artistic talents and repurposing existing media to create</text>

The emergence of disruptive technologies is a constant source of contention in the UK and beyond. Whether the aim is to enable a privileged elite to intervene more extensively in society or create an independent counterattack, the response has to come from somewhere.

In this light, the museum that opened in Liverpool today is not doing much more than bringing together the types of organisation that the community has evolved to become engaged with. It is an institution that facilitates that engagement through the mechanisms that it finds most convenient: the museum, its collections, its programming, etc. 	The museum that opened in Liverpool today is an interpretation of the historical practices of Community Arts practice in that city. It is a place where people come to understand and appreciate the way in which a community might produce and organise itself creatively through arts and culture, and it is a place where people can find tools to get involved, participate, and contribute in ways that are authentic to the city. 	In a nutshell, the museum works in three main ways: it educates, records, and documents. 	The museum seeks to capture the historical practices of a particular form of community engagement, or perhaps it is</text>

Nevertheless, all of these organisations, whether CLTs, RCTs, or museums, become engaged with the local community through activities such as hosting community fairs, giving talks by the local representatives of the organisations, organising community events, etc. In doing so, they become involved in the formation of a shared understanding between the local people and the non-locals, which in turn, shapes the organisation and its activities.  	A second key element in the commissioning agenda that has often been overlooked is that of access. In the context of planning for the Biennial, it is often forgotten that Manchester has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the UK, and that this has been attributed to the over-doubling of HIV diagnoses during the HIV epidemic. Indeed, HIV diagnoses in the city have almost quadrupled in the last twenty years, and up to 90% of those infected never return to health.[6] 	The Biennale has often been cited as an example of a project that fails in its ambition to mobilize resources in a way that is equitable to the local population, but which nevertheless achieves a significant amount of research-based work in the city. 	However, this is only part of the equation. The</text>

Some of this engagement occurs at a grassroots level; others are more institutionalised. Still others are political in the usual sense, applying not only to the local but also to the national contexts in which this is happening. But in engaging with the local, these organisations are engaging with the larger social context of the community, its language and beliefs, and in so doing, are becoming citizens of the community. 	These citizens are engaged with not only the larger community, but also with the wider society, which has a direct and often significant influence over their actions. Through their activities, which often centre on the local, and which are often also exploratory, these organisations can create a sense of place and identity in and among their communities. 	In the larger scheme of things, these citizens have a significant amount of power, and they wield it in powerful ways. But in the realm of art, this kind of institutional</text>

The Centre’s Project was a collaborative, inclusive and diverse group of artists, curators, artists, writers and community organisers, whose activities included commissioning, producing and managing artwork and creating a public domain programme for the city. It was at the Centre that I first met Samantha Jones, David Hockney, Wendy Harpe, Peter McCaughey and others. It was at the Centre that I met Walter Hulse, David Guttenbach, Mark Loudon and others.

The Boris Hill Design Centre was the first such design academy established in Derbyshire and has been a clearinghouse for the arts and arts-education sector in the county, disseminating information about art and culture from the academy to the local schools, community centres, and then to the wider community.

When considering any new technology, it is important to know what to expect, and how to prepare ourselves, our communities, and ourselves in general. This is particularly true when considering technologies that are new and disruptive, as is the case with social media and the web. It is important to understand how to prepare for such change, because it is possible that the new technology will lead to the erasure of our practices and identities and we will become something else entirely. 	The new technologies that we encounter and produce often have names that begin with  	T. They may be given names that begin with ‘Tada’ or ‘Kara’ or ‘Katie’ or ‘Chloe�</text>

In doing so, they open up new ways of engaging with the places that they occupy and that are still relevant in the world. 	When considering the relationship between art and the urban environment, it is important to note that the former is an urban domain, while the latter is a rural one. In both the urban and the rural realms, the priorities of the art collector are fundamentally set in opposition to those of the community. 	Thus, the collection that the artist transmits is a valuable asset in the hands of a local community, but it is also a potentially destructive asset in the hands of a global art collector. The collection that the artist creates is a valuable asset in the hands of a local community, but it is also a potentially destructive asset in the hands of a museum that is itself increasingly active in opposition to the interests</text>

In all of these activities, the collections become entangled in the development of the area, and are often used as evidence of the community’s collective responsibility. The collections become symbols, act as a discourse, and create a context of negotiation and conflict resolution. But this process of negotiation and resolution is often violent and oppressive, and the communities that comprise the site of conflict often end up worse off than when the conflicts started. 	Therefore, it is critical for the site of such conflict to be accessible and maintained in a participatory way, so as to foster negotiation and dialogue; otherwise conflictual actors will always seek to undermine the very foundations of the site and undermine the very relationship between the community and the local authority.  	Therefore, although it is often claimed that a ‘big data revolution’ is happening</text>

In sum, the collection is a complex artifact that has, through the long course of its development, managed to embed itself, sometimes quite forcefully, in the social fabric of the city. Its collection, as a collection, is a landscape that is structurally dependent on the city, and its collection, as a collection, is a heritage that is structurally dependent on the city. In this sense, its continuous variation and ongoing creation is both a collective act, and a site of continual change. As such, its collection, its heritage, and its present form are all products of the city’s ongoing accumulation of layers and forms of habitation, gathering and regathering. 	In this sense, the collection comes to define and represent, or perhaps more accurately, the form of habitation</text>

The name reflects the colonial heritage of the region, and the colonial heritage of the empire. 	The Park Palace project was a response to the legacy of colonialism, and as such, it needed to be managed with extreme caution. The development faced many challenges, but the most challenging was undoubtedly the one facing the indigenous peoples and other vulnerable sectors of the population, as the country spiraled into economic ruin and political instability. The Park Palace project was put on hold due to economic mismanagement, but the challenges faced by the Park Palace project have continued to this day.

In 2005, the National Anthropological Park was established in Panama City, and included lands in both ‘Mexico�s National Park’ and ‘United States’1 National Parks –2 areas collectively known as the ‘Buffalo Wilderness’ area, named for the location of the largest population of landless Native Americans. The national park encompasses 1.8 million hectares (4.3 million acres).1 	The land-use plan for the area immediately adjacent to the National Park calls for the establishment of cooperative agreements with local Indigenous and local communities, as well as with businesses, non-profit land trusts, and tribal organizations to jointly provide management and ownership of buildings, assets, accommodation, and natural resources.2 	The park’s eventual objective is to enhance the long-term ecological and aesthetical values of the area by encouraging the establishment of ‘planting communities’ within the park itself, while also supporting the ‘occurrence and maintenance of wild and scenic species’ and ‘the establishment of ‘heritage ecosystems’ within the park,</text>

In 2005, the National Anthropological Park was established in Panama City, and included lands in both ‘Mexico� and ‘Panama’ with a combined area of over 6,000,000 m2 . In 2008 the National Park Service established the Panamanian National Park Service, which includes parts of the Andes Mountains and parts of Panama City in South America’s highest park. Panamax is the largest national park and preserves, preserves and registers over 6,000,000 m2 of land, making it the third largest national park after Zion and Yellowstone. It is the only national park managed by the National Park Service in North America. Panamax is the site of two American presidents — George Washington and Thomas Jefferson — as well as the site of the last inter-tribal meeting between white and Native American tribes. Panamax is also the site of the 2012 London’s Pride Parade, when a white nationalist group sought to normalise the idea of white male superiority and reclaim white male dominance.

In 2005, the National Anthropological Park was established in Panama City, and included lands in both ‘Mexico� and ‘Panama’ that were part of the British Empire. The park’s website claims that it is a place where ‘monuments from the past can be found, objects representing traces of a past that are embedded in the earth’.1 	It is important to note that these claims – which are frequently traced back to early nineteenth-century European notions of progress – are often traced to the ‘enduring influence of abstract idealists and naturalists’ who ‘saw in nature’ and thus saw in the natural world a progression towards a just society. Aspects of these naturalists’ conceptions of nature that are repeated in the work of art are often interpreted in ways that are antagonistic or even helpful to the interests of powerful human cultures. For example, the influence of Kant’s philosophy of the Enlightenment is often cited as a reason why the colonial powers wished to expand and modernise their societies.

In 2005, the National Anthropological Park was established in Panama City, and included lands in both ‘Mexico�s&quot; and ‘U.S’1’ zones. Its mission was to house, preserve and promote indigenous knowledge, culture and heritage through research, documentation and exhibition. Its collection included over 1,000 objects from over 100 indigenous communities in Mexico and Venezuela. In 2007, the National Anthropological Park was expanded to include Guayaquil, an area adjacent to Panama City. Today, the park is home to over 1,000 objects from over 100 indigenous communities in Venezuela.  The Guayaquilites were the first to leave Panama and set up permanent settlements in the Andes, and today they form the largest indigenous population in Panama.2   The origins of the colonial complex are a matter of debate among scholars and historians. Historian Willene Clark maintains that the rise of modern-day Panama City was largely due to the trading of sugarcane, mainly to the Andes region of Venezuela, across the Caribbean, Central America and South America.3 In the nineteenth</text>

This would give the local authorities a voice in the development of the area, and would allow the establishment of a 'public realm’ in the truest sense of the word. The city would assume responsibility for the development of the zone, while the district would relinquish any claim on the public domain. This scenario is not without risk, as a strong community of residents would inevitably seek to secede from the district and seek to establish their own authority, but it is a unique position to be taken by the city and the district in the development of an area. It is an area with a rich history and a rich future, but at the same time it is an area with a claim on becoming something else – something they do not want or need to be in charge of. In an ideal scenario, the claim on the public realm would be absolute, but in practice this is often not the case. Often times, the claim on the public realm is disputed amongst competing claims, and it is this</text>

This is the context in which co-construction is made and co-production takes place.  The creation of a local sustainable-housing programme has recently become a priority for the administration of Sunderland’s Outer Heidelberg district. This is due to the recruitment of 1,500 new housing associates from nearby buildings. These residents will provide affordable housing alongside local business and community members, and will also assist in setting up and running the nearby bakery and cafe.  The theory underlying the project is that it will be possible to create a ‘culture of collaboration’ by encouraging collaborative thinking between the different stakeholders in the district, and thus enabling the ongoing evolution of the area through dialogue rather than confrontation. This can be seen as a ‘smart growth’ strategy, which seeks to combine the strengths of different levels of government, grassroots groups and academia in order to address a specific problem space.

This is where the similarities between the projects presented in the exhibition and those that have been implemented in the neighbourhoods surround the school are most visible. In both the projects and in the actual neighbourhood development, the role of residents is actively encouraged and their input is fundamental to the success of the projects.  In both the case studies, participation is an essential element in the success of the projects, and this is especially true in the case of ‘deep democracy’ where people actively participate in decision-making through their direct action, which is facilitated through narrative design.  The key to the success of both the art projects and in situ installations is in their ability to engage the community through narrative design, which is facilitated through narrative architecture.  One might ask: how do artists create situations in which the needs of the community can converge?  The answer is that the needs of the community must be conscious and achievable in order for the artists to achieve their goals. In order to achieve their goals, the artists will</text>

This scenario is also frequently referred to as a ‘transcendental democratic scenario’.  In this scenario, the local people take ownership of the development of their area and the provision of services and cultural facilities, and thus create a ‘new equilibrium’ between local people and the urban environment.  In this model, the urban space is seen as a collective resource, and the collective use of the urban space is acknowledged as a collective responsibility.  The idea of the ‘utopia’ is frequently cited as an alternative to the utopia of the community’s control, and utopias are seen as possibilities through which social change may be effected.  One could argue that the utopia of the community – or at least, the utopia envisioned for a community of like-minded people – would entail increased freedom and greater autonomy for people to pursue their interests, and this is not always possible in a given area due to the multiplicity of interests competing for access to</text>

This scenario imagines a co-productive partnership between the school and the local authority, where the latter partner contributes to the enhancement of the quality of life in the area through the provision of services, such as free schools, community facilities and sports grounds.  One might also consider the role played by the local community in such a scenario, where stakeholders might include stakeholders from the school, the local authority and other interested parties.  An arena for debate and interaction, yet also for resolution of disputes, is an essential ingredient of sustainable community development. It is this forum that biennials hope to foster between local authorities, stakeholders, artists and artists, and artisans, as well as between artisans and artists.  Such a forum would exist not only in the venue of the biennial, but also in the local market and other venues where artisans and artists can come to find solutions to difficult dilemmas. It would foster an understanding between the two groups, drawing stakeholders away from the resolution of disputes</text>

It is this last level where the school might become a stakeholder in the development of the area, or a co-producer with the local authorities in the development of the area. This would allow the local authorities to allocate resources and to jointly develop the area with the school; this can be done through a joint-use agreement.  An example of this kind of partnership is found in the joint-use agreement between Liverpool Biennial and Simon Property Group, whose projects are found in the school’s books. In this case, the resources of the school are shared between the organisations, with the school providing expertise in planning and development as well as hosting various educational activities around the projects. Liverpool Biennial and its partners do not envision themselves as a community-led organisation, and thus engage in activities at an informal level in order to foster a sense of co-responsibility between the public and the arts institutions.  Another example of a ‘community-based artist’ institution-funded institution-based programme is found at the Biennial organisation funded by the Arts Council England and Co-operative Learning Partnership.

It is this last level where the school might become a stakeholder in the development of the area, or a co-producer with the local authorities in the development of the area. This is where the similarities end, and where the influence of the government begins to wear thin. In these cases, the local government takes the lead in the provision of services and facilities, and in the development of the area, while the school takes an increasingly marginalised role in the area.  A growing number of studies have suggested that students who attend school in the urban setting are more exposed to the elements that cause urban decline, and that is where the similarities end and the power plays begin.  A growing body of research supports this contention. A systematic review of studies on exposure to art and culture in early childhood and adolescence, and later in adulthood, concluded that art and culture are intrinsically linked with increased self-reported emotional well-being and self-efficacy.[4]  Art and culture are not abstractions and can therefore be contextualised. Social science research has shown that the experiences of migrant workers in the wake of the financial crisis, and the subsequent austerity measures, are a consistent displacement</text>

This would open up new perspectives and new ways of working, based on the shared values and interests of the community.  In my opinion, the future needs to address a deep and long-term ecological crisis. The answer to this challenge is not found in an urban development project, but in a holistic and long-term ecological analysis and management of the city. This is due to the fact that cities are made up of a large number of distinct parts, and as a consequence, different levels of urbanisation can have very different impacts on the biosphere. For example, a high-end development project in the financial district might lead to a ‘soft landing’ on the high-end property market, which might in turn lead to a reduction in high-end property prices. Similarly, a low-density development project in the dense outer districts might lead to a surge in housing prices in the core areas, which in turn can have a negative impact on the affordability of housing for lower income households.</text>

It is this last level where the school might become a stakeholder in the development of the area, or a co-producer with the local authorities in the development of the area. This is the context for a deeper democracy – a neighbourhood council – to take root and become institutionalised.  As an example of how to achieve this, in the block around the bakery, the neighbourhood youth soccer team is organising events with the school to celebrate the new year, such as New Years Eve playing football with colleagues or New Years Eve baking a cake, while the school is also organising a New Years Eve picnic for students and staff. The neighbourhood youth team is made up of artists, writers and community organisers, while the school is made up of architects and designers. The artists, writers and community organisers all come from different walks of life, have very different skills and backgrounds, but when it comes to building long-term relationships with the school, they all have one thing in common: they all have the same set of priorities and come to the same place, often times reaching across the same barriers.  One might ask: in what way is the bakery a community enterprise? The short answer is that</text>

It is this last level where the school might become a stakeholder in the development of the area, or a co-producer with the local authorities in the development of the area. This scenario calls for enhanced interaction between the two levels, because in the current situation, the only way to influence the development of an area is through participation. The level of the school should be elevated in the development of the social, cultural, and economic context of the area in order to create a ‘feed back’ cycle, whereby the actions of the school influence the actions of the community.  In the present situation, the level of the school is directly related to the amount of integration achieved, and there is a clear disconnect between the educational level of the students and the level of the teachers’ level. The students see their education as additional in their social responsibility to enhance their capacity to participate in the community, while the teachers are primarily there to deliver instruction in the traditional ‘white collar’ sphere.  A deeper level of linguistic and cultural refinement is therefore required, and this can only happen with the involvement of experts in the area, and this can only happen with the involvement of</text>

The final proposal had the exact same concept as the previous two, but the geographical region and the museum were relocated to a new exhibition format. I was invited to propose an entirely new format for the biennale, one that would allow visitors to switch from one section of the museum to another. I proposed a branch that offered different perspectives on the same theme, with local, regional and international artists interspersed throughout the branch, all arranged in chronological order from earliest painted wall works to the present. I was given the task of organizing the artists into groups and sub-groups, with brief narratives of their activities in the city. The branch also offered a place for them to meet, converse, exchange work and present their ideas. An introduction to the subject was given in each group’s meeting, followed by a closing statement about the group’s activities. The branch was a great way to begin my research, since it allowed me to get a feel for what the museum might be like, what its limits might be, and what it might be like to be inside the museum.

It was not an exhibition of architecture, but a commission into the social life of cities. It was a commission into the culture of cities. Using very interesting new multimedia technologies, the original proposal and the revised one were combined into one multimedia presentation. This new format was particularly interesting, since the original proposal and its fragmented narrative were combined with a new form that demanded precise coordinates and precise paths. The result was that the original proposal became accessible through a new medium that demanded exactitude from visitors, while the form that I proposed was completely invisible. It was a kind of ‘white noise machine’. It was the breakthrough that changed everything.

I was invited to propose the next step in the museum’s evolution, and as an artist, I wondered where the museum would end and the city begin. My proposal that each pavilion within the new format of the museum should contain a unique narrative and a self-contained architectural work would address a gap of considerable size between the museum and the city. It would begin to conceptualise the new role of the museum as a hub for research and discovery, and perhaps as an alternative form of urban form for its future growth. During the development of the museum, the gaps between the museum and the city would be filled with cultural institutions offering learning opportunities and resources for research and discovery, while the museum itself would continue to exist in a highly bureaucratic form, constantly monitoring and controlling the city’s development. During the development of the city, the gaps between the museum and the city would be filled with development agencies and its residents, who would use the museum as a data point and a tool for economic development.

My proposal was not a new one, as previous biennials had incorporated art and social purpose as a way to tell the city’s story. In fact, the first edition of the Biennale in 1897 had already begun to do this, as we learned from Jean Guy Lecat, a curator at the British Museum and a specialist in 19th-century art. He had come up with the idea of the biennale as an institution of exchange after years of research on the art market. The entire curatorial package – curator, art collector, art distributor, art-maker – was catalogued as part of the British Museum’s Early Modern Exhibition. The Biennale as an Exchange The Biennale in 1897 contracted with the British Museum, and with it, of course, the Museum of Modern Art, so the Museum of Modern Art had to withdraw its exhibition from 1897</text>

I proposed that each pavilion be a mini-essay in itself, with brief archival narratives, illustrative works and textual records of the history of the city. The idea was to position each pavilion as a distinct point of entry into the museum, and the museum as a distinct region within the city. The final proposal had the exact same concept as the previous two, but the geographical region and the museum were relocated to a new exhibition format. I was invited to propose a third proposal, which addressed the future of the art museum and the development of public galleries in the old style of the pavilion. This was due to the fact that the main two proposals placed great emphasis on the development of a public identity for the pavilion, while Myatt attempted to incorporate an entirely new architectural style into the structure. The fact that both his older and new proposals were submitted in the same day created an opening for my proposal that was not immediately taken up by anyone else. It took almost a year before anyone from the museum or the city government would consider either Myatt’s or Myatt’s proposal, although they would eventually eventually eventually come to the conclusion that they did not want to host a museum-type art exhibition in their city again. While this may happen in a future biennial, in the current format it created an opening for another artist to come in and change the dynamics of the art museum and the city.

The final proposal had the exact same concept as the previous two, but the geographical region and the museum were relocated to a new exhibition format. I was invited to propose an entirely new exhibition format, specifically designed to be presented in conjunction with the centennial of the city in 2019, but also to explore the idea of ‘episodic presentation’ in the museum. This would mean presenting the same works twice in different contexts, in different venues, in an episodic format, in and around the original works. It would also mean presenting the same works in different settings and in different museum collections, in such a way that they could find common ground on a conceptual level through their similarities and divergences. Finally, it would mean presenting the same works in a multi-contextual, multi-use exhibition format, with works selected from different contexts and museums, in such a way that they could engage with and make connections with different audiences in different ways. This last idea, ‘multitasking’, is an important one, and a fundamental premise of the exhibitionary impulse. It is the driving force behind the exhibitionary impulse, and holds</text>

The final proposal had the exact same concept as the previous two, but the geographical region and the museum were relocated to a new exhibition format. I was invited to propose a curatorial approach that would bring the two disparate parts of the city together in a way that would be authentic to the distance that the two new exhibition formats would create. In other words, I thought, this exhibition should be a ‘cumulative narrative’ that would grow from the two new formats into a more global, ‘multidisciplinary’ synthesis. The key to this new curatorial approach was a clear understanding of the local and global contexts in which the projects were operating. If I could categorise it neatly, the categories I listed on a formative experience in my youth would be the first steps towards the hierarchies and systems of globalisation that we live by. I would say that the first step was a step towards a localised and regionalised, interconnected and interdependent world that is no longer quite so innocent. I would add that the second step was a step towards a more globalised and integrated world, but I think that’s still subject to change</text>

The final proposal had the exact same concept as the previous two, but the geographical region and the museum were relocated to a new exhibition format. I was invited to propose a hybrid of the two, but with active learning elements as well as a more conceptual orientation. This was my proposal, and I believe that it was a good proposal that was well received and considered. It is true that the idea of ‘the museum as a continuous, multidisciplinary research facility’ came up during the conference, but as the saying goes, no museum can be a country without an embassy. The fact that this was seen as a problem by some participants in the conference, and by the way it was presented by the curators, led to an impression that the project was complex and time-consuming, but this was seen as a problem by others as well. For example, the idea that the museum is an institution that must be continually replenished, and thus its unique international character is threatened by the museum being extended, and thus its internal logic must be adjusted in order to deal with the changes. The idea that the museum is an episodic type of space that can</text>

The final proposal had the exact same concept as the previous two, but the geographical region and the museum were relocated to a new exhibition format. I was invited to propose an alternative format, and the two exhibition proposals were merged into one. The merged exhibitions became part of the International Contemporary Art Exhibition (ICA) system, and my proposal to combine two curatorial approaches was accepted. The result was an exhibition system that provided numerous local and regional experiences, varied in its content and orientation, and fostered an environment in which artists could experiment, present their work and network with each other.The integrated multi-modal museum-like format that I proposed was realized in the early twentieth century, but this wasn’t the last time we’d done it. In fact, museums played a critical role in the social life of the city, as collections, displays and repositories, in shaping the concept of place and history, and in providing a public space where communities could gather, exchange and exchange. During the twentieth century, the ‘museum binder’ – who is in charge of the museum, exhibits, exhibits, etc – developed a super</text>

The final proposal had the exact same concept as the previous two, but the geographical region and the museum were relocated to a new exhibition format. I was invited to propose a deluxe format that would have been displayed in international pavilions, but with works selected specifically for the exhibition. These were works selected from the permanent collection, the permanent collection of the Kunsthal Aarhus, and the museum itself. For this reason, the works selected were works with a national or global context, and rarely works from the city in which the pavilion was located. The selection of works was extremely selective, and while there were many excellent works included, there was also a dearth of locally relevant and innovative work. The exclusion of certain artists and their collections from the exhibition was also very problematic. A number of the pavilion’s selected works clearly display a strong preference for an artistic style or an expressive idea over other types of cultural resources, and this can be seen in the abstract style guidelines, which prescribe that the art displayed must be &quot;inspired by&quot; a particular collection or collection of art objects. In the three pavilions that I curated, the</text>
