It was a collection of many different things in a common action. In this mix, the festival offered many things in a pre-9/11 mix, but at the same time it simultaneously circumscribed many aspects of many different people’s experiences. It was a project that emerged organically from the city’s rubble, yet also from the anti-establishment rhetoric of the new economy, and the cultural logic of the post-WWII urban renewal programme. It was a bizarre but effective way to</text>

And as the mayor declared at the time: ‘This is not a city in which religion or national identity or racial or ethnic purity is a priority.’ It was seen by many as a sign that the city was waking up to the fact that it was no longer a laboratory for capitalistic rationality. Why then, almost a decade later, is the festival still struggling to recover its pre-9/11 sense of place? The festival’s current incarnation, Design &amp; Empire, is being staged as a present in the arts venue, not far removed from the site of the hijacked airplanes. The festival’s original name, Jazz Fest, was a reference to the first Jazz concert, which occurred in Greenwich Village in October 1965. I turn to see if the name is still appropriate.Does anyone still remember when the name Jazz Fest first started? Or why?DDownload this article as PDF27 March 2014To Maria Hlavajova12 July 2014Bologna ArcadesImage courtesy Christos TheodorouPreviousNextBologna ArcadesImage courtesy Christos TheodorouMaria HlavajovaUtrecht, NetherlandsBer</text>

It would host the New York Philharmonic, the New York Zoological Society, the New York State Museum, and many other important cultural institutions. It would also host, in the years that followed, the annual Gay Pride march, as well as the historically significant black-tie gala dinner, the annual Asian fifties rock and roll festival, and the film festival The Phantom Thread.In the coming years, the festival would host the Venice Biennale and the premiere of the documentary on the city, In Real Life, about the lives and works of the Biennials, as well as the New York Times best-selling books on architectural aesthetics and minimalism, among many others.

Financial capitalism ushered into being a series of diverse economic models that sought to accommodate financial flows by blending commercial and financial power, based on the logic of infinite demand with the logic of infinite supply.[2] These various economic forms then spawned what Adam Smith, an early adopter of the concept, would later call the ‘metainterface’: the commercial metropolis, where multiple modes of consumption could be accommodated simultaneously.[3] The commercial metropolis operates through a network of distribution networks that converge on a single point of sale – a point in time – where a product is sold. In this model, demand is simultaneously fulfilled by the supply</text>

And this is the festival’s power today. It is a powerful symbol of global migration.The festival came to embody something else, too: the end of IT and the beginning of the new era of connectedness. The festival’s real essence is that it is an event that is continuous with time. And this seems to be at the core of what the festival was trying to do with its name – try to capture the temporal essence of the event through a series of images. But the festival also had an end in its own. It ceased to be, and to some extent still is not, and this is what the festival is again now: it is being forced to confront this end. It is forced to change its name to something more contemporary and more relatable to the times. But this is also what contemporary art is: it has an end, too.And so the</text>

And as the mayor declared at the time: ‘This is not a city in which religion or national identity or racial or ethnic purity is a priority.’ So much of what was planned for the city was premised on the idea that the festival was a ‘place of encounter’ and that it was this encounter that would make the city a desirable place to live, work, play, raise families and, ultimately, provide opportunities for the next wave of refugees to re-entrance into the city.Actual encounters with refugees did, of course, happen. In the years that followed, the number of refugees who came to Germany grew exponentially. But the real encounter – the real, visceral encounter – was with those people fleeing the violence and persecution of the region in which they were trying to reach. These people were part of the larger global economy that was trying to kill off the last remnants of the old order. The choices that the city and the festival made in response to this global economy were as vast as the scenes in the final sequence of Twin Peaks.

And they will be able to tell us what to do with our city. This is the kind of thinking that happens during critical and transformational moments.During these years, the festival would host countless performances, many of them being performed in English and many of them being performed in Urdu. And these people would tell the stories, many in their own first language. And they would add their own cultural touch to the mix. For me, this was the transformative moment: as the film Groundhog Day would have it, when the day would finally come and the actors would perform their parts. But this wasn’t just an act of will.This was a cultural moment in that it was led by artists, intellectuals, musicians, writers and others with a range of expertise and sets of skills. There was also a political moment embedded in the festival itself. That</text>

And these migrants and refugees, whether fleeing the conflicts in their home countries, or seeking other sanctuary in the global south, would build up a city-wide festival with their own set of distinctive customs, traditions, languages, and cultures.These are the kinds of questions that contemporary biennials – today, especially those in the US – would do well to interrogate. They would offer us new ways of looking at old conflicts, challenging old binaries and hierarchies, and forging new identities. And they would do this in the name of art, in the name of architecture, in the name of history, and in the name of global capitalism. Why then, when the festival was initially conceived as a way to bring together people from all over Germany, have it come to be anything but?

And as the mayor declared at the time: ‘This is not a city in which religion or national identity or racial or ethnic purity is a priority.’ This proclamation, and the way in which it was executed, was anti-Muslim. It was also anti-immigrant. The festival had been planning to launch a year-long ‘White Education Week’ – an initiative to teach children about the importance of civics and the power of being citizens – by that name. But the administration of the festival was equally uninterested in learning about how to build or employ ways to enrich the city, or how to make life in and on the city better. The festival was a failure, in large part because of the way in which it was run. Who would have thought that a biennale dedicated to the memory of a city's past, with its streets and squares and abandoned buildings, would one day one day seek to profit from the city? The festival was a rare event in the city, and though it might have some kind of impact on the way in which artists are run, it will not make the city better. The bi</text>

The festival would be a place to find and foster these new ways of looking at the world.This is the festival that emerged. It is the festival of negation. It is the festival of the invisible. It is the ‘day of silence’. It is a festival of the not-yet, the not-present, the not-yet-now. It is an ‘opportunity for reflection and assembly’. It is a ‘place of encounter and exchange’. It is a ‘time to take stock of the present and ask, what is it like to inhabit this present?’ It is a ‘place to work, to play, to be present, to partake in the present, but above all to exist and witness, to inhabit the present and be present</text>

While Harvey is clearly describing the institutional changes that have taken place since his journal article, it is worth noting that biennials have also played a part in creating the conditions that enable the institutionalisation of the crisis. Harvey is a pioneer in the journal article, and his account is a valuable place in the canonisation of the crisis. 	[7]  A key turning point in the journal article was published on page 8, where Harvey refers to ‘a general public that has grown weary of the slow pace of change and […] cultural iniquities’.[8] Art and the Social Readings of Harvey and the journal article, along with the growing body of research on art and social practices that followed, such as those produced by the Arts Council, suggest that the biennial may have been part of a larger, more systemic trend in the socialisation of cultural resources.

Histories of the Crisis are published by Verso in London and New York; the New Criterion in New York and the New Criterion in Paris. New Criterion president Jeanne Heeswijk stated:We have to recognize that, in the last crisis, the biennial was a temporary appearance, a posturing, a diversionary tactic. It is no longer a museum, but a collection centre, where art is organised and presented. So the biennial is no longer viewed as an exhibitionary venue. It is rather the site of a social life, where people gather to exchange, to exchange skills, to exchange bodies, to exchange gifts and, of course, to live together in harmoniousness.’[7] The significance of this shift in perspective cannot be overstated. As biennials, we are now more like most biennials, that site of exchange and community. We also live and work in and make other biennials – exhibitionsary venues – and are visited by other biennials. What has become increasingly evident is that, in the last twenty years, the biennial</text>

Harvey makes a similar point in his essay ‘Crisis of the Intimate: Imelda Staunton, the Biennial, and Critical Art’.[8] Staunton’s essay is part of a larger project that begins with her paper published in the journal Socially Engaged Criticism, No. 1 published in Harper &amp; Row, London, 1986, and part of a series of essays in a series of publications published between 1986 and 1990, including part of the essay in the anthology Socially Engaged Criticism No. 2 published in Harper &amp; Row, London, 1988.

Histories of the Crisis are published by Verso in London and New York; the New Criterion in New York and the New Criterion in Paris. In an introduction to the journal, Harvey narrates the journal’s genesis:  The Crisis placed a great emphasis on the consumption of resources (production, storage, transportation), with cuts to social services (health, education, law enforcement) that were felt to be disproportionately affecting certain groups of people. It was seen by many social theorists and artists as being at odds with what constituted a socially necessary crisis. ‘The Culture Industry’, Harvey narrates in passing, the industry’s tendency to produce works that speak to immediate needs – needs that are not negotiated through analysis or discourse – is shown to be a prescient reflection of the world economy.

Histories of the Crisis are published by Verso in London and New York; the New Criterion in New York and the New Criterion in Paris. In the journal article, Harvey identifies a number of factors in the crisis of financial capitalism.[7] He focuses on the economic, but also includes political and social factors, such as the migrant crisis, the refugee crisis, the privatization of social provision, the ecological crisis and much more. The crisis of financial capitalism is not confined to countries where art is regularly represented in a negative light; it is a global phenomenon that affects all global art markets. As Harvey narrates, the crisis of the ecological commons is felt in ‘all over the world’, and although the causes remain unclear, historical experience suggests that the criticality of the crisis lies in its transnational character. Artworks are commodities in many cases, and the historical conditions that allow for their production are set by agreements between nations.[8] Harvey narrates these terms in the context of the global financial crisis of 2008, which became known as the Great Financial Mockery.

Histories of the Crisis are published by Verso in London and New York; the New Criterion in New York and the New Criterion in Paris. Histories of the Crisis were also the first issue of the journal to publish an issue of the journal itself, in the form of a double-sided journal (with an October cover story). These two issues introduced two parallel histories, one for the artists, one for the communities impacted by the crisis. The artists, whose works are part of the issue, and the communities they represent, are seated in a series of ‘present and […] future perspectives’ tableaux, each depicting an ‘interview’ with one or more participants in the crisis. The present and future perspectives would make these interviews […] the first ten essays in the journal.[7] Histories of the Crisis features a range of writing styles typical of its author(s), including legalistic, critical and theoretical descriptions that often appear in an attempt to grapple with a given issue (such as the legalistic treatment of capital today, or the way in which post-2008 financial crises are resolved),</text>

The Biennial Condition, 2011–present As a biennial,  	Note taking, a.k.a. triennials, are institutionally significant events that occur between the years 2011 and 2019. In the years since their origins, they have increasingly become forms of cultural exchange between nations and cultures, often mediated through multilateral institutions. They are places of multi-sited exhibitions, public spectacles, and data feeds, where knowledge is exchanged and cultures are formed. In this sense, they are ‘documentaries of the present, ‘presentations of the past, and ‘pictures that speak of the future’. ‘Any biennial’ should have a purpose and strive to meet this purpose, but in the last analysis the biennial must also achieve a political goal – something that has become increasingly difficult to define in the current political context.

The text of the first chapter of Chronicling the Crisis – now published under the title The Contemporary Condition – appears to be a response to Soderbergh’s political statement, which read as follows:In the wake of the crisis, the museum is being reconceived in the image of a new normal, in which the individual is valued above all else, and art more and more seems to fill every space, every horizon. But perhaps the main thrust of your work is not so much about what’s happening to the museum as it is about what’s happening to us: the curators, art lovers and artists themselves.

In this sense, I figure, the contemporary is always in a struggle with the specific, though often winning, overuse of what one can call the ‘imagined contemporaneity’. (JL)Leap into ContextThe (very real) advent of photography and video made it possible to record, from the ground up, the history that took place during the early stages of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, and to make it available to scholars, journalists and others with access to archives. This historical work, if anything, magnifies the role of the artist, as an author, in creating the awareness of the crisis and for this I am grateful.

As a corollary, this is often the case, and in such cases the superstructural is the least ableist of the partners. It is, of course, the biennial that becomes the multinational art museum and is thus also the international art marketer, in that it supplies the other with the resources for its activities, while it, on the contrary, maximises the leverage of the bargains it makes within the society.  In this analysis, the biennial is the ‘capital of the present’, exhibiting the contemporary contemporary phenomenon in all its historical and contemporary manifestations, while simultaneously providing a physical base for future cultural activity. The 1996 Amsterdam Biennale, exhibiting the same year as the first World War, was no exception to this rule. While its themes of the trans</text>

In an attempt to bring the biennale back to the current (present), contemporary (world) stage, in 2017 the Biennale staged a number of performances, ‘recollections’ of the past events in Venice, Berlin, and so on, in an attempt to revisit the historic vibrancy of the biennale. These performances were produced and directed by the Biennale, and their audiences were largely engaged by the biennale’s newly-developed ‘connecting art’ programme. Though these creative actions certainly have a place in a biennale’s curatorial repertoire, their real intent and even potential impact is limited by the culture of the city in which they take place.

The 1995 Venice Biennale, which saw the premiere in L.A. undated it in 2012, is a case in point.[5] This is true in many of those cities – New York, London, Paris – where the biennale has occasionally staged events that are connected to the city, or are demonstrative of a city's growth. But in many cities, the biennale has tended to be about art as exhibitionary form, or the art as a commodity, like every other exhibitionary form, and rarely does its curatorial independence – or, to be more specific, its independence from other curatorial forms – stand out as clearly as it has in Venice.

A substantial proportion of these visitors were from outside of Italy, and from outside the Biennale were expressed the presence of another ‘majority population’ in the Biennale’s audience. These two 'race categories’ that we can identify as biennials are, in their current form, made up of visitors from different parts of the world. While they may seem to be arriving en masse to be seen by a diverse collection of people, and seeing and hearing about something that they have never seen or done, in reality, these visitors are arriving en masse to be photographed, to hear from a curator, and to be part of a cultural exchange that has a deeply specific (and highly visible) impact on the life and future of the city. 	In these ways, the biennale is a frequent site of the encounter of different sorts of people, arriving on</text>

The fact that Piero Bisello directed the 1989 Venice Biennale also explains why the Venice Biennale has a 1993 entry fee that is higher than the biennale of any other city, although it also explains the dominance of the artist-organisation in the biennale. Assembling the Biennale of the Twenty-First CenturyErvin Negri Ervin Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri Negri</text>

As a corollary, this may be seen as an important point of difference between the exhibitionary curatorial format of the present and the curatorial curatorial curatorial process of the past, when there was a marked tendency for the most prominent artists to be established in the centre and the periphery of the city. While the contemporary curatorial process of the past may permit cultural enterprises of the most local interest, it is significantly different from the past curatorial process of the present. The understanding of the contemporary curatorial at a high level is one generated through data, and whilst data is valuable in conveying information about the contemporary art market as a whole, it is of limited use in mapping it given the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the contemporary urban environment.

The main reason why the Biennale was able to undertake this massive scale and in the time it did, was that it was sold by and was funded by the Biennalee through a variety of different funds, mainly from the Swiss and Italian governments, as part of their ‘Common Market for Art and Cultural Spaces’.[5] The Biennalee was itself a major player in this market; through a combination of its agreement with the Italian Cultural Commission in 1995 and its important sponsorship of the 1998 Venice Biennale, it controlled access to many major art museums. The sale of the Biennalee also meant that it had a stake in the allocation of global curatorial resources.

They are the only forms of art or cultural activity in this country to have their exhibitions and performances, whether on a large scale, a smaller scale, or reproduced in a museum collection. The danger is that these once in-the-making exhibitions, which provided the core curatorial thrust of the biennial, are being reproduced without any kind of political or social impetus or sense of place or history or community or social purpose or intrinsic curatorial value in the public or cultural sector. And this is a problem. I remember vividly the turn of events in Liverpool when, some years after the Biennale of Sydney, artworks were selected for removal from the streets due to a 'no man's land' sign read by the council. The intention was to eradicate sign writing, but the council were forced to back down when protests from residents and community groups led by women artists and architects. The removal of artworks from the streets is a typical mechanism of the biennial today, but the practice of systematically and deliberately destroying cultural assets outside the biennial is</text>

So it is that biennials, along with art fairs, are passing through a stage right now where they are experiencing their most vulnerable state. They are the only forms of art or cultural activity that can be defined as ‘high-quality tourism magnets’. As the Australian and New Zealand biennials continue to grow larger and more international in scope, and as the art fairs shrink and are replaced by art collections, it is clear that ‘high-quality tourism’ is the only kind of ‘high-quality tourism possible’. And this is a fundamental change from many years ago, when art and cultural tourism was much more a part of the tourist package. The addition of artworks to the itinerary is a classic curatorial move, one that virtually any curatorial person can do, and that I expect will continue to be for many types of trips. But the logic of the biennial isn’t that simple. It requires an understanding of the world in order to be understood, and understanding requires an audience. In other words, as biennials expand their geographical scope, their numbers, and their real estate markets, they require more and</text>

So it is that biennials, along with art fairs, are passing through a stage right now where they are experiencing their most vulnerable state. They are the only forms of art or cultural activity in this country that are experiencing this kind of deindustrialisation and are struggling to stay relevant. This is a fascinating time for biennialism, for the form as a whole, and especially for the individual artists who draw audiences to their exhibits and acts of cultural activity. The biennial is no longer the be-all and end-all of art form, but is in many ways a transient and transient exhibitionary form that is no longer able to sustain artists or the cultural-economic-political-ideological character that it had in the 1980s and 1990s. In this context, biennials are becoming increasingly rare, which is creating an exhibitionary imbalance that is making a comeback in some quarters. This imbalance is particularly problematic for artists who draw audiences to their artworks, as biennials tend to generate a lot of press and generate a great deal of public funding, which in turn attracts artists from other genres to exhibit their work. This imbalance is making some biennial artists less than</text>

So it is that biennials, along with art fairs, are passing through a stage right now where they are experiencing their most vulnerable state. They are the only forms of art or cultural activity in this country offering an uninterrupted stream of new work, and they are the only forms of cultural activity that can count on a regular income. When this happens in the biennial format, it occurs that the artworks are displaced and moved to other locations; museums and galleries fill this role. This happens most dramatically in the art world, where art is typically viewed as a consumable commodity, and art is often given away for free. But the displaced artworks are artworks that are hard to replace; if they are displaced, they are often hard to find. And this happens in the biennial format every two years; the cultural resources needed to support permanent artworks are limited. So the displacement of artworks is a persistent phenomenon in the biennial world. It is a feature of the biennial itself, but it is also a feature of other kinds of exhibitions, and it is a feature of biennials in general.

They are the only forms of art or cultural activity that are explicitly being demonstrated year on year, and the only indicators of the health of a particular art or art-world. At this particular juncture, biennials are in a unique position: they have the exclusive right to the biennale, and are therefore obliged to present a continuous amount of art in a given city. This is why biennials have to present a certain amount of contemporary art, or else they are excluded from the precious few places that other forms of art can claim. The fixation on their own contemporary interest sets the biennial apart from other forms of exhibitionary media; a phenomenon that most curators would agree is detrimental to the medium and society as a whole.The fixation on the contemporary also confuses the biennial with other curatorial practices, which are themselves making a comeback: museums, academies, special exhibitions and so forth.

But the real trick is to find the right form of cultural tourism, to draw the right mix of people to the right places, to the right experiences, while remaining sensitive to the needs and desires of the local people.This is the dilemma facing curators today: do they abandon their culturally sensitive duty to inform the public of art’s real character, or do they embrace the power and money of the art gallery and museum, which are committed to making money regardless of who is visiting them, and which museum(s) can they turn to when they are faced with a public gallery or gallery empty of patrons?

Making art in the context of a biennial, and particularly in the context of a major art museum, is different from making art elsewhere, especially in other types of exhibitions. The former requires the audience to put in a lot of effort, whereas the latter can be enjoyed in one's adult lifetime. The fascination of the contemporary biennial audience is the opposite of nostalgia, and it is the opposite of what most curators strive for. So it is that biennials, along with art fairs, are passing through a stage right now where they are experiencing their most vulnerable state. They are the only forms of art or cultural activity that can be counted on to provide a high degree of safety and security, and the only legitimate venue for cultural exchange outside of war zones. But this kind of ideological constant (the need to be taken seriously, and to be reckoned with) is gradually being replaced by a more pragmatic and nongrowthy kind of ideological constant (the need to protect and serve, and make new lives in perpetuity).The biennial is a cultural phenomenon, and it is happening now in many forms: it is a main stage at major art museums, a blot on the landscape, a rare commodity amongst curators and art dealers, and a weird anomaly amongst artists and curators. It is becoming increasingly common for biennials to be organized around a function or a set of functions (the usual exhibition venue, a recently acquired property or a gallery asset, as well as temporary exhibitions, dealer exhibitions, and so forth). The functions of biennials have taken a variety of forms across cultures, but the basic</text>

They are the only forms of art or cultural activity in this country offering this kind of protection for critical mass. It is a pity that this kind of historical, social and curatorial neglect or inability exists in our city centres. They would be a valuable addition to the cultural landscape if they did exist, lending a critical mass to argue against the prevailing trends, offering alternative futures or suggesting other possibilities. There is a danger, however, in building a biennial around a museum or an institution that is burdened with such heavy mandates and is therefore unable to devote the necessary resources to supporting its important cultural activities on a regular basis. This is especially true in the current period, since the biennial format is now so ingrained in the art museum that it is almost a requirement for entry. In many cities, a biennial is more of a tourist attraction than an art museum. It is a form of cultural consumption with a heavy institutionalisation of the past, present and future. It is the museum equivalent of Amtrak, except that it is not an institution but</text>

So it is that biennials, along with art fairs, are passing through a stage right now where they are experiencing their most vulnerable state. They are the only forms of art or cultural activity in this increasingly globalised and integrated world, and they are the only places where art is being made with the most immediate, tangible effects. And they are the only places where art can be made with the most negative impacts. Such is the nature of the biennial condition. It is up to curators and artists to create art that is dignified by this status, and can be accepted by those with whom it is presented. But given the choice, most artists would rather make work that maximises their capacities, or do something that is more readily available and touches more people.Art is made in many forms, and art is made today in many parts of the world. But in the age of the biennial and the museum, the biennial itself is becoming increasingly rare, and art museums increasingly uncommon. There are only two museums in the world with collections of their own, and these are in Asia: the Museum of Contemporary Art (in New York) and the Museum of Contemporary Art (in</text>

Biennial attendance has to increase every year, and there has to be a way to make them more like art museums. There has to be a difference.  The other issue is this: what constitutes a biennial? I suppose the answer is that it has to be a ‘relevance’ to the major biennials of the world. If the biennial is to become more and different from their biennial predecessors, it has to be experiences that are unique to this form, and not experiences that are typical of other types of exhibitions. For example, the London Biennial has to offer a different kind of experience from the Venice Biennale, because the latter requires the audience to travel to both. And the Philadelphia Biennale must offer a kind of experience from the Denver Biennale, because the former requires the audience to travel to both.

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the biennale was largely confined to the pages of Venezia Province, in the year of its founding, and only occasionally appeared in other Italian cities, including in Venice).6 	But Baudrilliard and her colleagues saw a far more fundamental problem with the biennale that was equally as pressing: what is being exhibited in the city is but an image, a collection of images, and the city is not only the object of our images, but also a living organism that reproduces itself through its own images. The Biennale was therefore not only exhibiting but also reproducing another kind of art – that is, reproducing art from outside the museum by showing it in the museum – but it was also exhibiting and reproducing a kind of art that emerged very late in the game, that was neither major nor minor art in its own right, but something like post-academic art. And what this something like is precisely the kind of art that the Biennale is now</text>

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the biennale was shown in a rotating calendar, not included in the city’s general tourist calendar), a description that was frequently applied to the ‘new media’ of art being developed at the time. The biennale therefore seemed to offer a way to anticipate in advance, with great precision, what might be called ‘postmodern’ developments, and to create, with great specificity, what Joseph Conrad called ‘a new kind of urban being’.’4 This kind of being would render media consumption obsolete, or at least to a certain extent to our contemporary standards. But even if this were to be the case, what would become of the iconic ‘temporal conditions’ that we associate with biennales?  One could ask what our current biennales would do if they did not take place in cities, and what kind of spatial and temporal difference would they make? Would they be any less significant because the centennial they were staged</text>

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the biennial naturally responds to changes in time), and the city was often characterised by a rapid proliferation of architectural styles, some of them very successful, some not so successful. Baudrilliard and her colleagues saw an opportunity to intervene and bring some of these different temporal registers together in a way that would enhance the city’s capacity to simultaneously capture and reflect on the historical moments that are made visible through the architecture of the present. The idea was to engage with what she and her colleagues described as the ‘complex temporal situation of cities today’, and to see what could be done with different temporal registers – to engage with ‘time as both a space and a number’.[31]These temporal modes of engagement are designed to minimise the apparent interactions among people and objects in a given scene, and to the extent that they are recognisable to a human observer. The Greek philosopher and mathematician, Socrates, makes this point well in his own defence in Timaeus. He</text>

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the biennale was actually moving from its traditional location in Rome, to taking place in Venice at the end of that year). In its self-conscious ‘performative’ character, this description is no doubt an attempt to capture the exoticisms and exoticisms of the time. But, in the broader context and with this biennale as a series of smaller operations, it betrays a certain amount of historical decadence. For Venice, particularly, the turn of events in the late nineteenth century that resulted in the rise of the biennale was a turn of fortune that was largely to be regretted. Its current economic and spatial situation is a turn of fortune that is likely to perpetuate its historical dependency on tourism and the financial services of culture. The biennale as an institution and its revenues today are a turn of fortune that is less certain and less certain. Venice Biennale website  	References: Antonio Olascoaga, ‘On the Ide</text>

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the biennale was seen as a social event, and therefore subject to the laws of historical and urban repetition). In the years immediately after the conclusion of the Venice Biennale, Baudrilliard and her colleagues sought to formulate a new kind of biennale that would be continuous with the themes of the 1910 Paris Exposition, and would address the social and political dimensions of the biennale in a number of new cities. In other words, the twenty-first century is going to see the twentieth ‘the time when the biennale became both temporal and universal’. This is an extremely important project for us to undertake, and I look forward to seeing what we achieve together.Download this article as PDFBaudrilliard &amp; CompanyOpen House New York, June, 2018Baudrilliard &amp; CompanyOpen House New York, June, 2018How did we get here?When we opened the bakery, the address, the concept and the intention of the Biennale,</text>

In the new century, we might see an event that is described as biennale-like in the sense of being present in a city but not taking part in it. In an event that is both internal and external to the city, but is itself a ‘temporal’ event, but is also a ‘world’ in itself (besides taking part in it), the biennale has a chance.  The idea of the ‘biennial as a ‘world’ only became significant in the twentieth century, and it is here that Venice’s unique relationship to its own history becomes relevant. Venice is a historical anomaly, but its innovative and dynamic ways – its ‘street plan’ and its ‘scene plan’ – are what other biennales do well, beyond the obvious reasons why they are there.

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the biennale was often characterised as moving to and from Venice, and thus of the temporal economy of art’s historical practices). In fact, the attraction of the Biennale to the present and the ‘postmodern’ era, and to a particular temporality that can be reproduced through increasingly sophisticated artworks, is precisely what Baudrilliard and her colleagues set out to undermine. They did this not through historical or anthropological studies of the biennale, but through the study of museums and the ephemeral culture of museums (which became increasingly important in the postmodern era, as well as in the twentieth century). As museum collections became ever more important in the twentieth century, and as biennales became ever more important, the need for a curator seemed increasingly urgent. The biennale was seen by many artists as an essential staging post, and this is why, in the nineteenth century, the biennial needed to be a multi-year enterprise, accounting</text>

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the biennale was shown in Venice, and Venice itself was seen as centrally important in the world’s financial and military systems). The biennale experienced a kind of internal reorientation, one that sought to reconcile the temporal with the spatial, the human with the machine, and the artist with the temporal.But while the Biennale in its current form can nevertheless be said to owe a great deal to the influences of Venice, a significant amount of its character derives from the influence of the City of Venetian cities. In other words, the Biennale is really an event in itself, and like all such ‘events’, it is really made possible by a rich tapestry of cultural transmission that exists between the different cities that make up the Biennale. And this character is – in a strict numerical sense – determined by the sheer number of cities represented within the city. In other words, the Biennale, like all exhibitionary forms,</text>

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the archipelago was closing in on a bankruptcy court, the Biennale was seen by many artists as a way of holding on to temporality). In a number of cases, the idea that the biennale was inherently anti-intellectual was the dominant one. In Venice in particular, this idea (as well as a number of other places around the city) was under constant attack. In a number of biennials, the critical mass of the public came first, and then art was often said to be a pre-eminent concern. In other words, the biennale, while it sometimes seemed to be responding to what was perceived as an anti-biennial trend, was actually a positive phenomenon that was complementing what was happening elsewhere. The problem with this kind of historical/ideological framing, however, is that it becomes increasingly difficult to know what is actually going on in the world of art right now.

In those years, the Biennale was often described as a crisis of the ‘temporal’ (since the biennale in Venice was centred on the museum, and museum collections were nationalised in the process of modernization, as was evident in the collection of artworks on view in the Giardini). The narrator of the poem is none other than Max Ernst, the German zoologist and Curator of Works on View at the Giardini. Max Ernst wrote:The Biennale in Venice, which has recently taken place, is a most unfortunate and deceptive exhibition of modern artifice, mockery, and trickery. It is the most characteristic and characteristic feature of the present exhibitionary complex. But to show a fragment of the work already judged and judged, as being contemporary and modern even though it is made to resemble nothing so much as a museum collection at an unknown age, and to show an exhibition of historical curating – to take the cardinal feature of the present as a given and render it in a number of guises and forms – is a most characteristic and characteristic feature of the present</text>

The project began to evolve into a fully fledged community work, and eventually into an online publication. At the same time, it also experienced a kind of viral growth that was completely unexpected and completely unexpected in itself. As new ideas, tools and techniques were developed and new community members came on board, the process of how ideas, knowledge and creativity came together became much more dynamic.This kind of participatory research and discovery happens within a community of people who share the same language, the same beliefs and political views, but different political experiences and histories. It is happening now in Liverpool, and will be happening everywhere in the world as we continue to be part of the digital economy and participate in connected information technologies. But to take part in such research and discovery, you need to be able to articulate clearly in a way that is both conversant with each other and the local environment. This kind of shared perspective is rare in communities, and is one of the challenges of the new economy: to develop full-fledged new ways of organising things.

The project began to evolve into a fully fledged community work, and eventually into an online publication. At the same time, it also evolved into a programme of workshops and events, which continues to this day. At the 2015 Edinburgh Fringe, there was a partially funded phase 3/4 funded by the Arts Council and part of the Social Practice Masters programme at Lancaster University. There are many other arts organisations involved as well as local communities. The aim of these collaborations is to understand how art can help create a more social and sustainable future for people and places through their practices. For more than just arts and culture, this is about what other social practices can contribute in this context.For the last three years, the Social Practice Master’s programme at Lancaster University has been running alongside the Social Practice Masters programme at Leeds University. The programme has the distinct opportunity to work alongside other teaching organisations in the same way that the arts commissioning agency does with other social practice students. In addition to working alongside other partners, the students are given the opportunity to develop their own research project or work through a previous research project into what might be called</text>

The aim of the project is to inform and educate by bringing together diverse knowledge streams and perspectives. For this to happen, we need to be able to articulate why we are doing what we are doing, and why we are doing it well. The idea of inSiteEvents came about as a way to create a continuous, public, collaborative process by which people could share and contribute to the site in many ways, creating a possible new model for art-related social purpose in a city that is still largely apolitical. The architecture of the site has been designed to support this new model of community engagement. This is why the name of the publication has been kept under wraps, because it is not part of the agenda or purpose of the site. It is more of a phenomenon.

The collection and website developed a kind of a collective memory, a kind of a collective archive, which became an integral part of the project. In this sense, it was a kind of a ‘homebrew' or ‘seed stock’ of sorts, or ‘seed material’ that came from many different places and came out the other side very well. The process of gathering materials and building the website also involved in many ways the same materials and concepts that were brought into the project through the various art and social action projects.

It is an incredible thing to think that it took just nine months for the internet to be invented, and that it will take us all ten times longer to process the data. However, recent events have put this project in a very different place, and made it necessary to think about new ways of organising things.In the spring of 2014 I started to develop a new type of user group called Discourse, which would be able to carry out collaborative research and discovery on its own. Through a year-long exploratory research project, I invited participants from different fields to come and collaborate on Discourse’s research and to create an archival collection and website of sorts. I invited artists, composers, film-makers and curators to contribute to this project as well as other online art, social and cultural practitioners. The project began to evolve into a fully fledged community work, and eventually into an online publication. At the same time, it also attracted artists and creative professionals who came to work closely with the community around it, including architects, designers, photographers, writers and musicians. The diversity of the group ensured that the process it produced was not just an expression of who we were as artists and creators, but also a reflection of who we were as a people: a collective. The aim of this collaborative process was to: a) inform and inspire the next generation of artists and creative professionals by showing them how to ‘reproduce’ themselves through the processes we had devised; and b) create a place where that could happen, so that that next generation could benefit from what we had done there.The site and community hub came about as a result of two things in particular. One was the network effect: the more links we built between different places, the more resources we created. And the more links we made between different audiences, the more effective our outreach would be. In the case of the arts community, the link between</text>

The project began to evolve into a fully fledged community work, and eventually into an online publication. At the same time, it also attracted artists, performers, journalists and other users to contribute to the publication. At the beginning of 2015, I launched an online exhibition titled System 6: Chaos Computer, which traces the history of computer-system design from the 1980s in the USA and examines the connections between social theory, architecture and computer game design. In 2016, I curated a two-day symposium entitled ‘Unfixing America’ at the MCA’s Talking Computer exhibition series, exploring in-depth the cultural and architectural underpinnings of our ubiquitous computer.Together, these different sources of information allowed me to come to different conclusions about the world. For instance, the way in which social media affected our sense of place and identity in the 1980s and 1990s was a source of much disagreement amongst artists, as different social experiments could potentially lead to opposite conclusions. In the case of art, the influence of computer programming could be seen as similarly insidious. In the case of architecture, the influence of</text>

The project began to evolve into a fully fledged community work, and eventually into an online publication. At the same time, it also attracted artists who were either from the UK or had residency or postgraduate programmes in the UK. The aim of this publication was to be an extension of the research, in that it sought to bring together the different strands of the Discourse project and bring them together in a way that might be of use to one another. This publication came about as a direct result of this research and creative collaborative process. It was also a direct consequence of the conflict in the Middle East that was then affecting the region. In the weeks leading up to the publication of the first issue of the journal, I organised a series of workshops in the community hub of Anfield. There, participants from the project and from the local arts establishment joined me in developing a range of questions and ideas. These questions and ideas became a document that was assembled into a book that was published as a joint publication between the two arts institutions – Liverpool and Doha. The questions and ideas that emerged during these two years were: what are the forms of</text>

The project began to evolve into a fully fledged community work, and eventually into an online publication. At the same time, it also attracted artists, artists' studios and creative agencies to join the project through a collaborative process that allowed artists to explore the possibilities of multimedia engagement. The result is a compendium of knowledge that is both authoritative and accessible, both for students and scholars. I would say that the following steps helped me to arrive at the project’s current form:From the beginning of the project, I have tried to make it as accessible as possible for people to access the information; this meant creating an online resource called ‘The Vault’ where people could access the research and documentation. I have also created a public Facebook group called ‘The Vault’ for participants to post their findings and ask questions; this allows people to share their knowledge and get support for further research. I have invited artists, composers, film-makers and others with a creative edge to join the project as co-investigators or collaborators; this ensures that the information gained through the project will be shared with as many people as</text>

The texts have been translated into multiple languages, and in 2015 a second edition was published by Cambridge University Press. The aim of this edition was to present the discourses of the Discourse project as a podcast, with archival episodes from the past, with additional interviews and critical essays. In 2016, the Cambridge Union published an expanded edition of the anthology, with an exhibition of the project's original black and white photos, a new cover photo and text, and a new chapter titled ‘Spectators’ in the Union's current newsletter. The project is archived at Unionetwork.org .

The project began to evolve into a fully fledged community work, and eventually into an online publication. At the same time, it also attracted artists and creative professionals from all over the world, many of whom came to contribute creative works, including new media, web design, event design, social media, food and travel design.The aim of the project was to: 1) capture the multidisciplinary, multi-disciplinary nature of art, culture, activism, and public works; 2) to offer a platform for dialogue and exchange between artists, curators, art historians, art’s audience, artists and curators; and 3) to build a common platform for art’s many forms to be explored and shared. The collection and website was developed in collaboration with the artist Cynthia Forster, who curated the 2014 Biennale of Sydney, and the curator Carl Forster, who curated the 2014 Liverpool Biennale. The materials and methods used in the project were developed and shared between the participants, and their contributions were considered essential to the success of the project.

I took part in the conception and when it was ready to be displayed, the users’ brought it to the office and presented it to the media. The media came, marveled at the power of visualization, and came away with a new perspective on the world.It was a collective, intelligent vision; a work in progress, but with time to mingle and talk.The virtual image became an international symbol of the social impact of ideas and images; a new kind of communication between people. It brought people together, challenged people to engage with the world around them, and allowed those with different worldviews to know that they were not alone. It created a dialogue that challenged people to think differently and allowed people to imagine new possibilities.This is what the virtual image wants. It wants to be able to connect. It wants to be able to change. It needs people to engage in dialogue. The problem is, what it usually gives</text>

There’s a logic to that, but it comes with an elephant in the room: people’s perception of art and culture. The fact that so many people find it repugnant and uncomfortable to witness work that they created and commissioned art from them is testimony to the power of that perception. There are art museums all over the world that would gladly put on a show for the fans of their art, but they can only do it with the artist’s consent. The idea that art can somehow ‘bridge the gap’ between public spaces and private life seems counter intuitive and absurd to me. The notion that the art collective might allow that kind of bridging seems counter intuitive to the very notion of community.I was present when the idea was put forward that the art be produced in spaces where it was actually not allowed to be.

I was struck by how quickly the idea was recast as a kind of  	virtuality by computer scientists at the California Institute of Technology, led by computer scientist Jeffrey Chester. I felt as if I should have been present because I felt as though I should have been present, but I didn’t want to be absent from the story because I didn’t want to be invisible. I wanted to tell the story in the light of day, with people understanding what I was trying to do because I had the conference there. I sent an email to the organizers and asked if I could go behind the scenes and collaborate. When I got the call to go, I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’ The idea was warped, but at the time, it was the only way I was comfortable</text>

At this point, the project was showing signs of life, as people bringing ideas into practice. One of the projects that emerged was the project that invited people to ‘re-animate’ buildings. Ideas circulated that it could be done with the help of nano-building materials, which are fabricated from the nano-scale components of buildings and used as building components. Nanotechnology allows for the creation of highly mobile building components, which in turn enable new uses for the material components. In the context of the DDB project, the material components of buildings were reconfigurable. Ideas circulated that it could be done with smart materials that monitor the health of the building and use those monitoring data to detect materials that are deficient in certain types of building materials. One of the project leaders, Dr Vikram Sethi, an Industrial Engineer at Tata Steel, Mumbai, proposed that the remediating of the urban landscape be achieved through the integration of data analytics</text>

The exhibition opened with a series of paintings by the artist Carol Becker that captured the spirit of the conference in a single image. The images were based on actual exhibits that were placed in locations around the city, and the installations themselves were conceived as a kind of exhibition of beauty that was part of a collective work. In their own way, the artists’ claims to ownership of the data is questioned, since it isn’t shared between the users of the software and the sites that host the site. The hand of the government is also shown to be present in this exhibition of beauty. The figures of composers, dancers, painters, sculptors and others who contributed to the design of the site are also prominently displayed, alongside figures from the police and legal systems. The story of the site appears repeatedly in the exhibition, often intermingled with accounts of</text>

The personas of the activists who came to work with me on the project were markedly different from the people I’d met at the conference. A collective memory emerged about the events of the conference that incorporated many of the same behaviours and motivations. Some of the people who came out of that memory line would later become key activists in the housing and justice movements. But the ways in which the participants connected to and enacted on the narrative of the conference was very different from the ways in which we connected. I came away from the process with a new understanding of how to approach future work with those people, in order to ensure that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past.The other thing that emerged from the conference was a sense of what we had in common. The social aspect of it was very important. We’d all said that bond that we had with the Quaker people</text>

I don’t have a great deal of personal knowledge about the project, other than what I heard at the conference, but I do feel like there are a number of questions that need to be asked. First, why do you suppose that the avatar has a particular relationship to the data that he or she represents? Second, what does it mean for the avatar to be a fictional character? Thirdly, what does it mean for the avatar to be a member of a community? Finally, what does it mean for the avatar to be a citizen of a community?

The notion that programming is a modus operandi emerged early in the conversation about what the art institution should be. Whether the coding of the participants is done by the creators or the curators, participants constantly ask, ‘What could be more beautiful than programming?’ The participants formulate a question and ask it out loud, asking it in many different ways. They’re not able to articulate all of the answers, but they’re able to generate an atmosphere of openness, intimacy and collaboration that is authentic to the process. The programming is done by the participants and is guided by the curators, but it doesn’t feel like an art institution. It’s done by people with skills and tools that are complementary to each other and can be used constructively or destructively. The programming allows for the generation of meaningful relationships between people through the manipulation of data; it</text>

They’ve worked with the DDB since it was created and run by Rami El Samahy in 2011; El Mahdi was instrumental in bringing it to Istanbul. They’ve also worked with him in other projects in the past, for example in Memphis, Tennessee, where El Samahy is a musician and the author of several poetry collections. In the past, when the DDB came to the United States, the artists formed a collective and worked with the artist to develop her solo work. The collective has since expanded internationally, is active in its local community, and is a platform through which artists from all over the world can communicate with one another.

They showed off the system to invited participants, including myself, who was invited as a co-developer of one of the project’s augmented reality applications. I was invited as a developer because I’d worked alongside the lead designer on the project, and because of my expertise in computer programming and embedded systems engineering. The system is a modified version of the one used in virtual reality, and it provides an interface between the physical and virtual worlds. In the real world, the headset and the computer would both be black, but in the virtual world, the virtual world is illuminated with a white light. In another layer of the system, the user’s brain converts the imagined world into an interactive map that tracks movement, places, and encounters using the spatial phenomenon known as ‘position tracking’ which is an</text>

This is a unique and exciting opportunity for artists to engage with the political, economic and urban implications of a biennale that is increasingly political, economic and social. Cultural tourism is an ever-present dimension of the tourist business. It is a form of capital for which there is ample profit potential. Cultural tourism is a major contributor to the biennale economy and plays an ever-increasing role in the provision of a city’s cultural resources, notably cultural infrastructure, cultural tourism and the biennale as an economic driver. However, in recent years the economic interests of the biennale have shifted towards the ever-expanded sphere of geopolitics and military interventions. The biennale as a tourist industry is experiencing a crucial shift towards urban, participatory cultures, where cultural encounters are facilitated through modes of transport that are heavily dependent on geo-political considerations. The biennale is a critical and ever-present form of cultural production. It provides the political and social cover for the implementation</text>

I invite artists, curators, architects, architects, journalists, heritage campaigners and other stakeholders to join me in this critical journey of cultural regeneration. This will involve more than museum collections and exhibitions; it will involve engaging with the politics of identity and place, and the role of art, curation and infrastructure in resisting the logic of consumer culture. The Museum will play a key role in the creation of a new media landscape, and in the promotion and exchange of cultural practices and identities. In the radical sense of this word, this might include the actual production of cultural products or even the making of them. But it will also involve a relational and dynamic interaction between the Museum and community groups, creative professionals, artists, architects, journalists and others with a range of expertise and vocations. This will entail a high-level strategic planning process involving both institutional and grassroots expertise. It will involve developing strategies to engage directly with biennial and large-scale cultural institutions, but will most certainly involve much more interaction and negotiation with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and non-profit arts organisations (NPOs).

The project, entitled ‘Welsh Streets: The Biennale of a Community Arts Programme’, was led by Jane &amp; Tony Richardson, artists and directors of the Welsh Streets Art Centre, and produced by the Welsh Streets Partnership, as well as members of the community. The project was part of the Assist Historic Buildings Campaign, funded by Arts Council England and HMRI, and part</text>

This could include curating projects, writing articles or even curating the forthcoming curatorial programme of the Museum, taking part in cultural events or exhibitions, or whatever else might be useful in this critical moment. The key is to realise that cultural interventions do not have to be ‘intangible’ in order to count. They must be transformational in some way. In this critical moment, a critical cultural maturation is warranted. That is, the path must be travelled in order to bring culture to the urban centre, and beyond. In other words, cultural regeneration should be a political and material act, and not just a financial one. This is why cities and localities have had cultural constitutions since the late eighteenth century, to ensure that state power is channeled into passive modes of consumption and not into active interventions that actively shape culture. It is why states created cultural institutions, such as museums and conservatories, to counter this tendency towards passive culture, and why artists have a contractual right to</text>

This can happen only with the involvement and participation of a multi-disciplinary team of artists, curators, architects, historians and others with appropriate expertise and discipline, including architects, heritage campaigners, artists, critics and others with a skill set to create engaging cultural experiences through data (but no hands-on involvement).  In a broader sense, the Museum is a building whose purpose is cultural, but its actual function is cultural promotion. It is a complex collection of social, economic and spatial systems that assist in creating and sustaining a biennale experience for visitors. Its success depends on many factors including the quality of its cultural value extraction, the long-term engagement of its public, local and regional stakeholders, and its integration into the city’s infrastructure and social systems. In this critical, unpredictable and increasingly fragmented context, the biennale must adapt to the changing nature of the urban environment and society. The biennale must also adapt to a society that is more fluid, adapts and can</text>

This will require collaboration and accommodation, but it will also require a fundamental re-thinking of the current system that is failing us all. 	[1] The first World War was fought over these very questions. The United States and Britain declared war on Germany on June 6, 1939, but Germany responded by reinforcing her naval and military might by invading the UK. The UK responded with greater military might – overwhelming and ultimately victorious – but with no clear idea what to do next. Eventually, the question was returned to London, to be decided by a council of city planners. The council was made up of representatives of industry, academics, politicians, and many others. It seems entirely plausible that the Museum might find itself embroiled in a similar quixotic situation, with no clear direction or resources.

The journal must present evidence of the activities and claims of the Museum in its current form and in its imagined future. It is not acceptable for the journal to return to the past, present or future in ways that are purely historical or archival.  For the Museum to achieve this, creative forms of archiving are essential.

I invite artists, curators, architects, architects, journalists, heritage campaigners and other stakeholders to join me in this critical journey of cultural regeneration. This critical work entails reaching beyond the art gallery, museum, school, curatorial agenda and country to cultural and urban changes. It requires an understanding of the dynamics, the histories and the ideologies of postindustrial cities. It requires imagination and new ways of organizing cultural power. It involves considering the social dimensions of art and culture in postindustrial urban environments. It involves considering the ways in which art is produced in the context of postindustrial education and cultural production, and it involves imagining alternative cultural formations and creating potential futures for art and culture. The key is to mobilize diverse partners with diverse capacities and skills to work together in building cooperative futures.  In my view, a critical mass of art, artists, cultural organisations and communities are now calling for a biennale that reflects the city for the first time in a way that is not reflexive but anticipates, and that actively engages with, ‘the city’ as a cultural form and site. This call is not coming from a museum, art</text>

If you can't, don’t belong.  In an ideal world, the Museum would be a globally visible art institution with a permanent collection of contemporary art, a museum of contemporary art, and a permanent collection of art from previous art forms. But in a world where art is valued more highly than in any country on earth, and art is made in many places in many cultures, the Museum would also need to be a place of encounters, exchanges and cultural experiences that transcend borders and cultures. In an ideal world, the Museum would be a place where art is experienced as a humanistic art form, and its objects reflect this humanistic quality through their familiar forms and figures, their expressive writing and historic photographs. But in a world where art is universalised and all cultures have access to the same collections, the Museum would also need to</text>

This is a multi-year, multi-edition project that will involve documentary and photography-based work in the biennial as well as traditional curatorial and textual forms in the wider genre of curatorial work. In the museum business, this could mean curating in the museum, the gallery and the street; curating in high street boutiques; and curating online, at art galleries, public museums and underground cultural centres. In the street, it could mean hanging out with menswear super-fanatics; acquiring real estate and building a menswear empire on the back of the homeless; and whether by accident or design, or ‘just in case’ becoming a fashion icon and being followed by copy cat fashion blogs. These narratives are often written by or for a white man, but there are vast numbers of women and ethnic minorities contributing meaningfully. Together, we can build a city that reflects its diverse parts, creating new narratives and forging collective identities. The Museum is an ideal</text>

This kind of material is structurally related to the city and its politics, but it lacks the power of ‘real life’ and is therefore needed for the project of imagination. Does the museum have a contemporary value today? I would argue that it does not. The museum is a living organism with a social function and contemporary consciousness. It is alive with the politics of materiality and it produces works that speak of the contemporary condition, but it is also a living artifact that requires continual care and maintenance. The museum is subject to change, and its current mission may be to explore capitalism in its many forms, but it has an exceptionally rich and dynamic past that can be traced to the industrial revolution and its discontents. It is also a museum that records and represents this materiality and politics of materiality, and through its various collections and exhibitions, reveals the preconditions and processes of everyday life today. Its current mission may be to serve as a repository and exhibition venue of this materiality and to this end it established a</text>

The museum, as such, is a set of relations and their dynamic reciprocity is a radically different kind of material than the way in which cities are usually conceived. This kind of material is structurally decentralized, but it has a political form and power – both qualitative and quantitative. Its appearance and proliferation coincides with the historical and technological quixotic projects of city-builders and industrialists alike, but it is also a necessary and fascinating complication and paradox of modernity itself. Its appearance coincides with the quest for oil and natural gas, but it is also structured by and concomitant with the shifting and cumulative impacts of climate change and its effects. Its proliferation coincides with the inevitable geopolitical conflicts and migrations of modernity, but it is also a prescient and embedded principle that can trace its history and consequences to this very moment. It is a material that is constantly (but imperfectly) evolving, and it behaves in some ways much like and is also affected by this shifting and contextual logic. But this kind of evolving material is uneven, variable and fragile. Its substance is always on the move, and its spatial and temporal nature is inherently episodic and unpredictable.

The museum, as such, is a set of relations and their dynamic reciprocity is a radically different kind of material than the way in which cities are usually conceived. This kind of material is structurally related to cities and their complex web of control structures, but it is actuated by and contributes to a society that is not always defined in relation to the city. The museum as materialiser and its curatorial hand, whilst incorporating and contributing to the city’s social and political life, is materially different from the way in which cities are usually conceived. This kind of ‘materialise’ takes place in three dimensions: (a) in the museum itself, (b) in the form of exhibitions and (c) in the use of archival materials and archive materials. It is to a large extent an effect of the museum’s initial public support and fundraising model, which placed great value on the object of permanent collection and made it a universal reference. It is to a large extent an effect of the massive, multi-year project entitled  	Project Horizons which was initiated in 2010 and funded by Royal Academy  and the Wellcome Trust. Its aim was to</text>

This kind of material is structurally unprecedented in its capacity to generate and expand social formations, and it is notable for its poverty and immensity. This kind of material is ‘the city’ in its spatial and temporal aspects, but it has an entirely different kind of content and purpose, exhibiting a radically different kind of social reality.  It is a museum of the contemporaneous conditions of the world through its material elements and its multiple media of cultural production. It is a museum that is constantly reminded of its temporal dimension and to a lesser extent, of its social dimensions, but at the same time exhibits a kind of organic unity that is unlike any other kind of museum. It exhibits a kind of accumulated narrative that is continuously renewed and that is deeply embedded in the city’s social and spatial terrain. It exhibits both its own episodic and ‘recurrent’ character. It exhibits the condition of contemporaneity through the repetition of various forms of social life, but it does not merely present the traces of such</text>

The museum, as such, is a set of relations and their dynamic reciprocity is a radically different kind of material than the way in which cities are usually conceived. This kind of material is structurally different from the kind of material (museum) that is produced by and for society, and yet it has been shown to produce very similar kinds of influence and change on individuals and collective behaviour. The museum is a ‘living organism’ that reproduces and emerges from the material it is embedded in. It develops and it responds to the changes that it is embedded in. But it does not possess ‘life’ or life-giving potentialities that allow it to thrive in the present and shape the future. The museum and its curatorial gesture are constrained by the very material it is made from. And this kind of material is not just made up of images and texts: it is also ethnographically diverse and geopolitically diverse. It includes translations, annotations, tables, maps, audio and video recordings, images, documents, film and video, drawings and diagrams, religious texts and imagery and literature.

This kind of material is structurally distinct from ‘muralism’ and ‘painting’ in that it is not governed by the notions of beauty or social value that we attach to them. It is materialised and socialised, but it is also ‘real life’ that it is. This kind of ‘materialist’ understanding of the city precludes many other kinds of social organisation and historical processes that are intrinsic to the city. The kind of ‘cultural Marxism’ that is being advanced within many parts of the world is premised on the idea that there is a single social and historical narrative that we must all follow, and that we must all adopt a set of shared values and beliefs. ‘Materialist’ narratives can be materialised in many forms – cultural artefacts, economic narratives, political narratives, economic instruments – but the fundamental premise is the same. The question is what is meant by the collective taking of space? In Marxist terms, we can say that</text>

This kind of material is structurally and infrastructurally different from the way in which cities are typically conceived: it is not ‘real life’ but ‘material life’. In the latter case, the material – the ‘ideology’ – dominates the power and it is this kind of ‘materialism’ that characterises contemporary urbanisation and the modern condition. The Museum as Materialising CentreThe museum as materialising centre is a concept that has recently gained a lot of currency in the context of contemporary art and modernism in contemporary art’s social-political context. It is often cited as an example of the contemporary production of meaning and social change, and its development as a ‘contemporary art form’ in the postmodernist and post-racial society of the spectacle. This kind of ‘contemporaneousness’ is characterised by the proliferation of exhibitionary forms – the accumulation of collections, the constant building of museums, the proliferation of language</text>

This kind of material is structurally different, more powerful, more pervasive, and more influential in its impact and in its impact on contemporaneous social and political formations. It is, in other words, a ‘living museum’ that exhibits and actively participates in its environments, producing what Deleuze and Guattari term ‘eco-exhibitionism’ (see Richard Florida’s Staging of American Cities: Baltimore and Stoney Creek, 1974). And here we can move from the museum’s historical curatorial gesture of the ancient museum, exemplified by Herodotus, to the museum’s contemporary materiality of the biennial. While Herodotus made the real-life contributions of his or her situation to the historiography of ancient and medieval cities, the biennial has largely adopted a representational and graphical orientation.

This kind of material is structurally different from what we think of as ‘culture’, which is defined as ‘the art of making things in the world, including making things in one’s own image, and which is closely tied to ideas of originality, creativity, and culture. In this sense, the museum is both a site of making and of destruction. But it is also a site of culture, and as such, it generates ideas about the world that are in part socially valuable but are also socially reprehensible. It is a site of ideas that are socially valuable because they are true, but also a place of destruction because they are pernicious. This is the contemporary museum: it collects and presents cultural value in a way that is both socially valuable and pernicious, but also a site of radical change because of its historical trajectory. In other words, it has a social function but it has to happen in a particular sequence and in a particular way, because otherwise it is not a �</text>

This kind of material is structurally sound and has some of the desirable properties of a city, but it is fundamentally different from the kind of ‘real life’ that is produced in the city.  One could argue that the kind of ‘real life’ that is produced in the city is that of the heavily invested citizen, engaged in the civic duties of citizenship and urbanism, and increasingly conscious of the social and political values that are entwined with the economic. The kind of material that is produced in the city is that of millions and millions of citizens engaged in a ‘process’ that is characterised by constant change, and in a constant relation to each other. The museum, on the other hand, has the power to detect and point to a particular kind of life that is produced in the city, that is responsive to change and that is possible because the city is reproduced in constant movement. It is, in other words, able to detect and mark ‘life’ that is new</text>

In a work entitled ‘On Portoghese Painting’, an exercise in metaphor, Flaubert imagines a young Michelangelo making portentous figures in the margins of his frescoes. The figure of the traveller, he writes, ‘stands for death, for corruption, for everything that moves, and for nothing more than to touch things he does not understand’.2  Portoghese is a classic French painting language that derives from the 1620s.

The drawing is a particularly inept one – almost as bad as the painting – but the point is that the drawing is a particularly inept one. The drawing is a castle, and the painting a painting. But what is a castle today, but an image? The castle and the painting are often juxtaposed, and the juxtaposition of the two is often enough to convince an observer that something is different today. A castle and the painting are sometimes compared, and the fact that the drawing is a castle opens up a door to a different world. A drawing and the painting are images that are intimately related</text>

The omission of any specific reference to the specific collection of objects in the collection is curious, since the collection would presumably include works from a period when Guy Lecat was active. However, the inclusion of a group of objects from the collection in the Biennial’s catalogue raises the question of what sorts of relations between art and non-art forms, between artist and public, are the intended? The answer to this question will presumably inform the way in which the collection is organised and presented in the 2017 catalogue.  One possible direction in which the collection may operate is as a collection of objects, perhaps grouped by city and given a nominal subject heading. This would make the collection both more visible and less mysterious. It would also permit the collection to negotiate its way through a city's real and perceived heritage,</text>

The first published article about Guy Lecat in the Liverpool Biennial’s collection of photographs and videos, for example, is a lament by a single artist, and his words are one long lamentation of the ravages of urban sprawl. His is a lament that is weighted with historical and archival references to a particular period in British art history, but it is almost a declaration of war on contemporary art. He accuses contemporary art of ignoring ‘the essential role of a centre of culture, including the vital role that arts institutions once had in shaping public opinion and legislation’, and he demands that ‘avant garde, compositional art, […] staging, […] staging, […] staging, […] staging, […] staging, […] staging, […] staging and […] staging institutions be formed and founded in his memory’.3 But Guy Lecat</text>

Nor does it mention that Lecat was the subject of numerous investigations and controversies, including one convened by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to the Crisis of Victorian Art (18), including one convened by Dame Janet Smith, who alleged that Lecat was exhibiting Victorian art in a fraudulently inflated or 'glorified' way. The publication of this book coincided with the publication of several other biennials, many of which included biennials of a similar sort – a tendency that continued well into the 1990s – and many of which included biennials of a contemporary variety. Biennialism, then, clearly occupies a position of significant visibility and influence in the United Kingdom and beyond, and the topic of this volume is a natural extension of that visibility</text>

Its subtitle is a play on words: ‘The Biennale of 1924’.10 	The exhibition does not continue with a description of the installation, but the catalogue simply says: ‘This is a work of art’. This is consistent with the brief introduction of the work in the exhibition, in the exhibition, and in the text. The subtitle bears a threat: ‘This is a work of art’. The text is part of a threat, but it is accompanied by a description of the work that unambiguously identifies the art as being that of Lecat.

He was the second in a line of artists, landscape architects and landscape writers, and the son of a prominent Montreal landscape architect. As early as the 1870s, Lecat was developing strategies for the landscape, urging the establishment of ‘landmines’ and the ‘use of physical and mental coercion to suppress resistance to colonisation’.12 In a note that year, he encouraged a second wave of landscape architects and landscape writers to jump into the burgeoning field of landscape architecture, calling it a ‘new breed of landscape’.13 A popularizer of the mining of natural resources, Lecat was a leader of the post-mining economy that sought to exploit the resources of the landscape in ways that left mining behind.14 A landscape architect by trade, he is also known for his occult theorisations and fictional writing.15</text>

He defined ‘post-Impressionism’ as follows:  [T]he resurgence of art and its discontents is the direct result of a sustained and critical reappraisal of the city as a site of habitation, production, and consumption.’[7] And again: ‘the city’––indeed, the culture industry as a whole––is driven by the ‘city as a space of habitation, production, and consumption’.[8] All of these terms are used in a number of places in the context of urbanisation and the biennial. Post-Impressionism and new urbanism were defined as a response to the crisis of culture in the 1970s and the 1980s, in which artistic practices</text>

If I wrote a story that was sympathetic to a community, but also believed me to be a voice of reason within that community, then I compromised my artistic freedom. I took the opportunity to tell a story that was emotionally charged and to provoke a conversation that was as emotionally charged as possible. I took the project on trust that the community would constructively engage with my work, even if I had worked outside the context of their organisation.

I did not have a veto in mind when I made Shelter. I had an obligation as an artist to tell a story that was as emotionally charged and powerful as I possibly could, and to do so in a way that is consistent with the ethos of the organisation I was working for. In order to achieve that, I made a lot of mistakes along the way, and I accept full responsibility for that. However, I also think that perhaps if I had not found myself so preoccupied with the art and the artist I might have found other ways to tell a story that was more emotionally engaging and representative of the community I was working with.My approach to the project was very much influenced by the work of various artists who I have worked with over the years, and although I did not have any formal training in archival or documentary archaeology, the things I wanted to do with my life were already predicated on the notion that I would one day be able to work in a museum. So, I used my position as an artist to find other ways to tell stories than through archival media. I would not say I was naïve or</text>

I did not have a veto in mind when I made Shelter. I had an obligation as an artist to tell a story that was as emotionally charged and thought-provoking as I possibly could. If I could give any Projectionist/Artistic Director an example of a project he/she could develop into a work, it would have to be one that addresses and addresses how we as artists, performers, writers and supporters create such power structures and their impact. It would have to be emotionally impactful because the power structures we create are designed to do that. I could not have imagined how much Shelter would change the world if it was published, and I cannot imagine how it would change my career either. But I did see the writing on the wall at some point during the process. If you are going to be involved in something you have a duty of care that you must instil in the people you are creating that role.

I did not have a veto in mind when I made Shelter. I had an obligation as an artist to tell a story that was as emotionally charged as I possibly could. I wrote a script that met the needs of the community in a way that they would accept, and so I made that piece of writing emotionally charged as well.I also wrote the piece as a podcast, using the term 'shed' to describe the process that the artist and her team went through in order to produce Shelter. Shed is a verb meaning to preserve, protect or act in ways that remind us of the existence and/or importance of things – a sentiment that runs throughout the text. It is used four times in the piece – once in reference to the need for insulation in the building, twice as often as the need for a fire engine. The reference to a 'shedding season' is an echo of a comment made by Francis Galton in response to a question as to whether the word evaporation was appropriate in describing the behaviour of the body in the building. Galton had stated that one should not speak of a 'shelf' or '</text>

I did not have a veto in mind when I made Shelter. I had an obligation as an artist to tell a story that was as emotionally charged as possible, and to do so in a way that would be suitable for publication in a recognised journal or archive. This was perhaps my greatest artistic failure; I made Shelter too emotional, and its reception in the arts world too. I should have made it more evocative of a real-life situation, such as the one unfolding in our borough of Kensington, where housing is scarce, but affordable housing is scarce too, and where the streets are empty and empty as a result. Shelter became an icon of the forgotten and homeless, and the story of MCH had such a power. But as artists we have a unique and ethical responsibility to tell our story authentically and constructively, and not as a narrative chosen by and for a community of artists.John SoaneJohn Soane is an independent photographer born and brought up in Belfast.

And I did that in a way that was authentic to the place and time of my origin, but also in a way that was relevant and engaging. I did not want to be an artist writing about people or places that are part of a larger social structure that is deeply flawed but also wants to be an artist creating art that is part of that system.In order to be considered culturally relevant and accomplished by the Arts Council of Scotland, a project or a work of art had to be published in a recognised journal or archive. And as I saw from the Arts Council of Scotland website, this was a critical metric: their journal metro required 500 copies to be printed and distributed, and their print edition metro required 2000 copies to be sold. So a journal had to be a global phenomenon. Journal publishing became an important way in which the Arts Council of Scotland connected with readers and made projects</text>

I did not have a veto in mind when I made Shelter. I had an obligation as an artist to tell a story that was as emotionally charged and dramatic as possible. I did not set out to do a David and Goliath story, or to render an entirely mythical and fictitious landscape into something that could be taken seriously. I set out to tell a story about two artists who were asked to make a site-specific contribution to a community project by bringing together a mix of local art and architecture, and about the politics and cultures of community architecture. I was not making a David and Goliath story; nor was I trying to.But I did want to think about the ways in which the project connected to the broader art world, and the way in which the Arts Council or the Biennial might wish to collaborate with an artist in such a project. There were of course also other interests that were more aligned with my own.I felt that the intimacy and resonance of the project was enhanced by the fact that it was being done in vernacular English, as opposed to the traditional Welsh, Gaelic or Scottish terms.   </text>

I also thought that the work I was doing with the Biennial of Edinburgh was very much an artistic one and that the impact it would have on the arts-education sector in Edinburgh was a very good thing. In fact, I continued to do work for the Biennial of Edinburgh as a Curator until my own departure from the organisation in 2014.My interest in community design went back years before the advent of the Community Arts movement. It was a way of saying to artists: here are the questions that need to be asked of you within the context of a community that is capable of giving you creative solutions. It wasn’t just arts and crafts, but questions about what kinds of engagement can be built into a community, about how that can be supported and about how that can be replicated. Chaired by Joasia Krysa and Rob Clarke, the Community Arts conference took place between 1981 and 1986 at which the curators</text>

That is, of course, if the curator is prepared to include those who do not fit the model of the human being in the interests of the art world either because they are not human or because they do not fit the world of art world paradigms.I have made the mistake of thinking that because I had commissioned a project from the Arts Council of Scotland or the Arts Council of Wales or the Biennial of Edinburgh, I automatically belonged to a community or community organisation and could therefore demand a project be published in a recognised journal or archive. Some might argue that an Arts Council of Scotland or the Biennial of Edinburgh would never sanction such a project because it would contradict their statutory representation, but then one would also need to find a way of vetoing such a project. I did not have a veto in mind when I made Shelter. I had an obligation as an artist to tell a story that was as emotionally charged and powerful as I possibly could. I thought I owed it to the community to know the truth, so I told the story in the most honest way I could muster. I thought it would be easy to portray people in a simplistic way – a few bigots murdering another bigoted bigot for being different – but the realisation for me was far more painful and destabilising. I didn’t invent the ugly face of housing, but the fact that people were still dying in the streets because they couldn’t afford a roof or a fire, or because their houses were unsafe or had mould growing on them, was hugely distressing. The fact that people still needed to be housed was another reason to revisit the project. I thought it would be great to revisit Shelter as a project through which we could actually do something about it, rather than as something that will always happen in Harlech. But the reality is that we can’t. Because there simply aren’t</text>

I did not have a veto in mind when I made Shelter. I had an obligation as an artist to tell a story that was as emotionally charged and as politically charged as I possibly could. I wrote the script myself; it was a true to life take on things like abortion and euthanasia. It made sense to me at the time. Now, almost a decade later, I understand why. That first draft was so raw and vulnerable. You could almost see the desperation in the artist’s work at that stage. You could almost see the way that her desperation was aroused by the circumstances of her own personal situation. But her creative arm, fuelled by the moment, pulled her through that raw moment of vulnerability. She wrote the song, the poem and the video in the face of everything, while the rest of us suffered through the bureaucratic red tape. She created an environment in which the artist could create that moment again and again – in a different form, but one that represents the same story. She created a framework in which the artist could inhabit that same space of creating and experiencing that was missing.That is to say, she</text>

Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including in the collection of art and art-historical images that are now housed in the National Gallery. As a result, the biennial has had to develop a unique curatorial approach to be recognisable outside the galleries, while the other curatorial tendencies, including museums, have had to produce similar levels of content in order to be taken seriously in their local communities. As the biennial has grown, so has its image, and its image-making has become a multibillion-dollar business. The collection, while it may not always be perfect, is an excellent repository of images, and its image-production has become one of the most important aspects of the business. The collection is a rich vein, containing images from many different worlds, with images from places where images rarely leave the cultural soil. Given the right mix of subject and image, a picture can be made very powerful. For instance, the collection of Van Gogh's works in the National Gallery is a powerful image, but</text>

The biennial as a curatorial approachThe biennial as an art collection has been curatorialised in many ways, but its greatest and most pervasive influence has been the collection and circulation of images on a massive scale. Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including when they are graphic, powerful, provocative, sad or just plain ugly. In these ways, biennials have been able to morph and mutate through their history. The collection and image would still be there, but the major sources of information and the means of accessing information would be many miles away. Much like the collection and image of a painting, the collection and image of the biennial today is a last resort. It is a place of concealment, concealment by geographical or economic impossibility, and sometimes even of necessity. It is a place where art is often marginalised, which is to be expected in a metropolis with such global images everywhere. It is a place where art is often fetishised, which is to be expected in a metropolis where artists and art-historians flock, and where biennials are products of their times.In this way, biennials can be seen to be products of their times, and the collections that emerge from this process.</text>

Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including in the ways in which they are packed, transported, organised, used and misused. While images can be powerful, they are not sufficient to conjure a specific experience or thought. A biennial needs to be an experience, something more, and something better. A major part of what makes the biennial curatorial is the collection and circulation of images. It is this treasury that constitutes the biennial, but it is also the collection and circulation that generates the biennial as a whole. The biennial must be places where images from many different places can converge in a common space to form a new ‘imaginary bond’ and create a new kind of ‘city’. It must be places where images from many different worlds can come together in a common space to form an ‘imaginary community’ and thereby create a new kind of ‘city’.

The biennial as a curatorial approachThe biennial as an art collection has been curatorialised in many ways, but its greatest and most pervasive influence has been the collection and circulation of images on a massive scale. Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including in the collection and image circulation that generates what we can call ‘the urban image’.1   Image circulation in the biennial has become the leading cause of motion in the cultural landscape, and urban transformation has come at critical moments. As a collection of images, the biennial is a living document of the city, exhibiting, narrating, and ultimately documenting the culture of the city as a whole. It collects, narrates, and documents, and represents to a great extent what it sees, hears etc. in its exhibitionary form. In this sense, the biennial becomes, or should be able to become, more like a museum: capable of surviving in its present form as an archive of the city, and capable of intervening in and influencing ‘the urban image’.2   Art and curatorial action in the city have recently begun to converge on two very specific points in the city: the Westin Hotel and the Arsenale. Although the Westin</text>

The biennial as a curatorial approachThe biennial as an art collection has been curatorialised in many ways, but its greatest and most pervasive influence has been the collection and circulation of images on a massive scale. Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including in how we perceive and represent them (see section 4 below). Understanding this colossal image-collecting habit seems essential for a biennial to be responsive to the changes that we can collectively identify as ‘the Anthropocene’. We need to understand the ways in which a biennial can fail to see the forest for the trees it is making efforts to support. A number of factors combine to make a biennial a failure, but here we focus on just two: the first is the colossal amount of energy required to support the art and culture it is trying to represent; the second is the cumulative effects of that art and culture being stored and circulated on a global scale. The biennial needs to be able to detect signs of this growing infrastructure, so that it can plan accordingly. The art collector in me wants to know what art will be like when it is needed, rather than what it is trying to conceal. When the biennial is as globally visible as Twitter is today, it</text>

The biennial as a curatorial approachThe biennial as an art collection has been curatorialised in many ways, but its greatest and most pervasive influence has been the collection and circulation of images on a massive scale. Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including in the collection that we call the biennial. The collection and the biennial have been entwined, and the collection is the locus of the most significant influence on the biennial. In many ways, the biennial is the prototype of the collection and the biennial follows its muse. The biennial has its images, its collection, its image and video collections, and its virtual collection of images. The collection and the biennial both have their images that are assembled from many different images. In a way, the collection and the biennial are the same. They are made up of images from many different perspectives, and they both use the same image or image from many different images. But the extent to which this image is an image of the same image or image from many different perspectives is what sets them apart. And the collection is the locus of the most significant influence on the biennial. The biennial as a curatorial gestureMany curators have adopted the collection and</text>

The biennial as a curatorial approachThe biennial as an art collection has been curatorialised in many ways, but its greatest and most pervasive influence has been the collection and circulation of images on a massive scale. Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including in the collection of a biennial. The biennial as a collection has, until relatively recently, been the most dominant and visible form of art museum in the city, and the image remains the dominant medium through which images from many positions in history and society enter the cultural sphere. As a curatorial gesture, the biennial has often been able to stretch its image-collection outside the museum, between the lines of its walls. In the 1980s and 1990s, the collection and image was accentuated in the form of a ‘big brother’ that monitored the city in much of Asia.  At its best, the collection invited a certain complacency regarding the way in which art was collected and represented in the city. By the early 2000s, the collection and image was starting to be seen as a more significant threat to the museum, which was beginning to perceive the collection as a more significant source of artistic content.

The biennial as a curatorial approachThe biennial as an art collection has been curatorialised in many ways, but its greatest and most pervasive influence has been the collection and circulation of images on a massive scale. Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including when they are graphic, powerful, or instructive (as in the case of biennials such as Liverpool, Leeds and Tate Modern and Gettysburg). The collection and its images has always been the largest possible component of the biennial, and continues to be so. The biennial has a particular curatorial agenda, and its images and collections are the largest possible form of what it means to be a biennial. The biennial has a particular relationship to the city and its image, and its images matter. The biennial is a collection of images, and its images matter. The collection and its images matter in many ways that are not restricted to what is normally considered a collection, such as when they are a visual language, when they are organized around themes of the moment, when they signal a moment (e.g. the Palestinian intifada) or a place (e.g. the Occupy movement).

Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including in the collection and circulation of images that results from a biennial. The biennial with its images of all varieties of humanity, and of all kinds of cultures, has become the leading locus of contemporary global culture. It is true that the cultural values, ideologies and political orientations of the past are still relevant, and that we are affected by them in large ways today. But the biennial has become the locus of significant current social, political and cultural change, and is therefore in many ways the most accurate depiction of the world we inhabit. The biennial is no longer the dominant cultural collection and it is indeed true that the number of books published in the first quarter of next year will be very different from what we got in the first quarter of this year. But the fact that the biennial will publish many more books than the previous record holder, the New York Museum of Art, will undoubtedly increase the cultural value of the exhibitionary form.

Images matter, and images matter in many ways, including in the ways in which they are used, used and recycled. And they matter in ways that are consistent, global and continue to be reshaped by the life and culture of the city. For cities to fully immerse themselves in this art of becoming, over time, are two things that need to happen: (1) the collection and circulation of images needs to happen on a massive scale, and (2) the biennial as a collection and circulation of images need to exist in a deep and continuous form. Without these elements, the biennial would still be a collection of images, images of images, of images. But they are everywhere, and they are images everywhere. They are embedded in the fabric of the city, and as a curatorial tool, the biennial has become much more than a collection of images. It is an image museum.Curatorial tendencies in the biennialIt is common for curators, artists, and arts administrators to have a kind of tripart</text>

The success of the Biennial in Los Angeles depended on its ability to foster a network of contacts and collaborations, and the ability of the organisers to mesh different forms of experience and knowledge. The Biennial in Lisbon also depends on its ability to create a unique place – hosting a symposium, introducing a new art curator or organising a long-term curatorial study of a particular area. The organisers of the Biennial in Lisbon have set up a city-wide open house, inviting any community member with a biennial project to join them. The Biennial in Lisbon has also commissioned a community of artists, curators, architects, landscape architects, landscape writers and artists’ associations to develop a ‘strengthening mission statement’ for the city, drawing on the ideas and practices of the previous century. The development of the statement is the site of much debate and speculation, with much of the community of artists, architects, landscape architects, landscape writers and artists in the city actively participating in the process</text>

The success of an organisation is its ability to share and to move quickly, so this conference seemed like a space for a diverse range of organisations to be present, but also for different ways of organising themselves. For instance, the NOMADIC, which is short for National On-Migration and Migration into Art International, is a worldwide organisation founded in 1980 to promote art and cultural exchange. It is made up of over 300 member museums, galleries, public galleries and underground art fairs across many countries. It has been involved in public programmes around the world for over twenty years, and its main international programmes take place in East and Central Europe. It is a network organisation, with branches in many countries, operating independently throughout the world. 	The number of artists and curators attending the conference increased from the original twenty, to over 50, and the number of publications sold increased from one to two.

The success of the Biennale as an organisation was also built on multiple previous accruals of influence – accumulated over decades, and especially through the long-term relationships that artists had with the city. There was a palpable sense of camaraderie at the conference – people exchanging ideas, strategies and techniques. The only problem was how to put this into practice. The answer to that challenge is a question that conference participants found themselves asking themselves repeatedly: how do I get the word out? What was the success rate? How do I engage the user? How do I get funding? How do I put events together? How do I get the word out?   The answer to the last was most likely going to be the department of painters, because that was where the money was at, and so the user was often left out in the cold. But the success of the conference as an organisation depended on a succession of important policy debates, debates that continued to be waged within the Biennale itself</text>

The success or failure of an artist’s project in such a dense urban setting depends on a great deal of subtle and more obvious political, economic and cultural factors. The success or failure of an organisation's programme in such a dense urban setting depends on a great deal of subtle and more obvious economic and social factors as well. The Camden Arts Festival, which ran for the first three years of its existence in the 1990s, was an example of an organisation that was able to build a strong base of support from local residents and community organisers while also engaging artists and creating a public space where people could come to engage with the arts in a way that the city could sustain. 	The question of community, however, remains hugely relevant for the development of social and spatial democracy in the UK and globally. The biennial as a space remains elusive, both in the USA and in cities such as Camden, New Jersey, where the biennial has often been a point of friction. Much like the social and political</text>

The success of the biennial depends on its organisational flexibility, and whilst this flexibility may be necessary in certain contexts, in a broader sense it is a strength. The ability to intervene early in a project (in the past when the biennial was largely a waiting game) and to intervene later (in the new biennial context) is a strength. The ability to sustain an artistic and collaborative process (even when this process is politically-charged) is a strength. The biennial is about to enter a period of centralisation – a time when new curators are likely to be brought in from outside the organisation – and whilst this may be the case in other contexts, the biennial as an organisation is moving towards a position of great reliance on data, which is to some extent a by-product of the digital revolution. In these and other ways, the biennial is becoming ever more institutionalised, and ever more like other artworld formations: ever more reliant on a particular type of art-hist</text>

The success of the Biennale in other respects may be judged by how well it can disseminate its content and make shared experiences possible. For some, this may have involved responding to the biennial as a physical space in which art could be found, rather than the other way around: the media of the biennial. For Peter Osborne, this may have meant working with local heritage organisations to create a series of performances, one of which would be a walk down the waterfront of the harbour, with the artist-organiser creating a temporary public space in the middle of the water. Such a project may well have been more politically risky, but it was motivated by the need to respond to the impact that the declining number of art biennials was having on the city. The number of biennials in the city has declined by half since 1990, making it the most densely populated urban area in Canada. There are now over 200 biennials in Toronto, but their programming is almost entirely dictated by the</text>

The programme of exhibitions, symposia, docent-led programmes and festival-like events planned for the city over the next ten years is a reflection of this intention. It is a new beginning, and a chance to build a birthing of knowledge and partnerships, not just as individuals, but as a network of sharing.  	The NOMADIC conference itself represents a new beginning for the organisation. In many ways, the conference represents a turning point in the history of the biennial – when, in the past, this was the only space for the artist/organisation to operate in the city. Not all of the speakers at the conference were new to the organisation, but the sheer volume of material produced, their talk-like pace, the fluid flow of ideas and the fluid dynamics of their location and interaction with the city all lent themselves to the production of many different forms of organisation. The success of the biennial depends on strong institutional engines of exchange – financial, legal and cultural – that can monitor and dictate how much is produced, distributed and communicated in the city. The biennial as a social process is closely tied to the development of the legal and financial systems capable of regulating and mapping such activity. The biennial is an appearance, a shared space for the occasion, but it is also an expression and an outcome of a political and social trajectory. In November 2016, the 10th Session of the International Biennial Network was held in Shanghai. The network was fractured into three parts: (1) the city, (2) the biennale, (3) the museum.) The aim of the 10th was to create a shared vocabulary and understanding of the biennial through a series of themed exhibitions, seminars and events. The ‘biennial’ is a global concept, and thus, in this context, the network’s events had to be regional in scope and</text>

The success of the Biennale in London depended on the organisational fluidity of its curators, and the fluidity of its material. The emergence of new ideas and artists entering the Biennale at this point in time depended on the organisational fluidity of its business partners, and so the organisation responded to the biennale’s unpredictable public events with organisational changes. New curators entered the Biennale from the 2011/12 school year, and the Biennale at Tate in the 2014/15 school year. Despite this frequency of introduction, the style of the conference itself remains largely the same. There are significant shifts in material, material used, and new approaches to organising the biennale in London. As a conference, the Biennale serves an important role in the urban-dynamics of the world, and its organisation is an important part of the capitalist city. But the Biennale has to be organised in parallel to other capital flows, and in</text>

The success of the Biennale in London depended in large measure on the willingness of audiences to switch from their audience to the organisers, and vice versa. The production of different forms of organisation in and through the biennial was a constant in the city, and the conference therefore ends up representing both the strengths and limitations of the practice of organisation in the UK at the time. 	The conference was held at the Chiswick Art Gallery, and its purpose was to introduce the art and curatorial team comprised of Owen Kelly (Director, Liverpool Biennial), Peter McCaughey (Curator, Tate Modern), Jess Doyle (Associate Curator, Tate Modern), Maria Kelly (Artistic Director, Liverpool Biennial), Caroline Rowell (Director, Science &amp; Industry Museum), Andrew Davies (Research Director, National Museums Liverpool and the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design), Lisa Paintham (Artistic Director, Liverpool Biennial), Tania</text>

The success of the Biennale as a whole, then, depends on efforts such as these, which enable the artist/organisation to articulate and deliver its ideas across diverse forums and platforms, and which enable the community to join in the conversation. New forms of community organisation are built on the back of these intensive efforts, and this is precisely what the conference represented. The development of critical race theory, for example, is a good example of an institution (biennial) employing a collaborative process to produce a result, and the specific development of critical race theory as a tenet of the Biennale’s social purpose. Race theory is a theory of national difference, developed in Canada and US, and is thought to account for many of the distinctive features of the contemporary condition. It is a theory of difference made intelligently, and which seeks to account for the ways in which national identities shape cultural practices, and how this may account for the observed heterogeneity within cultural landscapes.

The poem appears in part in the book Angels of London (2014), a project curated by Dawn Butler on the behalf of the Liverpool Burial Ground.

The project, funded by the Arts Council and Arts Council Liverpool, produced qualitative footage, mapping the life of an East London gallery and its fleet of temporary exhibitions. The footage was used as part of a research project into the East London Gallery Network (ETSGN), an underground arts community.

In other words, they perform a function beyond their actual uses - performing a function that transcends its actual organisation and functions. One can also argue that these kinds of monumental works</text>

The biennial format was designed to be repeated over and over again, in order to continuously expose different kinds of art to a public with a diverse range of attitudes and experiences. 	Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was also a significant site of articulation. The museum was seen as a site of constant, repetitive repetition, and so there was an implicit commitment to a common, human‐centered mission. In other words, the museum was not just a site of repetition, but actively encouraged to repeat itself. 	Art was a political tool in the service of the museum, and so the biennial’s decisions to focus on an artist or a particular project were often as a result of an artist or a curator already having made a site‐specific, often site‐specifically focused project that they believed was important. Thus, biennials often benefitted from a single institution constructing an entire ‘curatorial agenda’ around a single artwork or a set of images, or a collection of images, or a set of texts, or a combination of the two. 	Art was a political statement, and so the format of the biennial was also an essential site for its expression. It is</text>

The biennial format was designed to be repeated over and over again, in order to continuously expose different kinds of art to a public with a diverse range of attitudes and experiences. 	Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was weakened somewhat by the biennial’s continual reconfiguration, but today it is still the major venue for the exhibition of a major art exhibition. Every art biennial since 2006 has sought to reconcile the museum with the real life – or, as in the case of  	13, 13  	Architecture of New York and San Francisco, the actual life – in the museum, where the biennial is concerned. This is an attempt to do away with the museum as the real point of departure for the new art from being conceived. The new art has to be conceived in terms of the museum. 	Art’s relation to the museum has become increasingly important as a result of the biennial, as well as other curatorial practices, such as curatorial immersion and virtual curation. In the 1980s the museum was the real point of departure for contemporary artists, but in recent decades it has become increasingly important for artists to become immersed in the real life</text>

Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was largely defined by the fact that it was seen as a permanent site of exhibition and recurrence, where the art was always relatable and could be counted on to continue to be there. The biennial format, on the other hand, is an artifact of the fact that art is an ephemeral, epiphenomenal phenomenon that is constantly evolving and subject to myriad kinds of condition, and so its characteristic character is the sharp break that artfirms typically impose between different kinds of experience. 	Art biennials are, in short, places where art can be made visible in a way that is unmediated by the museum, but also in a way that is mediated by the postmodern, postindustrial museum. And this is what biennials are today: they are places where art can be made visible in a way that is both transient and subject to a range of changes, but also in a way that is subject to these very different kinds of change.

Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was primarily defined by its repetition: it served as a physical archive – a physical monument to the art – which allowed artists and curators to continuously revisit the art in a way that was both permanent and open to revisiting. 	Art’s historical tendency towards contemporaneity, then, is partly a by-product of its historical relationship to the museum. Biennials have a physical and social mass, which are fundamentally intertwined. The museum and the artworld are both constituted according to the biennial model. 	Art’s traditional, long-term relationship to the museum is also a by-product of its historical relationship to the urban. Urban forms emerged out of the museum, and the biennial. Art’s wider social function is to communities, and so the urban form emerged as a way for artists to connect with and share experiences with communities. 	The museum, in turn, emerged as a way for artists to experiment with new forms of community, and</text>

In the 1980s, when the biennial was at its height, the ‘biennial’ seemed to mean more to visitors to a particular art museum than to artists and curators who had a significant role in staging the exhibition. Thus, the association between the biennial and the contemporary art museum was strengthened. 	Art biennials were encouraged to combine contemporary art with social, economic and political struggles. This was particularly true in the US, where artistic activism was actively supported by the state. 	Art’s historical role in the contemporary urban environment is to some extent an artifact of the fact that artists had a range of vocabularies, and so the contemporary art museum was born. 	The biennial format was designed to be repeated over and over again, in order to continuously expose different kinds of art to a public with a diverse range of attitudes and experiences. 	Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was fundamentally about the exchange of places and commodities, in a global marketplace of cultures. Contemporary art, by having a global reach, and thus representing the contemporary phenomenon as a global phenomenon, is an art form that has to regularly make new people — artists, curators, collectors, traders and others — out of necessity, as different kinds of art is routinely made, sold and exchanged all around the globe. 	Art’s contemporary predicament is similar. Its historical ephemerality and global circulation make it an ideal form for storing and circulating cultural products, ideas and information. But its present economic and spatial heterogeneity makes it an ideal venue for the exchange of different kinds of art, for artists to engage in activities of a different sort from what is typical of museums and gallery art. Art’s global circulation and its present economic dependence on commodity exchange means that it is frequently depicted and talked about as if it were an industry. But its international character and reach mean that it must compete with other forms</text>

The biennial format was designed to be repeated over and over again, in order to continuously expose different kinds of art to a public with a diverse range of attitudes and experiences. 	Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was by design. Biennials were designed with this in mind, and so the museum as a regularly recurring object that is both constantly on the trail of art’s real activities, and an obstacle in the path of its intended activities. 	Art’s historical relationship to the museum was another reason for its historical scarcity today. Biennials have become institutionalised, and so of course face an increasing number of challenges as an intersting museum-going public. But they also have the advantage of being able to remain independent: independent from their museums, councils, boards etc. They are visible, and so able to engage a wider public that appreciates art from everywhere they go. 	Art’s historic ambivalence towards the museum was another factor. The biennial format demands frequent repair, and art’s historic ambivalence towards the museum was partly about this.

The biennial format was designed to be repeated over and over again, in order to continuously expose different kinds of art to a public with a diverse range of attitudes and experiences. 	Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was primarily defined by the fact that it was a form of popular entertainment, a way to offer exhibitions to meet the artist’s needs, and to make art available for museums to peruse and engage with. As the Nielsen Gallery notes, a biennial is a ‘runtime, ‘meaningless structure that reproduces the history of art’s original conception, making it accessible to repeat viewings year after year, like a museum’s collections. 	Art’s initial social function was to provide a platform for exchange and entertainment. The increasing accessibility of artistic practices and objects allowed a different kind of social agency and agency into the artwork and material. While the art itself––the image, the idea, the idea of the art, and the idea of the art in general––was often used as a way to manipulate and subvert people, the public was also encouraged to exert agency and shape the art and the materiality of the art in various ways. 	</text>

The biennial format was designed to be repeated over and over again, in order to continuously expose different kinds of art to a public with a diverse range of attitudes and experiences. 	Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was also a significant factor in the rise of the biennial, since the museum was seen as a stable house of art and art history. 	The biennial is a multi-year, multi-edition art museum, and so its format reflects the historical relationships between art institutions and art products. 	Art biennials have often been around for many years, and so their institutional memory can be traced back to this historical historic, sometimes difficult-to-define period. 	Today, biennials are the exception, and institutional memory is the rule. But in the 1980s, biennials had a particular character that was, in many ways, almost revolutionary: The biennial. 	The biennial, by definition, must be a ‘repetitive’ form of exhibitions. It’s a regular exhibitionary form that has to be continually repeated because it represents the historical and contemporary importance of the art form in a continuous way. It’s a</text>

Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was also designed to be repeated: the museum as a constantly evolving collection of objects that can be found in art galleries, museums and archives, and reproduced at the biennial level. 	In the 1980s, artists, curators and art historians began to notice a deterioration in the curatorial quality of the art being exhibited, as well as a growing tendency to reduce the significance of the contemporary art produced in the biennial to that produced by museum curators. 	Art’s exhibition of 1984 was a good example of this tendency. Although numerous artists and artists made contributions to the exhibition, the bulk of the art was either re-figuration or litho, and the people who curated it were mostly artists who had exhibited their work at the previous year’s Venice Biennale. 	However, this was just the tip of the iceberg. Over the next two years, artists and artistic organizations from all over the world converged on Venice to bid farewell to the old and</text>

Art’s classical, long-term relationship to the museum was fundamentally defined by its ability to expand and to take on different kinds of cultures, individuals and situations. The biennial format, then, is a system through which different kinds of art are brought together in the same space, bringing together art from different times and places, in a given context. It is a space for a particular kind of culture to emerge, and this kind of ‘biennial’ was intended to last for a very long time. 	Art’s historical relationship to the museum was also deeply influenced by the institution that came to be known as ‘the Biennial’: a reference to the first American museum dedicated to the exhibition of art by transnational associations; and to this, we can add the English museum, established in 1884, the first museum of international exhibitions, and the first museum of contemporary art. All these museums, and many more like them, were established to deal with specific kinds of art, and in that order. The word �</text>
