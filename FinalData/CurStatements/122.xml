    The next Liverpool Biennial, due to open in 2017, will be an eclectic mix of new and old artists, writers and curators taking over the space of the museum, from the Chisenhale Gallery and Granby Four Streets to Anfield and the Granby Triangle area. The project, which was first mooted as a city-wide movement in 2014, was then given the go-ahead by the then mayor, who cynically sought to cash in on the project by selling off the cultural value in exchange for demolition. The project was put on hold due to a lack of investment, but the mayor has now returned with a bang – announcing a whopping £1 billion bid to create a new £50 billion urban centre solely for the benefit of the financial elite. If built, the proposed ‘Great Art Mall’ would significantly expand the geographical reach of Liverpool, dwarfing all previous attempts to incorporate the city into the globalised capitalist economy.Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be the art’

The goal is to create a ‘permanent, integrated, transitory, community’ through a ‘beam of light’ that illuminates the surrounding area with ‘60,000 LEDs’, a combination of passive and active control elements that react to the urban environment with controlled emission of heat and light. The project was designed by Juergen Teller, Steve Sitwell, Moira Kenny and is being spearheaded by Architects and Engineers Special Projects Branch (BEBR) and the Biennial itself. Liverpool Biennial 2016 will be held at the former Park Palace theatre site in December and January 2017. While the Biennial will be staging its ‘big moment’ at the venue, the artists will be moving their studios to new premises elsewhere in the city. The city itself will play host to a number of mini-exhibitions, including the photography exhibit</text>

The main event will see artists, curators, art historians, art writers and artists chosen by the biennial commission take the Tate Modern Award for Excellence in Art, Design and Design. The 2016 Biennale will be the largest ever to be held in Britain, overtaking even the Venice Biennale as the most prestigious international art institution. It will also be the most expensive ever to be held in Britain, surpassing even the art institution’s most extravagant public offerings. The retail price tag for a work in the event is set to reach over $1 billion. </text>

The other half of the cultural property will be squatted on the other side of the globe. That’s right, the other half of the cultural property will be squatted on the other side of the world, specifically in East Asia. The fact that the project was put on hold while the rest of the world caught a break suggests that the project has somehow become something that is both culturally relevant and geopolitically convenient for the city. That’s not to say that there aren’t cultural clashes going on in the world right now – there’s a real war going on in the Middle East between various Shia/Sunni fundamentalist movements – but the fact that the project was put on hold while the rest of the world caught a break suggests that the project has somehow become something that is both culturally relevant and geopolitically convenient for the city.

The city will once again be a staging ground for artistic exploration, debate and contestation, as well as the site of potential conflicts. The various projects will find a home in a publicly accessible building, alongside the city’s myriad other urban problems. The only difference this time will be that artists will be paid to work in zones 0–4 of the city, rather than in the military zone. The goal of the project is to create a ‘cultural district within which all creative endeavours … can be located’.’ While the city may now be awash with skyscrapers and financial machine, it is also becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a future for oneself or one’s place in the world. This is particularly true for young people – whose growing up years are marked by encounters with both financial and office-</text>

But at the same time, we’ll also need to be asking how the art can impact the city in ways beyond displaying its work, and beyond becoming more value, culturally and economically speaking. What does it mean to ‘present’? How do we begin to think about these complex questions? This book is a starting point, a starting‐point that hopefully leads to a deeper understanding of what the art world can and cannot do, in and through cities. The term ‘present’ has many senses of meaning, and rightly so: it describes what has happened in the present, and conveys the sense of time standing in for space. In that sense, it captures the episodic, durational character of the historical and contemporary condition of the city, and its episodic and contemporaneous moments of emergence and decline. But it’s also a</text>

It will be an exhibition of ideas, produced in part through dialogue with local residents and art professionals, and curated by Dame Helen Smith in partnership with The Bluecoat. The exhibition will be a ‘land and sky’ of contrasting textures, rich with colour, contrasting patterns and textures, from the city’s skyline to the doorstep of Anfield. It will be an utterly bizarre and beautiful place, but also a place of conflict and conflict. The sky will be the limit. But in the end, what really defines a place, and makes it a place, is what happens below. That’s what we do here at Liverpool Biennial – we try to get our cultural value embedded in the very fabric of the city. We do this through dialogue, engagement and sometimes conflict. But we also have our cultural values that are actually built into our city, and that we actively work to create and enhance, through</text>

The works will be assembled into an ‘assembly line’ that will see artists employed in various capacities, providing assembly for the workers’ families and communities that will be transformed by the projects. The project will see over 1,000 community members taking part in the production of the projects, which will be performed in venues ranging from community centres to major museums and galleries. The assembly line will see artists employed in a collaborative process through which topics addressed by the community will be considered, and a final decision will be made on the best candidates through a competitive tender process. The projects will be delivered as annual financial support for community groups, educational work, awareness raising and debate.

Although the event itself will be located in and around Anfield, visitors to the museum-type format will encounter many of the same issues and events that characterised the city that year, including the legacy of racialised violence and a curfew imposed on the city centre. The museum-type format will see progressive design practices adopted across the board, from the shopping centre to the city’s historic docks, which in turn, will host a range of different projects ranging from street parties to education projects, including those relating to housing, employment, community and arts spaces. The ability to perceive change in processes leading up to and during the riots will be explored, while the museum-type format will see artists developing and testing out new strategies to address the current tensions.

This was already evident in the opening salvos of the art fair, when artists and art dealers flocked to the city to bid on works – many of which were immediately put up for auction. The fact that the exhibition would be curated by a woman, New Delhi-based artist Mallika Dutt, who had also curated the Venice Biennale and was well versed in urban issues, was seen as a huge plus by art buyers and curators alike. Dutt, however, was not the only one with a manifesto of sorts written in defence of the city.  The Cultural Mumbai of India, a citizen's journalism project started by a woman in her mid‐20s, documents systemic sexism and racialisation in the city.  Aamir Khan, one of the curators of the Liverpool Biennial, wrote a book in 2014 about his experiences in the city, The Empty Hearse.  Acknowledging that his book was</text>

We’ve all felt the loss of meaning and mystery from the adoption of this narrative, but now we’re in a position to begin to read it, to begin to understand it. This is a huge opportunity for us as artists to participate in this narrative, to contribute meaning to this narrative, to become involved in a larger conceptual scheme, but also to experience the loss of meaning and mystery that comes with not knowing or not knowing enough about the city. This is a crucial moment in the history of the Biennial, because it allows us to begin to read the changes that are occurring in the narrative of the exhibitionary tradition in this city, and it allows us to begin to comprehend the affect these changes are having on the city.

LR: We’ve all heard the narrative of the ten episodes, and collectively it’s something like 500. It’s a global narrative. It’s an idea that’s prevalent in a way that few people in the world really get, and that contributes to the sense of something magical and magical about the city.  You can start with the Birkbeck Institute, which is a globally recognised non-profit research centre on the waterfront, and which has been publishing its work at the Liverpool Biennial for many years. It was an important player in the 1990s when the Biennial was founded, and it remains a leader in the biennial’s contemporary audience.  London’s Royal Festival of Art is the only remaining practitioner of a practice that began in the early twentieth century, with artists finding a way to simultaneously operate within and experiment with the urban environment. The importance of this remains under-studied, although the biennial’s historical trajectory suggests a possible engagement with the social.  The ten-year plan for</text>

LR: We’ve all heard the narrative of the ten episodes, and collectively it’s a familiar arc of loss, anger, despair, loss, anger, loss, anger, loss, anger, and loss. But what usually happens in these ten episodes is a very specific set of skillset that was acquired, or is at least learnt. In order to become recognisable, or at least understood, a story has to be told. And in order to become understood by a storyteller, a story has to be connected to something concrete and present in a real way. Otherwise, the audience doesn’t catch on. The key to understanding a story is in its abstraction. You need to understand the story as a way of understanding what’s happening in the world of which it’s a part. Without that kind of understanding, our understanding of the world around us would be confined to our own small part of the story. In order to achieve that kind of understanding, a story needs power and resources. And so, when you do a retrospective</text>

It’s been a while since we last spoke with the audience, so we need to find a way to come to terms with this. I think it’s a question of identity. When you’re creating a narrative, you’re placing something in focus, and placing something into context. The narrative that emerged from the ten episodes, and their voices, is what we tell ourselves and others. It’s our narrative, and we have to be the protagonists of it. We have to tell a compelling narrative that people find compelling. That’s why – to achieve this, we’ve had to invest a great deal of energy and time making it real and convincing people that it’s ours, and that it’s happening, and that we’re the dominant narrative.

And so it’s with interest and trepidation that we begin to tell this story in different ways: as a play, a story told by a group of people over time, a narrative that emerges from different points of view, or a particular narrative that emerges through a particular point of view. We do this in order to explore and perhaps create a space for another narrative to emerge. This is a narrative that is richer and more complicated and requires more thought and care. It is also a narrative that has less place in our present historical narrative and cultural context. This may occur in the future, when we leave the city and come home to the countryside, but in the present it’s a fixed point of view. It’s a narrative</text>

But there were also episodes that we hadn’t heard of, and those were marked by certain aesthetic imperatives. It’s very easy to identify an aesthetic need today: there’s a crisis of identity; we’re subjecting ourselves to huge amounts of media culture; and we see ourselves in the media, and we see our world through the media. There’s a tendency today to demarcate the political and economic as if they were aesthetic needs, which is absurd, since today’s society is made up of millions of individuals operating independently of each other. The challenge today is to create an aesthetic that emerges from the various layers of society, and that does so through multiple mediums, both physical and virtual. That’s why you need a biennial, today: to achieve this through art alone, and not just to get rich quick. The</text>

LR: We’ve all heard the narrative of the ten episodes, and collectively it’s a familiar one. We’ve all experienced it at some point or another. But the interesting thing is to see how the “transmission” has come to define the narrative of the city in the 21st century.  LBP.com 	Having encountered the strange and wonderful world of the internet several years before, I could understand the fascination of the local people for the idea of a museum that would house all the stories that they could fit into a single museum. In these early internet days, no one would ever set up such a museum, because it would be seen as a radical intrusion. But the fascination of the local people for this very idea is what gives the museum its character – its strangeness – and frees it from the constraints of modern artifice and bourgeois curatorial fetishism. The museum becomes something that is not present in a physical or conceptual sense – something that is both present and absent at the same time.  LBP.com</text>

LocalDict 	In these episodes, we’ve introduced elements of the story of the episodic that are not necessarily representative of the larger narrative structure of the “Transmission”, but that nevertheless fit within it. We've used a number of publishing houses in the process, and the serialised nature of the book allows us to build up a story over several issues or even several issues in parallel.

But what we discovered was that the city was a node in itself, and that ‘place’ was only ever a partial node. There were other nodes around the city, nodes where cultural institutions and tourism came to anchor. And these were those nodes, the ‘placeholder’ – these were the sites where the architecture of the city would grow in relation to the culture and tourism that’s happening at the moment. So we began to see ‘place’ as an object, and the ‘city’ as a partial and variable node. This is exactly what we did with L’agenda 21. We placed it in the context of other exhibitions that we had curated around the world at the same time, and also in relation to other exhibitions that we were doing in the city at the time – essentially placing it in a multiplicity of different exhibitions year on year. This is what we did with Venice in 2009. We did this in order to create a contest among artists – a competition about their</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was a node in a much broader ‘network’ of nodes, each with its own ‘origin story’ and subsequent ‘path of emergence’. Each node was characterised by its own episodic and dialectical ‘time-critical’ node, which we can now name the ‘Biennale Centres’ (based on our observations and inferences from the conference). ‘Centres’ are the architectural exemplars that articulate a network’s hierarchical structure, and through ‘nodes’ we can deduce ‘eries’ of nodes within the network.’ This sort of hierarchical structure is characteristic of ‘horizontal’ infrastructures, but it is also characteristic of the condition of urbanization in general. Urban infrastructures are typically located in the periphery of the city, where their spatial and temporal nature makes them the preferred setting for large-scale, often multimodal public and private</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was a node surrounded by other nodes – in effect, that the biennale was located in an urban ring around itself. ‘Nodes’ are the nodes of a larger structure, and ‘rings’ are the nodes of a smaller ring. So, the ring around the city referred to the ring around the biennale. But what we found even closer to home was the ring that connected the two cities – the ring of commerce that enveloped the city and generated immense volumes of investment for the biennale’s production costs. In other words, the ring that connected the two cities was not the city but the ring of commerce. And this is what we mean when we talk about ‘places of exchange’: places of exchange between two people or people of two different kinds of beings, things of many kinds, whose exchange is mediated by things, by the given and by the impossible.’6   	But how, then, to account for</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was only one node in a much larger ‘geographical network’ that also included features such as coastline, mountains, rivers and towns. Along the coast, there was also a growing ‘geographical memory’ associated with the phenomenon of climate change, which made it into something more ‘persistent’ with the biennale as a global phenomenon. This memory manifested itself as sea-level rise, which in turn was thought to be a global phenomenon. We discovered that the biennale’s real ‘roots’ are in fact in the cities. So we saw that the cities were the real sites of the exhibition, and that the cities were the sites of the exhibition – in a global, ‘metainterface’ kind of way. But the real locus of the exhibition was also found in the metainterface – in the form of climate change, and its links to sea-level rise – and this was seen as a global</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was a node in a much broader, far more dynamic ecological system that included the islands of the Pacific, as well as an increasing number of other places of the world. The Pacific Islands are the core of the ‘geographical unit’ of the ecological system: there’s Hawaiʻi, which has its own set of laws and regulations governing the movement of people and goods, and which is particularly well-suited to the growth of the biennale’; and of course, the islands have their own set of environments and cultural histories. So we began to see ‘place’ much more as a spatial category, and the city as a node in that system. In fact, we began to see cities as nodes in a much broader, far more dynamic ecological system that includes the islands of the Pacific. Today, ‘place’ is the primary spatial category for the biennale, but knowledge continues to play an ever-increasing role in urbanization</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was only one node among many nodes. Other nodes had their own uses and priorities, and the city as a node within the node cluster was only one among many nodes within the cluster. For many nodes in the city, the rise of the biennale meant nothing more than the maintenance of order and decorum. But for a number of those same people, the rise of the biennale was the occasion on which to launch all manner of new cultural practices and discourses, to embark on a ‘war on tourism’, to delegitimize the tourism industry by branding it an ‘invention’, and to institutionalize a new form of urbanization, one in which the city plays no more role than the biennale venue might once have.How do we know this? Because we did a survey of a number of cultural stakeholders in Lisbon. We asked them about their knowledge of the biennale, and also of art in general, and of course, of course</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was a node with many nodes, and each node was a junction for many junctions. So we found ourselves wondering where the art was located, and how the art was distributed. We also wondered how the art was generated, and whether it was the work of many artists working as a team, or whether it was the art of a single artist or an ensemble of artists. And we discovered that the latter was far more prevalent, because the biennale is a ‘niche event’, and because the art was displayed at such a high level at the conference. So we decided to investigate this phenomenon more deeply, to see if there was any interconnection between the biennale and the city, between the biennale and the city as a whole. We found that there was a great deal of interconnectivity, but it would be foolish to assume that the biennale was immune from the effects of this urbanization. We found that the biennale had to be physically</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was a node in a much broader, much more dynamic and dynamic interconnectedness of nodes. And these nodes were placed throughout the world, and especially in the cities. And this node ‘city’ is no longer the initial premise of the exhibition, since many of the exhibition’s curatorial gestures have moved away from this initial premise. And this is what we mean by ‘global ecology’.1. The concept of place has come to represent an idealised form of idealised history, where the cities once again assume a dominant role. However, this time the cities are not idealised; they are brought to bear in the quest for sustainability and equity through a system of economic exchange that is no longer based on the exchange of commodities (including humans) but instead relies on the exchange of place.  In contemporary terms, this implies that ‘place’ is no longer the object of scientific and literary theorization, but that humans have turned its core characteristic – the exchange</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was a node, and not just a node, with a humongous periphery. The city is a node at the edge of a huge object, and the periphery is a node at the center of a huge constellation. The constellation is a node at which nodes converge, and so on. But what we found even in the biennale itself — which is located in such a way as to be globally visible — was that it was also anchored in the city, and so the ‘global’ dimension was central to the idea of ‘inhabitation’. The world that we see around us is produced by things that we can only see as ‘external’; this is why biennials often claim to be places that awaken consciousness. But when we wake up to the world around us, we tend to see only what we’d like to see: only in terms of what we want to believe is actually there. And so we’re constantly waking up</text>

But what we discovered was that the city was a node in a much broader ‘paradigm shift’ that was occurring all around us. The biennale had entered a new ‘mode of chronic irregularity’, as David Harvey would say soon after the conference began. We noticed that the level of our self-examination began to vary. We started to be open to new questions. Questions that are not rooted in the established order and that demand a response.For example, the question, ‘What is it like to be an urban resident of L.A.?' presents us with a set of questions that are too numerous to answer adequately in a blog post. We chose to dedicate one of our many blogs to the topic, because it is a particularly moving one to speak of in the city. We think it captures the essence of the question and the sense of the questioner. But we can’t put into words the feelings or experiences of living in the city, nor the depths of the pain and</text>

The other ten artists were Adam Connolly, Susan Rankin, Patricia McKee and Deborah Richter. The Biennial format is very different from the Museum of Modern Art style, in which curatorial directions are more interested in the preservation of historical objects than the development of contemporary art. The reason is that the museum is interested in the development of art as a practice, while the Biennial tends to intervene at the level of culture. So the relevance of the Biennial in the 2000s was that it was there to be learnt by learning and so it gave the impression of an ever-widening canon of European, American and other art from different times and places</text>

The project came together in time for the Biennale to be staged in 2007, but it was a complete surprise for the local community when the Biennale went ahead and re-opened with a residency programme in 2009. What struck the Biennale as a great injustice was that the artists who created the Biennale experiences, produced and delivered them in ways that were authentic to the locality. The Biennale chose to rely on a series of coincidences and idiosyncrasies, rather than design strategicities, to set itself up as an event in the city. The Biennale was set up with a series of artists’ residencies, which it continues to do, although these days it is more interested in the support of a studio head, rather than the curatorial thinking that allows for the creation</text>

All the artists lived in a neighbourhood of artist-run community centres. Some were based in different cities, but the focus was on the same themes and practices. The artists delivered their works primarily in 2011, but there was some overlap. The biennial format meant that these artists had a second chance to explore the city and work with community groups. Some artists returned to the area after the project, while many others didn’t. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty how an artist would react to an urban neighbourhood, but there are some patterns that can be recognised.

The aim was to explore the ways in which artists could work with local communities to transform their neighbourhoods, and the way that art could function as a property (leases, buy-sums, cooperatives, cooperatives, cooperative housing, community gardens, youth clubs, art schools…). The programme was informed by the Community Land Trust initiative launched in 1995 by the Arts Council, who funded some of the earliest work in the area. Since then, a community land trust has been set up with the Community Land Trust Board to manage and develop the land. The way in which art is re-const</text>

The museum branch was shut in 2016, but the Residency Programme was relaunched as a museum-funded programme with the Community Arts Trust, and the biennial schedule followed suit.  As the Biennale approached its ten year anniversary in 2017, the Community Arts Trust decided to reclaim the governance of the Biennale, and the artists were invited to take over the museum branch in 2021.

I invited the artists to engage with the idea of movement on a personal level, but also in a conceptual way: with reference to their own lives and the journey of their art.  Their approach to the movement of the city was very powerful in making the idea of the residency more personal, and also making it more empirical. The idea of the residential building as a participatory space was also a powerful way to bring the artists together in a way that they hadn’t before. The building was a resource, a place for the very process of commissioning, research and art creation in a very concrete way. The building, and its space, became a</text>

All the artists had residencies at the Liverpool Museum of Art, but since Azpilicueta was a curator, I asked him to commission a specialised team of curators to work on a specific project for the museum. This was the artist that year: Susanne Sundblad. They focused on the history of the area, with a particular focus on the contributions of local people to the development of the city, and on the role that the art world could play in that development. The project was to be a mural exhibition, but during the process of the exhibition, the artists produced a set of muralists to produce a new kind of urban arts movement.

By the time we started the residency programme in 2007, the biennale had shifted to the weekends, and the artists spent more time in between. The fact that the biennale still exists on the weekends is a reflection of this: the city organises it thoroughly, and the artists have to be flexible, since there is no public transport to the city centre. The fact that Ribeiro is still alive and well produces another layer of complexity, since his biennale started again in 2009. At the time, there were also plans to create a parallel biennale programme for the two cities, but these have now been put on hold.</text>

All of them were involved in the 2006 Biennale, but I think Sánchez, Duarte and López de la Torre’s presence in 2006 is unique among the artists. It feels as if we are returning to a more traditional biennale, but with more of a community feel. The biennale has an obligation to this community, and although the autonomy of the artists is protected by the Biennale Council, they are not. If the Biennale Council is unable to safeguard the autonomy of the artists, there is a legal obligation on the artists to actively participate in creating a biennale experience consistent with the expectations of the Biennale Act 1989.

The idea was to have a creative dialogue with the local artists, and the local curators, about the meaning and purpose of the Biennale, and the relationship between art and architecture. The Biennale started to change its format, starting to collaborate more directly with the local artists, and the local curators started to change their programmes. The Biennale started to collaborate more actively with the local community, and with the local architects, in an attempt to find ways to make the Biennale more productive for the local community. Some biennials are more interested in the accumulation of cultural capital than in the creation of that capital. The Biennale is a unique institution, and its curatorial value is unquestionable. It is a part of the city for a reason, and part of the city for many more reasons. But it is a rare gift, and a curatorial gift. It is</text>

A third lineage is emerging: those who aspire to be artists in their own right and who are skilled in producing culturally responsive art. These are the artists who seek to work outside the context of an institution or a profession, and who can exploit the institution’s resources and bequeath cultural assets to worthy beneficiaries. They are the artists who design their own institutions and who can lay claim to cultural property. They may well become global artists themselves.

A embedding of art, architecture, landscapes, or other cultural resources within an institution is a relatively recent development.  The new breed of the embedded curatorial is the one responsible for the development of cultural competencies, and is thus expected to see itself as a cultural agent capable of bringing cultural practices into existing institutional settings.  A good example of this can be seen in the installation in the Pratt Institute gallery of the work of the New York Public Library as part of the Language Series, 2013, which invites artists to create pictorial works that inhabit the spatial and temporal registers. The work is a mapping of the New York Public Library’s digitised holdings of books from different periods, using archival materials and employing interactive media such as maps, social media and podcasts</text>

A second generation of curators is developing a third lineage of curators: those who aspire to be fully embedded within the art institution, able to contribute to its administrative infrastructure and, with a few exceptions, to its cultural life as well. These are the embedded curators. The embedded curators have the potential to become influential cultural locusts, taking root in the institution and raising the bar of artistic practice ever higher. They are the curators of the embedded, and have the potential to become cultural titans.  As of yet untested strategies for the embedded curatorial, it is up to experimental and experimental curators to determine whether an artistic practice such as sculpture, painting, music, or mural art, can be effectively integrated within a given situation in an art institution. It is also up to curators to determine whether the art institution is capable of supporting such a development, and to provide the institutional support for such a development through a funding mechanism.[8]It is worth noting that the curatorial work for the past decade has been predominantly carried out by the curatorial team led by Artistic Director Joasia Krysa. The emergence of a curatorial identity for the art institution has been welcomed, but not a proposal for institutionalisation.  A curatorial identity may be used to tell a story, to tell a rhythm, to tell characters, to tell space, and to tell rhythmically. The identity may be adhered to in a particular place, and used to create a certain kind of relationship with that place. Hence the name ‘embedded’ in relation to the curatorial. Thus the curatorial gesture is understood in relation to a particular kind of institutionalised identity (embedded identity). In theory, the embedding of the artist’s identity in the</text>

It is also up to curators to determine whether there are other ways to engage with the embedded art situation, and to strike artistic-politically-engaged poses that are responsive to the institutional context. This may require that the embedding – the cultural zone – be reconceived in other ways, and new artistic practices may emerge. At the very least, new art must be imagined and created that is politically-engaged and generates social change.  If there are other ways to engage with the embedded art situation, such as through curatorial or museum-based projects, these other approaches must be developed with an eye on the art institution and the artist, and not on the other, or in some cases, the other. Current and potential institutional tools for the embedded curator are being adapted to the embedded artist’s needs and values, and to the embedded situation.

It is also up to curators like myself, who have both curatorial and non-curatorial skills, to determine which art institutions may best support the embedded curatorial’s creativity and habitation within a given context.   As I said at the TEDx talk about the embodied, unmediated, and mediated worlds: ‘The larger the world is, the less certain and unstable is the embedding of meaning and agency within that world.’  Art institutions and their boards of directors are, of course, the ones who control the means of art getting produced and disseminated. In an ideal world, these means would interact with one another and with the environment in a dynamic and interdependent manner. Unfortunately, this is just the world we live in. The embedded curatorial is an art institution at its best, and at its worst, it is a destroyer of worlds.  As a result, the embedded curatorial is constantly evaluating its own dynamics and situation, in an attempt to find the</text>

A third generation of curators is developing a fourth and final lineage of curators: those who aspire to be artists in their own right, and to engage with the world as artists rather than as artists institutionalised within the art institution.

Many contemporary interface myths revolve around the  	transactional interface, or the ‘click-clicked’ interface as a media of exchange. But this kind of interface is becoming ever more ‘click-driven’ and reliant on the web, phone, tablet and cloud to function, while the user becomes ever more ‘motorcycled’ and dependent on the infrastructure of the web, phone, tablet and cloud. A click-clicked interface is no longer free and open to interpretation; it is strictly mechanical and predictable and can never innovate – not even in the digital age.  	The advent of the click-clicked interface means that a clickable part of the interface has a clickable part – a fact that has been interpreted by many</text>

The fault lines between programme and user are always visible, and the user is always right – even when the programme/programme is right half the time and the user is wrong half the time. Programmes can and do go wrong, and mistakes are always made. But the real tragedy of the interface is that it always succumbs to the temptation to negate responsibility and the real power of the user in favour of the computerised fantasy of immediacy and transparency. The careless use of the ‘real-life’ narrative in the design of user-friendliness guidelines, app store rankings, social networks, and ad networks is a classic example of this kind of meta-narrative.

The interface is an artifact of the interface industry – it represents a particular way of organising data, but also a set of conventions and tabulations that exist alongside of the data. The data that is gathered and transmitted over the interface is ephemeral, and not just in the sense that it is lost and destroyed along with other data, but also in that it is lost and destroyed along with other data. A tabulated history of the interface is not just a tabular record of how well the tools that make up the interface work, but also of what happens when the tools that make up the interface break down. Tabulating data, recording and monitoring progress is a fundamental aspect of the interface industry. Processes that are driven by data capture and analysis software become increasingly sophisticated, and the interface is a fundamental node in a system that is constantly monitored and data-collected.

The interface myth also exploits the fact that the user interface is a live system that constantly reassembles itself – evolving, mutating and reinventing itself – in response to user actions.

But what is the interface? How does the interface make its presence felt? What is its apparent behavior? These are questions that call out to an understanding of the  	interface, but few still have access to critical mass with which to ask these questions. The reasons for this state of affairs are varied, but it is often cited as a reason for user-friendliness – the ubiquity of images, the click-through-rate, the bouncing of images across the network, and so forth. But these features are often absent or under-utilised, and so the function of the interface is often misrepresented or under-appreciated. 	The interface is a media-specificity myth.</text>

In effect, the need to be re-imagined every time the interface is revised or updated is a fundamental design flaw of the interface today. 	But there is another kind of transient nature to the interface – the kind that can last for many lifetimes – the kind that was theorised by William Burroughs back in the 1950s and which is closely related to the concept of narrative architecture: ‘structures of mutual recurrence and displacement.’ This kind of timeline is what Burroughs identified, and what Margaret Thatcher and her cronies in the 1980s and 1990s identified as the  	critical interface layer.

And while the user interface might strive to provide the best possible experience for its users, in reality the user is not so passive as this fiction implies.

She or he decides what objects appear or does not appear on the screen. The decisions made in this interface are final and irreversible. This decision cannot be changed by the user.

It is the largest international biennial institution with a global reach. It has organized numerous research projects at a worldwide scale, including the 2015 Gulf States project on the Gulf of Thailand, which explored the physical geography of the region and its maritime traffic; the 2017 Sea-Level Rise Research Centre, which employed Gulfport Research Laboratory’s wind, wave and tide models on a global scale; and the 2018/19 Globex project, which employed over 1,</text>

The board’s 2018 budget request seems excessive in relation to the size and scope of the project, but in the context of a biennial with limited resources, it is necessary to increase the project’s scope in order to pay back the investment.

As a result, biennials today are often underserved by their urban environments, under-studied or misrepresented in histories, or completely ignored by the art world. As biennial tourism grows in popularity, so too does the demand for accommodation, transportation and other essential services supporting the art-related industries. As a result, the demand for a museum platform increases, which in turn attracts more galleries and galleries of all kinds to the city. As a result, the museum becomes ever more important in the city. It represents and represents itself as important. 	It is this constant evolution of the biennial that creates the illusion of contemporaneity, even though, as</text>

This is despite the fact that the museum is operating below capacity, with only around 200 guests a show, compared to 3,000 in the past. If the museum is unable to address this growing discrepancy, other partners may step in to fill the gap. Liverpool Biennial’s 2018 development strategy includes a section entitled ‘Impact and Proximity’, which seeks to define the terms of its future interaction with the city. It proposes ‘Impact Areas: a new generation of practitioners is learning to inhabit the urban space through hands-on activities; their knowledge, skills and networks expand as they migrate further afield.’[4] The proposal places significant reliance on the museum’s tourism business, specifically targeting areas of Liverpool with significant cultural histories and attractions to visitors. The museum is asked to lead ‘a new chapter in the history of the city</text>

This suggests that, at an instalment level, the organisation’s future plans may be much more readily discernible. It is also worth noting that, at an instalment level, the organisation’s past may be more easily discerned. 	[1] The Biennial was founded in 2016 and aims to be a hub for creative learning in the city.[2] The term ‘institutional conversion’ is frequently used within the arts world to describe the process by which artists are trained, and often placed within the context of conversion therapy, which uses culturally specific ideologies to alter a person’s orientation. It is understood that the modelling and psychological techniques employed within institutionalised contexts can and do lead to cultural conversion, and that artists may engage in this process themselves as facilitators, ideators and ultimately artists. The Biennial has been described as a hub for ‘institutional memory’.[3</text>

The increase in expenditure may be due to the increased number of artists participating in the art project at a later stage, or the museum becoming more commercially viable, but both have contributed to the crisis. If the new instalment is a further indication, then the board’s decisions may have to be revisited. Whether the board is correct in their approach is yet to be seen, but the fact that the Biennial can afford to raise funds at a faster rate than it does now may prove an issue in the future. That decision must be made by the museum board, not the Biennial itself.

This increase is primarily attributable to a 3.5% increase in the biennial’s commercial partner, Golden Goose, and a 25% increase in the biennial’s general fund, both of which increased by approximately 20% in value as a percentage of the total biennial budget.[4] It is worth emphasising that Liverpool Biennial has operated below capacity for some years, as evidenced by the fact that it was forced to reduce the number of exhibitions it was holding due to financial constraints.[5] In fact, the Biennial’s highest attendance ever was in its 2012/13 instalment, when over 200,000 people visited the art fair, Instituto Mayor de Buenos Aires, Argentina; a testament to the biennial’</text>

These are large budgetary challenges when considering that the Biennial has been operating at a loss for several years now. Liverpool Biennial is currently undertaking a year-long ‘big data’ project to better understand its own financial model, and how art is generated in the city.[4] Analysing the fate of an art institution is a difficult task, but the challenges presented by the rise and fall of the biennial may serve as a useful reference for the future of an artist-run biennial. The rise and fall of the biennial may also inform the future of artist-run museums and the philosophy of ‘museum as a political medium’.[5] Liverpool Biennial’s growth may be partly explained by the growth of its own brand, which is increasingly seen as a credible business proposition and a source of pride for the city.

This suggests that the new owner is preparing to devote more resources to events than simply on-site preservation. Liverpool Biennial 2018—the art world’s oldest continuously operating biennial and one of its few remaining non-commissioned cultural institutions—is scheduled for early 2019. Whether the new owners will follow this format of artist-centred programming remains to be seen. What is certain is that the building will be heavily remodelled and new management hired soon after its closure. Whether the Biennial can be organised in this way again is unclear.The Biennial as a Cultural PracticeNew Museum building, Saint John’s Church, Saint John’s, New Brunswick, Canada.

We don’t yet know what the planned human-scale structures for the new cities is all about, but we do know that we’ll soon know that the planned ‘metro’ is more accurately a hybrid of skyscrapers and cities. And while the biennial has a tendency to generate a great deal of hype and a great deal of attention, that attention doesn’t really lend itself to solving problems, but rather to reinforcing existing hierarchies and ideologies. For example, the biennial may herald a new model of cities, but within a certain period of time, new urban forms will need to be invented and new ways of organizing the urban space created. New models of cities will need to emerge from the biennial’s inflection points, as it were.Above all, the biennial needs to end up in a museum somewhere, with the understanding that it is an ever-present, but new kind of presence.</text>

But it also has a power that is proportional to the complexity of its relationship to the biennial. For example, the biennial as a subject is subject to the vagaries of capitalism, but it also has a power that is necessary to the functioning of the biennial as a particular form of temporality. And this is what biennials do. They’re contracts between artists and the biennial as a producer. They’re invisible, they’re discretionary, and they’re breaks from the otherwise productive patterns of capitalist accumulation. And this is what biennials are for. They give us, or at least point us to exist outside of our environments. They provide a break from whatever is happening in the world as a whole. And this is what biennials can do. They provide a space or a time or a place that is not dominated by the interests of corporate or financial capitalism</text>

But it has increasingly important work to do, and it needs to be able to work across these historical divides and bonds in order to produce and sustain creative artistic and historic moments. I would argue that the primary role of the biennial is to produce and sustain artistic and historic moments, and this mainly means the work it does on a global scale. The biennial has to be able to sustain a sense of place and identity in a way that the global economy will not allow, and it needs to be able to generate cultural power and identity for places that are more immediately present in the aggregate than in its database.In other words, it needs to be able to produce and sustain artistic and historic moments that are not manufactured and sustained by the global financial and cultural systems that it is visiting. I would argue that the current global economic and political systems do not provide these elements for the biennial to explore. I would propose that the biennial should make use of its location, but also</text>

And this is perhaps the reason why biennials, like all kinds of different kinds of institutions, have to be constantly on the lookout for that kind of infrastructural replacement that will replace the infrastructural base of the biennial, but will also make its impact harder to gauge.The biennial has a great potential for this new kind of spatialism that we’re discussing here, the spatialisation of art, the museum and the biennial in modernity. But this potential is real and it may well be that the biennial as we know it will be even more real in the future. We need to be prepared for that.This brings us to another set of questions: what should be the role of biennials in the urbanisation of the world? I think that there’s a fundamental misunderstanding of what urbanisation really means</text>

But what it generally lacks in power it more than makes up for in other respects. In its current form, it is a curious mixture of powerful and corrupting. It pulls us into periods of great change and change and brings us to interesting periods of great instability and instability, but at the same time it is puncturing these periods and bringing us back to the present, sometimes bringing us full circle. This mix of power and corruption is a theme running through biennials today. The power of the biennial is enhanced by the fact that it is able to define and reconstruct the subject matter studied, and this power really comes to the fore in the history and culture of the twenty-first century. But the biennial as an institution can also endow with extraordinary and often transformative effects on the world around it. This is what happens when biennials become culturally embedded in their sites, and so, for example, when biennials are cultural touch</text>

But that power is also used to an extent that challenges the biennial as primarily an art project. Biennials need to be constantly (very) sensitive to the fact that they are (very) artefacts, that are constructed, that are (very) instrumental in producing (a certain) set of relations and relations between people and places. That tendency towards omnipresence and towards the impossible is something that will (probably) remain within their historical and conceptual borders. However, that tendency can and should be used to create (new) relations, and that’s why biennials should be around for so long after the art is done. Because in the end, what they’re really making is always a very real and very dangerous mess of relations between people and places – a mess that they’re constantly (very) liable to make worse. And they’ll always make worse, because the circumstances</text>

I remember well the first time I went to Venice for the Venice Biennale, in 1989. I was twelve. I was not yet ready to sign up to become a biennial visitor. I was not yet ready to become a biennial patron. I still didn’t yet have a name, or much of a identity, with which to engage with the conventions and values of the art museum, or engage with the real life of being in and out of the Biennale grounds. I was still trying to figure out the difference between being in a museum and being in the real life of a city. The Biennale was a real event, and I was taken on a tour by two guides who were very experienced and well-known in their fields. We travelled around the city, stopping at historic places of interest and exploring the history of the Biennale. We were stopped by two museum curators who were</text>

But it has to take account that the biennial is a cultural centre and is moving towards a ‘cultural city’. It has to take account that the biennial could become culturally aware and innovative, and that in the future it may become commercially viable through partnerships with other large institutional buyers. It has to take account that the biennial is a ‘city in which art is made visible in large numbers’, and that in the future it may become art institutions’ primary means of engaging a city in a public way. It has to take account of the fact that, in a city this size and with such a deep and rich cultural history, it is going to be very difficult for the biennial to create a similar impact in a city without significant cultural changes. It has to take account that, in the future, the biennial may wish to partner with other art institutions or other commercial organisations and create collaborative art projects. It has to take</text>

But it also has another essential job, one that it does exceptionally well: it produces biennials. And it does this through what I call the ‘biennial condition’. The idea of the biennial has become immensely globalized; the museum, or the museum as such, is the global node of the biennial’s social reproduction. And so the biennial is a ‘placeholder’ – a point of entry into the larger social reproduction of bienniality beyond the museum or the museum as such. It is, in other words, a point where social reproduction takes place not within the museum, but also not without it. It is a point where social reproduction begins to be done through the mediation of cultural capital, through the activities of the artworld and the cultural tourism industry it develops, and it is a place where cultural activities begin to occupy a significant amount of travel time.

But in many cases, it also has a tendency to reveal the nitty-gritty details that only a specific kind of historical researcher can shed light on. That tendency is what historian and anthropologist Sean Carroll calls anthropomorphising historical moments. Anthropomorphising is a powerful act, and it’s oftenentimes what biennials do best. But at times they also need to be called back into the present, and that’s exactly what biennial critics do. It’s not easy to anthropomorphise in the age of the biennial, and not easy to undo the historical moment, but biennials have to do it sometimes. And sometimes they need to do it in order to live up to their historical moment. That’s what anthropomorphising means.Sometimes the anthropomorphising is necessary, and sometimes the undoing is not. But at the same time, biennials have to be able to operate in a</text>

The reader can also ‘figure out’ what that thing is, or what it might be’. A number of biennials have attempted to translate the historical into the contemporaneous, but they have tended to produce hybrid, sometimes contradictory, representations of the former. The 2010 Venice Biennale was a prime example of this hybridisation. It was judged to be an authentic contemporaneous with the texts and cultural practices of the social and urban context in which it was staged, but it was also judged to be a hoax by critics who perceived a pre-monetised, commercial enterprise masquerading as a cultural occasion. The critics were so confident in their depiction of ‘Venice 4’, they did not bother to check. They saw a privatised, profit-driven, sometimes contradictory but always ideologically diverse and progressive form of biennality possible only in the ‘city’. Biennials are at once literary (their literary endowments,</text>

By reading texts or pictorial forms that clearly and deliberately break with convention, the reader can draw his/her own interpretation on the events of the historical ‘face’. For instance, the famously anti-fascist slogan ‘Big Apple’, coined by Egyptian-American poet Moishe Postone in 1971, is a play on words from the anarchist manifesto by Murray Bookchin. The origins of the slogan are traced back to Bookchin’s non-classical ‘Liberation Through Non-Classical Struggle’. Postone’s slogan is a response to a British intelligence agency, MI6, which was responsible for subverting popular uprisings in the Arab world to bolster Britain’s global empire. Bookchin’s book, Anarchism and Other Essays was published in 1971 and followed up with a series of postcards in which he reprinted some of his earlier work. A 1988 collection of postcards and articles includes a collection of postcards titled ‘Murray Bookchin: Selected Essays’.Postone’s poem is a call to arms: arms raised to meet the challenged face</text>

By reading texts or pictorial forms that clearly and deliberately break with convention, the reader can draw his/her own interpretation on the events of the historical ‘face’. For instance, the calligraphic writing on the gateposts of the Tate Modern may be an expression of civic engagement, but the actual writing is often critical, even melodramatic, in its reflections on the city’s decline and potential rebirth. The ‘face’, in this case, is an object that is constantly (re)present, constantly subject to change, continuously (re)present in relation to the events of the world around it, and so on. In this way, the ‘face’ is both a locus of presence and a kind of alter ego – a mythic figure who provides meaning and agency in the world through her/his body – though the reader may or may not identify with her/his identity. To be able to do this, the ‘face’ would have to be able to generate her/his own narrative – which is itself a myth – and also have agency, since the events of the world around</text>

For instance, the Byzantines conquered Egypt in 1453 and for centuries the pharaohs and their court were wrapped up in an intricate web of diplomatic, economic, legal and even magical activities that incorporated everything from tax collecting to royal bulls to manage the economy. As a result, the local pharaohs often found themselves caught up in a web of economic self-sufficiency. As early as the fifth century BC the nomadic Bedouin population that now calls itself the ‘Arabs’ began to influence cultural practices in the Near East. The rise of the Arab Spring in 2011 and subsequent mass migrations of peoples south of the Sahara is thought to have contributed to a revival of interest in the classical Orientalist perspective of things south of the Sahara. The Byzantines eventually came to dominate much of Eurasia and much of what is now Egypt, but the real shift happened south of the Sahara.

By reading texts or pictorial forms that clearly and deliberately break with convention, the reader can draw his/her own interpretation on the events of the historical ‘face’. For example, the ‘face’ in the Qur'an can be divided into ‘sides’ – fictional, historical, geographical and ideological – and ‘fronts’ – real (historical) images of the Holy City. The parallelism created by breaking ‘ideologically’ language into its constituent parts can be used to create new vocabularies, new worlds, or alternatively, ‘imaginary structures’ that serve as the basis for new conceptualizations. In this way, the historical face can be reinterpreted through a given text or pictorial form, while simultaneously questioning the status of ‘real’ images and texts in the same way that the reader might engage with an event such as a Paris or New York street party.

The character of the contemporary is a critical determinant of the readability of the social, and the contemporary is a reading that actively seeks to understand the world through its image (re)constituted social media (relevance is a critical quality of the social image). Because the social image is constantly re-constituted through the act of reading, the contemporary is also a reading that actively seeks to understand the world through its image (re)constituted image (relevance is a critical quality of the social image). As a consequence, the contemporary contemporary novel must engage with its own image making in order to be textured and shaped by the social image (relevance is a quality of the social image). – Juss</text>

Such an interpretation is often critical in drawing a clear understanding of specific practices, and the social consequences of such practices. For example, the anti-globalization movement arose in part on the back of a 1980s anti-colonial movement that was largely triggered by the spectacle of white poverty and urban destruction in the wake of white flight during that decade. The anti-globalization movement sought to end poverty and urban decline through a combination of direct action (the ‘Miracle on Mango Street’), creative organising (the ‘Rip It Up’ campaign), cultural mobilisation (the ‘Swing’ campaign) and (in the West) legalised activism (the ‘Leave’ campaign). The key to the success of such legal action was the mobilisation of broad publics, including large segments of the urban middle and upper classes, who saw themselves as the beneficiaries of a revitalised Mango Street.

In the case of transparant texts, the reader is not just entering into a world, but actually entering into a world of his/her own making – creating what might be termed ‘art’ – that is internally contradictory and contradictory.

The Egyptian Room was a monument to the memory of the forgotten, but it also functioned as a kind of laboratory for contemporary art’s own experimentalization. And here, perhaps, is the lesson for contemporary art: it should be able to exist in a city in crisis, but it also needs to be able to exist in a city that is not experiencing crisis but nevertheless needs to somehow resolve it. This kind of curatorial experimentation is exactly what the art fairs and their artists put into the cracks and crevices of everyday public life, in an attempt to create a different kind of artworld experience. It is a kind of positive feedback loop – encouraging art to be made in a specific space, but also making it possible for that art to be made elsewhere. It is a kind of urban accident that often times has catastrophic results. But in the end, what the art fairs and their artists do is done for the simple reason that they are so damn entertaining. After all, what is it that they promise us?  One can only imagine what their future may hold. [1] See Bernard Ace</text>

It offered a way to think about art and the social dimensions of art production, and perhaps a way to start conversations about art and social change.But over the past decade or so, a certain amount of noise, pollution and conflict have become commonplace in the US, and in many other parts of the world. New urban developments are occurring all across the country that are being promoted through what is being called ‘transformational localism’. This is the idea that the ‘Transforming Tractors’ of gentrification and redevelopment have applied retrofitting abandoned places, and have invited in non-developer communities to take over formerly’distributed property. In these places, developers have set up ‘suburban Disneylands’ where many people can be built in and around the core city, but with few or no public services or social benefits, and without providing any public goods or public benefits to those inhabitants.

The Egyptian Room was a monument to the memory of the forgotten, but it also functioned as a kind of laboratory for contemporary art to be made in the most immediate conditions possible. In other words, it served a function that was in some way apolitical. But as time went on and the museum stopped making money, the political became apolitical. Art had to find other places to take its place in society. The Egyptian Room was a kind of laboratory for this new curatorial posture. It offered a kind of idealised outward appearance to the political, but beneath the surface this space harbored a kind of latent populism that was being worked through. Art had to be made accessible to people who might be interested in political work, but beneath its surface there was a kind of political that was overriding. This is an example of the kind of politics being worked through in the Egyptian Room. The kind of politics that places a premium on the participation of large numbers of people, over-emphasises individual voices and favours a communal experience over that of a small number of people.

The Egyptian Room was a monument to the memory of the forgotten, but it also functioned as a kind of laboratory for contemporary art to be made in a city that is no longer part of the Egyptian Quarter. It offered a way to think about the city from a radically political perspective, while simultaneously offering a kind of sanctuary from the city's violence and oppression. I think that the Egyptian Room is a classic case study in the power of symbolic environments. It demonstrates the power of language, but also of culture, and the power of symbolic action. It is a kind of poetic echo, but also a kind of terrible reality. I think that through a series of small actions, cultural and artistic organizers could create powerful symbols and action that would be able to survive in a city that is no longer part of its historic tourist destination. For example, the Egyptian Room had the support of a city council, but without that kind of institutionalized support, such symbolic actions would have had to be led by an elected body.

The Egyptian Room was a monument to the memory of the forgotten, but it also functioned as a kind of laboratory for contemporary art to be made in a city that is no longer a center of production and circulation. This kind of radical reclamation is often misunderstood, and the city often presents a distorted or contradictory version of the things to which artists, curators and arts administrators respond when presented with a situation that contradicts their preconceptions and biases. In the 1990s, the political situation in Brazil was such that it was almost impossible to find a gallery in the city, and the only places that were regularly visited were museums and certain district galleries. So there was a real crisis of accessibility in the city. But the real revolution in access came in the 1990s, and the curatorial turn has been a real contributor to the increase in artistic freedoms and autonomy that is now commonplace in Brazil. In a city as politically and economically diverse as Sao Paulo, the curatorial turn is a real asset. It gives freedom of expression to a city that is deeply divided by class.

Through a kind of ‘metainterface’, the Egyptian Room allowed artists and art historians to sit among the debris of a once-vibrant downtown, amidst the discarded merchandise of a once-mighty culture. The idea that a museum should be a site of passive contemplation and repetition is firmly rooted in the museum’s first president, John Moores, who established the museum as a place of meditation and contemplation. In his words, ‘the natural atmosphere of a museum is study…a state of mind…a state of consciousness…a state of meditation…a state of emancipation…a state of consciousness…a state of rest…a state of rest…a state of rest…a state of rest…a state of relaxation…a state of relaxation…a state of entrapment…a state of euphoria…a state of elation…a state of elation…a</text>

The Egyptian Room was a monument to the memory of the forgotten, but it also functioned as a kind of laboratory for contemporary art to be made in a city that was being rapidly converted to a megacity. And this is what the contemporary curatorial movement hopes to achieve: turning, or creating, a sense of surprise, or creating a different kind of anticipation, in the event that the city’s capacity for anticipation is gradually exhausted. In other words, it’s not so much the objects on show as the conditions on show – and the ‘contemporary curatorial’ can be seen to be reacting to the ever-present, ‘contemporary art market’ by threatening the market with destruction. Many artists, including SNCF, UD, UDHR, UDAT and others were artists, in various forms of contemporary art, during the 1980s and 1990s. UDHR was a particularly daring and experimental form of contemporary art that challenged the classical notions of the modern artist and the museum.

And it seems that in the current political climate as well, the Egyptian Room has a place in art, even if it has to struggle with its own. After the Arab revolutions, the building was again a staging post for the competing narratives that emerged after, during and after the revolutions. But this time, the competing narratives were more readily dismissed as part of the larger global battle between radical Islamists and secular liberal democrats. The current Egyptian President, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, is a secular liberal democrat. He is a rare exception, in that he belongs to a predominantly ceremonial Shia minority sect, and his father, former president Mohamed Sissi, was a religious fundamentalist. So while the Egyptian Room served as a kind of laboratory for the contemporary art of being made everywhere else – in Qatar, in Istanbul, in New York and in many other places – it was made especially uncomfortable by its ostensible home in the country that lost the last war.</text>

The Egyptian Room was a monument to the memory of the forgotten, but it also functioned as a kind of laboratory for contemporary art from a post-Fordist perspective. All these cultural‐political gestures and more were, in part, a reaction to the fact that the main form of art in the city was no longer being produced by people who had their art produced in‐house. Today, many artists who were once considered local, or even regional, to the city are now commissioned by international galleries and museums, and their works are often placed outside the city in order to maximise their commercial appeal. So, too, many artists who once considered themselves artists on a regional or even a national level are now commissioned by international art collectors, and their works are frequently placed in regional or international art fairs. And of course, the curatorial gesture continues to play a role in art production in the city. The curatorial shift in the 1990s was a dramatic one, and it is still very much a factor in art production in the city. But while the importance of the curator remains fairly constant, the curatorial gesture</text>

The location of the exhibition – a converted warehouse in the heart of a district – provided a backdrop of activity that was both familiar and unexpected. The curatorial gesture in this context could be perceived as a provocation, and the gallery responded with a number of installations that placed art in a situation that was both familiar and unexpected. My favourite example of this is probably the Egyptian Room, from the mid-1990s. It’s a monument to the memory of the forgotten, and the very idea is repugnant to the current political climate. Nevertheless, the very fact that it was installed amidst so much noise, pollution and conflict – in a city that was experiencing its own political and economic crises – made it a beacon of hope for a city that desperately needed a miracle. The Egyptian Room was a monument to the memory of the forgotten, but it also functioned as a kind of laboratory for contemporary art and contemporary consciousness in the city. It provided a space for a small cadre of artists to work, exchange and imagine new possibilities. The function of the museum and the curatorial is to make things visible; what they are most like when they are hidden. And so the museum and the curatorial move us, making us visible, making us understand things that we otherwise don’t comprehend. But they also have to be watched carefully, and that’s why you have to check in with the curatorial department at least monthly. The reason why this is so is that the power of the display comes from what it creates rather than what it conceals; the former is more intuitive and the latter more difficult to categorise. The interesting thing about consciousness, as we discovered when we started to investigate what it means by ‘consciousness’ in our world, is that it can be controlled; you can put something in a box, and it will follow certain rules.

But this does not mean that the museum is neutral or that it serves all audiences. Globalisation and its social concomitant, capitalism, tends to enrich a particular elite, and museums, like any other socialised art form, are particularly adept at conveying the value of a particularised commodity to a social elite. So it is useful to understand how a museum might intervene in this process of global capitalist circulation to intervene in this process of cultural revolution, in the sense of cultural imperialism. Global capitalism exploits us all, and so museums, like all cultural forms, are objects of circulation, part of a circulation that includes both globalised and locally independent sectors. They are products of a circulation that develops not only within nations but also in other parts of the world. And so, in this sense, they are globally relevant. And this is what museums – like other art forms – are today: objects of circulation in a globalised capitalist society. In this circulation, they acquire cultural value and become part of a circulation that creates a set of values and ideologies that are in turn culturally valuable. And so, museums today often act as agents of change within this circulation – they are cultural</text>

But this does not mean that the museum is neutral or that it serves all audiences. Globalisation and its social concomitant, capitalism, tends to enrich a particular elite, and so a museum that exhibits the arts in a neoliberal fashion may in fact educate some people to become artists or managers of museums or galleries or other institutional forms of art. It may also educate other people, especially people belonging to that elite, to become artists or managers of museums or galleries or other institutional forms of art. In this sense, the museum is able to capture the cultural energies of a society insofar as those cultural energies exist in a form that can be commodified and transmitted along with other assets (pictures, objects, texts etc.) – an ideology. In this sense, the museum is able to preserve its character as a site of exchange, a place of aesthetic encounters, and a site of social interactions. But this process of exchange and its paraphernalia – exhibits, texts, images, spaces – are used to produce values and ideologies. And so the museum is constantly reminding people to come to it, to adopt its values and to become members of its social organisation. As such, the</text>

But this does not mean that the museum is neutral or that it serves all audiences. Globalisation and its social concomitant, capitalism, tends to enrich a particular elite, and so a museum that exhibits particular forms of capitalism (such as its contemporary incarnation, the contemporary art market) is necessarily global in character. It conveys certain values and ideologies to a specific social group or social stratum, and so it is the museum that constitutes the site of capitalist circulation, and thus is also the site of social struggles.3 	In the past, this concomitant has meant organising the art market in a prescient and influential way. Today it means engaging with the political and social complexities that sometimes confront us in contemporary society, and making art that is relevant and interesting to a particular stratum of people, such as art-sharers, public galleries, arts organisations, students, locals, tourists and so forth. Art today is an object of exchange between institutions, and so these institutions value it as a commodity – a commodity with certain intrinsic properties. The museum, on the other hand, stands for the value it produces in the marketplace: a commodity with a set of</text>

But this does not mean that the museum is neutral or that it serves all audiences. Globalisation and its social concomitant, capitalism, tends to enrich a particular elite, and so a museum that exhibits dominant themes of globalisation today might be exclusionary for communities outside of the globalised elite. More likely, museums that exhibit predominantly globalised images today might be useful for communities outside of the globalised elite. I prefer, for instance, museums displaying images of protest in predominantly Muslim countries, or of Palestinian civil rights activists in predominantly African countries. I would prefer, however, that such art museums display works by and about artists who are predominantly of European descent, and about their practices, anxieties and movements within the context of the contemporary radical contemporary artist’s community. And I would prefer that these images and works of art not assume a position of dominance or pre-existential relations with other cultural forms, and especially not that they should exist in isolation or in defiance of other cultural forms and movements.

Globalisation and its social concomitant, capitalism, tends to enrich a particular elite, and so a particular museum such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York may be a more accessible museum for artists and the museum-going public in poorer neighbourhoods. New museums may be built in the arts-poor neighbourhoods, for instance, and may commission exhibitions in poorer neighbourhoods. Curators, curators, art collectors and artophiles may gravitate to these museums over poorer museums because the rich museums tend to be located in affluent coastal neighbourhoods, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York or the British Museum in London. The Museum of Modern Art in New York, however, is an arts museum with a social purpose – it is a museum of the contemporary condition. And so it is now building a new building for the Museum of Modern Art in London, which will be a museum of the postindustrial future. The new museum will be a museum of the past, but it will also be a museum of the future, or, perhaps, a museum of the present, depending on one's</text>

A museum that is a particular articulation of contemporary global capitalist culture today is a museum of art, while a museum that reflects the legacy of the Black Cultural and Urban History is a museum of society. It would be absurd to suggest that the mission of the museum today is to render abstract concepts comprehensible to a mass audience, or that the museum is neutral between art and philosophy. On the contrary, the museum is a site of continued cultural reproduction and reproduction of value, so that its true mission – its role today – is to the extent that it is not being served by other sites and activities. I would argue instead that the mission of the museum is to preserve and reanimate the historical and contemporary social formations that it was created to survey, to the extent that doing so is in the interest of the capitalist system.

But this does not mean that the museum is neutral or that it serves all audiences. Globalisation and its social concomitant, capitalism, tends to enrich a particular elite, and so a museum that exhibits dominant trends in art and culture in a metropolitan museum context might be considered progressive. On the contrary, it might actively participate in conveying those trends to a geographically diverse and culturally diverse audience. The museum might exhibit a curator’s own creative impulses and methods, or it might exhibit a socio-political context and ideals that are in direct opposition to those of the dominant culture. The contemporary museum might be interested in the latter, while the past museum might seek to negate the latter. Globalisation and the metainterface are made up of social processes, and so it is with the museum. As Tiziana Terranova explains, when the metainterface is globalised, it loses its original ‘world-picture’ character, which was characterised by the presence of ‘people of a particular culture and a particular language in a particular setting, such as a city’s historic historical cultural districts or historic neighbourhoods’, where ‘</text>

Art today is produced in countries where the economy is notoriously volatile, and in many cases where the government is accused of manipulating the economy to prop up financial capitalism (which it arguably does by lending at below-market rates to companies it knows will expand, create jobs and so on). Art today is produced in countries where the political and economic systems that construct, engineer and (mostly) lead into modern capitalist modes of production are rife with racial and ethnic dilutions – where publics, including artists, are frequently accused of succumbing to the temptation to align with local economies, fads or fads alone, to the lure of hype or the illusion of accessibility.

It might be more representative of the elite because it is organized in such a way as to be able to lecture and show exhibitions in its chosen field of aesthetics, which is dominated by the interests of the financial and economic elite (i.e., the World Economic Forum and the like). It might be more representative of the elite because of the dominant role that global finance plays in world trade and so international bodies like the WTO can be seen as inevitable extensions of the organisation of capitalism. But all these things are also true of the museum, which is today dominated by a small cadre of curators and artists committed to the production of exhibitions that serve to reaffirm the social function of the museum in a given city.

In the end, what is necessary is that the surplus of a given project remain in the hands of the people who initiated, adopted, and continue to control that project, at a given moment and in the present.  	Real-time 	The advent of world-wide mobile computing and internet enabled rapid advances in production and consumption, which in turn, expanded horizons of what can be produced and consumed. These technologies make it possible to produce ever greater amounts of surplus, which in turn expands the economies of scale needed to support the extraction of ever greater amounts of surplus. The surplus grows ever larger, more diverse, and more problematic, while the ecological footprint shrinks ever smaller. Yet the ecological footprint remains large and complex, and while its contents are often elusive and distorting, they can nevertheless provide crucial information on the terrain. 	Consider, for example, the impact of the oil crisis on the planet as a whole. The impact on the biogeochemical cycle that would result from a given amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is immeasurably more destructive than the impact from the current consumption of fossil fuels. The impact on biodiversity is equally immeasurably more damaging. Consequently, it is essential that we all work towards the production of ever greater</text>

These new social forms required that people become specialists in one field, rather than bound by fixed positions in a socially destructive economy. Consequently,  	the social and political formation required that people negotiate multiple levels, were it not for the constant erasure and re-emergence of that form in and among social groups. 	Moreover, the advent of mass media and the anthropological study of culture ecology, which followed closely behind these technologies, opened new worlds of cultural consumption for humans, displacing traditional forms of labour and wealth. The anthropological study of culture increased in both focus and resources, becoming both more objective and more powerful, allowing the anthropologist to penetrate deeper into groups’ homelands in order to understand how people live their daily lives, especially in the context of a given country</text>

These technologies made it easier to engage with local or historical materials that are digitised and shared between disciplines or even within disciplines, allowing for the transfer of understanding between disciplines or even across different time periods.  	In this context, the potential of virtual or distributed archiving becomes clear. Furthermore, as a tool for archive-keeping, it has been employed in an ever expanding range of contexts, from the production of documentary films to archive-keeping societies to archive-sharing platforms like YouTube to archive-sharing via social media. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the technological singularity is the undoing of the cultural; there are now dedicated efforts to understand how technological innovations impact cultural practices and the history of cultural practices.

Today, it is impossible to go to the wrong place in time and come out the same way, which has led to a world where even the most brilliant and socially engaged projects are transient. The advent of augmented and virtual reality technology has also altered how we perceive the world. New augmented and virtual reality experiences are possible, but they are far less likely to be made by the people who built those experiences. 	Digital cameras, smartphones, and social media have all but abolished the need for craftsmen and artists to build and navigate their way around a landscape in order to produce artistic works that are authentic to the context and people of the place. This level playing field between the urban and the rural has also led to a new level of cultural homogenisation.

    The next Liverpool Biennial will be in two years' time, but events in Liverpool have been a good indicator of things to come. The biennial format, which is now ubiquitous in most cities, was once the preserve of decadent metropolises, now common in fringe cities. But while in earlier, more decadent cities, the biennial was a transient and transient kind of thing, now it is extremely common. It may be a transient feeling, but it is very apparent in the city right now. The biennial format is a persistent current form, and its future may very well be in transit through these last two years before the festival itself kicks off again in 2017. So we can say that the biennial format is like a weather phenomenon: it has a beginning, a middle and an end. Our city’s recent, but still relatively new, weather phenomenon is the biennial format.

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, and continues to this day. The aim of the biennial is to catalogue the city’s past natural wonders and cultural sites, while also providing a means to exchange and connect with other cities in the world. In other words, it is a kind of museum with a curatorial function. The biennial format has the curatorial as a function of conveying meaning and ideas across the geographical area covered, in much the same way that museums do today. The biennial visitor is interested in the city as a whole, but especially in the city that is being assembled into one large virtual entity called ‘The City’. This is a very important and powerful function of the biennial, because it dominates and circulates information, drawing visitors in with its dynamic and often fantastic visual language, and thereby establishing a shared common ground with other cities. But the biennial visitor also needs to be able to step back and take stock of what is being done within the city, and of what is</text>

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, which was a complete re-formatting of the original cityscapes and helped bring a new urban vitality to the area. The biennial format may have a beginning, but its trajectory is often unpredictable, and the early 20th century may be a little too romantic for its own good. The biennial may have a middle and a point, but its real strength is its ability to tell multiple, but connected stories. That first Bilbao Biennale, and subsequent, more global, exhibitions of urban architecture and design, were all staged in and around the city highlighted a point that has been lost in translation in the age of the biennial: that the cities that form the basis of biennials are, as a rule, also the borders of the biennials. And this is a crucial point. If we are going to talk about contemporary art in the same way that we talk about the city, we need to begin to comprehend that the city is a virtual frontier, a place</text>

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, in which the artist Sarah Nuttall curated a total of twenty-one exhibits, of which eighteen were located in the ‘present’ time. It then transitioned to a biennial format for more recent works, which I figure is a good thing, because it allows the museum to spend more time in the present, and less time wandering into the future. The sixteen biennials in the city between 2016 and 2018 were each unique, but in that order. The show that Sarah and I curated for the Liverpool Biennial in early 2018, entitled The Resident, is a good example of this new, but old, kind of thing. It begins with a narrative survey of the city, then explores contemporary art within the city, and then, finally, closes with a question mark that says: would this be a good place to live? The show itself, which came out in June, 2018, is much more of a collection of questions, with questions cropping up across the museum from the artists</text>

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, which was the largest and most visible of the group. The Bilbao Biennale opened with a biennial-like architecture exhibition, and its subsequent public acts included a number of architecture tours of Spain and Portugal. The next step, of course, is the major European city-wide exhibition that will introduce the art to a wider audience, but the future biennial may well be a multi-year, city-wide, public-private partnership that opens for business at any time. I don’t think this is a bad thing, because the biennial format opened new ways of looking at the architectural forms, at times even at the time. But I don’t think it is a good thing either.The biennial format is a global phenomenon, and its contemporary-looking cities are only parts of the story. Assemblages and collectives of cities form the basis of this story, and cities such as Liverpool have become the object of their collective gaze. A new</text>

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, but it has since expanded into a global phenomenon with over 200 exhibitions, over 1,000 cities ‘within sight’ of each other, and organises international and domestic events that last years ‘much longer’ than the biennale itself. So there is an end to be seen, and so we can move from the biennial to the festival. The biennial format is a very particular kind of movement, and it is interesting that in the early 1990s, a few biennials emerged in London, New York, and other major cities around the world, but their primary audiences were in the developed world. Biennials today have a global reach, and are often characterised as being driven by a ‘different kind of humanity’.3. Cultures of resistance. Culture of resistance is a key concept to comprehending the biennial phenomenon. It is a set of practices and discourses that emerged in response to the overproduction, consumerisation, commodification</text>

It may be a recurring event, but it is now becoming increasingly rare and the middle may be the exception rather than the rule. There is a new normal in terms of what counts as a biennial exhibitionary venue, and what is considered a biennial experience. This new normal is defined as follows: a) ‘The biennial is a permanent, recurring exhibitionary venue that engages with and depends on time and place; b) ‘It is a permanent venue that offers permanent exhibitions in a form that is continuous with its internal logic; c) It maintains its organic character by continuously shifting its form, space and function; d) It creates a dynamic micro-experience through its many virtual or virtual-only publics, specialised collections and informal ‘meet-ups’ held in venues, public institutions or associations; e) It establishes a public sphere</text>

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, but now many cities in South America and Eastern Europe host biennials. While in Liverpool, they have begun to organize themselves into local museums, or city collections, which may be collections of objects from the era, or are it exhibitions about contemporary life in the centre. So the museum form may be seen as a historical irregularity, with a pre-existing middle and post-modern contingent. But it is notable for its openness and its ability to transition from one era to another. It is not unheard of for a biennial to exhibit a significant amount of original art within its pages, but this is unusual, and while it may be interesting to some, not all art will find an audience or audience for its work. The problem with the biennial as an exhibitionary form is that it is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it draws audiences in with promise, inspiring consumption with lofty concepts and sweeping observations, but on the other, it restricts options and making one narrow and</text>

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, in which artists, curators, writers and other curators worked side by side with artists and groups of architects and engineers to discuss the biennale’s current situation, and to establish a new kind of international relationship between architecture and engineering. This project came to be known as Besank’s Architecture Series, and its themes of resilience and revolution were repeated across several biennials and multiple formative museum collections. In the case of Liverpool, the biennial format then extended well beyond the city itself, to other cities in England and to other continents. It was an important node in the historical relationship between architecture and the urban, and between architecture and countries, and the city now represents not only a failure, but a site of resistance and frustration for many people. The biennial format is a museum-based exhibitionary form that emerged in response to the city’s declining population and rapid growth, which made it easier to pack into one place and visit often. In these ways</text>

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, which was itself preceded by two biennales in 2017 and 2018, with a combination of new and old. The 2018 event may be considered a ‘re-formation’ of the medieval biennial, while the first two biennales of the 20th century may well be seen as reaction to this changing climate. In any case, the biennial format – which I have been using the term loosely here at LCBO – is here to stay.So what does the future hold for the biennial? I have no idea. I have a vague feeling that there is a shift happening now in which the curator is more important than ever. I see a curator-general emerging as a kind of de facto leader of the curatorial cadence. I don’t know what that would look like, but I do know that this is happening, and that it is happening now because the curator is no longer the sole author of the events that take place in the city. I think that</text>

It began as a series of exhibitions, culminating in the mid-2016 Bilbao Biennale, which was, in many ways, a supplement to the museum, as well as a way to celebrate the city’s rich past. But the biennial format has a life of its own. It is an element in a city’s infrastructure, a way of knowing, a way of being present in a city. It makes sense geographically: Liverpool is located in the north. So Liverpool Biennial will be situated in the city, in an area of the city that is very much like the city: very densely populated, very walkable, very well-served by transit, and home to numerous businesses. The exhibition format will be very much like that of a shopping mall, with segments such as ‘Redevelopment at a Glance’ or ‘Walking Tour’ providing an overview of areas of the city that are being developed but without specifying what those developments are. The idea will be to walk through the walking tour segments, and ask: what is it</text>

The Leverhulme Collection was then maintained by the Leverhulme Trust, which appointed a conservator to oversee the collection. In 2004, the Leverhulme Collection was sold to the British Council, who established the Leverhulme Trust, which manages the collection today.

The Museums were closed in the early 1900s, and the Leverhulme Development Company closed in 1922. The Museums and the Leverhulme Development Company were divided up in to several museums, with much of the architecture and interior decoration left behind. The Museums then reverted to the Department of Culture, and the Leverhulme Development Company was merged with the National Museums Service.  The reason why I’d like to think of the Leverhulme Development Company as a cultural institution is that it achieved such power through its patronage, which ensured that the architecture it produced would be taken up as a design proposal by local authorities and museums, and would be used in selecting sites for future major exhibitions.  So the power it had through patronage was itself a site for negotiation.  	In addition to the negotiating power it had through patronage, the Leverhulme Development Company also had the negotiating power of law.

The research project for this project, led by Historic Architecture, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust, and the Leverhulme Museum was supported by the Leverhulme Foundation. Historic Architecture is an independent, multi-disciplinary research organisation based in London. It was established in 2015 as part of the Leverhulme Trust, and the Leverhulme Museum is a museum of modern architecture. The Leverhulme Trust was established in 1867 to manage the property of the Leverhulme Development Company, which was formed in reaction to the closure of the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1869. The Leverhulme Development Company operated the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as the London and New Museum, and the Liverpool Museums. The Museums were closed in the early 1900s, and the Leverhulme Development Company closed in 1922. The Museums and the Leverhulme Development Company were merged in 1991, and the merged organisation became the Museums Liverpool.Today the museum is a major player in the city, and the Leverhulme Development Company is an important tenant in the neighbourhood, but its role in the city is largely ceremonial. The building of new museums is a form of cultural resistance, and as such it is a deeply embedded part of the organisation’s social function. The Leverhulme Development Company has a permanent collection of rare books, manuscripts and drawings, which it uses to teach and provide support for the Liverpool Biennial, as well as for a number of other exhibitions and activities. The collection is a treasure chest, containing over 1,000 books from more than a dozen countries, and includes more than 300 titles in the English, German, Russian and Armenian languages. The manuscripts were written in Armenian and Greek and were published in Greek and Italian under the title Stages I &amp; II, or ‘The Two Years�</text>

The Museums were closed in the early 1900s, and the Leverhulme Development Company closed in 1922. The Museums and the Leverhulme Development Company were closed to prevent the erosion of their assets, so excavating their collections was an important step in the process of their return to public use. The Leverhulme Development Company was dissolved in 1922, but the Museums and the Leverhulme Development Company have been preserved as part of the London and New Museum, and the Liverpool Museums. The Museums and the Leverhulme Development Company have excavated and published materials from the 1867 Liverpool Biennial, but no longer cooperate with the city or museum in its day to day activities. The Leverhulme Development Company was a pioneering developer of regeneration strategies for abandoned or underused sites in the city, and its initiative appears to have been driven by a desire to return to the urban centre rather than the island or the country. The goal of the company was to return the site to use by the local community, and in recent years, this has meant working with the community to create a urban farm,</text>
