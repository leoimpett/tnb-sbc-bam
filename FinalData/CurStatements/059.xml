Bouchra Khalifa is the only museum in the world that has been able to pay its way. Then I went underground. I was taken to an underground museum, which is very similar to the museum in the city, but underground. I went to the museum that was building a new section on the site of the old Palestine Mandate, and it’s now called ‘30 Years of Palestine’. It’s a chronological section, beginning with 1948. It’s based on a different, more radical reading of the place. I went underground once more, and then to the museum that was building a new section on the site of the old Palestine Mandate, and now called ‘Palestine Cinema’. It’s a concert</text>

I shouldn’t have gone there, back then, when the economic crisis was taking place, and the worldwide financial meltdown was starting. I went there as a tourist, to see for myself, for someone else to cite when the financial crisis came. That’s all I ever wanted to do. And now I’m old and grey and rich and famous and have the time of my life, and I’m not going to waste it anymore, because I’m rich and famous and have the time of my life, and it’s all gone now. I can’t be both a tourist and a museum collector. I’m broke now.Bouchra Khalifa, 2015. Photo courtesy of the artist.Funny story: when I first heard about the Bouchra Khalifa from N</text>

Bouchra Khalifa is the only museum in the world that has been able to pay its way. Bouchra Khalifa’s director, Asma Jahangiri, once led a pilgrimage to the site of the Prophet’s grave, and was murdered by an Islamic State militant. Jahangiri was the director of the British Museum, where Christopher Hillier, another director, was murdered. Jahangiri’s work is also the subject of a new documentary about her life, The Empty Space of the Prophet, to be shown in 2017. 	Khalifa is the only living member of the Curatorial family. She is the youngest of the curators, and she was raised in a secular Muslim family in the British Museum’s Upper East Side gallery. She has a sister, Amina, who is curator of Islamic cultural activities at the British Museum.In a 2015 interview, Khalifa spoke about how the Islamic State’s propaganda machine had influenced her practice.

Even the smallest of the biennials can raise awareness and money for a cause. The only thing that can keep a biennial from becoming a biennale is a biennial with a specific agenda. As biennials mature and broaden their curatorial approaches, they become more like other art forms, and in that process more like other art forms. Some biennials, and the curatorial approaches they present, are actually quite effective at bringing together disparate elements of the art world. Biennial funding has become an art form in its own right. In the twentieth century, it was an instrument through which artists and arts organisations ensured that their projects were not neglected or excluded from future biennials. Now it is a commoner, and the curatorial approach that it takes is what determines whether a project is considered worthy of inclusion or der</text>

It was too early, in fact. By the time I got there, the celebrations were already in motion. The Palestinian artists, scholars, activists, writers and collectors who formed the core of the exhibition’s audience were already there; the visitors were a mix of locals and visitors from the Arab world who came for the exhibitions, as well as visitors from places like Malaysia and China. The main exhibition hall was a dance of objects, and the multimedia part of the exhibition was a multimedia party. Assemblages of artists, curators, journalists and collectors were regulars. The main objective of the exhibition was celebrating the history of the art world in Palestine, and its relationship to the city it represented. And at</text>

The autonomous vehicle is a last resort, and while it is utilized sparingly, it is becoming increasingly difficult to understand its true motives. For instance, when faced with a prolonged black-out, the connected car may resort to dangerous levels of petrol and diesel to cover critical infrastructure gaps, but what it really needs is a way to connect with the electrical grid. 	Looking to the future, let’s look to the possibilities of connectedness in all its aspects. Let’s not forget the human element, and let’s not forget the human connection. 	Looking to the future, let’s look to the possibilities of cities composed of smart objects. Cities today are made up of sensors and data capture devices embedded in buildings and infrastructure, which enable cities to be populated and supplied with critical infrastructure goods and services</text>

Therefore, it is unable to adapt to changing demand and thus finds itself stuck in an ever-expanding, ever-dangerous capacity-market. In an effort to find alternative uses for scarce energy, the car industry has promoted itself as a singular creative-class resource, uniquely positioned to exploit the abundant natural resources of the planet. The industry maximizes the potential of any new technology by valuing its potentialities above all. This is why large corporations often develop disruptive technologies early in their businesses, when they expect this to happen at the earliest opportunity, usually when there is a glut of cheap energy on the planet. It is also why, in response to the advent of fracking, the oil and gas industries spent decades preparing for it with elaborate elaborate contingency plans, massive infrastructure upgrades and even biological and chemical weapons programs. These seemingly harmless energy technologies eventually mutated into devastating ecological disasters that devastated vast areas of the planet. Perhaps the most insidious aspect of the connected car is that, unlike other technologies that we have promoted and made ubiquitous, it is able to exploit human behaviour and cities in novel and unexpected ways. For instance, the connected car seems able</text>

Therefore, it is unable to adapt to changing demand and thus finds itself stuck in an ever-expanding, ever-dangerous capacity-market.  	Within this market, there is a conflict between those with a globalised future to build for and those without a future at all. The latter group includes the displaced people of today, who are forced to seek work in tomorrow's rubble. The connected car represents a possible escape from this apocalyptic predicament, but it does not quite meet the needs of today’s inhabitants. There is some good news: the connected car did meet one of its creators’s dreams: there was even a time when there were electric-car factories in Detroit! 	But the dream of a connected car did not live up to its promise, and while electric-car production in Detroit fell short of projections, it did meet planners’ expectations. There are signs that the economic engine that inspired the connected car could be reinvigorated in the city’s revitalisation. The question is whether the people who designed and built the car in the 1990s can be allowed to reclaim its</text>

Therefore, it is unable to adapt to changing demand and thus finds itself stuck in an ever-expanding, ever-dangerous capacity-market. The connected car is vulnerable to a variety of forces shaping energy flows, yet it is also prone to a certain amount of ephemeralism – an art form that seeks to exploit everyday behaviours – yet it is also able to deploy powerful new cognitive tools to discern reality from fiction. This kind of thinking is part of what the connected car represents to consumers: technology is a powerful tool that can render any setting possible. But for this to happen, we need a fundamentally different kind of understanding of the possibilities. We need to understand how the connected car represents energy in the socio-political and urban context. And we need to develop strategies to leverage this understanding.In this regard, we can consider how the car represents energy in its service belt. This is how we imagine the future energy landscape would be like if all cars and trucks on the planet switched to electric cars and trucks, but instead of driving them, passengers board them from stations around the globe. This would mean that travel would be possible between</text>

In an ideal world, the connected car would display realistic statistics and allow drivers to know how much energy they are using, how much pollution they are creating and, most importantly, how much damage they are doing to the environment. Yet these are just the fuel-economy statistics of the future car, designed to please the technologists and fuel the imagination of the privileged few. The real game is in the house, played out within the built environment. The question is, what does the future home look like? This is the persistent illusion of complacency that pervades policy-makers, practitioners and many others who inhabit the built environment, oblivious to the damage that real housing does to the planet.  The answer is: it depends. How we build our housing and urban futures depends on what kind of imagination and mindset we have growing up. If our imagination is built on fossil fuels, our mindset and mentality is also built on them. If we let those two gasses fill our cities with</text>

This is the predicament of those caught in the car of the connected car: it cannot go faster or further, and thus it must always find a way to consume more and more of our scarce natural resources.  	When looking at the infrastructure of our cities, we can see that the connected car is not a singular event that occurred in a given geographical area; rather, it is a multi-sited and multi-functional artefact. It is a ‘transportation infrastructure’ that provides capacity for many modes of movement, yet is also a stationary object that delivers only incremental improvements in terms of efficiency and quality of life. 	In order to achieve greater capacities for many modes of movement, connected cars would have to evolve faster and penetrate deeper into urban environments. This would require an even larger and more diverse range of car models and models, to include fully electric cars and plug-in hybrids, as well as fully electric minivans and cars with fully electric and hydrogen fuel</text>

It is also one in which technology is omnipresent. Yet there are signs that suggest that technology may one day return to the city in important ways that resemble the ways in which we live now. A city that is resilient to the unpredictable is a city that is simultaneously fascinating and frustrating. The ability to harness energy from the environment in novel and unexpected ways is one such example. A city that harnesses the latent potential of the urban domain may well one day return to the city as a function of habitation, much like the ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations that flourished for thousands of years before we were born.   Bakunin on Metaphysics and Empirical Experience   (1839) 	In considering the historical and contemporary origins of our urban environments, we must begin to understand that the city is not an organic outgrowth of industrial production but must be understood as an immense social and political</text>

This version of the connected car is a technological artifact, created in part to meet regulatory timelines. Yet the capacity of such cars to meet ever-flexing international conditions is questionable. As a consequence, most of the developing world is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the kind of geopolitical instigation typically associated with a fully automated, market-based future. Even as the connected car industry booms, other types of infrastructure is being increasingly exposed to the kind of stress and unpredictability associated with a fully autonomous future.This type of vulnerability is particularly insidious. It is increasingly likely that the car that you buy will be driven by a driver who is more easily absorbed into the landscape, and whose behaviour is guided by the software that is installed in the car. You may not even know that the car is driving itself, but every time you stop, the car senses that you are in motion and issues you with a manual that is as autonomous as possible. Consequently, your driving will become increasingly intelligent, allowing the car</text>

For instance, if traffic lights are turned off in the car, but the driver does not pay attention to them, there is a risk that the car will engage in a chain reaction of problems that could end up with a gridlocked urban environment. In such cases, the connected car must be programmed to spot traffic lights and douse their emergence with energy as much as possible.Yet the connected car has its limits. While it may employ artificial intelligence and control systems, it is unable to anticipate when a problem will arise that can be programmed to exploit energy resources. Therefore, it is unable to adapt to changing demand and thus finds itself stuck in an ever-expanding, ever-dangerous capacity-market. In an effort to address these problems, connected cars will have to be able to perceive when there is a problem on the horizon and thus act accordingly. This is the age of the anthropologist-driven future, and while there are many forms of this, the main challenge for anthropologists researching in the future will be different from those of the past. For instance, the challenges of climate change will be different, and will undoubtedly be more protracted and controversial. There will be many forms of this, and anthropologists will have to master all of them.The other major influencer of the future, which I will come to shortly, is religion. As we age, our planet is releasing increasingly large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, which causes changes to the climate that can be measured and predicted. Changes in the climate are already occurring and are magnifying. By the century’s end, most scientists agree that the impacts will be profound. Therefore, the kinds of technological capability needed to forecast</text>

Most alarmingly, this long shadow – which can be seen as a future danger – is being visited upon us all. The connected car represents a future in which cybernetics reign supreme, energy becomes the currency of the new dominant paradigm, and environmental destruction is routine. Yet there is still a way to go before such visions become a reality. Until then, the connected car remains a fantasy.That is, until the reality of the situation is brought to bear on the need for such cars. That is, until we can demand, or more accurately, propitiate, that kind of infrastructure from the infrastructure firms that design and maintain it. Then the infrastructure will have to be invented and constructed. That is, until we can demand and reap the benefits of a fully realized connected car industry. That is, until the need arises for cars to discharge vast amounts of energy into the developing world. When that time comes, the need will be enormous.

In 2012, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Archaeology (FAE) established the first Smithsonian Contributions Fund, which supports the Museum of Modern Art’s archaeological and historical research. The Museum of Modern Art’s current budget is about 20% funded by the FAF, 20% funded by the LA County Museum of Art and 20% funded by the LA Department of Cultural Affairs. 	The Museum of Modern Art’s collection room, the Gallery of Modern Art, became a popular destination for visiting artists. In the early 1990s, when the art market was in its infancy and the Museum of Modern Art was established, the Gallery of Modern Art held regular shows in the early evening, attracting artists and curators from all over the world. In 1999, the Gallery was expanded to host shows in the afternoon and evening. In 2011, the Gallery was closed to the public during the summer.

In 2012, the Museum of Modern Art opened a new, artists-only, no-photo-op-section, dedicated to its artists’ work. ‘Outsider’ status in the Museum of Modern Art was extended to a third of the building, which became a hub for artists, curators, and other artists’ supporters during the exhibition’s opening week. This practice of holding back content for the dedicated fan club or the museum-going public is common in biennials, and it was a significant factor in the exhibition’s success: offering a curated experience while also providing a place to gather for the occasion. Here, the public is invited into the museum through a self-guided tour that follows the museum’s curatorial approach to art making, its curatorial language, and its curatorial microsite. This intimate and representative curatorial approach to the art making of the twenty-first century begins with the twenty-first Venice Biennale, which</text>

In 2012, the Museum of Modern Art merged with the Museum of Art and Design, becoming a museum dedicated to the design and culture of modern urban environments. The new museum is a significant addition to its long-standing collection of contemporary art, but it is also a significant departure from its initial '70s avant-garde focus. The new museum is a showcase for a new style of modern urbanism that seeks to simultaneously archive and analyse the past, present and future (subjects, after all, are important in the museum business). It is a record of the avant-garde, but it is also a museum of the future. This is the mode of the contemporary museum, and while the avant-garde and its practitioners had a significant presence in the 1960s and '70s, the museum business is no longer the dominant form of cultural organisation in the United States, and the increasing number of objects brought into circulation during this period is a museum of the future.  	</text>

In 2012, the Museum of Modern Art, with its collection of art, objects and materials, became the subject of a $3 million gift from the San Fernando Valley Community Land Trust. In 2015, the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art merged to form the newly established LA County Museum of Art. The new entity is committed to the collection, storage and exhibition of art from the different museums and the community land trusts it supports.It is important to note that, unlike in conventional museums, the purpose of the biennial is to support a permanent exhibition of art from a particular place, time and/or context. Rather, the aim of the biennial is to foster dialogue and exchange between art institutions, between people from different places and even between different times. This is why biennials have specific titles such as ‘The Treaty Book’ or ‘The Contemporary Condition’ and have collections that are widely distributed. This collection and distribution also explains why artists’ collections are often housed</text>

In 2012, the LA County Museum of Art and Lyric Theatre were incorporated into the newly designated LA Unified Arts Commission, a public agency that oversees the arts and culture of the county. The Commission is an autonomous body appointed by the LA Mayor and sworn to preserve the arts for the benefit of all Californians. It is comprised of representatives from the mayor, the county executive, representatives from LAUSD and the LA Sheriff's Departments, as well as representatives from non-profit arts organizations. The Commission was established with the mission to ensure that the arts are of value to the community by: 1. Reinventing civic engagement through art and culture; 2. Supporting local self-starting and culturally responsive art and culture initiatives through grants, commissions, and the collection; and 3. Providing leadership and funding for culturally responsive art and culture initiatives through the creation of culturally responsive locales.  	[i] The LA/Orange County Register, 11/22/2015, http://www.latimes</text>

In 2012, the LA County Museum of Art added a digital media archive to its existing collection of art, objects and materials, and has been collecting and preserving material from the Museum of Modern Art ever since. The hardware and software used to create the exhibits and the accompanying online collections are still produced and operated by the biennial, although the biennial's online collection is made up of works previously exhibited in the museum but now owned by Google. The Library of Congress generally does not regulate the display, transport, use or business of existing collections or collections, but it does control how these materials are used and arranged. Its mandate is to research and collect, but it has the opportunity, in consultation with the curatorial team, to transform or arrange these materials in any way it chooses.

The scale of the objects found in the exhibition is intended to make a statement: each of these images represents one of the objects. The objects found in the exhibition are assembled from disparate materials and come from different eras. They are meant to be seen in the context of the historical situation in which they were produced, and to a particular point in time. In this exhibition, they are juxtaposed against stacks of documents from different periods in time, and then arranged in chronological order of discovery. Each object is literally a fragment of a much larger whole. This juxtaposition is part of what the exhibition is about. The other part of the exhibition is about the historical situation in which they were produced. The objects in the collection have particular symbolic value today, and the juxtaposition expresses the historical situation in a particular way.  In the exhibition, the curators look for symbolic value in the objects in the collection, and create a symbolic episode through their discovery. They do this by asking provocative questions, which are intended to stir thought and provoke a reaction. The aim of the exhibition is to provoke a thought</text>

The images speak of fabrics and textile production at a global scale. The collection’s focus on fashion is a response to the global phenomenon of fashion, a constantly shifting term that has created a multitude of imitations and cleverly disguised practices. The images weave together different aspects of the global fashion industry – physical, mental and cultural – in an effort to make a statement that is both precise and powerful.

The objects found in the exhibition are assemblages of various materials, some of them semi-precious, some of them common; they are collectively part of a larger assemblage that is a work of art as well as an object of destruction. The title of the exhibition, ‘Fabrication of Space’, suggests that the assemblages are assemblages of different kinds of objects, but what the hell are they? And why are they all arranged in neat, ordered patterns? I am not making a categorisation of the assemblages, but what the hell are they doing in a gallery of art? Why are they in a gallery of art?

The images show the earliest stages of a process of design that is continuous with the development of human culture during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

In this sense, the objects in the exhibition are narrativising events that are, in fact, unfolding all around them. The exhibition is a kind of ‘presentation of things as they are, happening now, in a particular place, in a particular time’. In other words, it is a ‘story’ rather than a ‘sequence of events, occurrences, or things’. This exhibition is not, however, intended to tell a ‘story’ in the traditional sense.

Assembled by a Curatorial Faculty comprising representatives from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Huntington Museum of Art, The New Museum, and the Liverpool Biennial, the team took the elements found in the architecture of twenty-one cities – in particular, the vernacular, the commercial, the industrial and the residential – and applied them to the curatorial intervention of the twenty-first century. Their project was curatorial in character, and their exhibition ran counter to the trends of international contemporary art fairs. The twenty-one curatorial interventions took the forms of performances, public meetings, writing prompts, research trips, and online exhibitions. Their digital impact came as a result of their research-based, material- and-mesh design, as well as their immersive, multi-use exhibitions.

The main topic of the exhibition is space, but there is considerable reference to the social and urban impacts of industrialisation in India and other developing countries. The fabrics, paraphernalia and craft supplies found in the exhibition are items of fashion accessory, often used as evidence of technological success. The Indian city is the prototype of a predicted global technology hub, and the world is designed around the city, not apart from its infrastructure, which is part of the original urban fabric.

This is the story of how the Museum of Modern Art acquired its collection and its collection of images, in an event that became known as the Collection Addition, and how that collection came to be populated with works by a curator chosen largely on the basis of his or her self-perceived knowledge and appreciation of contemporary art. This is the story of how an art gallery could potentially function in the world as a source of cultural capital and how that might start a conversation about how art and art’s social impacts may have changed, if not yet globalised.Download this article as PDFJennifer CorcoranJennifer Corcoran is Professor of Exhibition Research at the Victoria and Albert Museum and Director of Exhibition Research Lab 3 at SOAS, where she leads research projects into art’s social impact.

Although there is some evidence that such cultural capital may shape practices and ideologies in ways that benefit those at the top, there is much more work to do. Finally, the question remains whether, absent social change, the biennale could also function as a source of contemporary understandings of itself and the world. This may be seen as a particularly Japanese-style ­– or ‘Indian’ ­– way of thinking about the world. In that case, the biennale would see its main mission as supporting the national art museum or museum of the country in its curatorial work, as well as staging public events and ‘mementos’ that reflect the socio-politically relevant information that is currently available to the museum. It would also, of course, like to see its collection of art and art’s raw materials used in the same way as museum collections are used today: as raw materials that are capable of supporting future generations to draw upon when constructing future cities, for example. This last aspect is one that art professionals and biennials around the world could learn a lot from. This is partly because, today, art collections and biennials are data feeds into one another, with collections and biennials producing and displaying data that informs art’s value and cultural capital today. As a result, it is easy to see how the two worlds may differ in their own way, and how biennials may be counted among artworks that are part of the collective experience of art today. That said, the task that remains is to work together to realise the biennial as a workable combination of artworks and communities, one that is not bound by the rigid categories of art museums and biennials. That combination would need to be found and fully embraced by both art lovers and those yet to be counted among them. The current level of engagement with art from a global perspective is a product of exhaustive knowledge acquisition, consumption and repetition,</text>

Final thoughts 	In the current biennial format, there is a strong focus on art and art’s temporal character, with no real focus on the artists or the craft that goes into creating that art. This is perhaps the case for biennials in other contexts, but in the contemporary context of the biennial, the biennial has largely absorbed the art museum, the contemporary art market and major art fairs into one consolidated mass of exhibitionary activities. Although some biennials do produce curatorial changes and innovations, the primary purpose and original focus of the biennial remains the same. Today, the main tool in the biennial's toolkit is its institutional capacity to identify, capture and organise disparate types of art, places, people and experiences into manageable forms that can be exhibited together. The biennial’s public relations machine is a powerful tool, and its flexible, adaptable and ever-changing format</text>

This last ambition may be seen as a challenge to the traditional biennale format, which prizes the preserved historical value of collections over the potential of new information that can be gathered from them. For this reason, curators today are much more likely to explore the significance of a collection of artworks when it is being curated rather than when it is being exhibited; and they are far less likely to present a work that is being made by that collection. One example of this in the biennale format is provided by the New York Museum of Art, which has been exploring the historical significance of the collection of porcelain vessels it has acquired from the city government in order to begin the process of restoring them to their original function of holding water. Although this is a potential end point for the art collection in New York, it is not clear that the collection would be strong enough to support the work, or both the art and the water, when it is actually being brought</text>

He couldn’t afford many friends. He wasn’t invited many friends’ birthday party. He was isolated from the outside world. He was raised in a Muslim home. But one day, while walking to school, he met a guy named Omar…who then introduced him to the art world. The next day, he went to see the Ramada Westin hotel. Westin was the daughter of British colonialists and had a collection of art by British artists. She was also an artist, and her father was a painter. All the galleries in the Westin’s hotel were closed to the public, except for a few VIP rooms. So, Nasser decided to visit the museum of Modern and Contemporary Art instead.This is how Nasser describes his introduction to the art world:When I was two, I came across Don</text>

The question, then, becomes what comes after the art and art’s raw materials? When, then, does the biennale become something that is independent of and even at odds with the art, or something that is a composite of both? Biennales, like all art forms, are distinctive in that their objects and actions are essentially creative acts. That is, they are not objects or artefacts of art, but rather creative in their own way, and art has a place in this definition.1. The 2015 Biennale of Sydney is a rare exception to the rule. The art opening and the art’s own power as a producer of content is what makes the Biennale stand out as different from other forms of art openings. The introduction of the 2015 Biennale of Sydney did not come with a pre-conceived idea of the museum as a site of art’s reception, but rather with the force of a policy decision</text>

It may be that, absent social change, the only way to truly understand and appreciate the world around us is to become involved in creating it ourselves. This may be the case, in part, because, today, participation in art and art collections is widespread and dependent on the little known but essential function of the museum. The biennale, therefore, may be seen as a kind of urban proxy that reveals, in a constantly expanding and transforming way, the hidden and surreptitious ways in which art is actually made and consumed. And part of the job of the biennale is to find art that is still hidden and surreptitious. In this sense, the role of the museum may not only be to preserve art from being destroyed but to discover it. This is one way in which the institution is today considered modern and progressive. This is also one reason why, in recent years, curatorial work has become more and more autonomous and the museum as</text>

The institute’s early history is a story of forced integration and cultural marginalization. Beginning with the expulsion of large numbers of Indian artists and intellectuals in the wake of the First World War, a racist colonialist policy was implemented that sought to separate the two cities. This policy of aggressive colonialism faced a people with a significant artistic tradition – Kanpur – in particular, who were confronted with the prospect of leaving the city. The campus became a military installation and later, the headquarters for the Indian Agents, an all-India paramilitary group engaged in suppressing artistic talent. This was part of a broader Indian Agents campaign to undermine art and visual culture throughout India. Over 1,000 artists and artists’students were rounded up and sent to prison camps in the mid-1920s.Of course, the Indian Agents didn’t invent or create culture wars.

Quantum computer, also known as superposition, is a type of computer that operates in an infinite loop and that achieves ‘instantaneous character recognition’ by employing exotic mathematical predicates. Like other computer algorithms, quantum computers program a set of numbers into existence at a fixed point in time. Like other kinds of programming, however, ‘quantum computers’ perform calculations that cannot be performed on regular computers.

When the Fletcher School of Architecture opened its doors in 2010, it signaled a new era for the institution: the creation of a multi-disciplinary centre dedicated to the study and research of urbanization and sustainable development for cities worldwide. At the time, it was also seen as a way to address an increasingly globalized and transitory urban landscape. Today, the Fletcher School is a globally recognised centre for its kind of urbanization, which has become critical in addressing issues of climate change and socio-political instability. Its activities include a research centre, an exhibitionary space, a manufacturing plant and an innovative business opportunity. What is the relationship between architecture and urbanization?

In the current writing of the book, she explores the &quot;social capital&quot; of new media technologies and how this infrastructural capital is connected to (but distinct from) the social. In addition to the institutional and political infrastructures that infuse new media with new life and inform practices, there is an immediate and (potentially) long-term social capital component to the mode of infrastructuralisation that is now unfolding in the context of the planet as a whole. This is evident in the ways in which social and environmental justice are being addressed via technology in the context of globalisation and in the ways in which digital technologies are displacing traditional media and media infrastructures.

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same kind of pattern, the notable exception is the rare arty-type mega-exhibition that exhibits material from different periods simultaneously, as a rule with a continuous running commentary on the material being put out there. Arty-type exhibitions are rare, and rarefaction is the rarest of commodities. 	So while the biennale is an occurence, a display, a material form, and a material media format – a physical manifestation of the economic – it is something else entirely, and much more elusive, and yet displays a great deal of essence in the world of exhibition. How to know About It 	There are a number of responsive questions that visitors frequently ask when looking at biennales and other art-historical occasions: (1) what is it like to be at the Biennale, and (2) what does it feel like to be at the Biennale? While these are valid questions, they are also often misconstrued or</text>

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same kinds of themes, there is one important difference between the mega-exhibition and the museum-like institution: the former is territorial in character, while the latter tends to be rather ephemeral and transient. 	So what are the boundaries for the biennale that are as fluid as the boundaries of the biennale itself? I believe that what is most needed is a concept that accurately represents the current state of knowledge about the city as a material substrate. ‘Thing-the-world’, as the name of the current international conference series Element, Incorporates Matter, which began in November 2016, and will continue until April 2018, in San Francisco. I propose the concept as ‘Tokyo Sculpture Park’, a hybridised and modelled on something that has become standardised in the city: the urban landscape as a continuous series of manufactured zones. I believe that the park functions as a single point of departure to explore a number of different</text>

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same kinds of themes and offer or demand the same kinds of material, the major innovation of the biennale has been the proliferation of material-intensive displays that demand and expose as much as possible of what is displayed. 	As a visitor to Venice, I can report that, while there are certainly changes to be made in the way in which the biennale is presented, I do not think that the overall trend is in my favour. The main reason for this is that, for various reasons (ranging from the financial to the political to the other), contemporary art is often presented as a symptom of a generalised malaise rather than an integral part of a curatorial concern. And although I do not have a cure for this general malaise, I do think that we need to be conscious of when we do in fact seek to diagnose it as a malaise. I mention this as one example of the changes that need to be made in the way in which art is presented</text>

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same collections, this is the dominant one at the moment. The museum-like institution is being slowly (but inexorably) eroded away at a rate that is almost un-imaginable in its present condition. 	So what might be possible in the context of a biennale? I can think of three areas in particular ripe for the development of what can be seen as a ‘biennialised’ form: (1) the collection-focused, site-specific, and ‘biennialised’ forms of the present biennial; (2) the collection-specific, site-specific and ‘biennialised’ forms of contemporary art in general; and (3) the collection-focused ‘biennialised’ forms of art that take place in the world of biennales. 	In no way can the three listed areas be considered complete or complete. Much remains untapped or un-explored. Nevertheless, each of them</text>

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same crowds, size, and form, the main driver for the biennale remains the materiality of a site, its increasing capacity to inhabit and inhabit again, its ability to be visited and observed again, and so forth. It is true that in the 1990s and early 2000s there was a slightly revived interest in the biennale as a concept, and in particular as an urban form, because of the increasingly urgent need to be seen as a visitor to the city, as a global phenomenon, and so on. But these visual forms have been around for hundreds or even thousands of years, and so are bound to some extent to be rooted in the historical and anthropological roots of the practice. 	In any case, there is a certain logic to the desire to inhabit, and there is a certain materiality and normality to the mode of biennales. There is a logic to the constant re-occurrence of the same exhibition or festival at the same site or in the</text>

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same primary objective of gathering together and displaying as many different kinds of material as possible, the mega-exhibition is clearly the one to target, to the extent that this is in the public’s interest. 	There are of course other kinds of exhibition as well: those that target specifically at a particular market (market research firm Euromonitor finds that major exhibitions of art and design tend to be located in the US and Europe), those that target an ethnic or racial group (Granby Four Streets artists, for example), and some that target a particular city (Toronto Arts Alliance, 2003). But the obvious prize for any such programme is obviously the one that pays for itself – in the form of a visitor numbers and an arts organisation's profile increases, and so does its financial viability. 	It is easy to understand the attraction of such a target audience for a biennial: it is hard to comprehend the other kind, but equally harder to ignore it. A target audience is a</text>

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same themes and seek to do so in an increasingly influential and influential way, the biennale has certainly embraced these themes and run with them, and now more than ever, with good reason. 	There are of course many more forms of exhibition that can and do exist, and I invite any and all contributors to this article to explore this diverse field. For me, this includes the various forms of performance, from private to public, that can be found in many places across the world, and the important work they do in bringing art and culture together and in doing so bringing us together. But as several readers have pointed out, many of these are participatory, interactive, and ‘game-changing’ in their own ways, and thus deserve to be reckoned as cultural products of the past, present, and future of the contemporary world.  	Many thanks to Kate Hoffman, Curator of Entomology, Natural History Museum, London, and Josephine Machon,</text>

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same or similar material, the mega-exhibition and the museum-like institution both inherit the impulse to the relative void. 	In recent decades, the biennale has largely been selected as a last resort, a last resort with high risks of not being taken seriously, or even noticed by the organisers. The vast majority of the time, this is the case. But there have been rare occasions when the biennale has been taken seriously, and those rare instances have been accompanied by a host of innovative and awe-inspiring display pieces that were only possible because the biennale was curated. 	While the potential for artistic and artistic-historical curatorial collaboration is great, this does not in any way negate the need for artistic and artistic-historical curators to be formed, and cultural geographers should realise this. Biennales are cultural geographers' worst nightmare. 	The biennale is a last resort. It is cultural in nature, and thus</text>

And while there are certainly many other forms of exhibition that exhibit the same themes and seek to address similar issues, they are all shown in venues that are ever-present, visible and – most importantly – home to other artists. 	Events such as the Venice Biennale and its surrounding exhibitions, which regularly redefine the terms of the exhibitionary race, certainly contributed to establishing the biennale as a post-traditional institution. But there are other, more regionalised and geopolitical forms of public display that are also appearing in greater numbers and frequency in the developed world, and that I would argue are contributing to eroding the boundary between culture and the local. 	What is becoming increasingly clear is that the biennale is entering a period of rapid change, to the extent that it is no longer able to sustain its traditional form. The traditional biennale, which is experiencing a decline in value and in many cases is actually becoming obsolete, is undergoing a major revamp aimed at more closely replicating the power of the biennale as a curatorial</text>

The website, which redirects to the 1940 issue of Popular Mechanics, is designed to be read in three dimensions. It is a ‘neat trick’ that makes use of 3-D modeling, but also incorporates text, images, and multimedia elements to tell a ‘bigger picture’. During the three-day conference, participants were invited to explore the origins of the fabric and its layers, the world of fashion and advertising, and how it would be possible to sew clothing from the future into the fabric of the present. They also had the opportunity to find out how their clothing might be made today.The conference took place in</text>

How do we create a shared social good through dialogue that is not dependent on the value of a single commodity?  How do we create a shared physical good through trade that is not dependent on the value of a single building? How do we create a shared knowledge economy through the production of peer reviewed publications? These are the kinds of questions that can help us imagine a future without resource scarcity or environmental degradation. The metrics may not agree, but they all measure the collective knowledge of a community of people. They all begin with the word ‘together’ and end with the word ‘behind’ – meaning everywhere. How do we start thinking about how to build a shared future?Download this article as PDFMeehan CristMeehan Crist</text>

Our metrics are simple: how many cars are on the road, and how many people are crammed in them? For the sake of argument, let ‘go ahead and assume that the social cost is reduced by 99.9% (although we should keep in mind that this is an upper bound). But the point is that cars and the social costs of car use are forms of energy that are shared. The social costs of sharing are, therefore, an open question.Here, then, is the second part of our symposium: the future of transportation.  The ubiquity of cars and the social costs of car use are reflections of a change in the way we understand how energy is generated and expended. And while the first part of our symposium focused on the environment, the second part is revealing, critical and evocatively titled The Public Transport of the Future. In other words, it asks: in what way are we going to build public transport in the future?  The symposium was tightly integrated into the larger Future City concept</text>

Our metrics are simple: how many cars are driven on London's roads?  How many homeless people are on the streets?

Governments around the world are now developing ambitious programs to bridge the gap between rich and poor, urban and rural, young and old, citizens and non-citizens, citizens and migrants. And these programs, though they may seem ambitious at first, are also often misguided and inefficient. For example, the way in which we produce energy in the UK is by burning fossil fuels through industry, but if the social costs of fossil fuels are to be shared, then we need to all be part of a solution. And so we move towards more inclusive and equitable funding streams. And eventually, we move towards new modes of urban and suburban planning that do away with the need for councils to be located in urban centres and instead build transit, public parks and other modes of shared use in the countryside.

How many babies are born in these cars? How many toilets do they use? How many doctors and nurses do they have to provide? What happens to the money that is raised when these metrics exceed a certain threshold?These questions are difficult to answer, partly because there is no global consensus on how to measure the social cost of sharing. Nonetheless, there are several metrics that can be developed and shared – shame-based, for example. The shame-based system proposes a proportionate share of the social cost of a car accident to be shared between the driver and the passenger. And the share is a ratio: a ratio of how many toilets do you need, in relation to how many cars you drive. So a car that causes twenty one accidents is worth roughly one hundredth of a car that causes five hundred. And so the system asks drivers to share.The present shame-based social cost of sharing system is an antiquated relic that is no longer needed. International comparisons about</text>

And in the developing world, the price of oil is around $40 per barrel.  The social cost of sharing, then, remains an open question. Our metrics are simple: how many cars are on the road, and what are the CO2 emissions associated with those cars?  How many hamburgers are on the menu, and what do the servers and customers in Hamburg, Germany, think of when they eat out? These questions, and more, remain unsettled. In an attempt to fill the gap, companies often offer social, economic and cultural benefits to workers engaged in car production, such as servers and customers. Yet these workers often decline these overtures, or minimise the role of the city in the metropolis. This leaves the metropolis wide-open to attack by wildcat strikes and other disruptive tactics. The question, then, shifts from the city to the metropolis: how do the social impacts of car production affect the social impacts of the city? How do the social impacts of car production affect the social impacts of the city? These are questions that can no longer be addressed using the old adage ‘Where is the Car?’. Instead, we</text>

How many toilets are there in the city? How many delivery men are there? How many fast-food outlets are there? How many yoga studios are there?  Or more simply, how many burgers are there? Burger counters, after all, are places where food is consumed. And how are the social values of the city defined? How are the social values of the city produced and delivered? The two most valuable human assets of the modern city – the capacity to produce and to deliver – are constrained by the fact that the city is a set of goods and services. The capacity to produce, then, remains a problem.And yet, the capacity to produce is a problem. The metainterface recognises when a system call needs updating. It updates itself. And so, the social value of the metainterface is realised when the city is updated.

The point is to get to know the city, to understand the city and its people. And yet the city seems to retain a certain amount of mystery and strangeness. We only get a glimpse of the vast metropolis that comprises London, through the city buses that continuously parade past empty streets or through the blind alleys leading to the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and so on. And we barely glimpse the people – the homeless, the homeless, the drug addicts, the muggings – that inhabit this city.

I appreciate the way you describe the ‘collapse’ of art forms — art, critics, collectors — and its aftermath as a ‘recovery’. I also appreciate the way you identify the contemporary art market as one pockmarked with ‘contagions’, with artworks increasingly displaced as resources shift from place to place, and are increasingly at odds with one another.

Lucía Sanromán told me a bit about the new manifestation of the museum that you designed in San Diego — the kind that you’d commission artists to produce if you wanted a museum of SF, rather than commission an artist to make one. She said that the museum that you were thinking of had a kind of a hiatus — it’s now a kind of a ‘restoration’. I wondered what that meant. Is the kind of restorative hiatus that you’d want in the form of a museum? And also, what does it mean to restore a form?

I was struck by how much the discussion revolved around the biennale as a form — specifically, the relation between the artist and the biennale. You mention the importance of culture for artists. I feel that way of thinking. But I also see that there’s a critical dimension to it. For example, the Biennale of Modern Art in Berlin had a project that sought to reconcile the different registers of the museum — curatorial, administrative, material — in a way that would reconcile them as artists. There’s a temptation for curators to produce a museum that represents the world as</text>

Maybe it was more about the characters you created in that fictional museum than about the art itself. But the point was that you imbued the forms you observed in that fictional museum with aspects of your own. That’s what I’d like to ask you again: what does it mean to imbue forms with aspects of one?

Is the kind of restorative hiatus that you’d want in the form of a museum? And also, what does it mean to restore a form of art? Because I feel like there’s a kind of a gap between the historical and the procedural, between the historical and the procedural, between the historic and the procedural — that’s really interesting to me. Also, between the historical and the procedural — in the sense that is, as L’ubach would say — between the historical and the virtual, which is interesting to me, because I think the form of that kind of historical and procedural difference that you describe is very interesting. For me, the other thing that she was talking about is the difference between the temporal and the spatial. And I think that there’s a gap between the temporal and the spatial because of the temporal — we don’t have a concept for what the temporal is, and we don’t have a concept for what the spatial is. But there is a conceptual difference between the two. And I think that what she meant by ‘temporal’</text>

But I still don’t know what a biennial is.Is it the same as a museum?I also want to ask about the difference between biennials and museums, because in general, I think that the way that biennials are different from museums is that they have no permanent home. They’re temporary residences, like hotels or schools. And I think that’s what museums are: permanent homes.Biennials, on the other hand, often have a kind of ‘home’ that’s permanently built into the city — like Tijuana’s Mara Salvatrucha Museo — which is a kind of ‘home’ that can be maintained and maintained (through donations and events like</text>

It is indeed a pity that the inhabitants of this future will become caged animals living in cages, as is the case with humans today. But it is not our fault that the buildings we inhabit are built on the rubble of the industrial past; nor do we deserve to become caged animals living in smaller, more intimate settings.

Despite efforts to embed low-cost, low-emissions materials in buildings and urban environments, a large majority of people still lack access to safe drinking water, electricity and sanitation, and many more still lack access to healthy food. The rapid growth of global urban populations and the suburbanisation of large parts of the country has put enormous demands on ever-larger water resources. As a result of all this, the number of people living in urban centres has increased by nearly two-thirds between 1973 and 2014. The global urban population grew by over nine million, and as a result of this, the amount of water required to support an additional nine million people grew. 	Thus, the need for ever-greater water resources</text>

He was captured by the Red Cross and sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he was interrogated by the Military Intelligence Service (MI6), which, according to the official report, was engaged in a ‘war on terror’. According to the witness statement of Major General Norman Wilkinson, a spokesperson for the Intelligence Agency allegedly claimed that ‘our Jew’ was a double agent working for the enemy.’ The implication was that Canguilhem was a supporter of the Nazi cause, and that his collaboration would help the enemy win the war. According to Wilkinson, Canguilhem ‘had invented a new language, equating Communism and Nazism with the ribandier.[10] The claim is utterly without foundation, and clearly contradicts the accepted historical fact that the emergence of language as a political concept was the direct result of the First World War.

During this time, he met and fell in love with Margit Mayer Rothschild, who would become his wife. The couple embarked on a photographic archive, which they named the ‘Crocodile Recordings’ – after the mythical beast with the snake and the chariot – and published these images as part of a monograph of landscape and photography called Animal Magnet.In time, the couple’s archive grew and they turned to archiving, but it was the rise of sound that first made visible these images, as well as the recording industry in the late twentieth century (postwar digitisation became the order of the day), and the soundproof booths of the 1950s and early 1960s.

Nowadays, the term is often used in reference to parties at a museum, although this is clearly not the same as a ‘fortnight’ as such a night is now.

He did not choose to fight in the war, but he remained in the country for several years and posed for numerous art books and magazines, including a series of portraits of the then chancellor, Herman Goering, with his Range Rover Sport utility vehicle registered to Canguilhem.The question of his military service comes up whenever the subject of photography, even in the military, comes up. It seems a truism of the 21st century that one can be photographed anywhere and anywhere, and it is therefore not surprising that the subject of a popular culture art project is also a common place in the 21st century. But it is also true that in the early 1900s, when the first World War was fought, the United States was embroiled in the conflict as a direct result of British involvement in the war. As a consequence, the image of the absent soldier is often juxtaposed with that of the present, in which the image of the absent soldier is often juxtaposed with that of the present. In</text>

He was awarded the Military Cross and Dazzle Cross, and was given the Legion d'Honneur by the French government. On his return to France, he was awarded the Crois de Guerre, and the Gaget de la Gagatine, a ‘trophy for a single image’. The Crois de Guerre is a royal decree that recognises distinguished French photo-editors, and the Gaget de la Gagatine is a medieval award for photo-realism. These two awards – recognized members of the French photographic community – act as formal badges of rank, showing the way in which a photo was considered important in the war effort. In this context, these awards recall the connections between photography and the visual arts, and the intellectuals and artists who contributed to Vorticism.These images, taken during the war, are a part of the National Gallery collection, which is now housed in the Louvre.

He captured the heroic sacrifice of the French soldiers who volunteered to fight in the war, and he used these images as propaganda for the war effort. Upon his return to France, he was awarded the Legion of Honor. Although not an artist himself, Canguilhem understood the significance of images and images capturing the heroic act of valour. In the aftermath of the war, he continued to photograph and document the war effort, and his images of valour are among the most recognisable in the history of the war.I was in a position to be able to observe Canguilhem at work in the 1930s, and I feel that the images I captured were indeed of battlefields, but also of suffering, despair and violence. I was not there, but the memories are very vivid. The gallant Focht was certainly among those who died, but the sheer scale of their suffering and brutality is beyond description.

He was not invited by the British to participate in the ‘Puritan’ Drum performance in the UK, but as the name suggests, he chose to remain silent in the public arena. Canguilhem was a writer and editor whose work depicted the German occupation of France and the Holocaust. In the early 1950s, he published a memoir that was both polemic and critically acclaimed. It was published in French in 1958, in English in 1961, and in both ‘first and ‘second editions. In English, it was reissued in 1967 under the title Of Mice and Men’. Canguilhem’s photographs of the French border, taken during the war, are among the most widely reproduced images of the conflict.Among the images that remain of the ‘most emblematic moment’ in the book is one of the dead crossing the Tarsier River into the Belgian Congo.

He was 21 years old when he died, but his body is notoriously damaged. Many of his negatives are blacked out or destroyed, and his work is almost entirely buried or forgotten in the present-day chaos of the Holocaust. Nonetheless, his negatives form the backbone of the photographic record, and his images of the Third Reich are among the most iconic and iconic images of the twentieth century. That he chose to remain in Germany and continue to receive Nazi propaganda posters and death camps testament to the power and corruptibility of the Nazi machine.The night he died, Canguilhem was celebrating the end of the war. In the years that followed, his body became a museum collection, part of a public museum system that hosted exhibitions that explored the effects of war on culture.

He volunteered to photograph Soviet troops fighting in Afghanistan, but was instead captured and taken prisoner by the Soviets. A few months into his captivity, he was brutally tortured, and eventually became a Soviet spy. Returning to France, he was able to join the liberation of Paris from Soviet occupation, but his captors returned to demand that he hand over all his negatives. Unable to comply, he gave up his passport and fled across the border into Canada. There, he was arrested and tried for espionage, but was found innocent and sent back to the USSR. There, he spent eight years in solitary confinement before being released on bail and sent back to the USA to be with his family. When he was released in February 1949, he embarked on a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment, and eventually, in April of that year, he was brutally murdered.The following year, in May, American poet Upton Sinclair published a poem in the magazine that he had self-published a year earlier.

He took over photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art after the war, and continued to photograph the war effort in the UK, during the interwar period. His photographs of the front were often used to lobby for the role of the photographer in the war effort, and during this time, ‘fortnight’ became a term of endearment in the popular imagination. In 1945, Walter Isaacson published The Six Million Man, a US naval intelligence report on the war, in which the role of the photographer was emphasised. In the report, the photographer was described as ‘the single most effective of the medium casualties’.[12]The adoption of the term ‘fortnight’ by the military did not come without complications and contradictions, and in fact many in the photographic community felt that the term had become something that was above all firmly embedded in the collective vocabulary.

He did not fight in the war, but returned to Paris to continue his photography. Despite this refusal, he captured the carnage in the city and its environs for over a year, from June 1940 to November 1942. The photographs he took during this time are highly distressing, but are also wildly prescient, for they depict the horror of the Nazi regime in its many guises, including the total subordination of the civilian to the military. In these photographs, the soldiers are not even in uniform, but act as if they were gods and goddesses, speaking as if the people are pagans and pagans everywhere. In these photographs, the human sacrifice is complete, but the sense of the work – which is therefore not actually performed but imagines an entirely different world – is very real. These photographs are part of the larger collection that the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art acquired in a 1990 gift from the British Museum.The collection also includes photographs from the Jewish Chronicle archive, including images</text>
