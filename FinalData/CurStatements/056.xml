    biennial as a self-learning system, is one that is capable of generating innovative new practices and modes of interaction with urban environments. 	In this article, I return to the biennial as an evolving &quot;system&quot;, one that is constantly on the lookout for new ways to engage its diverse audiences, current and potential future visitors to the city. I begin by outlining some of the biennials' most fundamental assumptions and values, drawing upon experiences from the past several years that demonstrate the power of an episodic biennial to change the forms, even if only temporarily, that it occupies. 	Next, I present some possible future biennial sites and proposals that are as interesting as the present ones, and the places where they will be found. These suggestions are not intended to serve as curiosities or ideal locations for permanent settlements or next-level insights into the city, but rather as terrain on an ongoing, if sometimes labyrinthine, dialogue between culture, cities, and public realm that should be explored and perhaps even inhabited.

Finally, I close with a description of the ‘next big thing’ that a biennial can be, a radical re-constituting of the city in which the biennial would occupy a new position in the cultural landscape, but which would also increase the city’s size and power structure. 	The biennial has traditionally been seen as a static entity standing between present and future, present and past. In reality, this dynamic relationship has proved elusive, sometimes tearing the biennial apart into separate present and future periods. In the 20th century, the biennial was an episodic event that happened to be frequent (nominative) in a city, but for contemporary audiences and visitors, the biennial has become a static, predictable place where art and art history collide. Increasingly, biennials are episodic in character, occurring on a regular basis (new artists, established artists, established artists, etc.) in a given city. In the bi</text>

To be considered part of the public realm, sites or spaces must be places where people come to connect with the terrain, with its people, places, and stories. Biennials can be transformative in their effect, but they are most effective when they actively engage with the terrain in search of knowledge and place. 	In Search of Knowledge and Place 	When I began my PhD research in Athens, Greece, in 2015, I became interested in how biennials are placed in a city. I came to understand that cities are places that function in ways that are shaped and initiated by, and dependent upon, the biennial that occurs every two years or so in Athens. 	As a city, Athens has a biennale as a recurring event that requires no specific programming or state-sponsored organization. It is a city in its own right, a city in which art, aesthetics and culture are deeply embedded. Art exhibits and performances form a large part of what makes Athens so distinctive;</text>

Finally, I suggest some curiosities for the future of the biennial, its terrain and its people, proposing some curiosities about to be built or renovated, and some curiosities that will be able to exist only in fiction. 	Events in and around the Biennale should be possible only through a mutual aid and cooperation between the different stakeholders: the exhibitors, the visitors, the curatorial team, the arts administrators, the writers, the artists, the visitors, the community organisers, the journalists, the politicians, the museum curators, the curators, the architects, the journalists and the visitors. 	Events in and around the Biennale should be possible only through a mutually beneficial exchange between the different stakeholder groups. This is why it is so important for the organisers of an episodic biennial to engage with the community, because it opens up new ways of engaging with the biennial that otherwise may not exist.

Finally, I conclude by recommending some of the biennials' most pernicious trends and recommending their eventual elimination. These may be placed in a public or a private arsenal of destruction, depending on one’s position on the spectrum of aesthetics. The biennial as an episodic art form has a particular and sometimes a particularly perverse ability to generate pernicious trends, since it is able to exist in the most prominent position, even if only momentarily, within the cultural landscape. By now, most biennials are operating in an environment of some degree of adaptation to the episodic, especially in the public arena, and their continuance depends on events such as major art fairs, which draw visitors to the city, and the biennial in its many forms. 	It is not easy to define what a biennial really is, partly because it is such a nebulous concept, but I will attempt to give some idea from experience and observation. 	In the</text>

Finally, I present three curatorial approaches to the situation: historical, architectural and material. These approaches may be combined to form a curatorial triumvirate that simultaneously investigates multiple terrain and simultaneously creates a new frontier of human experience. The curatorial triumvirate may be a new kind of art institution, or it may develop a new kind of art form, or it may adopt any number of other practices. Its true hallmark may be its brazen avant-garde ambition, whether in its exploration of the city as a whole or of particular neighbourhoods, its materialist avant-garde tendencies, and its unbridled consumption of culture (including cheap, accessible, and ubiquitous consumption). Whatever its outward manifestations, though, the triumvirate is also a deeply embedded, perennial art form that draws on a particular historical situation and on an understanding of the city that dates back to at least the seventeenth century.

The idea that cities should be actively engaged with in some way is introduced here as a starting point for further discussion, and then additional sites and proposals are suggested that are complementary to the starting points or stand in the way of a particular outcome. The ideas presented here are not intended to serve as a definitive list of sites or proposals, but rather as a starting point for further discussion and for recommendations to the city’s future mayor. 	The recommendations in this article are intended to serve as a starting point for further discussion and for recommendations to the city’s future mayor. They do not represent an official position of the city’s government, but rather a starting point for further discussion and for recommendations to the city’s future mayor. In developing its core values, this dialogue has evolved over time. These initial beliefs evolved in the context of the biennial as a global phenomenon: biennials as a pilgrimage form; memorials to the past; and, increasingly, festivals</text>

Finally, I sketch out some of the curiosities and sites of interest to the biennial in an attempt to capture their dynamic, often fascinating, sometimes uncomfortable infrastructures, some of which could serve as models for the future of urban development, at a time of their own creation. The curiosities and sites of interest listed below do not necessarily represent the institutions or sites of their eventual decision, but they do demonstrate the site of their infrastructural evolution and sometimes profound transformations. This process of static, perhaps even brutal, infrastructural change is characteristic of the biennial, but it is also essential for its survival as a site in and for the future of the city. 	In order to be truly ‘infrastructural’ and truly ‘public space’ in the modern sense, a site of frequent, but confined, exploration and interaction has to be physically distinct from other sites of public use, and also distinct from other places</text>

Finally, I suggest some tentative curiosities for the future of the biennial as a public realm, perhaps inspired by the sites that have become increasingly rarefied, as well as some curiosities for the city as a whole. 	In the coming years, this dialogue between culture and the city could witness some very interesting curiosities, as curiosities in their own right. The curiosities just won’t happen for a reason: the city needs cultural institutions and the biennial needs the museums to report back to it. But the biennial could also benefit from better funding and support mechanisms, and from fully participating in the city’s economy, since its patrons would pay more and reap greater benefits from such a model. 	The biennial as a public sphere is expected to experience rapid changes, and these changes will most likely be as much about the places it occupies as about the things it creates. And while it is true that the biennial has</text>

At the center of the biennial is always the same: the visitor. In a biennial, the visitor is always a changed individual, experiencing, in a variety of cases, the recent past with varying degrees of familiarity. The biennial therefore needs a narrative that encompasses all of its points of view, not just the dominant perspective. A narrative that maintains continuity with the past, but also the possibility that its own dominant perspective may be questioned. 	Previous biennial narrativisms tend to represent the prevailing, or at least dominant, historical narrative through which all present and future visitors to the city (or, perhaps, all visitors to the same city) experience the museum. This dominant historical narrative is often filtered through a cultural theory of the city – cultural theory being the study of how humans are influenced by the environment, and how this affects cultural practices – often drawing upon nineteenth-century naturalist and geologist Émile Durkheim.1 Cultural theorists have long known that it</text>

I then present three curatorial approaches to this terrain, each demonstrating a different way of approaching the city. The simplest is the  	Architecture of Dispositions, which I developed in collaboration with Julia Carrie Wong and others, and which aims to rethink the role of the biennial in the social and political landscape of Hong Kong. The second approach is in collaboration with the HKRI, which seeks to revive a once-every-two years ‘Bologna’ scenario by asking, what if? What if every city in the world followed a Bologna model and provided the same services and displayed the same cultural sights? What might be called ‘the urban burrito’? If done right, this ‘burrito’ could be a city’s urban fabric, its built environment and its public realm united in one space. It could even be a city that is not, in fact, a city.

I suppose that’s another reason why the Arts Council might have been less invested in the town after the closure of the Arts Council. It’s easier to break free of the bonds that were put in place to ensure that investments in art are productive and bring about positive outcomes when the arts are invisible and unheard.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleMy work often addresses the politics of invisibility, the politics of difference, and the politics of inclusion. I have a particular interest in the politics of marginalisation and oppression, and the ways in which artists can be exploited and exploited by unscrupulous commercial artists. I often speak about the politics of perception, and how perceptions shape behaviour. I’ve spoken about how the Arts Council was racist in its approaches to the town, and how the town was uncaring and uninterested in what the Arts Council had to say. The Arts Council actually organised a retreat for staff and artists to discuss this issue. Without getting too political, let’s just say that</text>

I suppose that’s the easy part – the negotiations and the sense of belonging. The hard work and real work – the art of running the theatre, building community support, making the town a place where artists could be made and celebrated – was worth less in the long run because of the way that the town was run.The negotiations and the sense of belonging are long and tortuous, and often fruitless. But the important thing is that they were negotiated. That’s what real negotiations are about.Real negotiations are about power and money. And power and money are essential to any negotiation. The way that power is distributed now is that wealth is accumulated at the expense of labour. The more wealth there is, the more bargaining power that labour enjoys in the form of money, and the more bargaining power that labour wields in the form of culture. And so the negotiation between the Arts Council, the town and the town itself is really important. It’s the mediator between the town and the arts</text>

I suppose that’s the easy part – the hard part is when the artist is forced to leave the town because of economic pressures and the changes in the regulatory environment.This is the dilemma that art projects in postindustrial areas face: the art is there, but the development doesn’t reciprocate – in other words, it’s either ‘art for art's sake’ or it’s not art and neither do we want it. And so the story of the Peruvian artist Caron-Tibet and the Art Market stalls that she curated in Liverpool continues to be told, despite the evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the difficulties in establishing a similar relationship with an Arts Council in an urban area are similar. It’s also worth noting that Caron-Tibet was not the first to attempt such initiatives. In fact, the history of contemporary urban arts projects in Peruvian urban centres is quite a long one, with the US, UK and France all having their own</text>

I suppose that’s the rub of it: the Arts Council, the larger society, the rest of the arts organisations and even the local community were all invested in keeping the arts alive and well and in supporting the arts’ creative work done in the town. What the Arts Council did was very much an institutional job, and their involvement in the town, their role in the town’s development, their role in the creation of art history and art’s place in the town’s landscape – decisions, actions and initiatives that could and should be revisited and adjusted over time – were many and varied. The problem with the institutionalised job and their involvement is that they often repeat themselves and so over-interview – each doing their part in creating the image of the area that they control. It’s as if the art commissions and funding bodies in the area never stopped coming back and so the arts must have been constantly reminding themselves ‘yes, we’ve still got to do</text>

I suppose that’s the inherent conflict of the relationship between the arts organisation and the town – the conflict of the potential for the arts organisation to be a part of the town without necessarily becoming a part of that town – and the conflict of the potential for the arts organisation to take over the town and make changes there.I do recall one conversation that was had during the process that I participated in: the Arts Council having discussions with the town about the possibility of producing a visitor’s book. The Arts Council was keen that the book should be a compilation of things that they had in common, but there was some discussion about what that might mean in the context of the town. For example, there was a suggestion that a visitor’s guide to the town might contain a section on migration. Perhaps the Arts Council felt that their role included taking part in the migration of cultures? It could also mean that a section of the book might refer to ‘our history in the area’, as a way to</text>

I suppose that’s the logic of the ‘best in place’ thinking. The problem with the Arts Council and the rest of the entrenched interests is that they’re always there to prevent or disrupt something that’s already going well. And sometimes thatsomething is great – great art is produced in the town – but the Arts Council and their board of directors don’t see it that way. They’re always there to make money, to support the arts in some way and sometimes that's all the arts can really do. But that’s always been the case and unless something changes, that’s always going to be the case. The question becomes: how do we create opportunities for the art to be realised in a way that doesn’t compromise the integrity of the town?Download this article as PDFKate HoffmanKate Hoffman is a writer and arts-critical with a particular interest in the role of the artist.

I suppose that’s the easy part – the part about which there is currently no accountability. The harder part is when the artist is an outsider and you get challenged by people from outside the art world on the merits and demerits of your work. It’s quite possible that the Arts Council would have disapproved of what I did with the town, although I can’t say for certain because I was not an artist at the time. It certainly would have disapproved because I wasn’t an artist at the time. And I suppose that would be the predicament in such cases – if the Arts Council disapproved then the town would have to make the Art Council approve. But that would defeat the purpose of a Council, to endorse or delegitimise. Instead, the Council would have to commission and manage the Art Commission’s activities in a way that is mutually agreeable to them both.

I suppose that’s the slippery slope. The Arts Council might be a step too far in their exploitation of power, but I certainly don’t want to be that kind of Arts Council. I’m interested in radical change, particularly when it comes to the relationship between artists and the communities in which they live and work. I also want to see change, but I don’t want to be part of a system that exploits artists.I’m interested in sustainable art practices, and I believe that the way to do that is to have a dialogue between the arts organisation and the local community. And speaking of sustainable art practices, I have a question about what I’ve been doing with my Art Shed in Anfield. I know that my plans for the space are very much influenced by the work of the Community Land Trust, but I also feel that I’ve appropriated some of their ideas and practices. Is that true? Because I believe that the way to do it is different.</text>

It’s quite possible that the Arts Council might have approved what I did with the town because they were invested in the establishment and perpetuation of a mutually beneficial relationship with the town – in the sense that they’re invested in the town being an artist centre, a place where artists could be educated and made opportunities available to artists’ future careers, and in the sense that they’re invested in the town being a place where artists could be employed and play a part in town. I suppose that’s the rub. If the Arts Council didn’t want us to be artists, they’d have us do other things. But that’s not what we were given; that’s what we were told to do. We were told to sit around a computer and do other things.The Arts Council certainly didn’t want us to do painting, which is what we did from the beginning. However, they’ve always wanted us to do things with the town that would enhance the cultural value of the area, and so it’s quite natural that we would find things to do with the Arts Council’s art programme that enhance the image of the Arts Council. For example, the art programmes that we did in the town centre all had titles that were specific to the period – ‘5th Anniversary’ or ‘10th Anniversary’ or ‘Project Horizons’. These were very important to the establishment and perpetuation of</text>

I suppose that’s the nature of the symbiosis. The Arts Council, understandably, wanted to maximise the benefits from what they saw as a mutually beneficial relationship. I should have realised this sooner rather than later, and maybe now I’m too naïve or idealistic to grasp the full force of the Arts Council’s actions. But still – so many of them. I still get emails from people telling me that they still want to work with me, and they still want to be in the art school where I come from. I still get invited to festivals, and they still want to come to the annual carnival. I still get paid and people still want to come to exhibitions. And then there are the festivals, the minute art and performance and performance and performance and performance again. As someone once said in a festival advert: ‘There’s only one Billy Jack and that’s it.’ If there’s art to be had, then it has to be</text>

[2] Early twentieth-century computer programming was driven by ideas of the Machine, and its logical extensions were understood by this term, with its emphasis on abstract machine processes. Programmability became an essential aspect of computerisation, and the idea of the ‘machine’ as an abstract form of the world was taken for granted. Seth Godin, in his influential Computer Science: A User’s Guide (1949), an introduction to computer programming, describes how one could begin to understand algorithms as symbolic rather than purely mathematical operations. Godin begins by describing an image processing system, or ‘IMAGE’, which he describes as follows: ‘The basic idea is this: an image is an object with characteristics such as a number, a location, and an order of magnitude or kind of description.’ He goes on to explain that an algorithm is a set of instructions to be executed in sequence.

Her work focuses on the spatial organization of infrastructure, often understood as infrastructure composed of physical objects or systems of physical objects embedded in a semantic space. These can be considered as natural geographical features of the planet such as rivers, mountains, and islands, and urban environments such as parks and streets. Interstate highways and transit systems are another type of spatial feature that can be understood as objects or systems of physical objects. Interstate highways and transit systems are the linkages that create and perpetuate spatial typologies and also the space that supports transnational or global travel. Interstate and transit infrastructure are often located in and around densely populated metropolitan areas and coastal areas. The transnational and global interconnectedness of these infrastructural networks creates opportunities for trade between local and international stakeholders, but also poses challenges for local and regional</text>

But unlike in the virtual sphere, where the artefact is either there for all to consume or there to be physically destroyed, in the real world the artefact is neither here nor there. In a broader cultural sense, this means that the biennial has to be present at certain sites and in certain forms in order to be culturally significant and take root; it is culturally embedded and needs to be constantly (metabolically) renewed. And here, the biennial can become culturally unstable. As noted art historian, Jeff Kelly, puts it: the archaeological and historical record is littered with indications that large cultural institutions, such as museums and biennials, can and have changed. But historically, this only happens when and as a consequence of a political or economic intervention. During the 2016 Venice Biennale, for instance, the biennale was temporarily closed to the city due to construction, with many museums and galleries temporarily</text>

But in the new economy of cultural exchange, the biennial is the everyman, the hipster, the Jack Herer, and to a lesser extent, the tourist. The biennial is the one who stays put, and he stays in town, and he stays in the heart of the city. He is the visitor, and the visitor is the resident. The biennial is the curator. And the more we like him, the more we want to give him money, and the more we want to come to his house and spend days in his front garden, and to be able to say, and do all these things, and to be able to be part of this journey, and to share that journey with him.The biennial has an obligation to its place of abode, its place in the world. It is a cultural medium, and culture is what makes it different. But what is different about the biennial is that</text>

Images and texts were powerful, and images were universal. But as more and more people accessed the images and texts, and as more and more cultural goods and cultural networks were built, images and texts began to circulate more widely and simultaneously, with less and less emphasis on the image in favour of the symbol. Thus the biennial exhibits an increasing amount of cultural capital as it seeks to make global cultural impacts through its image and cultural-value hybridisation. In this view, the biennial exhibits a hybrid character – it is both a material presence (its art is made of bodies) and a conceptual one (its meaning is made visible through its image). In other words, it exhibits both the power of symbolism and the weakness of reason, acting as a vector for what is understood by that vector.‘Thinking Museum’, the exhibition space of the British Museum, 2016.

But the biennial has to exert great political and institutional power in order to exert such a significant influence on cultural exchange, because it is such a fundamental part of the cultural production process. It is much easier to undo a biennial than to create a new one. And while there are many forms of biennial today, the dominant and perhaps even the sole form that interests artists and the curators is the Museo Nacional de Arte Contempora, the New York-based, biennial branch of the Carnaval. The main difference between the Museo Nacional de Arte Contempora and the rest of the biennial is that the former organises cultural exchange in New York City, while the latter does not. I would argue that the biennial is a permanent institution because it is fundamentally a social event, and as such it is bound to the</text>

More to the point, these pre-internet forms of the biennial are characteristic of a cultural logic that reconfigures the biennial in relation to the ever-expanding number of digital downloaders and social media users. The biennial has, in effect, two images: a) the image of the biennial as archive, subject to an ever-expanding and shifting collection of objects and artefacts b) the image of the biennial as a consumer product. The first image is a snapshot, a truncated and reified version of the archaeological, historic and contemporary condition-sensitive condition of the biennial as a museum and a cultural practice. The second image is a dramatically augmented and enhanced version of this image. This is what the philology department at the Vienna Museum of Modern Art (WMAP) has in mind when they undertake a major renovation of the main building of the museum</text>

Cultural tourism is not a sudden appearance on a tourist map; it is planned and commissioned by cultural institutions, and it is the responsibility of the artists and curators to ensure that the sites and times visited do not represent an image of a pre-internet culture. However, the emergence of new media and imagery is often accompanied by a change in the underlying social and political systems that construct, rely and purchase culture. As a consequence, biennials may be part of larger displacements, which alter the very definition of what constitutes a ‘cultural institution’. The biennial as a postmodern condition has made itself visible at an international scale, but it remains largely invisible at a domestic one. Until now.

But like all such traces, the biennial will eventually fade into the background. We are here to stay, and our stories will be told by us in the biennial. What better place for such a trace to be located than in one of its many fictional narratives?As the biennial matures and changes, and with it its ever-increasing budget and its central role in cultural exchange, we will need to find new ways of framing our thinking about the biennial in a way that will make it different from other forms of cultural exchange. The important thing is that the biennial becomes more than just an event that takes place in cities, or in the case of the US, in the metropolis. It will need to be able to take root in the city and propagate its values, take root in the cultural sector and be supported by it, and even</text>

As a form of cultural exchange, it is an important one. But the fascination and hubris with cultural exchange that characterises so much contemporary social life in many of our cities and nations is deeply misplaced. Culture is a complex system with multiple infrastructures and economic actors, and biennials should be seen as a last resort, a last resort, a place where art and artists can be counted on to make the system whole and ever vigilant, always grasping for opportunity and always watching out for the big bad. The biennial as an art market returns in a big way in the 21st century, and in some places is even a major force in their local cultural politics. But its infrastructural nature and inflected localisms make it a particularly fragile form, and even more so when cultural tourism is a major part of the business. The biennial is a transient, transient market made up of many smaller infrastructures and</text>

But it is also a return to the demise of state control, domination, and authority. The biennial is an entity that is continually (very slowly) evolving, and as such, must have some kind of governing body or body of culture (regardless of what its name or logo might mean). The biennial is an ever-present condition, and its appearance is both a reaction to and an extension of the ever-present. Its current form reflects and depends on a long history of experience and change, of adaptation and new forms of domination, and of course, of culture. So it is always on the watch for threats to its authority and identity as a cultural resource. It is a point of departure for cultural resources to seek to be recognised and taken seriously, and it is this recognition and status seeking that characterises biennials as a global form.

In this version of the biennial, the art museum and the museum are global nodes of exchange, and the biennial is the international aggregator of goods and services. But the emergence of new technologies and the manifold social transformations they entail are also global nodes of conflict. We are not so sure of ourselves when it comes to the global nexus. Perhaps the root of our cultural inefficiencies and our present inequalities are not cultural in nature, but social in origin. We might say that the inefficiency and inaccessibility of our current forms of cultural production actually aid in the establishment of new forms of cultural production. Social media and connected devices are part of this mix of new technology and social change.The biennial has a global reach because it is a temporalised phenomenon. Its spatial and temporal dimensions are globalised, and the biennial as a global phenomenon is also an international phenomenon. This means that it can be seen</text>

    biennial as a self-learning system is the product of years of work, and its development is itself a work in progress. This process of change is no less true for cultural institutions, but understanding their potential can open doors to new experiences and new ways of interacting.This could mean exploring established and potential conflicts through historical and archival materials, or exploring new frontiers through the power of metaphor.  The power of metaphor is a persuasive tool, and works its magic not only in the realm of aesthetics, but also in influencing behaviour and perception. For instance, the power of language is tied to the power of metaphor, and how we conceive of the world through language. In the realm of aesthetics, a word is a phrase that represents something or someone in relation to an object. A single definition can be broken into several different relations, each one representing a different aspect of the same thing.

A single definition can be broken into several different relations, each one representing a different aspect of the same thing. For instance, the word ‘beauty’ is a ‘phrase that can be interpreted in many different ways, and a question mark is a synonym for ‘beautiful’. So a lipstick can mean many different things in different contexts, and ‘beauty’ is just one of many possible ways of being expressed. The power of metaphor builds towards a more subtle understanding of how language is constructed and understood. This kind of powerful comprehension is extremely valuable in and over the long term, because it allows us to ‘reproduce’ meaning and perception through repeated expressions of words – something that is very difficult to quantify and to understand in the abstract. To understand beauty, we need to understand how language works, and how the social relations between people of different worlds synthesise into language, but much can be learned by understanding a word's many different forms. The power of metaphor becomes understood when applied at a global scale, and over time. This kind of understanding is extremely valuable, and can open doors to new understandings of the world at large.For instance, the power of metaphor can be used</text>

The power of metaphor is that it is malleable, able to take on many different forms and connotations. Aesthetic considerations, aesthetic theory and aesthetics as a discipline have long been at the centre of aesthetic and cultural debates. But the power of metaphor has recently extended to other spheres of public life and society as a whole. For instance, in the wake of the 2015 Istanbul Biennial, discussions of the relationship between the city and the biennial have become increasingly common. In places where the biennial is anchored – where cultural institutions, their visitors and the biennial itself – discussions of the city (including the city’s politics and bureaucracies) often come up as the best venue to question and explore the economic, social and political implications of tourism. In a 2015 survey of over 1,200 biennials around the world, Travel + Leisure magazine placed Istanbul at number four on its list of the best cities for tourists</text>

So a product that speaks of its origins as something that emerged from a conference about aesthetics, but also features images of people rolling dice and smiling children, is likely to elicit different interpretations from those who perceive it as something that was developed by a PR firm. The metaphor of the conference itself becomes important, as well, as a practitioner of the art of framing their practices within this conventionally constituted framework. This particular version of  	Beauty Behind the Curtain, developed by the artist Ron Curry, places the conference in the context of an old ‘Black-ish’ television show. In the programme, contestants are asked to recreate a scene from a television programme using elements from their own cultural milieu. In the case of the conference itself, the participants are asked to imagine a fictional ‘curatorial platform’ where participants can ‘explore curatorial strategies and [...] create an experience that is [...] different from that</text>

So a beauty is a possible interpretation of a question mark, and a ‘word’ is a kind of object that can be interpreted in many different ways.  As a rule, the more possibilities there are for interpretation, the more options for rejection, the more options for change; the ‘grammar’ of language is much more variable than the ‘maturity’ of the human species. Hence the range and flexibility of beauty is subject to change, but the power of language remains the same.Beauty is a property of objects, and thus both human beings and non-human animals acquire it through experience. But beauty is acquired not through intrinsic properties of objects (such as intrinsic worth or moral significance), but through cultural practices, objects-as-components and ‘words’ that serve as approximants and boundary markers. Aesthetics, then, is a *globalized* concept,</text>

This process of change is no less true for cultural institutions, but understanding their potential can open doors to new experiences and new ways of interacting.This could mean exploring established and potential conflicts through historical and archival materials, or exploring new frontiers through the power of metaphor.  The power of metaphor is a persuasive tool, and works its magic not only in the realm of aesthetics, but also in influencing behaviour and perception. For instance, the power of language is tied to the power of metaphor, and how we conceive of the world through language. In the realm of aesthetics, a word is a phrase that represents something or someone in relation to an object. A single definition can be broken into several different relations, each one representing a different aspect of the same thing. For instance, the word ‘beauty’ is a ‘phrase that can be interpreted in many different ways, and a question mark is a synonym for ‘beautiful’.[5] In this way, beauty is both a category mistake and a demeaning slur. By recognising the power of metaphor, the art institution can use this knowledge to create more powerful instances of itself through wordplay, iconoclastic practices and other inbuilt mechanisms. Through a series of these practices, the power of metaphor can be used to create spaces and interactions of a radically different kind, radically different from the existing order.[6]The power of metaphor is itself a source of considerable creativity within the art world. One might even consider this power to be a force for good in the world. However, it is important to recognise that power is inherently fragile, and that institutions and their diverse forms are capable of being corrupted by powerful vested interests. It is precisely because institutions were made with such clear aims and purposes that they are also capable of being corrupted by these pressures, and that is precisely what has happened within the history of the</text>

A single definition can be broken into several different relations, each one representing a different aspect of the same thing. For instance, the word ‘beauty’ is a ‘phrase that can be interpreted in many different ways, and a question mark, when placed between equals, represents either a small number of persons or a very large number of persons. So when we speak of a ‘beauty page’ or a ‘well-known beauty page’ we don’t necessarily mean the page that came first in a beauty pageant, but rather the page that came after it, and the ‘well-known beauty page’ that followed it. A ‘well-known beauty’ is one that is familiar to many people, and so is a concept that is easy to understand and which is widely used. As an expression of the ubiquity of ‘well-known’ in print and visual media, and especially in the social sciences, it is a powerful concept to have around.  A recognisable set of relationships, which arise from these media, are stamped on our perception of the world as a whole. These relationships are built on assumptions and prejudices, and they emerge most clearly in the form</text>

A single definition can be broken into several different relations, each one representing a different aspect of the same thing. For instance, the word ‘beauty’ is a ‘phrase that can be interpreted in many different ways, and a question mark or double question mark can be used to identify parts of a larger idea.[22]  A single definition can then be constructed through this metonymic system of possibilities, each one representing a different aspect of the same thing. For instance, ‘beauty’ can be conceptualised as a ‘set of rules’, and ‘truth’ can be conceptualised as ‘a set of commitments and choices’.[23]  This kind of thinking, which exists in and is informed by the aesthetic, is often referred to as ‘metaphor-ness’. It is the ability to perceive similarities and differences, and to grow and change over time, in a certain sense being ‘metaphorical’. This kind of understanding of metaphor is what gives a concept its power.It is also a kind of metaphor for actions, for actions that are immediate, conscious and intendable. For instance, the ability to perceive similarities and differrences</text>

For instance, the word ‘beauty’ is a ‘phrase that can be interpreted in many different ways, and a question mark is a synonym for ‘beauty’. So a definition can be broken down into smaller pieces, and understood as representing a concept, or a set of relations.  Similarly, a concept can be conceptualised as a collection of relations, each one representing a different aspect of the same concept. For instance, ‘personified creativity’ is a set of relationships that identify certain aspects of a concept, and the concept is understood as representing a set of behaviours. The power of the personified creativity – the idea – is in part based on the fact that such a definition can be broken into smaller pieces. For instance, the English word ‘person’ typically refers to a singular object, and the concept of art is closely tied to an individual. But the power of the personified creativity lies in its ability to imagine a multitude of objects or sets of relations – individuals, generative potentialities, objects – that can be understood in different ways. The ability to imagine</text>

For instance, the word ‘beauty’ is a ‘phrase that can be interpreted in many different ways, and a question mark, or ‘bow’ in some cases, can be used to indicate that something is uncertain. A number of artists have their origins in conflicts between different nations in the nineteenth century, and various empires in the twentieth century, and their work is often inspired by those histories. Such connections are made evident in the installations shown at the Venice Biennale – in the case of David Slater, for example, the Australian flag was temporarily taken out of a synagogue in Jerusalem and re-purposed as an inverted pyramid inside a sea of flowers. The significance of such themes and images becomes evident only when viewed in relation to the larger social and political situation in the world today. What they symbolise is a failure of imagination, not genius, that produces and sustains contemporary social and political problems. The failure to see beauty in the world as it is produced, and to see beauty as a social process that produces images and phenomena of which we are capable of constituting much more meaning and much richer images</text>

Thus, the power of aestheticised images is tied to their being able to be used in a multitude of different ways. And this comes as no surprise to researchers who, over the past decades, have been working on ways to harness aesthetic imagery to generate aesthetic outcomes in contexts where politics, aesthetics, and aesthetics are all but absent. The power of aestheticisation, then, is tied to the disappearance of politics, but the power to the imagination.More than that, however, the power to the imagination lies in the hands of the very practitioners of the art of making things look good at the expense of others, whether thatís politics and bureaucracy, greed and poverty, or the oppression and division that rages on in our wider society. The power to the imagination therefore exists in the context of a neoliberal economic and political order, and cannot be taken away from either citizens or non-citizens alike.

Whilst Venice Biennale was founded in 1903, its roots are in 1912 with the publication of an index of 19th Biennale of Paris. As the biennale grew in prestige and commercial power, so too did its need for cultural control. The ‘underlying assumption' was that the high-end, art-specificity of the Biennale would be engendered by the ‘high end of the category’; so, the managing agency of the event would act as a constituent part of the ‘category’.

The smiling faces of the visitors after the events of September 11th are a rare and elusive type of visitor. They are often depicted as sad, emaciated or frightened, but also as having happy, energetic or creative-looking faces. It is the type of image that is framed, thanked or turned into a quote. It is the image that will stay in the memory, and is often used in place of still lifes or graffiti.

When I came across the idea of an archive in the 80s, it’s because of Norman Rockwell, and his book The Rockwell Plan of Culture. Rockwell was a biographer and a theorist. He was a rock critic, and he was a theorist as to how culture might function in the age of the archival medium. He came across as a radical critic, and he was, and is, a cultural critic. But his plan of Culture Incorporated envisioned what he called ‘the miracle of culture’. The archival medium would be preserved, but the cultural act would be preserved too. And so the idea of the cultural act would have a second act, where the archival elements would be inserted back into the culture through what he called ‘the miracle of culture’. So the idea of the archive would be a way to bring these two ideas together. But it would also incorporate all the cultural moments that are part of the cultural act, and then incorporate</text>

When I came to LA to do the ARC, I made a conscious decision to spend a year in L.A. Not because I wanted to, but because I had to. If I didn’t, I couldn’t have done it. And I felt like I owed it to the city to show some things that I hadn’t seen coming, and to come out of the bubble that I lived in for years.  Because I wanted to. I owed it to the city. And I felt like I owed it to the community to open up the things that we didn’t want to.  Because I wanted to.  And I still don’t know what the fuck that’s all about.  I don’t even know what the fuck that’s about.  I don’t even know what the fuck that’s about.  I don’t even know what the fuck that’s about. </text>

When I came to Liverpool I made a point of visiting the old train yards. They’re a very interesting artefact in a place like Liverpool: they’re a reminder of the infrastructure that existed before the railway came along. The old guard still owns the place, but the regeneration agents have a lot of negotiating to do before they get the structures handed back to the people. Very interesting for me was that there was a moment where the government said, ‘We want this space and you’re going to have to change.’ And the artists said, ‘We’ll find a way of making it work’.  That moment of negotiation that the government gives you to make something work is really interesting, and it happened to be part of the Biennale, but it still stands. The gift and the demand are two completely different things.  I don’t think that the offer was a glorification of the place. It was a question of,</text>

When I came across the term ‘culturally relevant practice’ in the Cultural Studies department at Queens College in the late 1980s, I imagined what a cult of culture would be like. It would be about as generic as an institution could get: there would be no such thing as ‘culturality’ and everything would be about the personified figure of a certain saint. And I imagined that this was the moment when a lot of young people in the department started to get really interested in the notion of culturality and started to read more cultural theory and cultural theory books and started to do research into what it meant to be a cultural critic. And so a lot of these young people would identify with this kind of theoretical construct and be like ‘well, I’m a cultural critic so I’ve read that literature, know that history’ and so on. But there was a tension there: the emergence of this kind of theoretical veneer to the</text>

When I came out of the seventies into the nineties and the eighties, I didn’t have a problem with that. Now I’m into the nineties and the eighties, and if the art world is going to adopt the language of the social I have to ask, what does it mean to be in ‘the social'? If the social is going to adopt the language of the social, then why can’t the art world? Why can’t the art world? Why can’t the social make and break the art world? Why can’t the art world) invent its own ‘space and time’?Why can't the social become the creator of its own ‘space and time’? Because the very idea of the social is being rendered socially impotent. The very idea of the social is being rendered socially useless. And if the art world doesn’t want to invest in the social, then what is</text>

When I came out of the hospital, there was a moment where I thought, Wow, I actually DO know what I’m doing. Because I’m not stupid, and I’m not stupid well. I’m making sense of what’s happening. And that moment when you come out of the hospital and you realize what’s actually happening, that’s powerful.  I was reading some of the letters that came out of The Resident after the fact. One of the women’s reflections is one of the most moving, and yet most largely ignored, parts of the story. She’s describing her own experience as a writer, and she’s describing the weight that she carried for years after the fact, as a way to try to somehow make sense of the fact that she was the one who ended up with the book. She’s going back to the house she shares with John and Jane and says, ‘I</text>

When I came to the United States, I brought these ideas with me. I brought along these folktales from the 80s: Reno, Des Moines, Chicago. These are all places where politics, capitalism, and white supremacy were constantly on the margins, and where poverty and homelessness were real. And I brought along these two phrases, which were a throwaway line in places: ‘Twas the last time I saw Mike Davis’. Or, more to the point, ‘Mike Davis was murdered while riding his bicycle home from the hospital. I don’t think I have that particular memory. It’s more that I’ve forgotten that particular tweet. I can still remember the headline, though. ‘Mike Davis’ is a name that people associate with being on the fringe; people start referring to him as that. So people start associating him with ‘extreme right wing extremism’, which is a bit of a stretch. He’s</text>

When I came to the United States as a Fulbright scholar, it was with this in mind. I wanted to capture the grit and the the work of the schools that I was going to, in so far as they existed in the city, beyond the city, and bring that grit and that work forward. I wanted to witness how the projects of the schools were interviewed, and I wanted to be part of that conversation. I wasn’t comfortable doing it in the public domain, so I thought, ‘Fuck it, I am the curator of the School of Visual Arts, and I am going to make a space for myself, for the work I do, and for the work that comes out of it.’ So I started working with a community arts organisation called the Southwark Arts Forum, which is an arts organisation in Southwark, and it was a hub for artists and community artists. I was like</text>

When I came out of the gates as the artist that I was, I didn’t really have a clear idea of what that meant. I guess the thing that kept coming back to me was just the idea that I was a comedian, and I was a performer, and I was just a regular person. I had a point of view, and I wrote a lot about ideas and ideas and the idea that there’s a point at which you stop being an artist and start being a comedian. And I imagined myself to be able to pick up where I left off in the 80s, and to be able to find my way back to the way I was in the present, only now I don’t identify with that era. I don’t think I would have been able to find the same way of relating to the world as an adult. But I do think I would have been able to find the same way of understanding it as an adult.

The biennial may not represent the final form, but its globalisation and diffuse nature has put it in the driver's seat. This position is entirely appropriate in a neoliberal tourism economy dominated by the European Union and the US. The biennial is a rare artifact that retains its historical functions as a site of discovery, where exotic cultures are introduced to familiar ones – in the form of consumable goods. These have become indispensible to the capitalist logic of cultural tourism, which relies on the exchange of consumables as a precondition for habitation. But the biennial is a consumable good – a very specific kind of consumable cultural tourism good. It is not clear that biennials were always so visible and so transnational in their import and export. The first public manifestations of the biennial appeared in the wake of World War II, in a form that was both apocalyptic and prescient. The apocalyptic vision sought to reconcile two incompatible apocalyptic possibilities: either the conflict over space would be resolved through scientific research and</text>

The localisation of cultural tourism emerged as a consequence of the biennial, and so it is with this event in particular. The biennial may not be able to sustain a permanent museum-like status, but it does have a long-term power in the city because it attracts and invests capital in its city, and so it is able to attract global art collectors. It is crucial, then, that the biennial develop a social mission that is mutually exclusive of these various forms of consumption. It is up to art collectors to enable this social mission, and so the biennial needs to create an ecumenical relationship with its local community. This is not easy to do, and so the relationship has to develop organically, with artists and collectors coming to the biennial to learn about its politics, investing, organising and becoming involved. The Liverpool Biennial 2016 could do with better research institutions, but it is due to open in January 2017. Until then, it is important for the biennial to have a social mission, and so develop a social dimension that is not exclusive to its museum-like status. The Liverpool Biennial is a</text>

The localisation of cultural tourism emerged as a consequence of the biennial, and so it is with this event in particular. The biennial may have specific goals in mind, but their application involves more social and economic factors than just monetary ones. As cultural-tourism becomes more institutionalised, and cultural tourism becomes more representative of what we mean by the term ‘biennial’, we may begin to see biennials, and their visitors, as agents of change, instead of the other way around. How to Organise a BiennialEvent(LCT) is the Tissue paper produced in collaboration with Álbio Nascimento-Noguez (University of Southampton), and was presented at the 24th Venice Biennale Cultural Research Center, Italy.In this issue of the journal, we discuss the ideas that came to define the biennial, and how our present and future cultural traumas may be connected to the bioennial. The journal is divided into four parts, each addressing a different aspect of the biennial. Part One addresses the origins of the biennial; Part Two looks at</text>

The biennial may not represent a complete solution to the culture shock, but it is a necessary first-wave bulwark against the art-historical equivalent of the Cultural Tourism Trust, or CT, in taking root in the cultural fabric of the city. And the biennial, whether it is a city, or a collection of cities, such as Liverpool, provides the template for future, if fragmentary, cultural tourism. The biennial format may be a convenient way to see cultural phenomena, or to be seen by a public, but it is organised, controlled and commanded by an external power, and its real power derives from the position it occupies in the global tourism market. The biennial may possess a visual language that is legible, that is easy to understand and to connect with audiences on a global scale, but it is organisationally unsustainable without a political will. In short, political will behind the art-historical artefact.The biennial is a global phenomenon, but its particularised form of global</text>

The localisation of cultural tourism emerged as a consequence of the biennial, and so it is with this event in particular. The biennial may be transient, but it is also a site of permanent, long-term structural changes, which are in turn a site of permanent creative practices. The key is that it constantly reconfigures itself through changes in its tourist base, which in turn emerge as a consequence of the biennial’s extraordinary levels of consumption. In this sense, the biennial is itself a site of permanent change. So, as the tourism and cultural industries that rely on it change, the biennial must also change. The only way to know whether the biennial will continue to exist in a material form is for art and cultural institutions to be able to document and map its changes, as well as the creative practices that it generates. The possibilities are too vast to enumerate, but here we can identify a few key elements of the 2016 biennial that are very much like the ideas and practices of the Museum of Modern Art, in its early years and later phases. These elements include: a) the museum as</text>

The biennial may be a transient phenomenon, but its historical trajectory – from exhibitions in major museums to the present, and ongoing projects in between – establishes a kind of permanent precedent for other cultural tourism events. When the Venice Biennale was first proposed, American curators William Irvine and Vern Frenzlinger, in their book Culture and Revolution, write: ‘The Venice Biennale would be the twentieth-century counterpart of the Cairo Art Biennale, in which the cultural tourism component would be replaced by a very important element of permanent exhibitionary history […] [T]he biennale would occupy a unique place in the world of art and architecture, its location on the Continent, and its placement in the museum system, constituting a new kind of museum that would offer a new kind of archaeological and archival discovery […] The biennale’s modern counterpart is the famous Arab Spring of 2011, which followed the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia, but with a US$5 billion budget and ‘</text>

The biennial may not represent the cultural tide, but it is cultural tourism in its relations to the city. The Liverpool Biennial 2016 is an iconic case in point.[1] And yet it was a big deal. It is a major retrospective of sorts, offering a rare and precious look inside the Biennial at a significant price. It is also a showcase for the city’s rapid regeneration plans, which are set to see an even greater rise in population as a result of the biennial. The Biennial is projected to stand to gain more than 3,300 new business visitors in 2026, making it one of the most valuable cultural assets of the city.[2] Just as important, in the coming years, when the Biennial seeks to expand its tourist revenue stream, it is expected to employ around 4,000 people directly, with an additional 3,000 cultural workers taking up permanent positions.

The localisation of cultural tourism emerged as a consequence of the biennial, and so it is with this event in particular. The biennial may be an emblem of economic efficiency, but its true asset is its spread: culture is the single most effective political tool of the capitalist system. The biennial has become an essential part of the larger globalised tourism industry, and so it is the sole representative of the ‘world’. But what is the true essence of biennial events? How is the biennial organised? What are its social functions? These are the types of questions that can lead to a discussion of the kind that needs to happen, but rarely does any event achieve widespread public or critical attention owing to its complexity. The case of Liverpool Biennial 2016 raises these kinds of ambiguities, and more. It is a rare event in itself, but the publication of a second edition of the journal Stages in June 2017, conducted with the journal’s editorial board, signals a possible move away from the biennial as a static form, and towards a more participatory and artist-driven event.

The localisation of cultural tourism emerged as a consequence of the biennial, and so it is with this event in particular. The biennial may have certain distinctive characteristics, such as its large size and its regularity (it opened every two years), but they are characterised by a diffuse and transient public. The biennial does not occupy a specific place in the cultural tourism package, but it does embody certain canonical characteristics of the art-travel industry (and art’s) that have become institutionalised: there is a place for art critics, critics and art lovers in the museum; there is a place for art-world visitors in the biennial; and there is a place for art lovers in the biennial itself. The significance of this observation cannot be underestimated. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, art-triennials such as Venice Biennale and the Spanish Cultural Center held prominent positions in the Venice architecture and design canon, while the Asian Triennale emerged as a canonical event in the city. The introduction of these three types of art-triennials into the concept of art’s‐</text>

The biennial may be an iconic cultural form, but it is far from being universally recognised or acknowledged. Even with major biennials in Europe and the United States, cultural tourism today represents a minority interest of only a minority of visitors. The biennial as a visitor form is still relatively new in the United States, and while it may seem counterintuitive to many people, to have a biennial that is representative of the city in which you are based, and so on, is not universally understood. This is particularly true for biennials located in cities where the tourism is low and where the local artworld is experiencing a major disenchantment. It is often forgotten that these are the same biennials that created the tourism boom that gave birth to these developments, and so it is easy to become invested in the new artistic district that the biennial is expected to support. One could also argue that the biennial has become entangled in the city’s urban-dwelling culture industry, which</text>

In fact, biennials are by nature secretive and self-critical, and much of their scholarly work is devoted to how to be ‘more like God’, as reflected in their sacred texts and in their Christian obligation to look to the future. Biennials have a ‘biennial of silence’, a condition marked by a refusal to speak publicly or acknowledge mistakes or transgressions, making matters more difficult for those who would seek to correct them.1 If biennial research is to move forward, it is imperative that mistakes like those made by the Liverpool Biennial be made less accessible and more visible. At the very least, this may require that biennial staff members undergo mandatory sensitivity training on the proper treatment of individuals with disabilities, and possibly some religious minorities.2 This public teaching may be required of all staff, but it is especially onerous for those with disabilities, who may find their place in the biennial increasingly restricted. As a result, it is not uncommon for staff to lack appropriate training or knowledge, or may find the skills they need lacking, which makes it more difficult to monitor</text>

In fact, biennials are by nature secretive and self-critical, and much of their scholarly work is devoted to how to be ‘public’ while remaining ‘private’.1 While some biennials would make wonderful exhibitionary curatorial acts, they are more often engaged in a self-serving ‘hack-a-thon’ that promotes their own value system, or in the case of ‘deserted’ places, a specific brand of that brand of place.2 In the contemporary biennial, the public is frequently positioned at a distance through the consumption of knowledge unavailable at the time of the show, and through habit of forgetfulness that is sometimes rewarded by the appearance of presentism. The biennial form has its moments of lucidity through its recurring consumption of artefacts of knowledge – a form of knowledge that is hard to define, hard to quantify and often elusive in its effects – but these vocabularies are characterised by an underlying paralysing darkness that makes them uninteresting, even repugnant.

Their domestic work is often much more impactful, and their international outreach much more interesting and engaging. As biennials become more public, and more of a trope in popular culture (how else can you explain the ubiquity of the Oumós biennial, and how every biennial thereafter springs from its public relations arm?), it is important to recall the old ‘permanent motion’ metaphor, and the related idea of ‘permanent representation and exchange’. This is done by asking: what is the essence of the biennial in and through the social, economic and political dynamics of our contemporary world? What are the conditions and temporal parameters that enable or impede the reproduction of the biennial? This is done through questioning the biennial’s public image, its institutional memory, and through research on its participants, especially those living outside the biennial itself. For</text>

Their love of the arcane and mysterious is a powerful storytelling tool, but a love also lies at the root of their secrecy. The real secretaries of knowledge, it turns out, are creatures like ourselves. Uncovered Kingdoms 	Jade Eco Park is the site of the proposed future city for the Amazon, in an area roughly the size of Rhode Island. This is the world's third largest standing forest after Tibet and Cambodia. The park’s name is a hybrid of two ancient languages, Maya and Aztec, and is named after the legendary heroine of the Quiche myth, Enlil Tenaxmi. It was also once a Spanish-governed territory. Today, it is home to an airport and is a major transshipment point for plastic bags and other waste from the port of Los Angeles to the Gulf of California. It is the largest remaining section of the Mississippi Valley Railroad. 	[i] </text>

In fact, biennials are by nature secretive and self-critical, and much of their scholarly work is devoted to how to be ‘good’ online, or ‘good’ offline, or ‘good’ in ways that are both theoretical and political.1 Despite this scholarly rigor, online biennials are everywhere being created, and there is overwhelming consensus that this is a good thing. We are surrounded by reports of the latest hothouse in the art biennale business, fuelled by reports of the top-ranking art institutions around the globe. The problem with this picture is that previously existing online biennials are rushing to catch up with the new ‘holistic’ ones, creating what can be seen as a monolithic ‘biennial of taboos’. As a result, the art biennale business is feeling the pressure to catch up, and online biennials are feeling the pressure to be more creative and flexible, not less. In the coming years, biennials may wish to create their own online database, perhaps based on the artworld conventions</text>

In fact, biennials are by nature secretive and self-critical, and much of their scholarly work is devoted to how to be ‘good’ members of the public by virtue of being ‘public’. In this process of obscurity, biennials also produce what Norman Brown refers to as ‘negative space’ – space that is neither here nor there’ – space that is occupied and contested.9 In black and white photographs, this negative space is depicted as a city in which ‘real people’ inhabit ‘space’ and ‘real people’·subsidiastically representational images of themselves are constantly being formed and destroyed by the ever-present forces of a capitalist urban-historical form. In the biennial as a whole, this negative space is depicted as one in which art is often quoted as a legitimate means of expressing political, social and economic sentiments, but is often implicitly understood to be inherently ‘negative’.10 Brown’s negative space is often characterised by the staged production of negative emotions in an aestheticised historical context,</text>

In fact, biennials are by nature secretive and self-critical, and much of their scholarly work is devoted to how to be ‘visible’ in the face of this critical, cloistered research. They may or may not be able to put out a full-scale fire, and in the face of such destructive elements, their need for visibility may well override all other considerations. However, this is a situation that is far from ideal, and biennials would do well to learn to be visible in the ways that are being challenged.  One such way to be visible is through the development of peer-review, the process by which online and offline scholarly outputs are assessed and graded. A core principle of online publishing is that the identity of the author is unknown to the readership, with varyingials of how trustworthy that identity is being questioned granting varying degrees of weight to various literary and artistic outputs. In the current biennial cycle, the biennial itself is frequently cited as a factor in the publication of works not produced through the biennial.

This is the era of the biennial, and it is a question that has been lingering over the biennial from its inception in NYC in 1992. Introducing the biennale, New York Museum of Art, 2012. Photo courtesy of the New York Public Library.8. Biennials, biennials of any kind, and the museum. Not all biennials are created equal. On the one hand, biennials have a privileged position within a museum, where they can devote significant resources to documenting a single event – such as the Museum of Modern Art’s 2015–16, which was devoted entirely to the history of art from the past 100 years – in ways that are almost entirely invisible within the museum. But this advantage is often questioned and undermined. What does it mean when biennials are collectively seen as a ‘collection of qualities’,</text>

In fact, biennials are by nature secretive and self-critical, and much of their scholarly work is devoted to how to be ‘friends’ in the here-and-now, how to be ‘beloved’ by their online audiences, while remaining completely invisible from the institutional vision of things. Despite this scholarly paling, biennials have a rare and valuable institutional presence, regularly presenting their research-based articles, reviews, and poetry to a worldwide audience, which often times aligns with and even sympathizes with the scholarly debates around a particular topic. Despite this institutional gravitas, biennials have an even greater public of users, often mischievous and narcissistic in their pursuit of internal quantification. Biennials, like other online cultural forms, rely on the institutional memory and the self-help techniques of a memory to maintain a critical mass. But unlike other online forms, the institutional memory rarely projects outward, and its critical mass, when it inevitably comes to a standstill, is neither spontaneous nor random.[4]Here, then, we can take the institutional memory and its assumptions</text>

In this light, their involvement in the ‘curtailment’ of knowledge, both historical and contemporary, is to be expected. This involvement does not make the biennial a ‘holistic, universal, or ‘deeply embedded’ ‘causeway to knowledge’, nor does it mean that the biennial should be accepted as a synonym for ‘universal’ or ‘deeply embedded’ knowledge. Rather, the role of the biennial in the ‘curtailment of knowledge’ is to offer a ‘bridge to knowledge’, drawing those with knowledge to the biennial so that they may ‘totally get’ to know it’.  	But this ‘biennial of knowledge’ is only possible because of the internet, and more and more of our urban and suburban infrastructures are now online, making</text>

But the AI that underpins the image-processing that creates the images that we see and create the worlds that we inhabit could also be used to design and construct images that are more aesthetically pleasing, more fulfilling and more socially impactful – to produce images that are culturally responsive and accessible, but also images that are culturally specific and image-specific.For instance, many contemporary artists have their images be interpreted – literally or figuratively – according to cultural cues, political situations or social norms. But many artists don’t consider how their images might be created to meet the needs of a culturally responsive or image-specific audience. As an example, many artists produce images that</text>

It is also about the role of the artist, whether she is a researcher or an administrator. The role of the researcher should be to find a solution to a problem that may exist, rather than to invent a new one. The role of the administrator should be to find a way to incorporate all the stakeholders into a solution that is palatable to everyone, including stakeholders who may have different values or opinions. This can be understood as an administrator attempting to reconcile diverse perspectives and opinions, rather than inventing a solution that is perfect for everyone. The role of the artist should be to find a way to reconcile conflicting values and opinions, rather than trying to impose a solution on others. In</text>

If so, consider introducing artificial intelligence into the mix. This would mean augmenting artists with machines that generate, record and analyse artistic behaviour, often through the use of 'big data', which captures and processes vast amounts of data on a daily basis. This would create a new class of artists who are able to explore and express artistic possibilities through the recording and analysis of their surroundings. This would create a new class of art producers who are able to develop distribution channels for artistic activities worldwide. This would end the age of the artist as a static creative agent who produces artwork across a community of artists and curators in a given city or country.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is an artist.

Still, the potential benefits of AI in the arts are immense, and could significantly augment the capacities of arts institutions to deliver culturally responsive programmes and outreach, whether that’s through increased access to resources or AI, or both.Artists, curators and art administrators should also consider the following:How can art be positioned beyond its current context and placed in historical and theoretical perspectives that are relevant to the contemporary situation?

In an ideal world, machines wouldn’t need human curators, but would regularly check in with them and offer their services when needed. As AI improves, the lines between artist and art system will become increasingly blurred, and artists and curators will need to be able to recognise when they are being used ethically and creatively.Artists, curators and art administrators need to be able to recognise when an improvement is being made to the systems they use, and to draw the line when it comes to AI systems interacting with art or the arts.

    <text>relationship between curating and artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot-button issue, with many artists and curators citing Musashi as an influence. AI will make it easier to find art and art of a given quality, whether it’s the ability to spot a winner in a art contest or to understand the depth of an artist’s artistic frustration at a given moment.Artists, curators and art administrators are understandably sceptical about the perils and benefits of AI, and are understandably reluctant to move the majority of their resources and artistic output offshore of their country of residence if they don’t believe that their artistic output will be secure and complete in the new technological world. But there is compelling evidence that suggests that AI could be a force for artistic and curatorial improvement, especially in the arenas of art, aesthetics, performance and media.Artists, curators and art administrators who are considering how to deploy AI in the arts should take into account the following:Artists, curators and art administrators who have been researching and developing their collections and collections management systems in-depth, and have decided to share their findings with a wider community of interested parties should do so as a community. This could mean that a local community of art users or community art societies, or a biennial or a large-scale contemporary art fair, is formed to experiment with and complement the potential of AI in the arts. Should the research and development be driven by a single organisation or a collective of organisations? It is clear that there are organisations such as the British Council who would embrace an open and collaborative AI research and development process, and would welcome the opportunity to work with artists, curators, art historians and art producers on this. Should the research and development be driven by a single artist or a collective of artists? In an ideal world, the answer to this should be easy: the arts organisation should be able to select an artist or an organisation based on criteria relevant to their interests and capabilities, and AI should provide</text>

On the one hand, it offers a relatively transparent means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers little else. The city has a low cost because of the labour involved in its manufacture. In fact, the more radically the city is shaped, the lower the cost will inevitably be. If the city is made up of many small fragments, each contributing to the production of the city, then the cost of producing the city – in terms of bricks, cement, timber, viaducts, streetlights etc – will go up. If the city is made up of large aggregates of smaller fragments, then the cost of producing the city will inevitably fall. A city that produces bricks, cement, timber, viaducts, streetlights etc. at a huge scale does not need huge amounts of maintenance. A city that produces them on a small scale does. Streetlights are made in large factories on the city’s outskirts. Cement is made in huge opencast mines in the hinterland. Logs are made in large open-pit mines in the city’s centre.

On the one hand, it offers a relatively transparent means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers little else. The city has a low cost because it is infrastructural, and because the labour needed to make the city runs in many cases in excess of the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover’s capacity. The most that the city can do is put together decent-sized blocks of houses (in most of which, the ability to pay a decent price is a problem) and provide a good quality of life to a large number of people.  The city is a complex system, and the complexity of this labour isn’t just an urban problem. It is a social problem as well. A lot of what people do with their bodies, gestures and even their DNA is socially mediated. A lot of what we think of as ‘nature’ has been engineered by human institutions and social practices. If the city is complex and incomplete then the border is even more so.  If the city is complex and incomplete then the border is also empty and pointless.

On the one hand, it offers a relatively transparent means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers little else. The city has a low cost because it is a large complex with relatively few residents (compared to, say, the farflung hills and mountains). The big disadvantage of the city, in the event of a major disaster, is that many people who need to be housed in the city cannot find places to live because of overcrowding. In such cases, the city is forced to make do with what it has – which is increasingly fragile – while the hills and mountains fend for themselves.  	Certain urban problems can be solved with technology, as in the Zapruder film, but there is still a great deal of unmet need in the city due to its limited resources. In such a case, the city would have to reinvent its functionality. In the Zapruder film, the mover is identified as a ‘Citizen Lab’ – a hybrid group of filmmakers, journalists, geologists and architects who volunteered their time, expertise and materials to the city’s disaster relief efforts.

On the one hand, it offers a relatively transparent means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers little else. The city has a low cost because it is located in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by cornucopia of development. The rapid growth and constant change that characterises the hinterland makes it an ideal site for the development of ever more massive megacities while simultaneously trapping so-called ‘green’ people in ever smaller parcels. Meanwhile, the air conditioner that produces half the city's energy can be bought by developers at breakneck speed. In the frenetic pace of development in the city, the hinterland is often left behind. While the megacity may mean new towers and new museums, the city is often left behind in its proliferation. As the space market in the 21st century is becoming ever more bureaucratized and urbanized, the city is becoming ever more bureaucratized and empty. The paradoxical situation for the city is that as development sprawls across multiple sites, it is often these same developers who move into the most densely populated areas, creating ever-greater clusters around the</text>

On the one hand, it offers a relatively transparent means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers little else. The city has a low cost because it is so densely packed. In the countryside, the effect of such intensive industrialisation is to tear apart the landscape. The city is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it offers relatively inexpensive means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers high-quality deformed or mangled mounds of rubble when the brick mover wants to repair the damage done by his/her machines. The city has two principal trade-offs to consider: the value of the city as a physical construct, and the value of the human life that is produced in its production. The city is particularly valuable as a physical construct because, unlike in other places where the concrete has been systematically removed or destroyed, in the city the concrete is inextricably integrated into the infrastructure and the social fabric of the city. The disrupted concrete market is a case in point. When the city is active,</text>

On the one hand, it offers a relatively transparent means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers little else. The city has a low cost because it is located in the heart of the agricultural belt. The problem with the city is that as the gridlock grows longer and the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover becomes more efficient, the people who stay put in the city are those who need the bricks (and thus the space and goods generated by the bricks to pay for their houses). Thus, as the city matures, it requires ever-greater amounts of public subsidy to pay for its infrastructure and its day-to-day operations. The city becomes ever more bureaucratic in its need for ever-greater public subsidies. And this double taxation – by the very name of the building and the function of its maintenance – is a feature of the city today, even if it is not a feature of the future. The infrastructure – the system that supports and directs urban life in this country – is the single most important determinant of how the city is going to be shaped. Without it, and with its subsidies, the city would</text>

The city has a low cost because of the labour it takes to produce the bricks, but on the other, it does not offer much else. The city has two faces: the face of the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover and the face of the brick/concrete mover. The face of the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover is a single face. The face of the brick/concrete mover is a two-faced commodity. In this case, the face of the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover is a single face with two discrete commodities: concrete/vinyl/concrete, and bricks/concrete. The face of the brick/concrete mover is a two-faced commodity.

On the one hand, it offers a relatively transparent means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers little else. The city has a low cost because of the labour it takes to lay the concrete, the huge trucks that move it all, and the drivers who use its roads. The city therefore has a cheap labour force, which in turn helps the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover. In the event of a conflict, the cheap labour force can be used to wage a war. The city therefore has an additional virtue that makes it suitable for the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover: the city has a scarce scarce scarce commodity, which the other goods it contains cannot exchange for.1 	Like the city, the ‘permanent’ aspect of the ‘homeland’ is an artifact of the colonial past.

On the one hand, it offers a relatively transparent means to make money when the concrete/vinyl/concrete mover wants to change the shape of the city, but on the other, it offers little else. The city has a low cost because it is so densely packed. Ninety-five per cent of the area’s Area Code is written in bricks and concrete. Ninety-five per cent of the area’s Area Code is written in kites and straws. The area codes, together, form the city’s regulatory landscape. If a developer wants to change the shape of the city, he has to apply to the city council and get a permit. The council then gives the go-ahead. If the plan is put into practice, the city has to fund the project. In the city, the construction of new transit lines and tunnels is a necessity; otherwise, the city will become like Memphis or Detroit. The city builds projects because the city is rich. If the poor don’t want to be poor, they have to be poor. The poor are often times the most resistant to change. The poor tend to be more vulnerable to deindustrialisation.

The city has a low cost because of the labour involved in the concrete mover’s other parts of the business (such as moulding, shipping, curing etc). The main reason for the city’s low cost is that the labour being done is fairly routine. If the city were an organisation, it would be called a ‘Workers’ Council, or a similar workplace organisation. The problem with the city, in the long run, is that it becomes an expensive ‘trap’.  	Whenever I think of the city, I picture the factory or warehouse or workshop where the puzzles are made. The trap doors aren’t always locked and the ventilation shafts can get pretty nasty (although rarely are they not ugly, given the inefficiency of modern design). The reason why the city acquires its shape is that it is constantly producing (i.e. constantly evolving) solutions to the puzzles (i.e. bricks and concrete and so on). The shape of the city</text>

To answer this question, I turn to the principles that underlie the biennial as an art form and to the historical dynamics that shape its form today. Modern biennials are the product of a specific historical moment, born of and developing alongside the modern museum, and of a particular cultural mix. They are not, nor can they be considered to be distinct from, museums today. Their form today is part of a museum-like museum-like system, part of a biennial’s permanent role. But they are in their own way museum-like in their own right, and</text>

This is why, when the West is threatened with destruction, we in the East need to work together to try to save what we call the City of London, which is part of the global capitalist economy. The question becomes what can the other side do to make us see the other side? A curatorial hand-wringing about aesthetics is not going to change anything. A city that is conscious of its fate is a city that is conscious of its fate. ‘Art’ is consciousness in reverse; it is what John Berger called a ‘deep sleep’ that year in Paris. Berger was one of the founders of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and he was a member of the Geometrice 1st arrondissement, an urban band that performed in the center of Paris. In the wake of the AIDS epidemic, the Pompidou’s repertoire expanded to include renditions of classic pieces by Debord, Satyagraha, and Surrealists like Salvador Dalí and Marcel Pellon. The avant garde in its purest form emerges from the rifts that these deep slumbers expose.Berger’</text>

This is why, when the West is threatened with destruction, we in the East need to work together to try to save what we call the City of London, which is part of the global capitalist economy. The only way to save what remains is for a socialist government to take over the art world and institute a socialist state of culture. This cannot happen in the UK because of the way that the capitalist gallery economy operates, but the idea that we, the artists and curators, should all be members of the same bureaucratic cast of mind raises awareness of what possibilities remain. When a public art institution is run by and for the people, not by and for corporate galleries, the possibilities are more numerous and vibrant. When a public space is taken by the people, and collectively managed by the governed, the rich and the powerful, the city's role becomes that of a buffer, preventing bigoted individuals or institutional interests from taking over the city.  One might add that the gallery culture of today is the direct result of the political and economic machinations of industrialised countries following the money, and especially their financial entanglements. The financialisation of art today is such that it is easier for a painter</text>

This is why, when the West is threatened with destruction, we in the East need to work together to try to save what we call the City of London, which is part of the global capitalist economy. In the 1980s and 1990s the art world was awash with proposals of new galleries, exhibitions and venues, but as ever, the answer was always the same: more art. New galleries, exhibitions and venues added to the old. And as ever, the curatorial turn has to be combined with economic development in order to support the new galleries and exhibitions. As the exhibition business has shrunk, so too has the collection business. And like it or not, the collection business is what feeds into the museum business, in a generalised sense. If the collection was a business, the museum business is a firm. So the curatorial office needs to be able to make good on its investments and create value for the gallery business. This is why original works, new curatorial approaches and formats are so valuable, not only as a store of knowledge, but also as a source of value. They become assets that the gallery business can use to support new galleries and exhibitions, and thus the maintenance</text>

This is why, when the West is threatened with destruction, we in the East need to work together to try to save what we call the City of London, which is part of the global capitalist economy. And this is what curators do. They find what the gallery system cannot, which is then put out on the market. Since the art world has virtually no money, or else has no interest in buying art, what the gallery system cannot sell, the market has to be flooded with art. But this is impossible under capitalism. In a capitalist society, the art world would try to cut its losses and leave the museum system behind, since it cannot compete with a museum system that is essentially a profit center. So what the gallery system does is to pick and choose which art it would like to show, and then to arrange these shows in such a way as to maximize the interest of as many people as possible. But what the gallery rarely does is actually ‘think about art’. It treats art as if it were a stock, marketable commodity, and exhibits, in galleries and museums alike, a selection of paintings and sculptures chosen at random from a market of ideas. And to</text>

This is why, when the West is threatened with destruction, we in the East need to work together to try to save what we call the City of London, which is part of the global capitalist economy. The way to try to save what is left over from the 1990s is to create a zone of mutually exclusive interests where artists, curators and the art world live together in blissful complacency. Such a zone could be a seafront park or a waterfront residential neighbourhood, with a mini museum built on the water's surface where the artists' studios once stood, complete with shops and a jeweller's shop. This would save the city some of its historic rent-seeking and make the waterfront something that is truly relatable to the people who now call it the City of London. So far, so normalised.But what if the city cannot find a way to live up to its potential? What if, in the apocalyptic future, the City of London were to be destroyed and all coastal areas to become coastal zones again? What then? Would the City of London rise again? I have no idea.

This is why, when the West is threatened with destruction, we in the East need to work together to try to save what we call the City of London, which is part of the global capitalist economy. This is why, when the other guy does something fantastically inventive and wonderful, we in the East need to do the same things to keep the peace. It is not that we in the West are better than the East; rather, our cultures are more evolved. And when we in the East start to break these cultural taboos, we in the West are more exposed to the cultural possibilities of these other places. This is why, the great cultural-political revolutions that occurred in the West between the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century were led by intellectuals such as Francis Galton, Max Horkheimer, Joasia Krysa, Emma Goldman and Emma Toll. These were not led by religious fanatics; rather, they were intellectuals who understood that the task was not to create a god but to allow creativity to take form within the world as an object of desire and to allow that desire to take on an object of control. They were not religious fanatics, but they saw themselves as</text>

This is why, when the other side is trying to annihilate us, we in the East need to collaborate to try to save what we call the Global South.Because, finally, when all is said and done, what is left behind is a legacy of cultural activity, a cultural landscape that is as hostile to capitalism as the city is to pollution. And the reason why is simple: what is latent, what gives form and life meaning, is what is neglected. The City, in other words, is a capital trap, which means that as capitalism breaks down, what remains behind is rubble and ruins. In other words, while the periphery may feel the break-even point, the city will always experience a constant loss of meaning and character as a result of the infrastructural binge.So what can a biennale do?

This is why, when the West is threatened with destruction, we in the East need to work together to try to save what we call the City of London, which is part of the global capitalist economy. The other half of the equation is often referred to as the ‘culture industry’, and it is here where the real battles are won and lost. The industry wants artists to be able to sell products that reflect the trends and values of the moment, and so artists are typically groomed and recruited into working with audiences who are already primed to adopt those trends and values. These are the artists, after all, who will emerge as cultural touchstones, and so the social ecologies that we produce, that is, the narratives that shape who we are as artists and who we become are produced and sustained by the industry.When the social ecology of the 1980s and 1990s is analysed, it is clear that the cultural industries did not invent the modern urbanisation and regeneration process. Rather, their intense administrative infrastructures, which followed the industries of the day, provided the political, legal and institutional framework for the processes that would later be described as neoliberalism.

This isn’t just theoretical. It is becoming more and more probable that such a move will happen, despite the resistance from some quarters to the notion of national self-determination. They’re afraid of what the East might do if it has its own city. They’re afraid of what the East might do if it has its own language. Finally, the other has to be able to put its pieces together in order to form a positive future for its neighbourhood and its people.

But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take one example, consider the role of the artist in programming the programming of a programme of events, places and objects. In the programming of a language, the artist is able to create grammars of interpretation that are qualitatively and itually distinct from the programming of the underlying computer. For instance, the programming of the programming of programming languages allows the artist to create grammars of interpretation that distinguish programming languages from each other. Languages also have constructors, methods and constructors, which permit the creation of syntactic units that categorise elements according to categories such as logic, structure and so forth. But what is a syntactic unit? How is a syntactic unit constituted? To find out, we need to know what is meant by categories. But what are the categories of programming? To understand programming, one must have some understanding of programming languages.In programming, nouns and verbs denote entities and terms, and gender is a synonym for ‘entity’. So the entity</text>

But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take an example from the 1980s, suppose the programming language of the year was Ada and the art world was C#. In the 1980s, the Ada Lovelace Random Access Memory (AAAM) and the Turing machine were both invented. In Ada, the parameters of the program are expressed as trees, where trees have structure and meaning – kind, function, location and access to data – whereas in C# ‘meaning is anything that can be quantified’, and is captured and interpreted by the computer as a tree. So while the computer understands the program’s parameters, they are not things that follow directly from the underlying mathematical formulas, but rather represent contingencies and possibilities. In this way, the computer can imagine and explore more complex situations, and thus can ‘think things through’. This is at odds with the traditional programming language of the computer, where parameters simply meant what you did with the data. So while the computer understands and can do with �</text>

But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take an obvious example, the programming of a robot is to begin to understand what the robot could and could not do. So the language that the programme is written in sets the nature of the interactions between the parts, and the possibilities for error-checking and automation, and thus reality is subject to the whims of the unpredictable and the conscious. More fundamentally, the language of the programme is itself a creation of the programming. The language of the programme is itself a writing that emerges from the interaction of parts and the possibilities it affords for interpretation. So the language of the programme is both interpretive and prescriptive, capable of giving rise to certain effects and conveying a message to a larger organisation that is ultimately autonomous. And this is perhaps where the autonomous and self-aware aspects of the Singularity meet the subject and object of cultural analysis. The language of the programme is a powerful construct that functions as a kind of pre-constituted ideal or set of ideals that emerge from the interaction</text>

To take the underlying principles of what is perhaps the most widely used programming language, the human language, and to apply those principles in the context of a cultural practice? Such a proposal is at odds with the historical presumption of human universality and rigid differentiation that still pervades our cultural practice. Do you know when you’d written the most legible piece of software you've ever written?

For this reason it was always a good idea to have a large number of programmers around to keep programmes in check.Programming languages are inherently interpretive, enabling grammars of interpretation to be formed. But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take an obvious example, the programming of grammars of interpretation is part of what we might call the ‘metainterface’ in which the human language is mapped onto a computer chip. So while the human language can and should be computer programmable – and is likely to become that – the extent to which is to be determined by the whims of the fickle and capricious elements of the chip, its firmware and software, and its ever-expanding and mutating ecosystem of hardware and software components. And while it is true that grammars of interpretation exist today in the form of firmware, software and monitor chips, that is very different from the grammars of control found in more traditional computer systems. A grammars of interpretation are more like towers of some sort, with tiers of programming at certain levels allowing access to higher and more subtle levels. And while the grammars of interpretation do have this flexibility and this power, the grammars of control are</text>

But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take one example, consider this sentence, which appeared in the New York Times on May 9th, 1948: ‘Times Square is going through a renovation. The buildings that once housed arcades are going to be reconfigured as city parks. A park is a space that contains a recreational area, a retail outlet, a public plaza and a public square.’ The Times had just published an article by Hilary Putner, ‘Times Square Restoration Task Force’, that was much more prescient than the one that came out of the New York Public Library that same day. Msgr. Harold Levy, then the Acting Director of the New York Public Library, summed up the significance of the landmark paper when he said: ‘The Times had a great idea. We gave it the benefit of the doubt. We said, ‘This could happen in New York.’’ It seems quite obvious to me that the Times and Levy Brothers could not have foreseen</text>

But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take an obvious example, the grammatical construction of the English language, which is constructed in a similar way to the language of the insular world of computers – with indefinite articles and clauses – allows us to create grammars of interpretation that are highly contextual and dependant upon the particular construction of the construction of time and space. For instance, the construction of a building or a street can be traced to the specific grammars of meaning and location that were developed by and for the computer industry. But how? This is where programming comes in. It is this ability to interpret linguistic structures that was seen as a fundamental building block of any new technological paradigm. And so, while the insular world of the computer did have grammars of meaning and location, the grammars of programming were seen as having a very different kind of structure. One could argue that the grammars of meaning and location evolved independently in parallel across different technological generations, but the fact that they are traceable to the</text>

But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take one example, consider the way in which the English language is inherently binary: either a letter is a letter or a letter is a letter and so forth. But what is a letter in the binary language of English? If the interpretation of a letter is unpredictable, how is the interpretation of a whole language? In a general way, yes; but this is because English is a universal language and grammar – the same rules apply regardless of where in the world the word is written. So while the interpretation of a single letter can be written off as an error, the nature of the word itself (simplified to its essentials) remains subject to great uncertainty. This ambiguity is compounded by the fact that the language we write is constructed out of overlapping terms and phrases, each defining a part of the universal grammar. Thus while the interpretation of a single letter can be written off as an error, the nature of the word itself remains subject to great uncertainty. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary lists many different spell</text>

But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take an obvious example, the language of the internet allows users to form grammars of interpretation around patterns, behaviours, characters and functions – recognising and interpreting them as data. So while the user can and should do all these things with no accountability to external authorities, the potentialities and capacities of this kind of programming are equally potentially destructive. A cautionary note, perhaps, for future generations when they come to programming.

But they are also inherently interpretive of what? To take an obvious example, consider the way in which the BBC World Service programmes it produces today are characterised by a great deal of linguistic ambiguity and ambiguity of interpretation. The reason is that programmes have become interactive interfaces, and grammar was seen as a degree of interpretive media beyond the confines of the textual medium. But programming is a very particular kind of interpretation, and the BBC World Service programmes it produces today are not just textual but also ‘interpretive’ in the sense that they interpret linguistic meaning in ways that are not confined to the context they were produced in. The World Service ‘learns’, meaning that programmes need to be constantly re-programmed, and this need not be automated. The BBC World Service needs to be constantly re-trained in order to provide the interpretation it requires, but it also needs to be taught how to interpret ambiguous or ambiguous grammars of interpretation. This may require the use of metainterfaces, programming languages or ‘deep learning</text>
