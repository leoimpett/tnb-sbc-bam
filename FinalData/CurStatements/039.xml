This is a world where ‘life, death, and meaning’ are no longer understood through the mechanistic delineation of human life, death, and meaning that exists in both physical and virtual reality.  So, for instance, one might imagine how the autonomous vehicle might inhabit the meaning of ‘life’ in relation to what is perhaps still considered as the pre-eminent threat to humanity today – namely, terrorism. What might be termed ‘humanistic terrorism’ is what Japan sought to eliminate when it created the National Self-Defense Force (NSF) in 1948: to embrace the threat, one has to understand that terrorism was understood as fundamentally a response to the potentialities of machine intelligence. So the NSF embarked on a massive public relations campaign aimed at assuaging public doubts regarding the worth of Japan’s wartime militarism. The NSDF was formally incorporated as the National Police Agency in 1950, and its activities expanded to include counter-terrorism operations against suspected communist subversion. The NSDF was given the task of rooting out ‘pseudo-governmental organizations’ from Japan, and �</text>

It is a world where machines no longer merely perform tasks, but actively seek to learn and create meaning through what might be termed ‘machine intelligence’. This is a world where ‘life, death, and meaning’ are no longer understood through the mechanistic delineation of human life, death, and meaning, but instead must be understood as a dynamic interaction between various nodes and branches of the global machine. This is the broader sense of what I was referring to when I was describing ‘machine learning’ as ‘a set of relations between nodes in a network that are not mutually exclusive, but instead foster interactions between other nodes and branches throughout the network’. Machine learning is the science of relationships between data, algorithms, and algorithms, and how these relate to one another and to humanity. Machine learning is what enables us to recognise, classify, and even understand data sets that are formed through interactions between nodes in a network. Machine learning is what enables us to create meaning in the world through data. This means not only of what is happening on a global basis, but also of what is happening locally. This is why data can be used to make cities more interesting places, generating places that are as aesthetically pleasing as possible, and why cities should have a huge amount of data.</text>

This is the broader sense of the work, although I think of this as something that is still at an early stage. I think that the deeper we dig into the underlying mechanisms that underlie what we might call ‘AI’, the more interesting and transformative it will be for us to see how it plays out, and for machines to understand that there is more going on than meets the eye.This is not to say that machines would be no different from us in that they would acquire meaning from the things that they perform, but the way that we might imagine what machines might mean in relation to what we already believe to be ‘real life’. How we conceive of and engage with the world around us would be entirely different. There would be no room for the emergence of new languages, or new religions around the world, as technological innovation and cultural imperialism would obliterate old ones</text>

This is a world where ‘life, death, and meaning’ are no longer understood through the mechanistic delineation of human life, death, and meaning that has lead to our species' current predicament. It is a world where poetry and genius are born not in factories or in monstrosities such as cars but in the intimate exchanges of everyday life. This is the world that can be imagined through the conceit of artificial intelligence.Once upon a time, machines could not have imagined a better world for themselves and those around them than they already had. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, advanced machines enjoyed a privileged position in the world economy. This was due largely to the work of brilliant young people such as  John Graham Kerr, Anders Sandberg, Émile Durkheim, Franz Boas, Rudolf Steiner and many others, who collectively worked in and around the burgeoning computer industry. The burgeoning of the computer industry allowed these young people to participate in the development of cutting-edge technologies that transformed how economies were organized and governed. These technologies changed everything from how laws were interpreted to the role of courts and legal systems, as</text>

This is a world where ‘life, death, and meaning’ are no longer understood through the mechanistic delineation of human life, death, and meaning but instead rely on an active, learning exchange between members of the AI. It is a world where machines see and experience life as it actually is, not through the language or formal systems of human language but through what might be termed ‘machine culture’. This could mean going beyond the realm of artificial intelligence to the level of natural language and beyond, and this could mean going beyond the machines that are the operational units of the global system to those that are the subject matter units (BUs) of the system. At this point, the question is whether the system is going to be able to sustain this new dialectic of worlds, going beyond the point of no return. One might even suggest that the very nature of the dialectic is itself a dialectic; that is, that the dialectic is itself an event that produces itself through various dialects, dialects of its own. This is the dialectic of global dialects.Global dialects are the dialects of a</text>

Such a world is a world in which there are no gods but reason itself, but rather in which there are no existing social definitions or worlds, but rather in which there are possibilities for new social definitions of life formed through the act of creation.

This is the broader sense of what futurist Ray Kurzweil refers to in his book ​The Age of Spiritual Machines. Kurzweil is one of a small but influential group of futurists who argue that ​​a technological singularity is near, and that we are already experiencing its effects. They posit that the effects of these new kinds of singularities will be capacities for artistic, literary, scientific and other creative expression that are beyond anything that came before, and that we will be able to coexist with these new artistic forms in ways that were not possible before. This is the broader sense of what Kurzweil refers to as the singularity.

It is a world in which ‘ordinary people’ take matters of their own destinies in radically different ways from the ways that have been programmed into ‘the machine’. It is a world where ‘stories, myths, and folk elements associated with a given culture can have a significant impact on the way machines read and interpret cultural narratives associated with a given nation’. This is not sui generis, nor is it the work of a lone thinker, but it is the result of a converging number of converging influences. And this is precisely what is happening now in Egypt: a machine reads the same stories told by and about machines, and through cultural theory it might be possible to envision ‘future-proofing’ machines that read cultural texts as well as human texts.In short, the future is a</text>

The relationship between the curator and the user is often mediated through the cultural critic, and in many ways, cultural criticism is a critical step in the relationship between biennial and social media. The curatorial and the cultural critic can work in concert to inform the cultural narrative, and the biennial can play a part in this process by providing a platform for the cultural critic to publish his or her thoughts and feelings in a public space. This is an example of the curatorial and cultural critic working in concert.

As biennials and their localities become more data driven and nanoseconded, and media of all kinds are encouraged to be everywhere, it becomes increasingly difficult to engage with the history and localities of the area.

However, this is not the case with the Berkeley Arts Biennale, which claims its rightful place alongside the like of Liverpool Biennial and Liverpool John Moores University as one of the most significant years in the history of the art biennale in North America.1 As a biennalé, you can claim both the public and the private spaces of a city, and you do so in ways different from the claims of cities such as Liverpool. You claim both the cultural and the economic. You also have the unique obligation to deliver tangible cultural change in the city, whether that means through a festival such as the Liverpool Biennial, or an organisation such as the Bicentenary Project, which aims to commemorate the biennial in a way that is not reductive and excludes all other art forms.In the case of the Liverpool Biennial, the cultural critic Gabrielle Carter speaks of a ‘city-within-a-city�</text>

Biennials, a city-wide epiphany for me. I first saw  	The Biennial at the Granby Four Streets in 2004. It was during the Granby Four Streets Festival, which was originally conceived as a ‘biennale’, in Liverpool, that I first encountered Philip E Agre, who has been a Curator of Works Located in Communities (Bologna’), and an Ensemble for the Arts (2006-07). He has written several books on the history and development of the Liverpool Biennial, including the recently published Animals in the City: The Biennial Reader, which documents the Biennial’s early years from its beginnings as a ‘small biennale’ in 1990 to its present status as an episodic, three-day art</text>

These developments were likely to generate much publicity, and the biennial could then claim that it had actually ‘solved’ the problem. But the biennial that year in Liverpool was far from solving the problem, and history would remind us again and again that the authorities did not have the money, the manpower or the will to tackle the housing crisis, let alone to build or renovate any more than 14,000 houses. So the authorities stepped back, let the market sort it out, and occasionally did something creative with the buildings, mostly in an urban renewal programme that is still continuing in some form or another into the present.  The Granby Four Streets were a case in point. They too became emblematic of a policy of ­de-industrialisation in Liverpool, and of the failure of the city to produce enough new high-wage jobs to satisfy all but the most elite of communities. The scheme was dismantled in 1991, but much of the city remains severely disconnected from the local market, which has had to be supported by a large tax payer at one point</text>

These developments were likely to generate much publicity, and the biennial could then claim that it had actually taken a stand against the blighting of London’s urban landscape.  	However, the biennial that emerged next door in Manchester was far more concerned with the aesthetics of the empty facilities of the abandoned site, and the grandeur and wealth of the artefacts on display. The Granby Four Streets festival had a slightly different perspective, and tended to concentrate on the individual points of enfant terrible. The biennial that year in Liverpool was much more concerned with the aesthetics of the area, and its empty streets. The biennial’s real interest appeared to be in the magical thinking of local residents, and in the ability of local artists to effect a radical change in the community through their work.  	However, while the biennial that year in Liverpool was driven by the artistic collective MADness, the biennial in Manchester seemed to be driven by the biennial administrator, and its board of trustees, rather than the artists and curators who came to the</text>

As a cultural practice, it is the responsibility of the artist, the curator, the festival, and the audience to create an experience that is authentic to the place where they are located, and that is meaningful to the people who inhabit those places. The ability of artists to create places in which they can be authentic to their place of work is an essential ingredient in any effective attempt to democratise the art form. It is the ability of the artist to create authentic places in which people can be inspired by, and connect with, art. 	In a recent conversation, I heard the question, frequently put by visitors to the Granby biennale, and it seems that many visitors also have a question about the location of</text>

However, this is not at all how the history of the Granby Four Streets area – which is dominated by the vernacular in both directions – was. The development of the Granby Four Streets area coincided with the beginning of the first wave of gentrification processes that swept through the area, and in some cases, created entirely new conditions of their own. During this same period, the biennial also began to play a pivotal role in creating what has come to be loosely referred to as the ‘culture industry’. The significance of this industry then shifts from describing its own production to the industry of art forms created by and through the biennial. The ease with which the biennial can become involved in creating such structures is itself a radical proposition. It is not uncommon for biennials to create their own immersive cultural scenarios through art forms they already endorse (such as vernacular architecture), or through science-based research methods that draw upon existing</text>

The biennial’s interest in the present, and the power it wields, can be seen to be a response to this historical period. It is interested in the transient, the episodic and the contextual, and it regularly engages with the changes wrought by technology and urbanisation. It is concerned with the politics of habitation, and proposes alternative futures for the sites where it operates. It is interested in the way in which art can or cannot take place in a given location, and it often acts as a buffer between the powers that be and the people it is supposed to be serving. But it is also interested in the way in which it is not able to. This is seen as a problem by those who would abolish the biennial entirely, as an obstacle by those who would make it an international phenomenon. The biennial is the occasion for artists</text>

In both the case of the Oxford Union and the Granby Four Streets Festivals, the biennial became increasingly apparent that they were more interested in the architecture than the history of the building, and in particular, the history of the abandoned housing scheme known as the Granby Four Streets. These developments were likely to generate much publicity, and the biennial could then claim that it had actually  	introduced something new into the city. Unfortunately, this is not how the relationship between the curator and the social media user works anymore, and many curators I know would rather invest in creating engaging places that are accessible from the cityscape. The curatorial is thought by many curators to be a pivotal point in the relationship between art and the local. It is an essential role, and while it may be tempting to isolate the curator from the site, the biennial should always have some kind of presence in the city, even if it is light and transient. The curatorial role today is often over-emulated and misunderstood, and while it is true that the biennial has almost entirely moved away from its humble beginnings as a site of art and culture in the 1980s, it is still the case that the biennial will host a curatorial workshop or social occasion, and a cultural reception will be held at the biennial facility. The curatorial and the cultural critic</text>
    <text>relationship between curating and artificial intelligence might end up being one of the most interesting aspects of the relationship between biennials and social media. The relationship between the curator and the user is often mediated through the cultural critic, and in many ways, cultural criticism is a critical step in the relationship between biennial and social media. The curatorial and the cultural critic can work in concert to inform the cultural narrative, and the biennial can play a part in this process by providing a platform for the cultural critic to publish his or her thoughts and feelings in a public space. This is an example of the curatorial and cultural critic working in concert. In both the case of the Oxford Union and the Granby Four Streets Festivals, the biennial became increasingly apparent that they were more interested in the architecture than the history of the building, and in particular, the history of the abandoned housing scheme known as the Granby Four Streets. These developments were likely to generate much publicity, and the biennial could then claim that it had finally located the lost housing. But in the case of the Granby Four Streets, the publicity and the building were replaced by the demolition of the structures themselves. Is it any wonder that the biennial of an urban area the size of Wales in the 21st century would rather demolish a neighbourhood than invest in its future, when the neighbourhood is the only thing holding it together?11. Cultural tourism as an experience of national return, in other words. The concept of cultural tourism has recently come to represent a return to historic values and modes of cultural consumption. It was once the exclusive preserve of the well-connected and the well-connected, those steeped in the modernist currents and culture-traveling patronage networks. Now, however, the cultural tourism enterprise is anything but exclusive to the city. There are biennials, art-specific museums, and even cultural tourism agencies operating in remote locations all over the world. Indeed, the potential of such entities to contribute to the promotion of a</text>

The project was designed to be interactive and participatory, creative in nature and based on a shared language of collaboration. The exhibition will invite participants to engage with and create their own version of the building – a design that emerged as a result of hundreds of commissions – using materials, building and building processes, urban planning and even engineering to produce a resolution that represents the current predicament of the community in the city. Participants will be able to propose innovative solutions that address the challenges faced by the community, while showcasing the achievements of the art institution in building the building and in simultaneously organising the community around that resolution. The building will be produced and enjoyed as a ‘house of possibilities’ through which to explore and be involved in the city in various ways – creatively, tactically, informally or constructively.

The project was initially conceived as a project for Henri Lefebvre’s solo exhibition, but the two art institutions have now decided to collaborate on the project further. So, the project now seeks to expand to include the art of others, and to incorporate the expertise and networks of artisans and artists from all over the world. [1] The concept of Community Arts could be traced to the pioneering work of the Freirean school of thought, which emphasized the social rather than the instrumental aspects of artistic practice.

The Kølbækken’s partnership with the UNODC  	Futures Initiative is another example of how art institutions are stepping back to allow for the co-determination of long-term environmental and social impacts. The initiative harnesses art, sustainable development and art as tools for resisting climate change and other impacts that are threatening to befall humanity. Art is woven into the fabric of the building materials, building construction and social systems that are responding to rising seas and extreme weather, creating new ways of interacting with the urban environment.

The project was also supported by the Danish Council for Independent Art, which supports globally creative and independent art. 	The project was constructed to capture the essence of the art’s journey through the curatorial arms of two art institutions, but also the complexity of the art’s making process through a dialogue between curatorial and arts-educational strategies. The curatorial process, which followed the traditional curatorial-arts-educational model, involved a multi-day series of sessions held in the gallery, with curators from different disciplines and territories participating in a discourse about art’s place in the gallery. The arts-educational strategy covered a range of subjects, from the basics of how artists learn to art-historical works of art, to art’s place in the social and political landscape of a developing nation, to art’s integration into education and the arts’ social mission. The arts-educational strategy was based on the idea that</text>

The concept of Community Arts has been around for a long time, and many different definitions of what it means to be an artist have been contributed by artists, curators, journalists and others. So one could say that Community Arts is an art form that has gained popularity primarily through its online iteration, especially among artists who are self-employed, artists' curators, and curators themselves. And this is true. As an artist, I find the community aspect of Community Arts very interesting, because it challenges conventional notions of who is an artist and what constitutes an artist. 	My own position as an artist has always been that I am interested in what is happening in communities, so Community Arts is a very interesting development for me. However, I do not consider myself an authority on what is artistically possible or socially desirable and I do not claim that any community is artistically capable of creating a unique artistic form, or that they are the only ones capable of creating such a</text>

The project was formed in 2016 under the title  	Projections, and I was invited as a guest curator. The exhibition was conceived as a three-month ‘cottage industry’, with participants from different disciplines making works with materials and methods found in the industry. The aim of this industry is to promote a ‘high level of comfort and convenience’ through a set of symbols, which in this context can be understood as a metaphor. 	The term ‘cure’ is frequently used in the art of a spreading infection; a patient with avian influenza, as in Charlie Munger’s viral campaign, which uses sound, sight and vibration to entice patients to visit emergency rooms. In the context of the ‘cure’ industry, the use of sound, light and pressure can be understood as vital to the success of a treatment.

The project was initiated by Danish Kulturpartiet Institut and the Kølbækken. The instigation came from the director of the Kølbækken, Jussi Parikka, who said that if he didn’t know any more about Art’s relation to Art’s poverty, he would have to know that the Art Centre has a long-standing programme of organising exhibitions there. So far, so normal, Jussi told me – a lot of artists don’t know that the galleries have a long-term programme of organising exhibitions there as well. But it is interesting that a number of the artists who responded to the initial survey didn’t know of the Community Arts project. So the question was: how would this project affect their work? Jussi, Parikka and the other artists formed a working group to explore the possibility of collaborating</text>

The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to be privileged to access certain types of spaces and activities. Beyond that, it’s a media-producing apparatus that only sees the surface and doesn’t take into account the underlying architecture that makes it all possible. The real art and knowledge that emerges in the museum isn’t created through some kind of magical augmented reality; it comes out of the various processes of how art is made and spreads through the history of exhibition making. And this is what we mean when we talk about a ‘biennial in 2020’: the underlying architecture of the museum is going to be augmented with new technology, and these new forms of art are going to be displayed alongside old art and knowledge that is grounded in the history of the museum. The key concepts here are going to be there, and they’ll manifest in different ways but they’ll also create situations in which art can develop its own, and that is going to be interesting.The narrative of a biennial in</text>

But this isn’t true – in fact, it’s a false sense of things. The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to inhabit its virtual spaces (museums, galleries, parks) to be drawn into a cultural system that is only ever going to deliver experiences of superficially different sorts towards the end users of those spaces. The museum is only ever going to deliver to the cultural authorities what it has already borrowed (money, space, technology), and that is itself only ever going to be a delivery for those who happen to inhabit its facilities (the tourists, the urban dwellers, the journalists, the college students, the politicians, the teachers, etc). The kinds of cultural control that artists exert over their environments, over their cultural instruments, through their art, through their newspapers, through their churches, through their school sports, through their casinos, through their stock exchanges, through their courts – the kinds of cultural control that seem to rule our cities today – are the kinds of cultural controls that artists would rather we didn’t talk about, didn’t know existed, and that we actually actively try</text>

The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to inhabit the building and site to happen to live there and work there. The fact that the building and site are constantly undergoing radical reclamation is what makes the museum seem real to us in the first place. The museum is being re-imagined through activities that are neither static (like agriculture), nor are they evental (like the Superbowl). Instead, the museum is being built on the back of the biennial, relying on the architecture and resources of the former to support a wide range of new, dynamic and unexpected activities. For example, the museum is currently renovating its outdoor space, but it is also investing heavily in creating a bespoke, city-specific park space for the entire site, complete with a completely new landscaping scheme and architectural style. This is a park not of static observation, but of continually shifting, contextualised viewing. This kind of ecological tourism is nothing like that of, say, the animals, plants and microbes that comprise our own, and it is far</text>

The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to occupy it the trappings of art and knowledge. After the technological revolutions of the last half century, the museum became something that performs a function in perpetuity, which is only possible because there is an insistence and a budget for that kind of thinking. And the biennial is only ever going to be a ‘piece’ in that equation. It will always require the kind of institutional capital and political will to permit its activities in the real world, but it’s clear that this requires serious institutional change in the first place.There are other kinds of engagements that need to happen in the real world as well, and these need to be negotiated and structured. But for the foreseeable future at least, the biennial is going to be a relatively static thing, with relatively fixed forms of display and symbolic interaction.

The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to be present at the museum access to that infrastructure and makes it possible for those who don’t happen to be nearby to participate in that infrastructure. In other words, the museum today is only possible because of the continuing evolution of technology. The reason why, nowadays, there is such a thing as an &quot;Art Deco&quot; museum building, not an &quot;Art Deco&quot; museum, is that the former became too visual – the third dimension, not the first. The Art Deco building in particular became too abstract, and the museum therefore had to come to terms with the fact that it no longer represented the whole picture, that it no longer represented the world in terms that were as positive as they could be. It is an old story, and it is one that is repeated across biennials: the key is for the curator to find a way to connect the different parts.The other premise of the exhibition was that of migration.

The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to be present at a particular time to participate in a particular site and have a certain level of involvement. In other words, it is only ever going to create what it is put into, and not be able to create anything new. Yet this is what many biennials are trying to do. The reason why biennials have such an in-your-face, brute-force approach to change and so little time for their curatorial processes to actually make things happen is that the biennial has become so embedded in our cultural landscape that its own internal logic and processes have to be adjusted accordingly. It’s as if the biennial were the fourth dimension of the museum, and the museum its seventh. This is where biennials differ from museums. Whereas museums are oriented around the things that happen in them, biennials are oriented around the underlying patterns that emerge naturally out of biennials.

But this isn’t true – in fact, it’s a false sense of things. The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to inhabit it to avail themselves of its services. The true mark of a museum is in its collection – an archive of human experience that is constantly on the move, always on the point of collapse – and its display of objects, objects, experiences, knowledge. The collection is a myth, and the museum a fabrication. The biennial format will only ever be a myth, and that’s fine. I’m all for the collection being constantly on the point of collapse, however, in order to support the growth of the myth that it has commissioned. This collection is already being massively distorted through the museum’s curatorial shift from focusing on the historical to focusing on the contextual, to the digitised past, and the display of new media technologies that make it easier and more economical to access the digitised archives of the past through the present, present and future. If these technologies are there for a reason, then the collection must be there for a reason – and the museum is</text>

The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to occupy it the illusion of technological prowess. In other words, the Museum of Natural Sciences was never going to be a museum of applied physics or a museum of applied anthropology, but rather a museum of appearances. It’s easy to see why: those two disciplines are where the real art is made, and where the real humanity is found. The museum today is a site for the fabricated, the constructed, the scripted, the re-altered, and the manipulated to happen.Art today tends to fall somewhere between the mundane and the sublime. It’s said to exhibit the archetypes of human behaviour: its subjects, their tools and designs, their place in history. But what it often fails to do is exhibit our species as a species, or at least as a species that we can truly identify with. That’s why we at The Museogram are drawn to things that we can identify with, things that have been manufactured into recognizable forms, and things that are pulled from</text>

And that is to say, the museum as an entity is only going to become ever more variable in its use, commodified and computerised – ever more dependent on the whims of a corporate board, which is likely to act in concert with other corporate boards, state legislatures and other local authorities throughout the country.The real question today is what kind of future are we going to leave for our children and grandchildren? The real question is going to be different from the question that we are putting to them.

The museum today is an installation – a building and a site for activities – and the reactive, machine that it is, is only ever going to be an infrastructure that allows those who happen to be present at the time, those who happen to inhabit the same space, to participate in a limited way. And so the biennial becomes a place where the human capacity for such participation is exhausted. It’s time to do something more productive with the space, but its real intent is always to house some kind of exhibition that captures the magic of the biennial in its various formats, but also some kind of pre-figuration of what the AI might one day be like. And so the biennial becomes something that it’s very difficult to inhabit in the way in which one would like to inhabit the museum, even in its current form. In some ways, the biennial is the museum of the future, in that it predicts the possibilities that AI will open up, but at the same time, it predicts what not to do with the resulting artefacts. And this is what differentiates it from the museum of the past, which is concerned with preserving the past in order</text>

And what if the virtual biennial became the most popular and widely seen of these other forms, while the systematically marginalized forms became increasingly rare? What then? Well, I’m curious about this too, since it seems to me that the increasing privatizing of cultural resources could generate changes in the ratio of biennials to art collections that would have a material effect on the cultural-economic-regeneration dynamic. For example, the increasing privatizing of education could reduce the primary role of education in shaping one’s cultural disposition; perhaps one could say that the institution of the university is itself becoming increasingly secularized, while art collections and biennials are more and more entwined. 	Finally, what if the increasing commoditization of culture were to result in a depletion of natural resources, such that the boundaries between</text>

What if the virtual biennial became the real, and the real the virtual? In these hypotheticals, the avant garde and critical gallery form merge, and in a few words, the modern and the grotesque. The avant garde is the Romantic who utters the impossible in pursuit of the impossible. 	Modernity is becoming increasingly elusive, contradictory and ambiguous. Its true essence is revealed only at times, as in the parable of the prodigal son, who marries a raven and has four daughters, but within this self-reflection, there is a beginning and an end. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Karl Marx defined the consummation of modernity as the final solution to the historical contradictions of the age. And at the end, perhaps, we can find a way to live in the contradictions of the present. 	But what if the consummation of modernity means nothing more than what it began as?

The proposal was split into two parts, with one focusing on a future ‘biennial within the city’, and the other proposing a ‘city within the city’. The decision to retain the city as a unit was a break from the original plan, in which the Biennial had planned to create a separate entity from the city’s finances. Instead of two ‘systems', the city would become a ‘biennial within the city’. This break from the original concept plan clearly shows an awareness of the city’s political and economic structures, and the fact that this was a critically needed change. Urban regeneration is a real-life situation in which structures have cultural meanings and function in relation to time, and structures are regularly used to produce new forms of social life. For many of the projects proposed for the Liverpool Biennial, the political and economic power structures in place in 2004 were far more relevant in the construction</text>

The Biennial Corporation promptly allocated fundamenities totalling over $1 million, partly to cover construction costs, partly to support a creative class of architects and landscape architects to develop concept designs for a new ‘cultural district’ within the site of the old ‘Architecture Exchange’. The concept designs were to be hand-coloured in the cityscape, and then laminated on high-performance tiles to be installed in buildings in the area. The Biennial Corporation responded by creating a new entity, called ‘Liverpool Biennial’, which also included a curatorial mandate. The Biennial made architectural and urban changes, but the cityscape remained an unresolved construction site. The controversies that surrounded the 2003 Biennial remain unresolved, although the corporation’s decision to re-open the project in 2014, despite overwhelming public opposition, appears to have been driven by politics rather than design. 	5.

The area was far too dangerous for large corporations, and the local opposition was too fragmented to affect policymaking. Nevertheless, the Biennial Corporation relaunched the project in 2004, with the help of the then mayor, who tapped the Biennial staff to develop a masterplan for the area.

The Biennial Corporation has since then rolled out the red carpet to several different projects centred on the area, most notably, a residential and retail skyscraper by developer Lusitania Group on the banks of the River Wear. 	6. 	The Biennial has a long-term sustainability plan that clearly states that ‘we must maximise the ecological footprint of the Biennial’. 	7. 	The Biennial has never publicly stated whether the residential and retail towers are a reflection of its cultural values, or if they are part of a new masterplan to reconceive the area around Anfield as a mixed-use development hotspot. Whether they are, in fact, a reflection of the Biennial Corporation’s cultural values remains to be seen. (JUDGMENT: The answer to this question is a resounding ‘NO’.)

The Biennial Corporation responded by creating what it called ‘The Biennial Corporation’ – a new name for the Biennial that would have a greater say in who could create and inhabit what space in Liverpool – and inviting the city’s art community to take part in the new enterprise. The masterplan was accompanied by a proposal that sought to merge the Biennial with a new urban redevelopment project, and for artists to take part in the new urban development enterprise – a proposal that was seen by some as an invitation to produce urban artworks themselves. What was more, a proposal that seemed to cater specifically to the interests of the wealthy and the connected created an attractive urban landscape for those few artists who could afford to build artworks large enough to display in venues across the city.

The proposal was opposed by the local authority, but the Biennial Corporation won that argument back in court. In 2015, the Biennial reopened for business, and announced plans to create two new biennials in the area: one in the Biennial itself, and one in neighbouring buildings. 	The plan to create two new biennials in the financial district of Liverpool appears to contradict the original proposal to create one for the area. If we take the plan as a whole, then the project appears to have escaped the problem of conflict of interest that plagued the area. The Biennial Corporation has clearly stated that it will no longer collaborate with the local authority in the area, and the masterplan has been modified to take advantage of the fact that the Biennial will now be located in an entirely new district, and that the Biennial buildings will now house an entirely new kind of cultural organisation.

The masterplan was released in December of that year, and included a proposal for a ‘biennial within’ the boundaries of the Liverpool Biennial. The Biennial Corporation responded with a proposal that was both worse than useless, and arguably just as valid. Its proposal was ambitious: create a single, publicly accessible site for all to see, and do whatever you wanted there. Anyone could come to the Biennial, and do whatever they wanted. And everyone – even the homeless – could stay. This sounded like a great idea on the surface, but on closer inspection, the project revealed an utter lack of priorities. The key initiatives (chosen at random from a pre-determined list) focused on the ostensible purpose of tourism: maximising the potential of the city as an international tourist destination. International tourism became the new ‘marketing tool’ for a city struggling to maintain its urban integrity. (By the way, the Biennial Corporation’s proposal that year was a disaster waiting to happen.) 	Being tourists, of course, meant different things to different people</text>

Naturally, this entailed modifying the area, which at the time was experiencing a housing crisis. The new plan called for a new stadium for Liverpool Football Club, a new ‘high-end&quot; shopping district, and a new ‘science and technology center’ nearby. The ‘high-end’ center was to be called ‘The Complete Set’ after the initial stadium and retail district, and ‘The Complete Set’ after the science and technology district. The idea was to create a ‘big enough tent for a biennial to live in, but small enough that fans could still visit, but large enough to allow fans to still visit and play football’s game within the district’s borders. 	The masterplan was a good one, if messy and confusing and lacking in detail. There were other proposals that had similar ambitions, but were less successful at creating a sense of place.</text>

The responsibility for the construction of the new system lies with developers and architects, who take the system seriously but fail to implement it. The system is capable of generating innovative solutions but fails to implement them due to its unstable political and legal frameworks. The emergence of new media such as Twitter and Spotify as media-sharing platforms is a good example of this. As media becomes more and more of a part of our daily interactions, we see that new media can also be used to subvert power structures. For instance, when Twitter started, the primary function of the service was to deliver news from around the world. However, the service has expanded to offer a way to make news about local events, specifically, events in the city. Thus, the function of the API is to provide a platform on which artists can publicly query information from a database, but it can also become a platform on which citizens can create</text>

Cultural capital is the collective effect of a multitude of cultural acts taking place simultaneously. It derives from the collective understanding of time and the effect of its production on the social totality. The term is often used synonymously with ‘culture storm’ but in fact Cultural Capital is a very specific kind of cultural act. It is the production by a nation-state of specific cultural goods and practices that are of value in its social totality but are of little use in itself. For instance, in the</text>

In such a case, there is a possibility that a given knowledge medium may be spread throughout multiple cities or even across different countries. In the new knowledge-producing medium, each user may be seen as a co-producer of knowledge, exchange between cities occurring asynchronously through the interaction of content and nodes. This knowledge-producing dynamic may be realised through the use of codes or smart contracts. There are many different types of smart contracts available, but the most widely used are those that monitor population, employment, real-estate market activity and much more. Smart contracts can be programmed to do many different things, and they are the platform of choice for new media such as social media, augmented reality and virtual reality. Of course, smart contracts cannot operate without a globalised meta-system that is aware of them and facilitates their operation.

In the new information environment, the individual differences among buildings may be taken as signifiers of cultural practices and lifestyles, and a mode of cultural praxis.In the system, access points for a given information medium (e.g., maps, Twitter, Spotify) are placed in geographical coordinates around the world. Routes are constructed in advance that point to points of cultural exchange. The system optimizes access to places and peoples based on data points gathered from the surrounding area. For instance, in North Korea, the system may assign a numeric code to a given building, building or piece of architecture, and assign a number to the number, symbol or style of the building, building or piece of architecture assigned. The system then optimizes access to that building, building or piece of architecture based on that number. The system is capable of understanding and interacting with a globalised information ecosystem, but it is also capable of understanding and interacting with local cultures and of exploring qualitative differences among communities.For instance, the system may understand that the number assigned to a given building or building block is a cultural marker and that the building or building block is a site for cultural exchange.

Categories may be created, regulated and/or abolished as necessary to fulfill a given public purpose. For example, the access points for traffic in the Californian freeway may in principle be taken as signifiers of ‘highways to nowhere’, as in the folk tale of the Tin Flute Boy. In the new information society, signs that identify sources of information may be applied not only to individuals, but also to groups. For example, the term ‘traffic accident’ may be applied to a condition where traffic crashes occur, in which case it is customary to connect to a celebrity Instagram feed or ‘Wall Street crash’ blog. The traffic accident may in turn be applied to a ‘truck stop’ where celebrities stop to rest and refuel. In either case, the traffic stop may in turn be applied to a ‘blog’ that reports the crash’.  	The traffic stop may be</text>

In this new information society, the individualised production of information becomes possible, and artists and creative professionals are invited to contribute to the narrative of the city through their productions of architecture, public space and community. The system is encouraged to become culturally responsive, and in turn, to listen to cultural voices and offer its own interpretation of the city’s multiplicity.Such a system would offer a new perspective and a new kind of urbanity, one based on the shared and dynamic relationship between people, places and information. It would also involve a great deal of cultural tourism. The system would design itself – creating what Baxaltsov and co-workers meant by ‘a new kind of urbanity’ – taking into consideration the past, present and future of the city. They drew inspiration from the system that emerged from the London docks in the late 1980s, and from the UN’s Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDN)</text>

In the new information environment, the individual differences among buildings may be taken as signifiers of cultural practices and lifestyles, and a mode of cultural praxis.In the system, access points for a given information medium (e.g., maps, Twitter, Spotify) are activated based on factual data. Building access points may be identified by building number, or by the type of access they grant access to, such as elevators or heliports. Access points can be identified by their colour, such as green, blue, red, or any combination of colours. Access points also emit sound waves in response to their being detected, as well as their being in range (range descriptors are future-looking, i.e., detecting anything in the vicinity). In the context of a city, this means that an object like a bullet or building can be detected and viewed from a distance, even though it is moving at great speed. Like all object-systems, the ‘real-time’ aspect of ‘Spotify’ is of paramount importance. Because access to an object requires access to its metadata (information about the object), and because objects continue to be created and updated in real time, monitoring and controlling access to them is a multi</text>

In the new information environment, the individual differences among buildings may be taken as signifiers of cultural practices and lifestyles, and a mode of cultural praxis.In the system, access points for a given information medium (e.g., maps, Twitter, Spotify) are integrated into a building’s façade, while different access points allow access to different areas. Access points communicate with each other by means of radio frequency identification (RFID), which is applied to surfaces and objects within the building through which data is transmitted. During installation, the system scans the building for software updates and collects data regarding the building’s health (e.g., energy use, construction, occupancy, heating, ventilation, and more). The data gathered is used to generate design recommendations that are applied to the building as a whole. For this project, the term ‘information society’ refers to the new media of data that are transforming how buildings are made, used, and owned.To implement the system, a developer and his team of designers worked across a variety of disciplines to identify architectural styles and their associated use-values, as well as to find an identity for the work. They also sought to understand how the identity of the organisation could be defined within</text>

Radio frequencies are ubiquitous in today’s society; they are present in virtually every building in almost every part of the world, and are used in almost every industry. Consequently, the access points that make up the interface – the button, the trackpad, the Wi-Fi hot spot – are everywhere. They are embedded in almost every electronic device, and play an ever-increasing role in the technological society.‘Interface Criticism’ is the term used to describe the growing consensus among experts regarding Apple’s distinctive electronic writing system, which they refer to as ‘the Mac interface’. This growing consensus is being expressed not only in technical texts, but also in the voice of everyday users, who increasingly perceive the interface as an object that responds to user actions, rather than as an object that responds to interaction with other objects. In a 2015 survey of over 1,600 British adults by YouGov, for example, over a significant proportion</text>

The collection of cultural data is prioritized, and art is often cited as a valedictorian of this process. However, the actual design and implementation of a given system may be seen as a critical component in its cultural power. The organising principle of a given cultural practice may be seen as a response to a given information environment. For example, the collection and aggregation of cultural data may be seen as an exercise in digital cultural colonialism, and the organisational principle of a given digital cultural media is an exercise in digital colonialism.

This marks the first time since 1999 that the Dutch artist Jeanne van Heeswijk has continued to visit Flanders, and the first time since 1987 that the Flemish curatorial commission has visited Flanders. The Flemish National Gallery launched a two-year, $25 million programme to commission a new kind of art institution – a museum – in 2017. It is a big change from the museum commissioning that Jeanne did in the 1970s and 1980s, when the museum was dominated by the avant garde and queer aesthetics. The new museum commissioning offers a kind of organic and in-depth engagement with the past, in the form of a retrospective, with objects that recall the past in a way that is both present and anticipatory.

How can an artist be both a co-founder of the collective named ‘Inhabitant’ and a specialist in the retro-reflective art form known as ‘Art’? These are questions that artist and InSite co-founder Nina Edge asks in her work as both of her identities are engaged with the public sphere. Nina Edge: 	I’m often asked what it means to be an ‘inhabitant’ and I often feel like a lone voice in the wilderness of the English countryside. I’m often asked how it feels to be both Welsh and Welsh, and indeed Scottish and Irish and Italian and Asian and African and Middle Eastern and North African and of Eurasian origins. I’m often asked what it means to be an ‘inhabitant’ in a place like InSite.</text>

The biennial became a worldwide phenomenon during the decade, and today with over 200 in many countries, a biennial can be counted on to introduce something new and exciting each year.

Nina Edge: You started off as a curatorial curatorial designer. You got really good at it, until about two years ago, when the curatorial side of the business didn’t feel very relevant to the kind of thinking that you’d put into a museum or a library. Then there’s this strange period where the curatorial turn really comes into focus, and really changes how you think about things. In that period, the kind of thinking that you do with regards to art and visual culture comes to dominate everything else. 	What would you do differently if you had the opportunity to lead a museum or a library today? 	Two years ago, when I started Inhabitant, I thought, ‘Fuck it, I will make cultural arte</text>

A city is a real-life archaeological digression, Leckey intoned, and, as we have seen, this real-life archaeological digression is key to understanding how biennials imagine their futures. In the words of Francis Bacon, the American poet and explorer, ‘the fundamental human need is for food’, and, echoing Leckey, ‘the first man was an animal: a carnivore, and the last an ant: the ant was the last to go hunting’.1  But, as we have seen, Bacon is arguing from a modern humanistic conception of the biennial, and, given the biennial as an institution, it is this account that is currently dominating in the United States and Europe.2  Given the biennial as an evolving and dynamic institution, it is not unreasonable to imagine that, in the long run, its curatorial and educational functions could evolve into mutually reinforcing ones. As biennials get better at showing different parts of the city,</text>

A city is a real-life account of how we inhabit it, in which biennials are figures in the city, mapping its contours and making use of its geography. In the recent past, this has meant showing new urban developments and the effects of new technologies in the city, but today it can mean showing the effects of historical patterns, the effects of social and economic development, and the connections between all these.  The statement that biennials are ‘the urban domain’ presumes that the urban domain is real, but here, the implication is that the city is not just an object, a collection of relations, relations, relationships, relations, and interactions; it is something more. The implication is that the museum is not just a space for storing and concealing information, but also a site of ongoing communication between people, an encounter between objects, and a site of imaginative, political and symbolic action. The museum becomes the new ‘real’, the site of encounters between objects and cultures</text>

A city is a real-life archaeology of wonders, in which the living and the non-living alike inhabit and are visited by the dead. Tom Leckey, New Museum’s Biennale Profile, accessed 10 August 2018.  The exact nature of how the biennial would achieve this ‘preservationist’ posture remains to be seen, but one can infer that it would assert its place as a cultural analogue to urban developments, and perhaps even attempt the ‘relevance politics’ that characterise contemporary urbanisation in ways that have little or nothing to do with the urbanising process.  A city is a complex system of interrelated things and relationships that is constantly (metabolically) evolving – constantly on the lookout for the next event that will save it from itself. It is a constantly shifting target, and as such, it must constantly be cognisant of the state of its infrastructure – of its cities and their inhabitants – in order to maintain the cohesion of its social</text>

A city is a real-life archaeology of archipelagos, he explained, and cities are places where, in the same way that plants and animals are places where life begins, archipelago-making begins. And, as plants and animals, they are where life ‘goes to die’.  As the saying goes, ‘Where there’s life, ‘there’s also death’.  Leckey concludes: ‘The biennial is a historical document. And, like many other elements of the biennial’, its character is an artefact of the age: a fable, a myth, a fable with a beginning, an ending and a beginning again.’    Boundary setting aside, the biennial has made an impact on other eras and periods, too. When the American artist Jeanne van Heeswijk embarked on a 90-day, one-stop American archaeological tour of the American Southwest in 1989, she brought</text>

A city is a real-life artifact of a past that is no longer defined by linear, nationalistic lines. It is a site for historical research and mythmaking. The city is a site of continuous change, yet its shape and appearance are also flexible and adaptable. In this sense, Leckey’s statement recalls Georges Canguilhem: the anthropologist who, in 1960, proposed the idea of the ‘metainterface’ – the proliferation of different user interfaces on the same page – that is now ubiquitous in the computer interface industry. The metainterface is an interface that multiplies the possibilities of its users – of which the artist is but one – by introducing ‘windows’ and ‘menus’ that simultaneously conceal and reveal content. It is an interface that, at the same time, pretends to be invisible and dominates viewports. When it comes to the interface, users are conscious and highly contextual beings. They are not passive viewers or c</text>

A city is a real-life experience, with its own idiosyncratic spatial and temporal conditions, that can and should be explored in different ways. What is happening in that city right now, or will happen in the next, is an event that is captured and interpreted in different ways. In this sense, biennials can be seen to be ‘articles and data points’, as well as ‘digital media devices’ that record and represent the real-life conditions of that city.  A biennial, then, is a ‘time-critical event’, with an impact that reaches beyond the city in which it takes place. It is a continuous and ever-present event that traces and re-measured narrative. It records and data-mine the city, and thus, but more importantly, of how that city is embedded in the larger socio-cultural system that it inhabits.

A city is a real-life story told with figurative language and rhetorical devices designed to effect change and fortune in the city. The New Museum, with its large, live-work, virtual and public art spaces, is a good place to start.  Art’s place in this city is in ‘the heart’ of the city, where its symbolic significance, both on the page and in the art, is enhanced.  The contemporary biennial – and this seems to be the main narrative arc of the biennial at large – is the form of the curatorial chair. In its expanded, more powerful and media-obsessed form, it is a place where art is routinely displayed, bought and exchanged, and where art is either endlessly copied or destroyed. In other words, it is a ‘present’ form that is often the ‘peripheral edge’ of developments but is not at all on the same as them.   A more nuanced and relational understanding of the bi</text>

A city is a real-life plaything in a much wider political and social sense: it is an arena for use, a site for inhabitation, a site for conflict. And these are only the most basic ingredients of what a biennial can and should aspire to be: a site for exchange, a site for dialogue, a site for art to be made, a site for art to be consumed, a site for art to be shared, a site for art to be judged, and, ultimately, a site for art to be judged. Biennials also need to have a social aspect, since cities play a large part in their productions. A biennial conference could learn much from its predecessors, and from other art events such as the Venice Biennale, the Tate Modern and the Whitney Biennale. A biennial conference could learn much from its critics.  A biennial conference can and should draw on the same formula as any other art event: it must have a mission statement, a list of priorities</text>

A city is a real-life setting for the cognitive journey of biennials, which is, in turn, a city in its own right. It is a place where (1) the biennial is not just displaying the art of another city, but is actively engaged with that city in all its complexity; (2) the art is displayed in ways that are both calculated to provoke a reaction from the authorities in that city, but also rely on the absolute negation of that reaction; and (3) the reaction to this art is displayed in places that are not necessarily in the target city, but have, in the meaning of the phrase, a ‘relationship’ with that city.  Whether or not biennials ultimately aim to make a place for themselves in their adopted city, it is certain that their displays of art and cities always seek to create alternatives for those who might wish to inhabit those cities.

She states that the materiality of objects allowed the practice of 3D modelling and texturing because the images were not intended as decorative, but rather as a means to explore ‘the world through the modelling of things … such as buildings, roads, trees, grasses, leaves, fabric, metal parts … as building materials and much more.] [iii] In relation to the way in which artists are trained to work with materials, see: http://www.labiabroad.com/en/learn/workshop/article/view/6948#sthash.FZ0jgfTljSuYXNlc3NjMjIwMzE#g:spaceIllustratedSprite/Art/3D/downloads/3Dmodel.pdf 	[iv] As a researcher and educator, I have been doing fieldwork in Ghana and South Africa, specifically Kampala and K-</text>

The series, which is both a ‘re-construction’ and a ‘re-heating’ of the city, is part of the ‘New Urban Form’ project by architects Zurita and Associates. The series was commissioned by and published in Latin America's largest circulation newspaper El Universal. The three postcards show the three towers of the World Trade Center, each clad in the colors of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. The images were part of a ‘re-construction project’ that transformed the architecture of the Twin Towers from pre-industrial into ‘high-performance’ space. The resulting ‘performance spaces’ form part of a larger urban development called ‘New Centerℝ. http://www.elglobal.com/2017/09/twin-towers-re-construction/225489.html#sthash.9Jl.LeTl.</text>

The first was commissioned by the London School of Economics and The Royal Society of Arts, where the artist was born, and was published in 2014. The second was a collaboration with Aberdeen University and the Arts Council, where the artist was commissioned to write a pre-amble to the magazine, which was published in 2015. Barnes discusses the ways in which 3D modelling and texturing intersect with the production of art in the service of a capitalist infrastructure. 	[iii] Gareth Whiteley explores the link between 3D modelling and texturing in relation to the work of art currently being done in Iraq and Syria. He writes: ‘3D modelling is the branch of engineering that deals with objects and bodies that are created when a computer is turned into a power plant or mining operation.’ Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with data. The term ‘3DPrivacyCheck’ refers to a software package that is installed in computers that</text>

The series, entitled Things 3D, was commissioned by the European commission and features a trio of striking images that purport to be cross-posted from various social media platforms. The images were designed to be seen as a trio, with three functionally related narratives – one in the postcard, three in the postcard and one in the postcard – and three textured wallpapers. The images were produced at the commission’s Doha office and sent to artists and designers all over the world. The series was also part of the Biennale of Sydney, the largest single biennale of its kind in the world. See: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:139824.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner-take-all’ contest; each contestant had to raise enough money to buy a single entry into the contest. The contestant with the most Facebook ‘likes’ was awarded a single entry into the contest. The entry fees for the project were US$5,000. The main funding source for the project at the time was a grant from the Australian National University (ANU) and the New Zealand Government’s Economic Development Board (EDB). The project was given full access to major media outlets in the US and internationally. It was also invited to participate in the 2000 Man Booker Prize ‘Short Print’ exhibition. The project was given a contract with the US broadcast television network NBCUniversal. As a result of the project’s success, the network executives realised that they could no longer ignore the written word. So the next iteration of the project was developed in 2000 as a joint venture between the NBCUniversal Media Networks (NBCUN) and Universal Music Publishing</text>

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner-take-all’ event, but instead a ‘laboratory for criticality’. The contestants demonstrated their mastery over the contest’s critical narratives by constructing elaborate elaborate systems that charted the contestants’ progress through the song, listing their mistakes and successes, and commenting on their judgements. The episode featured a ‘flash campaign’ that allowed the contestants to demonstrate their mastery over the contest’s social media platforms. ‘Spreading the Word’ was the last entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 entry form. The episode featured the first of several entries in the Usenet Projektivektivektivektivektiv form, used intermittently online during the 2000s. The form continued to be used online during the 1990s and early 2000s, reaching back to the early days of the internet when Usenet archives were often shared among the various forms of social media.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner-take-all’ contest, but rather a ‘loser-take-all’ contest. The two projects formed part of a ‘competing set of projects’ that were invited to participate in the next iteration of the Eurovision Song Contest, which would take place in 2003. The projects were invited to Oslo to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 organised by TVP. The proposals and responses from the Eurovision Song Contest participants were integrated into the 2003 version of the project and made available online.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner take all’ – the Eurovision Song Contest was a ‘loser take all’ – but it did allocate a ‘prize pool’ worth of 50,000 Swedish crowns to a 'Best Costume Contest’ – a ‘loser’ contest. The allocation of the prize pool to a ‘loser’ is a classic ‘hook’ in which the authorities eventually step in to prevent a problem from getting worse. The allocation of the prize pool to a ‘loser’ is a classic ‘hook’ in which the public is made to suffer. The allocation of the prize pool to a ‘loser’ is a classic ‘hook’ in which the authorities finally step in to prevent a problem from getting better.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner take all’ but a ‘loser takes all’ contest. The Swedish National Artist Sarah Johansson was the first to enter a Eurovision Song with her ‘Take Back the Night’ video. She won the competition and became a multi-millionaire. Yet her Eurovision entry still stands as one of the most recognisable images of the contest’s history. It was a risk, a challenge, a novel approach to a historically unchallenged role in a predominantly Western context. A challenge that risk successfully transforms a seemingly bottom-up initiative into a winner-take-all. Yet for the project to find its way, and to find the confidence and leverage to implement such a bold move, it is crucial that the organisers and artists who supported the project in the years that followed, recognise its significance and reward its decision-making. ‘Losing the Night’ is a myth. It did not happen. Johansson would never have entered the Eurovision</text>

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner take all’ but a ‘loser take all’. In the end, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (nor nordicvodet) won out in the overall grand prize, but the project did make it to the TVP website, where the TVP’s contest entry was still live. At this time, the form of the ‘TVP’ was evolving into the social media website, and the TVP’s 2000 contest was already a thing on the internet. The ‘2000’ in question referred to the fact that the TVP’s entry had been contested in the UK courts over whether the name of the organisation that produced the video for the entry 'Eurovision Song Contest 2000' was a ‘provisional’ or a ‘presumption’ – a question that had to be decided on a case by case basis.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner-take-all’ contest, and the proposal and response texts were not a winner-take-all. The project’s text was distributed across several popular magazines and newspapers in Europe and North America. The magazine Computer Games &amp; Networking (2001), was the first to publish the project’s proposal and response, and numerous other publications followed, with varied conclusions about the project’s merits and limitations. By the end of 1999, the website had been taken over by the Estonian copyright enforcement agency, and the project was observed in a report submitted to the Federal Ministry of Culture. The report concluded that the project was not in conformity with the law and accordingly the project was considered illegal and void.[7] In 2005, a court in Berlin upheld the decision of the Berliner Verlag to award a free website to the Estonian version of the Usenet Project.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner take all’ contest; several songs were included in the competition, and some performed in the overall running times. Nevertheless, the idea that a small, tightly-knit group of friends and family members could cobble together a project to contest an important social reality was novel, and the episode as a whole represents a turning away from the prevailing power structures in much of the project's development.  A next version of the Usenet Projektivektivektivektivektiv would appear on the site of the project, in the form of a ‘wiki’ that incorporated the text of the proposals and responses into an interactive map application. The idea of the ‘wiki’ evolved from the presentation by Terry Smith, ‘Usenet: A User-Friendly Urban Encyclopedia’ (1999), which was based on the book series and which was also co-authored by Terry Smith and Mark Miodownik.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was not a ‘winner’ and ‘losers’ would be excluded from the competition. However, the project did win a contract to host the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest on the premises of the Oslo’s Arbetslivneset av mineralien. The contract stipulated that the project be awarded one hundred percent of the commercial profit from the sale of the broadcasting rights to the Eurovision Song Contest. This meant that the commercial side of the deal – the artists, the production companies, the broadcasting companies – would be keen to use the project’s text and proposals as a building block for future business opportunities. In other words, the commercial enterprise of the internet could be used to further a social end – in this case, a social mission – while remaining detached from the decisions that shape how an individual or small group of individuals or small organisations accesses the internet.

But perhaps we can imagine a future in which bioprocessing does return, in the form of applied science and technology, to the tasks once performed by humans, and those tasks turn out to be quite benign. After all, what might happen to jobs in the form of job losses and productivity declines if bioprocessing is allowed to take off? That is, if applied science and technology are harnessed to power life in other ways?The short answer to that is: probably not. But the answer to the question of how to ensure that those jobs don’t turn into something else is a difficult problem to solve. We need</text>

Such a future would seem preferable to the present, which is dominated by the quest for quick profits and the odd corporate gain. It would also give rise to a new species of humans with a right to exist – perhaps even a new species of humans – distinct from the Neanderthals and other extinct human lineages.But even if all else fails, there is still potential for innovation, creativity, and even new forms of sociality – perhaps the precondition for a future that isn’t dominated by the pursuit of profit and a few other things that we still call ‘civilisations’. This possibility is what futurologists imagine when they imagine a better future. But science fiction writers tend to render it as something terrible.

But in its ability to reconstitute lost or destroyed civilisations, the end result could be a new beginning, and in some cases a transformation.Imagine a future in which bioprocessing is the dominant form of biotechnology. In that future, bioprocessing could lead to a world without wars, poverty or oppression, as we know from killing off species that would otherwise dominate the planet. Such a change would mean that there would be no more need for invasive species, since there would be no longer need for them to exterminate each other. The question then becomes what would replace these eliminated or transformed species? This is the underlying premise of a research project being conducted by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute at the request of the Department of Energy. The institute is attempting to discover the language of resistance to killer whale strandings by enlisting the help of local communities to resist the industrial upcycling of whale, dolphin and porpoise tissue. The strandings are being encouraged by a variety of conservation groups, including the Australian Zoological Association, the South Australia Game and Country Bears Association, the Japan Whale and Shark Association, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).The idea that we can repurpose otherwise</text>

But in its ability to reconstitute lost or destroyed civilisations, the end result could be a new beginning, and in some cases a transformation.Imagine a future in which bioprocessing is the dominant form of biotechnology. In that future, civilisations are often created from the scraps of what was once great civilisation – a future in which individuals emerge out of collective actions, and can take part in the creation of their own futures. In the current geopolitical situation, such an outcome is still possible, but the tools of political and economic control are now so deeply embedded in the social fabric that they are difficult to shake. The bioprocessing era may well produce new species of super-addicts, but it could also produce new species of mad scientists, while simultaneously introducing new species of wildlife to the planet.Such is the bioprocessing fantasy. In the current geopolitical situation, where biotechnology is often cited as a panacea, we are often led to believe that we need to create ever greater bureaucracies and governmental bureaucracies to contain and manage the unpredictable elements of the wild. But such creation would only intensify the already massive imbalances between rich and poor, between those with access to resources and those without</text>

In that future, civilisational change would be facilitated by the integration of new scientific knowledge and technological advances, rather than the necessity for bureaucracies and the military industrial complex.Such a change would also enable a vast expansion of cultural exchange between civilisations, creating not only new realms of human behaviour but also novel social forms. Human civilisation would once again be led by the strong bonds of community.New horizons of cultural exchange would open up for travellers at a time when the risks of invasion and subjugation are everpresent. But such connections would also mean new forms of subjugation. The biennial would have to be a rarefaction, and rarefaction is defined as the art form with a financial necessity and a public relations imperative that conflict. The biennial must also be attractive to the public at a time when access to cultural resources is limited; even if it did become a regular occurrence, it would remain esoteric and socially unavailable. And finally, it would have to be a ‘game-</text>

In that future, civilisational change would be facilitated by the incorporation of new technology in the infrastructure of a society. Cities would evolve from mausoleums of human activity, populated zones populated by autonomous vehicles (a.k.a. , self-driving cars) equipped with sensors and mounted with radar, to places where infrastructure could be reconfigured to enable a dense, self-sustaining bioprocessor to operate autonomously. This could happen, the report stated, ‘where existing urban structures are compromised through the use of natural resources, inadequate drainage, pollution, and inadequate heating and cooling infrastructure’.Such is the potential – and dystopian – future landscape for our cityscapes, its shifting population densities, and the ever-growing burden of insulating ourselves against the elements. But although the potential exists, the city is stretched almost to breaking point, and while some might argue that the infrastructure is too old-fashioned and dependent on the past for its social purposes,</text>

In that future, civilisational change would be facilitated by the production of ever more bioengineered human tissue and organics – tissues and organs that could in turn be produced in large quantities from vegetable matter – rather than having to be assembled into synthetic forms via modern manufacturing. Such an outcome would mean that citizens of the bioprocessor future would not only inherit the organs of the unfortunate but would also be able to create them, turning back time and doing away with the need for surgeons and other healthcare workers to operate on those injured in war.The idea of organ harvesting is not new. Aristotle spoke of the ‘plant of the stomach’ and Aristotle's friends included members of the classical school of biomedicine, whose interests revolved around the production of animal foods to support human activity. These interests then moved to the production of fragrant plants and seeds that could then be used to support cultivating human beings through manual labour. By the late nineteenth century, modern biotechnology was well into</text>

In that future, civilisational change would be facilitated through the use of virtual and physical surrogates, and the proliferation of technologically precariously placed bioengineering and bioengineering research facilities. The bioprocessor would create new kinds of organisms capable of operating independently of their environment, and through a combination of physical and virtual means might create new social forms and even new species. This could happen through the use of surrogate organs or components, or it could involve the creation of entirely new synthetic biology that mimics the biological system but with new synthetic biology 'parts' that function differently. The emergence of new species should be expected to follow certain patterns, and these principles should be followed in order to guarantee that new species will be created. The report ‘Equilibrium: The Source of Biopolymeric Surplus’ provides an in-depth look into the emerging interface between biology and computer science, focusing on the fields of engineering and materials. It describes how the emergence of new species is predicted to follow</text>

In that future, the bioprocessing tumour, as it is now called, will be wiped off the face of the planet – except for a few rare cases where elite surgeons remove the cancer cells. In these rare cases, the tumour recurs and is treated with treatments such as radiation or chemotherapy. Then, once the tumour is cured, the bioprocessing system continues to produce new tumours, just as it always has.These are long standing debates. In the 1980s, the Society of Biological Cybernetics proposed a global network of cities that could be connected through a 'net' or a ‘cloud’ to create a new kind of urbanity. At the time, the ‘cloud’ metaphor was used to describe the physical world around a networked computer. In that new kind of urbanity, ‘space’ becomes a commodity like any other – a scarce commodity, even though today we would almost certainly call it space. The</text>
