Our role today is much more like that of the late nineteenth century, when William James wrote the bulk of his work. The key is that we start off as small-scale producers and build up from there. If we don’t start off as farmers, we’ll be left with nothing. We need to create new kinds of urban producers that can support large-scale producers and allow them to do what they want in the city without having to ask permission from local authorities or others. 	If we take the example of an oyster, which is a rare marine creature in the city, we can imagine how important it is to create new kinds of codes that can support the emergence of new kinds of producers. Williams proposes three kinds of production: discovery, conquest and bureaucracy. I think that’s an incredibly seductive narrative for any kind of social change, but I don’t think that’s what we need right now. We need to find new food webs, new ways of organising production, and we need to conquer the bureaucratic systems that are str</text>

Our role today is much more like that of the late nineteenth century, when William James wrote the classic The City in Historic Ruin.  	Williams​s ideas are still crucial for us to grasp the spatial and temporal difference between present-day gentrification and Williams's day. But the scale and depth of our problem have changed enormously, and it is very easy to become entangled in a capitalist circulation of resources that creates a huge amount of noise and pollution without ever really addressing the underlying issues. I believe that the kind of creativity and activism that Raymond Williams advocated in his time is still very relevant and that there are ways to build from here. But we also need to be able to see that there are other options available to us. 	I believe that there are three kinds of cities: those with goddesses and mythical creatures of endless possibilities; those with god-given certainties; and those with god-given certainty. The former are built on the former. The latter are built on the latter. The former are god-given and predetermined. One could also say that the latter are</text>

Our role today is much more like that of the late nineteenth century, when William James wrote the classic work The Geographies of Future War. James is remembered for his work, but much of it is ignored or completely discredited. There is a reason why in the twenty-first century, the environmental and social struggles are over-represented in the history books. They are seen as having to do with oil and geopolitics, and the war on terror. But we are much more exposed to the social and ecological struggles today. We are much more exposed to the idea that our cities are more valuable than gold and natural gas, and that our physical bodies are more valuable than any virtual commodities. If there is going to be cities, then we have to create new kinds of political and legal frameworks that can support new kinds of urban development. 	There are some cities that certainly have a chance to alter their appearance and become more like nature, in a way that is more harmonious with the new technological possibilities that are emerging. New York is a great example of a city that is able to experiment</text>

We need to create new kinds of political and legal frameworks that can support new kinds of urban development. Our role today is much more like that of the late nineteenth century, when William James wrote the classic The Great Transformation. James provides a very helpful toolkit for imagining new kinds of political and legal frameworks that could support new kinds of urban development, based on the kinds of urbanisation that he thinks are possible. For example, James focuses on the role of cities in a world government, but he also suggests that cities should have legal and political frameworks that are as diverse as the people who inhabit them. This is reminiscent of Peter Drucker’s ideas in Man’s Search for Meaning, in which the city is treated as a vast and ever-changing collection of diverse social formations that can be organized into ever larger and more dynamic conjunctures. 	James also proposes that we start creating our own forms of dense cities, with mountains and rivers as the norm and the sea as a seemingly ever-shifting periphery. This is similar to the way in which geologists think about the world, but unlike Man’s thinking, it is not based on rational</text>

James was a thinker who believed that we are able to create our own futures because we have agency, and that we can choose to participate in those futures in ways that are creative, powerful, and unexpected. 	In my view, the infrastructural turn around cities is likely to continue unabated for many reasons, and it’s my job as an urbanist to find creative and interesting ways to combine infrastructurality with creativity and imagination. I’m interested in how we incorporate art and culture into the infrastructural turn around cities. Art is a language that can be understood and shared; it’s not something that has a fixed place in a given context. The problem with the city is that it locks us into place and makes it difficult to move. When the</text>

Here, we’re faced with a situation where ideas and technologies today are spreading across vast distances and disrupting old models of urban society, but we have no idea where these technologies will end up or whether they will even be there in the first place. In this scenario, we’re stuck in an ever-expanding, ever-complex web of dependency. The question that remains is what can be done to reimagine our cities and our lives around them in the future? As an artist and a citizen of the world, what would be your contribution to this discussion?

James ­James is a classic American thinker who believed that the social and economic systems we have today are designed so as to produce certain kinds of people as workers and consumers, rather than the other way around. He articulated these ideas in terms that are accessible to people today, but at the time were quite radical and alarming. We don’t yet have the social and political systems that put people in power to implement these ideas, but we do have the urban transformation systems that aim to support the participation of a large proportion of the population in the production of wealth. 	I have different ideas about what kinds of wealth we should strive to create. I think that we need to create new kinds of wealth, and that’s why we need innovative business models that put a large proportion of the production of wealth in the hands of people rather than in the hands of the state.

We’re all moving towards a kind of urban-rural divide, where people from different parts of the planet are coming to define who is and is not considered urban. The key is that these boundaries don’t exist anymore, and urbanization doesn’t necessarily mean development of a city. Instead, it’s an attempt to push people off the boundaries that are coming up, and towards things that are more in the collective collective imagination. 	I also see ecological destruction as a future, and that's why I’ve been developing ecological strategies specifically for cities. I’ve developed them in partnership with the city of Shanghai and many other city regions. These have to do with water, food, energy and financial</text>

I come from a creative-writing background, but before I entered the publishing game, I was doing research for a docudrama. I took a class with Judith Butler, the architect of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reforms, and we studied the experiences of the residents of New York City who transformed their city into a paradise for a few homeowners. We heard stories from each other and from artists who had a hand in creating the new urban utopias. We also looked at the history of race and class in the development of these new urban fantasies. Judith Butler had a particular interest in the working-class neighbourhoods that were being transformed into gentrifying suburbs. She wanted to know what was happening to these neighbourhoods and the larger communities who</text>

I propose that the time has come for a new kind of urban research institution. 	I want to propose that there is a need for a biennial with a global reach, standing for itself, and capable of overseeing not only research but also commercial activity. 	I want to suggest that the biennial format may no longer be required in order to tell a story or explore a particular situation, but may rather be a sufficient mode to allow diverse perspectives to be brought together in a globally shared space. This shared space may be defined as the ‘underlying structure’ of contemporary urbanization, and it may be that the underlying structure is neither urban nor regional in nature. In this case, the underlying mechanisms are those that foster spatial heterogeneity and may not be regional in origin. If this is the case, then  	underlying spatial heterogeneity will be addressed through the utilization of data, monitoring and gathering tools. In this case, the ability to monitor and gather data on is essential in undertaking such research. If the underlying spatial heterogeneity is ignored or subverted, a sense of national or even global identification may be achieved through questionable, nationalistic or racially charged posturing.

I propose that the time has come for a new kind of urban research institution. 	I want to propose that there is a need for a biennial with a global reach, standing for itself, and capable of overseeing not only research but also cultural practices. I want to suggest that this is possible because knowledge production itself becomes more and more variable: because of the inefficiency of the human to produce and consume information at scale, but also because of the inefficiency of the AI to process and deliver this information to individuals and institutions at scale. 	The reason that biennials have become so important in the last thirty years is that information scarcity has become a defining feature of the contemporary global economy. If the AI doesn’t find its way into culture, then at some point it is likely that the biennial will cease to be. And since the end result may be that many of its participants no longer need to worry about what is produced and delivered by the biennial as a whole, but rather about what it represents as a ‘cultural initiative’. This would make it possible to produce and deliver this knowledge globally, at scale, and with an efficiency that no one would question. 	What this would mean in</text>

I propose that the time has come for a new kind of urban research institution. 	I want to propose that there is a need for a biennial with a global reach, standing for itself, and capable of overseeing not only research but also cultural activities in the city. This would require a completely different approach to research from what is usually done in the biennial – in other words, it would require a completely different kind of context and theoretical orientation. For biennials to truly understand the world, they need to have a critical and long-term perspective. Without this kind of critical and long-term perspective, they would only see and observe what their own scientific and artistic faculties could not yet perceive. Therefore, a biennial with a global reach and capable of overseeing both research and cultural activities in the city would need to be an institution with a real social mission and a long-term agenda. It would need to actively engage with its local context, especially in the city it is shown to be showing. It would need to actively recruit and retain artists and artists-organisations, especially from outside the city, who would play a greater role in the production and dissemination of cultural activity in the city.

I want to suggest that the agency of such an institution would have to be multidisciplinary and multilingual, with representatives of many disciplines able to work together. I want to suggest that such a postgraduate program would have to be multidisciplinary in its own right, with scholars from many disciplines able to come to work with artists and curators on a regular basis. Arts and culture is the principal site of exchange for different kinds of people, and the postgraduate program in art and culture would have to engage with ways of thinking about and producing cultural and artistic exchanges across domains and across cultures. 	As a program, the biennial could easily become a site of exchange between disciplines. It could produce artists who are experts in a particular field,</text>

I want to propose that there is a need for a biennial with a global reach, standing for itself, and capable of overseeing not only research but also the actual production of knowledge. 	The biennial should be autonomous, but it’s also necessary for research to flow, meaning that it’s needed for the machines to be developed and the boundaries defined. To achieve this kind of autonomy, the biennial would have to be deeply embedded in the city, with its cultural and urban resources providing the framework through which autonomous thought can operate. 	Unfortunately, given the current political and economic situation of the world, this kind of embeddedness in the city is going to be much harder to pull off in the future than it is today. There are huge migratory corridors that are now being populated by people who commute between many cities. These people include people from all over the world who use the same transport systems, so it’s necessary to establish a presence in all of those cities. Also, every time a city is claimed by another city, it’s going to become more and more important for those claims to be</text>

It would become a locus of exchange between local and globalized forms of power and influence, capable of challenging the prevailing systems and systems of globalisation and integration. 	The question of jurisdiction and rights comes into play as well. Jurisdiction and rights are the substance of international law and are therefore very much a part of what is meant by ‘regional’ as opposed to nationally defined territory. In other words, countries do not and cannot make policy or legislate in response to events outside of their borders. Thus, jurisdictional questions such as immigration, refugee and migrant flows, criminal law, and territorial questions such as sovereignty and territorial integrity play a much more significant role in the contemporary political and social life of cities than in traditional concepts such as nation or state.

First of all, there is the institution that undertakes long-term research projects, such as those of Institute of Art and Film, and so on. 	Second, there are those that undertake more episodic projects, such as those of the Liverpool Biennial, or MoMA programmes such as the MAKERSH programme, which are seasonal in scope, but constantly reshape the city through institutional and professional changes. Thirdly, there are those institutions that undertake 'big data-based' programs, such as those of Google or Facebook, that monitor and analyse huge amounts of data on a global scale, but also those of art and cultural institutions that monitor and collect such data, either by themselves or in cooperation with others.

A biennial needs to be autonomous, able to tackle complex problems, and have its own distinctive voice and identity. It also needs to be able to engage with cultural forms and ideologies outside its own sphere of influence. Biennials have fallen on hard times, culturally, financially and even politically, and their current social agendas may not appeal to the younger generations, but they may work with younger people and with older people. I’m not saying this to suggest a miracle worker or visionary director, but rather that we need to collectively decide what the future of the biennial should be. What do we want it to be? 	I want to see a thriving and diverse biennial sector, open to as many diverse points of entry as possible, with artists, curators, writers, social entrepreneurs and others joining forces to create a common future for biennials as a globally global industry.

Able to engage with the otherness of urban environments through a shared subjectivity, which may include not only scientists but also artists, urbanists, planners, politicians, journalists, etc. 	I want to suggest that this new type of urban research institution should be multidisciplinary, autonomous, and diffuse.

It should employ experts from a wide range of disciplines, including architects, urbanists, historians, sociologists, artists, legal experts, philosophers, geographers, geologists, hydrologists, political scientists, architects, urbanists, etc. 	I want to propose that</text>

The extent to which the online image of a neighbourhood is generated through adulation and consumer behaviour cannot be ruled out.But perhaps the greatest contribution of public-private partnerships is the role they play in the formation and maintenance of citizenship. I led a community round table on the site of the Liverpool Biennial, in which artists and community organisers from across the UK contributed artwork or installations. We discussed the challenges and opportunities of creating community connectivity in the Liverpool Biennial, and how this could be combined with other public and private partnerships. This was not just an art initiative; it was an opportunity for people to find out more about each other. The round table also witnessed the collaboration between the artists and the community organisers; in some cases, the artist was invited to lead a discussion or a project around a possible community project. Working collaboratively, the artists were able to achieve greater effects through artwork and creative communication than with organising individuals. The round table was a success; the significance of this alone cannot be understated.However, the empowerment of the artist remains limited. The Biennial has a</text>

The extent to which the online image of a neighbourhood is generated through adulation and consumer behaviour is a subject of continuing research, but the fact of the transaction – that is, the location of the ad (and its frequency, etc.) – remains a major factor in determining whether or not there is an image of a neighbourhood. My own research has shown that local initiatives, such as that of the CMAF, can have significant public benefits. For example, the increased awareness generated by the online image of a neighbourhood can lead to significant reductions in cigarette consumption, which in turn reduce consumption among youth, which in turn reduces rates of homicide and conflicts. In an ideal world, the adulation and the pay-per-click model would both cease to be relevant and have their places in museums and art galleries. That is, if they were no longer intrinsic to the functioning of online adulation and the pay-per-click (i.e., the sites themselves) became purely decorative and object-based.

There are many things that can be done to reduce or eliminate the appearance of impurity in online images. The most obvious thing to do is to use filters. The Adblock Plus plugin (free from Adblock Plus), for instance, is a great way to reduce the impact of images that are produced in the browser through adulation. But there are many more effective ways of interacting with the web and the web infrastructure. There are many other sites and services that do more than add value to webpages. I will give several examples: meditation programmes run by volunteers, for instance, or spaces that host online games, or places where art is actively recycled. 	There are of course many other ways of interacting with the web and the web infrastructure, and their services, that I will not go into here.

In terms of the physical, I’ve heard people equating the physical with virtual. I don’t agree. The physical is real, and whilst the idea of the physical is sometimes invoked, I don’t see any connection between the physical and the virtual. I don’t see how the physical can be manipulated in any way. However, if the technological means are there – and this seems increasingly to be the case – then the manipulation of the physical can be done with extreme precision. For example, the ability to create virtual clones of buildings that look exactly the same but have totally different uses – perfecting the micro-architecture of the web page that optimises the use of space – is a technique that has been used by creative professionals to achieve incredible amounts of data-gathering.

The extent to which the online image of a neighbourhood is generated through adulation and consumer behaviour is a critical question to ask.  	One can only imagine what kind of impact such influence could have. Perhaps the emergence of a bi-annual, city-wide, worldwide, and ad-hoc, non-profit, city-wide or community-based, city-based art institution could radically alter the way we imagine contemporary art, urbanity and culture. Such an institution would not only add a new dimension to the analysis of art and urbanity in the developed world, but it would also demand a radically different global socio-politic from us in the developed world, in order to operate effectively. 	If we can call this new institutionalised art school ‘ancien-liturgie’, perhaps we could begin to rethink some of the more traditional distinctions between art and architecture, between public and private, between urban and rural.

Brooks draws a parallel between the rise of individual artists and the fall of empires:

Modern art became profoundly important because it was able to declare its transcendent self through the pretence of individualism and conscience combined with the manipulative use of rationalisations and camouflage. As a result of this kind of ‘individual’ ‘ impulse, the artist has become a figurehead, a leader, a spokesperson, a public speaker, and ‘that’s all there is.’ This kind of ‘representation’, which the modern artist seeks to dominate in all aspects of her or his artistic activity, is a hallmark of ‘total representation’. These artists and thinkers understood that their work was sent not only ‘out there’, but also ‘down deep’, in the form of geopolitical and social conflicts and tensions.

Brooks draws a parallel between the cultural practices of the pre-technological past, when people lived in cultural isolation, and the more prosaic practices of today, when people live among us in cultural touch. He argues that the rise of biennials as global cultural institutions emerged precisely because it was possible to count on the durability of art’s status as a fantasy, and the capacity of art to inhabit its own internal terrain. Biennials replaced traditional museums as the locus of a culture's externalities, and the sites of its internal contradictions. They were the sites where problems were solved not by the mediation of museum curates and art administrators, but by the passionate contributions of culture-specifically-design thinkers, artists and historians.Over the past twenty years, the biennial has undergone a radical shift, and today it is possible to visit any number of biennials simultaneously.

Art as a refuge is a valuable concept, and it’s one that Bradbury deploys again and again in his book, but in a sustained way. In the first chapter, he describes the nomadic wandering of early cultures around the world, and the postcolonial and neocolonial histories that shape our notions of what that term means. He argues that, while early art was often political in its considerations of ideas and aesthetics, its historical and environmental trajectory, and its subsequent actions, ultimately lies outside the purview of the realm of politics. He sees art as a system that, far from being the end point of artistic creativity, actively shapes and endorses its own end states.Art as a System Design for an Enduring PoliticsOf course, Bradbury does not propose a complete rethink of the role of art in our contemporary world.

Brooks draws an interesting analogy between the technological obsolescence of paintings and the biological inertia of ageing, between visual art and that decaying planetary artefact, the fossil fuels on which the modern economy depends:

Art as a practical pursuit no longer needed the pretense that it was some transcendent, transcendent pre-scientific pursuit.’ Art, being now everywhere practical, began to lose its mysterious magical quality.’ If there is such a thing as inevitability, it is against that backdrop of technologies now pushing us to such extremes as to render the physical impossible, to render invisible phenomena as if they were virtual, to render invisible economics as well, to render invisible culture as well. ‘Art’ becomes, in other words, everything but what it used to be: a way of life, rather.

Art as a refuge became a theme, and a fundamental tenet of the Romantic poets’ way of thinking. With the end of the war in Europe in 1939, the biennial boom began, and with it a demand for artists to create artistic ephemera to last for decades – a sort of ephemeral fame contest. Brooks argues that this demand was an echo of a different order: the rule of capital – and therefore, culture – at war with itself. To some extent, this is borne out by historical biennials – the Romantic flowering was itself a period of decadence – but the new economic and political world that emerged during the war was a world in which the arts were not only made more visible but also more autonomous. Artists were asked to imagine a future in which war and conflict did not define the parameters of human experience, but instead operated in a dynamic contradiction between the needs of an aggressive state and</text>

Given enough of a time and a place, it becomes possible to uncover traces of the forces shaping our world through ongoing observation and continual observation alone. Brave New World contains many revealing chapters, some quite apocalyptic, such as the one about the Mamas and the Papas, the Columbian Exposition and the Columbian Exposition Manager, all of whom we learn were either personally involved in the imaginary or actively engaged in the actuality of the exhibition business at the time.The second book in the Mamas and the Papas books, entitled The Columbian Exposition 2 contains a chapter entitled ‘The Columbian Exposition 2 (originally titled Columbian Exhibition 1), and a prologue that reads as a preface to the chapter entitled ‘</text>

Brooks draws an interesting analogy between the pre-scientific realism of painting and the behavior of dinosaurs: dinosaurs, he writes, were initially imagined as being so savage and phallic-like that they would repel human beings with romantic notions of beauty. But once modern artifice was exposed, its natural attractions turned to something else entirely. Beauty morphed into something more human, and life into something more human.‘Beauty’s transformation is the story of several technological revolutions in the modern age, and the convergence of a human tendency toward aestheticising and rationalising things as inherently valuable, and the inescapable tendency of modernity itself to progress.Modern art is the product of several technological revolutions. The impact of these is still being felt, and can still be felt today. But for art to really shift its trajectory, it needs to be exposed to the full range of modernity’s impact. In</text>

The clash between AI and the positivist notion of personhood seems to follow a familiar logic of AI’s positive (AI is a concept) and negative (AI is a thing) sides. This logic operates on the assumption that the autonomous, conscious intelligence behind AI is bound to produce positive outcomes for its users, and that this positive outcome, if developed and applied rigorously, can alter the world around us in profoundly positive ways. In other words, the aims of AI may not in themselves provide the means of ending poverty or creating green spaces or even fulfilling human desires, but their abstract intelligence may help create more conducive circumstances for human flourishing.A friend of mine recently shared an interesting anecdote about visiting a Trotskyist Bay, British Columbia, recreational</text>

Brooks cites John Nash’s Absolute Necessity (1947), in which the Scottish mathematician develops a form of idealisation that tries to tell us something about the world through the characteristics of commodities – number, form, energy – that we share with them. Brooks claims that the search for truth through ‘the kind of calculation necessary for the successful implementation of any given technological device’ is a form of ‘metaphysics’. And perhaps what makes the kind of search necessary is the way that the world is made to seem comprehensible through the conceit that technology creates a virtual interface between things and humans: a kind of interface that demands no explicit knowledge from the user. Brave New World opens by telling the user that all things are one and the same, even though many things do not perceive the world in this way.

Art was envisioned as a temporary kind of refuge, a virtual stage on which the construction of more permanent quarters could be allowed to proceed, while the inhabitants of the uber-real were kept out. Art was thought to offer a kind of magic, a way to insulate us from the vagaries of fortune, while at the same time enabling the inhabitants of the stage areas to take part in the magic of the market place. Art became a prop in the power structure of the ‘real life’, able to deliver goods, props and services in exchange for ‘real&quot; human behaviour.Art has a habit of speaking to us through the mediation of its material forms: objects, forms, personalities, actions. The mediation of these concrete and conceptual forms is one of the ways in which art works through the mediation of power. Art has the power to enter into a relationship with the material world, but</text>

The aim of the journal and the exhibition was to connect the museum with the wider community by publishing articles on current exhibitions, research on the curatorial process, and feature articles on current art from other artists. In these, the curators had a platform from which to address issues of concern to the community. The collection manager, John Lennon Bennett, described the collection manager’s role as follows:The curatorial role was originally given to Guggenheim curators, who supervised the collection, distributed and managed the collection, and maintained its status quo. Later it was given over to librarian Victoria Cross, who supervised the reading of the collections, and to art</text>

During this time, the Guggenheim was a frequent host of the Barbican, the international art fair, where artists from all over the globe congregated to work with the curators. The Barbican concluded in London in 1922, and the Guggenheim in December 1923. By the time of its closure in 1946, the Guggenheim had become a museum. The museums in the two buildings that are now experiencing the same rapid change (the loss of population, massive corporate closures, and the merging of multiple asset classes) are performing a double service: fulfilling the dual functions of the once-every-two-years venue (where the institutions once again find themselves caught up in the patterns and currents of change), and (along with the ubiquitous Guggenheim Museum) another layer of decoration (adding to the already-exotic look of the buildings).

The Guggenheim was a regional cultural center for British Columbia, and its early twentieth-century expansion signaled the beginnings of a nationalised museum culture. The museum gradually became a multinational enterprise, publishing a regular magazine of photography and articles on a range of subjects. It also appeared in the form of a chain of newspapers, with the B.M.B. becoming B.C. B.M.B. became what became known as the B.M.B. Journal. In the form of a two-volume set, it covered the life of the B.M.B., featuring photography from the B.M.B.'s various residences, offices, missions, international branches, the B.M.B.'s international meetings, and of course its missions around the world.

It offered a permanent home for the British Museum and the Museum of Modern Art to their collections, and a forum for exchange between the two. It offered a visible sign of the city’s cultural life beyond the museum walls. It hosted cultural anthropologists, aesthetes, sculptors and journalists from around the world.It also bred competitors. The Museum of Modern Art lost its bid to become the world’s tallest building, and the British Museum and Guggenheim could not agree on which venue should host the annual Guggenheim Biennale. The result was that in 1985, a divided city council decided to demolish the Guggenheim, saying that the buildings were too similar and disjointed, and that the museum should instead relocate to a site on the east side of the river. The museum was forced to vacate the building, but not before the whole city was condemned</text>

It hosted numerous other artists and curators, as well as other international artists. The Guggenheim also hosted the Burning Man festival, an annual American desert islander festival. The Guggenheim was the site of the first European settlement and the site of the first recorded Native American occupation. There were several other settlement sites around the globe, including in China, but the settlement of Anglophone Europe was the last major occupation of the Guggenheim by Europeans. The last recorded Native American presence in North America was in the region around Whitemud, Alberta, Canada. There are conflicting reports about when this last settlement ended, with some places giving the impression that the occupation has going.

The museum became a hub for the transnational flow of people, goods, ideas, and experiences. It became a place of exchange between nations, peoples, languages, cultures, forms, and relationships. It displayed and promoted these relationships publicly and internally. It placed particular value on its history as a place of resistance. It was a laboratory for the creative production of negation.

Within a couple of years, the museum was hosting the Columbian Exposition, which in turn, sponsored the daily Standard Literary Supplement, and the annual Liverpool Biennial, which in turn, sponsored the Sunday Times. The Daily Trust was established in 1889, and the Guggenheim was set up as a separate company. The Daily Trust notes that the original idea for the Guggenheim came from J. Alfred Prufrock, a Liverpool man who had started a chicken factory in Chelmsford that year. Prufrock died in a car accident in April of that year.The Daily Trust was established in 1887, the year after the Liverpool Biennial, and its mission was to give the public a &quot;voice in the administration of the museum’s collections&quot;</text>

What would be the ecology of enthusiastic post-industrial capitalism? What would be the ecology of a massive synthetic biology lab? Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘laboratories’ are used the same, and in both cases the objects are deployed not as installations reflecting the embodied rhythms of capitalism, but rather as narratives of the possibilities and demerits of possible future modes of social organisation. How can the institutional frameworks of postindustrial society be configured to respond to the kinds of ecological devastation happening now? How can the spatial and temporal scales of ecological devastation be shifted through the use of agro-processing technologies? How can the social use of resources be created alongside the production of wealth in ways that are more amenable to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many? These are questions that raise themselves up again and again in critical ecological writing, but they get largely ignored or rendered as if they don’t exist. The environmental critique of postindustrial society doesn’t really exist as an interdisciplinary enterprise.

What would be the ecology of enthusiastic post-industrial capitalism? What would be the ecology of a massive synthetic biology lab? Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘laborato-theory’ are now used synonyms, but let’s be honest: labor is still the star of the show at the microscopic level. Lab and factory are still the epicentres of ecological and labor-related drama, but what is being done to the planet at large by these transformations? I argue that we need a ‘species-wide ecology of imagination’, one that recognizes that we’re no longer just observing the ecological drama unfolding before our very eyes; that we’re part of a huge social narrative unfolding now centred around the production of ever greater amounts of energy, in the knowledge that we’re contributing to its perpetuation in myriad ways. I call upon ecologists and laborato-theorists everywhere to start thinking about the larger picture, to start dreaming bigger, to start dreaming ‘sustainable cities’.Sounds good, doesn’t it?

Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘labs’ have become sources of fantasy for many people, and the post-industrial society is the fantasy underpinning that all these activities have a place. The question becomes whether the ecologist who wrote those first few post-graduate textbooks on ‘future culture’ was being genuinely engaged with, or whether her interest was in meeting a client or fulfilling an existing institutional interest. In my view, the former is more likely. The particular interest in ‘future’ that characterises the industrial society is oriented towards the well-being of humans as products, and not towards the flourishing of living things on the planet. Hence, the emphasis in those first few textbook chapters is on how to maximize the capacities of organisms to carry out certain functions in the future, especially as technologies develop – how to create ever more self-sustaining eco-systems based on the very particularities of individual people’s remains.

The future looks bright for the ecologist, but there are dark clouds on the horizon with even brighter potentials than the one we're living in now.

We need to start thinking about the bigger picture.What would be the response to a post-post-industrial society where the only ecological activity taken seriously was the ecologist’s fantasyland? What would be the ecology of enthusiastic post-industrial capitalism? What would be the ecology of a massive synthetic biology lab? Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘labs’ are now frequently used synonyms, but what does that mean? What does ‘ecology?When developing its current plans for the city, the Dutch organization​De Waardwijk Nederlandse Erasmus’s (DIY)3D Centre for Creative Trade (CCCT) is currently researching the ecology of new kinds of urban space. The aim of this research project is to put an urban eco-system on the map through imaginative design and innovative implementation of technologies; to this end, the organization has initiated a cooperative research institute for artists’ work and community members, as well as a series of citizen science projects. The project website describes the concept of the ‘3D Centre for Creative Trade’: The 3D Centre is a collaborative research institute for art, design, architecture and community that brings together a studio, a school and a research centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands; a city, a</text>

What would be the ecology of enthusiastic post-industrial capitalism? What would be the ecology of a massive synthetic biology lab? Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘labs’ are often conflated, but few people are taking the time to understand that there’s a difference. A post-post-industrial society that exploits natural resources and turns them into useful things is one with a dense ecology of its own, where people are integral to the functioning of the system but don’t get any of the value created.  龍�In the future, perhaps, we could explore how our lifestyles today are contributing to the problems of climate change, but right now we have to acknowledge that there are ecological and climatological timescales that have to be addressed. We have to start thinking about the systems that are contributing to creating the problems we’re seeing, rather than the people who are the problem. Is it us, the people who use the roads and use the buildings? Or is it the building trades? Or is it the media? And does it include the activities of large corporations, which are the</text>

What would be the ecology of enthusiastic post-industrial capitalism? What would be the ecology of a massive synthetic biology lab? Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘laboratories’ are often conflated, which can lead to a misunderstanding of the former. For example, the corporate ‘laboratory’ can be seen as a place where workers build the future, but it also has a ‘plant path for workers to find work in the future’. Here, the plant path sounds good on the surface, but deep within, processes of de-classification and industrialisation are mutating the planet’s biosphere in ways that alter its chemistry and biospheres in unpredictable ways. ‘Industrial society has its ecological problems too, but it is the precariat, the proletariat, whose reproduction, intensified by ever more encompassing modes of production, threatens not only industrial society but also the planet’s fragile biosphere.’ Here, the ‘plant path’ is seen as something that can be repurposed and that can be adapted to fit new circumstances and social needs</text>

What would be the ecology of enthusiastic post-industrial capitalism? What would be the ecology of a massive synthetic biology lab? Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘human-criticality’ refer to the same thing in different ways, and so we can say that the synthesis between the two is the ecology of today. But what if the only ecological activity taken seriously in the world is the ecologist’s fantasyland? What if our ecologies start to resemble those of the biomedieval period, and the industrial revolution, and not in the way that industrial ecologies typically do? What if our ecological systems start to resemble those of the information age, and not in the way that information ecologies typically do?These are questions that raise the hackles in some people’s veins, and so it’s with trepidation that I turn to the book Human Concerns: The Rise of the Consumer Culture and Culture of Consumption (2010) by Rebecca Vilkomerson and Michael Rowbotham, and the subsequent discussion in their book The Culture of Critique (2011).

Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘laboratories’ are by-products of the industrial economy, but they’re taking on new lives as service industries. The lab is no longer the primary site of production, but rather functions as a site of exchange and routing of goods and people as technologies advance. What would be the ecology of a large synthetic biology lab? I propose that there should be ‘ecologies’, or ‘laboratories’, whose ecological footprints should be made visible in all the signs that they create, transmit and control information about the world. A ‘laboratory’ is a site where industrial production meets design meets maintenance meets transport meets art meets science meets entertainment meets nothing but commerce. A ‘laboratory’ would then be a site where design meets practice meets media and art meets math, where the former is made manifest through the latter. A ‘post-industrial society’ would then be possible, not through the</text>

What would be the ecology of enthusiastic post-industrial capitalism? What would be the ecology of a massive synthetic biology lab? Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘labs’ have come to refer to a particular mode of economic development in the world, and while the former is an exaggeration, the latter is in many ways closer to the truth. The ecologist will tell you that capitalism today is a complex system with many interacting parts, and that complexity is the spice of life. But this simplistic description only captures the bulk of the system; the bulk of the spice is extracted by a single commodity: money. The systemically minded person begins to see the bigger picture. And this is where things get interesting. In the twentieth century, the industrial revolution transformed the world, and in the twenty-first century it may well do the same for the world of biopolitics. The biopolitics of ecology and biotechnology has recently revived in many places around the world; in recent years, it has been a critical tool in the ecology-biotechnology arms race. But while the industrial and financial flows of money and commodities continue to</text>

What would be the ecology of enthusiastic post-industrial capitalism? What would be the ecology of a massive synthetic biology lab? Both ‘ecologies’ and ‘labs’ are often conflated, which is why the term ‘ecology’ is often used in tandem with ‘science’. But ‘science’ is a much more accurate term for the way in which the sciences are organising everything right now. The ecologist would have to be a genius to put the ‘industrial ecologies’ back together again so that we could start to reimagine the ecological systems that exist in the world today.Post-industrial society is rapidly becoming what might be called a biopolitics – the future is now – where activities now take place primarily in countries or regions controlled by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which is predominantly drawn from the federal government. The NCPC has super-charged the power of urban planning agencies, departments, and agencies into locally-relevant governance. And although it’s true that the NCPC has super-charged the agency into space, it’</text>

I don’t think we need to do a bespoke business plan here, or even a bespoke management team, because if we don’t believe in what we do, then we’re not going to get things done, and we’re going to lose our jobs.

We want to create what we can be proud of, and we’re not against that. But I do think that the seeds that we can put in place can help us to resist the urge to ‘call ourselves’ something that is already threatened with destruction.We have to start somewhere, and working towards something. If we don’t start somewhere and work towards something, we’ll never get there – that’s the mentality that we need to have. The fact that we have to start somewhere, and that something so simple can solve so many problems doesn’t make it a recipe either. There’s a formula, and if you don’t know what that is, you’re not making the right decisions, and you’re never going to get there, so we have to figure out what that is.

We’re not trying to change the game at all. We’re not into dynasties or anything, but we’re into what we do, and we’re not going to change our game through other people’s mechanisms.I think the thing that will always remain in the back of our minds, and which will always be there, is the feeling of not being able to express ourselves. There’s a line that David Cameron famously sang at No 10: ‘That line is long enough, isn’ – and I quote – ‘it’s the line between public and private life.’ The fact that we’re coming out of that line is a testament to the power of the symbolic. The fact that it’s going to take place in Wembley is a testament to the power of the cultural. The fact that it’s going to be based in London is a</text>

We don’t need to know the details, we don’t need to know what their backgrounds are, and of course we don’t need to know how they live their lives. Sometimes it’s good to ask, and sometimes it’s not so good, but that’s just common sense. And yes, I’ve got my fingers in all the pies.I’m so glad you asked me to be part of it.

But I also think that if we don’t create the conditions in which that can happen, then it will probably happen anyway. And I’m not saying that we’ll succeed – we’ll all be disappointed and mad at each other for a long time – but I do think that we must try to create the conditions in which it can happen.Because I think that when that happens, it will probably happen, and we will all be part of that process.

We’re looking for a group of people who think creatively and architecturally, and we need people who can articulate that as a way of thinking. A creative class in their own right, able to come out of their shells and start thinking creatively. I think my friend John Lennon would approve.There’s a tension there, where people want to be able to say, or design, what they mean when they do things, but at the same time, they also want to be able to do it in a way that expresses their own sense of place and identity. I think that’s where a certain amount of experimentation is needed. We need to make sure that what we do and say doesn’t end up being defined by what people around us think we mean. Sadly, sometimes that experimentation can lead to quite aggressive interventions – leading to situations where things don’t quite belong, and where</text>

It’s still going to be about the same game, but the game will be different now that it has AI. To me, the key is still the same – the same elements, the same building, the same area, the same landscape, and that’s really all there is. When you add an AI system to that, the challenge becomes different, and the ability to conduct research and discover new things is just as important. The system you’re building is just a shell, and to some extent, it’s already adding to the richness of the city. You can create something completely different out of the shell. That’s really interesting to me, the way that AI is able to construct new situations out of old situations. Things that were once considered ‘natural’</text>

If you do that, you’re not going to find the resources to carry it out. And I think our biennial might not be the right place for that, or it’s not what we should be looking for.

And so we’re doing it through the art of the possible, through what M. Paul McCarthy calls the ‘possibility of difference’. That comes from the Greek, and it’s something that we in the arts world struggle to articulate often enough within ourselves, something that we try to impose on others in order to make them agree to. But what does it mean to be ‘possible’? What does it mean to be ‘possible’ in the world as a whole?

The  Interface Evaluation Criteria includes several questions that set it apart from other computer languages. The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ It’s this question that underpins the whole research agenda of  Interface Evaluation Criteria.2 The answers to this question, and many others that we know how to do is at Stake. It is the very DNA of the interface. If the interface is a commodity, then the cultural value is a commodity, and its management is a business. If the interface is a data interface, then the control system is a platform 2 and its usage is a form of advertising, with politics as a partner.

The  Interface Evaluation Criteria includes several questions that set it apart from other computer languages. The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Scenario Design?’ The proposed interface would have to be able to interpret a wide variety of indications, not just the ones given by a user. Many other questions remain unaddressed, including the crucial ones about navigation and safety. 	The underlying principles of computer interface design would have to be discovered and incorporated into a technologically sophisticated and socially responsive way to allow users to envision and use the interfaces of the future, including at the level of biology. The quest for such a mode of thought and action would put humanity at the forefront of a new interface paradigm. 	A second set of questions that the committee asked and received was more practical and focused on the actualisation of such a paradigm. These questions allowed citizens to create an interface paradigm that is not beholden to a specific company or nation-state, but instead draws upon global computerisation and cybernetics research to arrive at a conclusion about what kinds of behaviour can be expected from users. These questions allowed citizens to create a virtual interface</text>

DeepMind received a substantial funding round from Google and Facebook in 2014, and continues to be funded by these companies.  	The human-computer interface is becoming ever more complex, and is likely to remain so for many years to come. The aim of this study is to develop principles, based on recent experience and research, that can then be applied to interface prototyping and research. We envision an interface that responds to different types of knowledge, using pattern recognition and machine learning to discoverable intelligences, based on historical and anthropological knowledge. The interface could be interactive, but also aesthetically pleasing, functional and even liberating. 	The  Interface Evaluation Criteria includes several questions that set it apart from other computer languages. The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Scenario Design?’ The answers to this question may inform future computer interface guidelines. For instance, the question ‘What is the Value of an Interface, Now and in the Future?’ may lead to future guidelines for data transparency and accessibility. 	The second most important question is, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Network Programming, or What is at Stake in the Art of Networking?’ The answers to these two questions may inform guidelines for the art of managing users’ access to information, but may also prescribe what types of interfaces are fit for specific purposes. For instance, the Network Programming Languages Guidelines 2010 by the Open Network Library and the Society of Network Programmers may be taken as prima facie guidelines for the design of interface design, but they prescribe only what is appropriate for use by a technical elite. The guidelines prescribe nothing about what kinds of people can use the network, only that protocols are laid</text>

The  Interface Evaluation Criteria includes several questions that set it apart from other computer languages. The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ It’s this question that underlies the decision to invest in designers who can design and are part of a research team, rather than in those who can program and create something beautiful and intuitive. The answer to this question may revolutionise how we think about computer interfaces, and may even change the way in which we design them. If the criteria is met, a networked interface may be described as ‘system‑level software that enacts a set of actions on a platform’, and may even be viewed as a form of passive reading that is part of a research project. 	The second criterion is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ It’s this question that underlies the decision to invest in a professional engineer or network engineer who can design and implement a computer interface, and may even be viewed as a form of passive reading that is a kind of research project.</text>

The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Scenario Design?’ It’s this question that shows us how to identify and address the most pressing issues facing the art of interface scenario design. It’s a decision that we as interface designers must answer. How to Know About Water Pipes and Smelters 	The second most fundamental question of all is: What is at Stake in the Art of Pipe and Smelter Scenario Design? 	We propose that the goal of the  Interface Evaluation Criteria 	 should be to know enough to affect change, but not to know enough to effect change. We believe that the current obsession with knowing everything that can be done with regards to user-friendliness and user empowerment is holding us back from doing things that will have positive effects on the world around us. We propose a radical change: the creation of interface architectures that never see the web, but directly impact their users’ lives. We recommend creating transparent screens that only ever see the web, but affect</text>

The  Interface Evaluation Criteria includes several questions that set it apart from other computer languages. The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Scenario One?’ It was not intended to be a definitive statement on the type of interface to be used, but rather a starting point for research into potential requirements, design dilemmas, and possible solutions. The questions above all ask us to identify what is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Scenario One. 	In the context of computer interface studies, the objective of this project is two-fold: (1) to produce requirements that can be met by future planners of transport and communication networks; and (2) to design and implement an interface that optimises the performance of existing infrastructure, while disrupting potential new uses. Transport and communication networks are set in motion across vast distances, and over great periods of time. The demand for data transmission is enormous, and the data that is transmitted is enormous – data that can identify where the next train is coming from, where the next plane is flying from and with what altitude, and with what speed, and with what</text>

The  Interface Evaluation Criteria includes several questions that set it apart from other computer languages. The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ The answers to this question could lay in one's profession, but also in the socio-cultural context in which the interface is made – a society, a language, a collective unconscious. 	The second most important question is, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ The answers to this question could lay in other fields as well, but the focus here lies on the interface as a media format, since it is the interface that provides the most value and provides the most access points. 	The third most important question is, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ The answers to these questions could lay in any number of subjects, but the focus here lies on the interface as a media format, since it is the interface that provides the most value and provides the most access points.

The  Interface Evaluation Criteria includes several questions that set it apart from other computer languages. The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ The answers to this question will guide our research and design efforts. The questions also prescribe what is considered a good and a bad interface, based on research and experience. 	The questions and their answers are as follows: What is the ideal interface for a given task? What is the user experience? What is the cognitive bias of an interface? What is the neural interface? What is the linguistic interface? What is the socio-political context of today’s interface paradigms? What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes? 	The answers to these questions will guide our research and design efforts. The question that emerges is: What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes? Our research and design efforts must address the question at the centre of the debate – what is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?

The  Interface Evaluation Criteria includes several questions that set it apart from other computer languages. The most important of these is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ It’s this question that we’ll ask in this project, since it informs how the design community perceives the importance of understanding and addressing different types of users and different kinds of cultures in designing interfaces. Our project aims to answer this question, since it’s the only way that the interface will evolve; if it doesn’t, we’ll all be stuck in this dystopian interface world. Interface Criteria question 2) and  Interface Evaluation Questionnaire (EEQ) question 1) are two excellent question that can be used to assess an interface, since they assess the user’s cultural expectations regarding the usefulness of the interface, as well as their knowledge of the physical and conceptual differences between computer and human interfaces. The objective of these questionnaires is to have at least as broad an application to a population as possible of users, since a good approximation of the intended audience is required in order to be meaningful and adaptable.

The second is the question, ‘What is at Stake in the Art of Computer Interface Schemes?’ The answers to this question can shape future interface design, but also design into what? What if the user interface is too abstract? What if the strengths of the interface lie in its transparency and lack of organisation? What if the strengths of functional interfaces lie in its organic structure and periodic updates (scaling)? What if the strengths of aesthetic interfaces lie in the fact that humans can draw beauty from the interface and its mechanisms? These are just some of many questions that could potentially be asked of an interface. 	The  Interface Evaluation Criteria could be adapted to many sorts of interface shapes and sizes. It is a starting point for research and conceptual development, a record of past experiments and a starting point for new creative interfaces. It is a tool for understanding and design</text>

There is also a strong possibility that the cooperative would not be able to survive, let alone thrive, outside of the city, due to the nature of the market. This final segment of the business model emphasizes the precariousness of the working conditions and precariousness of the housing stock of the area: the relative deprivation of the residents of Anfield, as compared to the relative luxury of residents in other parts of Liverpool. In Anfield, the residents of the bakery and the bakery cooperative are the anchor tenants, while the residents of the nearby housing estates and the local community are the slaves of the market. The bakery and the cooperative’s board of directors includes residents from the local area, professionals with knowledge of housing and cooperative dynamics, and activists from various organisations. The board includes residents from the bakery and the cooperative, as well as local community leaders, academics, architects and journalists. The board also includes members of the Local Government Digital Service and Housing Executive.

The hybrid model is the direct result of collaboration and collaborative thinking between the people who operate the bakery and the people who work in the cooperative. It is a response to the biennial and the museum, which seek to categorise and explain things into neat packages and categories. Cooperative members and visitors can contribute to the cooperative’s success by joining the cooperative board and becoming stakeholders in the cooperative’s business and business plan development. Cooperative members also gain access to business plans, funding information and other strategic information relevant to the cooperative’s business model and its development. Cooperative members stay involved in the cooperative’s day-to-day operations by becoming directors, which in turn, become stakeholders in the cooperative’s business. 	To develop its own integrated strategy, the bakery and the cooperative had to work together on a shared basis.

But that doesn’t mean the neighbourhood has to fail. There is a way to reinvent success through sharing, and the cooperative is the right place to try this new kind of urbanism.How to Make It in Your Own Skin (Part 1) 	In this first part of our interview, Ruth B. Polanyi discusses her book The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of the Modern Transformation, and the Political and Economic Disasters that Brought About the End of the Cold War. Part of the second part of the interview focuses on the role of art and activism in the 1980s, and the role of small government and civil society in the 1990s.

In fact, this is one reason why in the US, retail cooperative housing trusts (CCUs) have complementary forms: they are both about the creation of alternative, complementary forms of housing for low-income and working-class communities.CCUs have complementary forms because they are about the creation of housing for a specific clientele: tenants and homeowners. CCUs typically have a clientele of professionals, professionals-education providers, and legal practitioners; and many of their initiatives focus on skills development for first-time homebuyers, professionals and institutions. The bakery and the cooperative board consists of people with diverse skills sets, including food makers, brewers, chefs, homemakers, artists, teachers, food stylists, researchers and more. The breadwinners also have diverse skills sets: they can be builders, businesspeople, parents, community organizers, or organisers. The bakery is a great</text>

As a result, there is a strong possibility that the success of the cooperative would be influenced by the success of the business. There is also a strong possibility that the cooperative would be a success, since sharing in the success would help ensure sustainability and increase shareholder value. The board of the bakery shares in the success of the cooperative, since a successful cooperative board ensures that the success of the cooperative is maximised. A successful cooperative board ensures that the cooperative maximises the potential of its members and the wider community, making it a more enduring and sustainable model. The board of the cooperative is a strong negotiating tool, and can end up owning more of the business than they bargained for. The board of the bakery is often critical in ending a cooperative’s contract, since the contract provides for a certain percentage of the bakery’s future profits. If the bakery closes, there is a possibility that the cooperative could try to sell the bakery to another business partner or franchisee, who would then target new customers elsewhere in the city. If the bakery is a success, the cooperative board may wish to expand the bakery, or lease it back to</text>

There is also a strong possibility that the success of the cooperative would be dependent on the success of the cooperative. In the unlikely event that the commercial side of the business is more successful, the board’s financial success may be enhanced.In the case of a successful commercial venture, there is a possibility that the bakery and the cooperative could co-operate in a different way. This is the case for an organisation such as Homebaked which is a hybrid collective ownership organisation and a café co-operative. Cooperative members take part in the cooperative’s democratic decision-making through the cooperative board, which also includes elected representatives from the bakery and the cooperative. The board includes people with different skill-sets and experience levels, and is largely self-selected, reflecting the neighbourhood character of Homebaked. It is important to note that the board is not autonomous and does not delegate authority to any of its members. However, since this is a hybrid model, it is possible that board members have an understanding of how</text>

There is also a strong possibility that the cooperative would fail – just as many other food co-ops have done in the United States and elsewhere. I say ‘likely’ because some of the decisions that need to be made don’t make sense for the reasons that are given. For example, what if the local supermarket closes down? What if the housing market crashes? What if our street is closed? What if our neighbourhood is threatened? What if our breadwinners decide not to invest in the cooperative? These are just some of the reasons why, if there is going to be a co-operative bakery in our neighbourhood, it needs to be run with people who are not just experts in the area, but also people who have other skills and knowledge. It’s not going to be an academic institution with great professors teaching a class, or a university with wonderful arts departments, but people who actually do things because they are engaged, meaning that they have knowledge and tools to do it. And so</text>

There is also a strong possibility that the cooperative would fail: the board of directors may want to restructure the business and close the bakery. But if the bakery and the cooperative are to become truly collaborative, there has to be a process of strategic alternatives and viable locations for future growth. So far, this has not been the case for Homebaked, which has instead concentrated on meeting customer expectations and the financial obligations of its owners. This has meant developing strategies around loyalty cards and free food, but also relying more and more on analytics to target and measure the success of its growth. Homebaked is no stranger to failures, but it is also no stranger to trying new things, so it is worth reflecting on the failures of the past to help us move forward. This is a recipe for experimentation, and the failures of the past to allow for the success of the future.This is the bread that keeps us coming back.

There is also a strong possibility that the cooperative could support the success of the bakery and the cooperative in different ways. The bakery and the cooperative are run in a hybrid model of co-operative and artisanal agriculture, with a hybrid market place featuring both locally sourced produce (including organic meat) and vegan and gluten-free products (including bread). The cooperative bakery is a hub for the cooperative's activities, offering both fresh bread and produce from the farm, as well as goods for sale in the cooperative shop. The cooperative has a production line running down the road from the bakery, supplying fresh produce to the cooperative members and visitors, as well as catering to the busy café and visitors. The bakery has an extensive wine and beer selection, offering a range of products suited to the specific needs of the community. The cooperative has a bakery and unique food rental program, offering affordable but quality catering to the needs of the community. The bakery has a full-time production staff dedicated to baking and packaging, with an additional staff dedicated to</text>

There is also a strong possibility that the cooperative would fail, but the board of directors would continue to own the bakery and co-operate with it as a cooperative housing cooperative. This is the original concept and intention of the bakery and the bakery cooperative, and is what has defined the cooperative movement. There is a need for strategic thinking from management on the part of residents and stakeholders to determine if a neighbourhood or neighbourhood-based cooperative is the right fit for the neighbourhood. This process should take place with stakeholders, but also with stakeholders who already have expertise and/or skills that could be used in the cooperative movement, and whose roles would include either managing the cooperative as a co-operative as an independent organisation, or in the unlikely event that the cooperative does become a success, in the form of a cooperative housing corporation. There is a need for self-criticism as well as for new initiatives. New initiatives, whether sub-divided or incorporated into larger strategies, need to have roots in the community in order to be</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, it is not just about how to feed people and construct buildings, but also about how to live harmoniously together as a city comes together to address its acute shortage of affordable housing. 	The answer to how to achieve this kind of sustainability in a city may lie in the activities of what is sometimes called a ‘metro area’ or ‘regional market’.1 Such is the urban/regional interface: the point where the city and the regional centre meet, where commerce takes place and, most importantly, where social interaction takes place. But just as the city is constantly subject to change through the processes of development and urbanisation, so too is the ‘regional’ – subject to the whims of economic development, political and demographic changes, as well as to natural disasters and war – constantly subject to changes in its management. 	A region has its borders, and just as important as its borders are the political and legal devolution of power</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, in the current economic crisis in the European Union, it is not just Greece and its vast national debts that are a burden, but also the fact that many citizens do not feel that they are part of a real community and are alienated by the political process. The emergence of self-organising collectives and bottom-up initiatives are among those factors that are fuelling the anti-capitalist upsurge. 	In an ideal world, the only resource for making city resources useful and desirable would be a reduction in unemployment and social inequality. But as economies of abundance become more and more of a reality, the urbanist needs to be aware that not all needs can be met with the creation of infrastructure or new business models. 	Any city that is to some degree a production line for social practices and values needs to be monitored closely. If the city is to evolve in ways that are not reliant on the exploitation of labour, it will need to be possible to migrate labour between sites and environments</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, in the past when the cost of housing in San Francisco increased dramatically, developers spent a great deal of energy trying to cut costs by reducing employment and training programmes. By focusing on skills and programmes that are more easily transferable across social, economic and spatial levels, such as language, healthcare and education levels, the future urbanist can create incentives to create new urban environments that are more like those of the past. 	But what if the city is neither so easily nor so destructively transformed? What if the city instead offers opportunities for growth through technological innovation, new social practices and participatory forms of governance? If the future is indeed a ‘social transformation’ according to one eminent scholar, then the answer is a resounding ‘no’. Rather than embark on a ‘social transformation’, the city must create ‘tools’ that enable people to participate in creating their ‘future city’, making it possible for future generations to contribute to the</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, access to education is a social necessity for all, but policy-makers need to ensure that the provision of quality education is distributed equally. A future urbanist might suggest that students attend certain universities, but the reality is that most people do not choose to attend certain universities. Instead, many people attend private and parochial schools, which are limited in their enrolment to certain socio-politically engaged groups. Consequently, a future urbanist might encourage students to attend diverse universities, but this is not always the case. 	In an ideal world, all city residents would be able to access quality education at university levels and the parochial and public sectors would provide equal educational opportunities. However, this is not always the case. In fact, many students attend university despite their knowledge of architecture and urbanisation. For instance, in Toronto, 30% of students at the graduate level and above are enrolled in courses in urban studies despite having little exposure to urban studies, and only 6% in</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, in the United States, policies that encourage private redevelopment of vacant and underused sites and places of public use are often promoted as a way to combat 'bad urban planning'. In places of high public spending and high rates of unemployment, such initiatives can have a positive impact on the local economies that are dependent on them – but this is only possible if the local workers and communities that are the subject of such policies are organized and empowered to respond effectively to the challenges presented by the expanding population. 	In the 1970s and 80s, the Black Education Movement emerged in several North Carolina cities and states, demanding that all public schools in the city be converted to academies, and that students in these schools attend free summer camps run by the Academy Committee. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, other movements emerged in other parts of the US and Europe calling for the end to this economic neo-liberal transformation, and the re-establishment of worker–organisations.

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, in the globalised urbanisation process, it is increasingly important to ensure that transportation is provided for in urban environments, and that basic services, such as education and healthcare, are universal and accessible to all citizens. In the past, this meant collaborating with civic leaders and political parties to create transport infrastructure or funding bodies, but with the emergence of competing micro-aggressions and geo-political factors, the shift has recently shifted to building collective resilience through urban regeneration schemes and programmes. Cities now need to think beyond the capacity of existing infrastructure and build collective resilience through a combination of grassroots and institutional means, says Şehmet Baris Kuymulu, an Assistant Professor in Urban Studies at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Publics at Syracuse University. He adds that the current political and economic uncertainty surrounding migration is hampering the ability of localities to mobilise resources efficiently and effectively. 	Urbanists should therefore seek to understand the factors influencing migration in their locality and beyond, and to</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, in the current economic climate, it is not uncommon for developers, especially in the developing world, to create socially and politically unstable environments in which people, including citizens, live in poverty. To a large degree, these pressures are generated by unregulated capitalism, which uses finance and technology to produce ever more and expandable profit centers. Such developments are also often accompanied by conflicts that are fueled by unregulated capitalism’s capacity to shift resources such as cheap oil and natural resources, which are used to feed rapidly growing economies. It is essential that the future urbanist understands that the dynamic nature of the city is critical to the sustainability of his or her proposed projects. Any city-dwelling project that takes into account the city as a site of social struggle and social conflict will inevitably experience displacement and conflict. 	Future urbanists need to become conscious of the social and political dimensions of their work and projects. They need to know the languages of mobility and create strategies to navigate displacement and conflict. For</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, in the US, policies that encourage investment in education and training for workers with particular skillsets may be desirable, but do not necessarily create the social and spatial conditions for such investment. For instance, in the cities, a policy of free and reduced-price school lunches may be desirable, but does not necessarily translate into improved working conditions and income opportunities for low-income communities. 	The notion of public realm is further eroded by the proliferation of autonomous community groups, non-profit organisations and other socialised entities that have substantial economic power within the city, but which also have a significant stake in shaping urban development and in shaping the political and legal landscape of the city. 	Finally, there is the growing role played by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in strategically supporting and helping to shape the city in their own image, strategically placing development infrastructures, parks and neighbourhoods within their political sphere of influence.  	Conclusion 	It is no exaggeration to suggest that</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, it is not just the fact that people are living longer, but that their living standards are also rising. This trend is expected to continue; the question is how to allocate the scarce resources needed to support the growing population. 	If the city is to retain its cultural character and be responsive to its inhabitants' needs and wants, then it is imperative that resources directed towards arts and culture be strategically deployed. To date, this has not been possible in the city because of the concentration of resources towards infrastructure projects and large corporate business interests. The future urbanist needs to find creative and innovative ways to utilise the city’s resources towards projects that directly address the needs of the city’s inhabitants while creating positive spin-offs for the city centre and surrounding area. 	Finally, the future urbanist needs to create collaborative and equitable arrangements so that resources and assets can be distributed equitably. This may require new modes of sharing, as well as new forms of negotiation and division among</text>

The challenge for the future urbanist is to design policies and programmes that ensure that decisions about how and when to spend city resources are not made on the basis of economic considerations, but on the basis of factors such as social, cultural and spatial factors. For instance, in the decision-making process surrounding the redevelopment of the Cains Brewery site in Cains, Minneapolis, the city spent significantly more on the infrastructure to house and serve the brewery than the site itself. The city spent over $1 billion to store and house the brewery, which was then effectively spent in the nearby shopping centre. 	The Cains Brewery was closed for several years as a result of structural problems that damaged the building, but the City Council recently voted to re-open it as a restaurant and retail complex. The re-opening comes as a result of a city-funded pilot project that involved marketing strategies that incorporated the brand and image of Cains Brewery in marketing messages to attract businesses to the area and the city. For the pilot project to be implemented, a re-branding project had to be developed with multimedia that incorporated elements of the brewery and its paraphernalia into digital media and social media campaigns. The City Council is now considering whether or not to create a similar</text>

The founders expect to double the size of the company after the launch of the Global Urbanization Mapillary (GUM) in 2018.The GUM includes detailed plans for urban transformation in over 200 cities around the world. The aim is to create an integrated mapillary ‘that brings together, explains and maps the urban transformation taking place in each city – a conceptually complete urban mapping solution that will impact every aspect of urban development worldwide.’ The project was originally conceived as a research project for the university, but as the number of participants in the project rapidly increased, the city’s administrators moved the project into the larger public sector. This is especially significant in a country like Iraq, where the public sector accounts for approximately two-thirds of economic activity.The GUM project is</text>

These were developed and are still being used by local authorities and large corporations around the world. They show the share of public funds that go into constructing, maintaining and integrating new infrastructures and how that compares with the performance of older infrastructures. For example, the use of boring machines to build new roads or the recycling of petrol station infrastructure gives a picture of the economic impact of transport infrastructure, but it does not consider the environmental or social impacts that accompany it. The use of software to monitor, analyse and interpret data helps to understand the social and economic impacts of transport infrastructure, but it does not take into account the political, legal and administrative systems that regulate its use.

The goal of these is to create collaborative and equitable platforms on which to run such experiments, to enable local and regional adaptivity to the city’s changing demographics, and to enable a range of other opportunities, including the creation of new industries, the co-construction and the reinvention of obsolete infrastructure, as well as the creation of new publics and the reduction of poverty.In a previous life, I also worked for the Greater Baghdad Authority, which is a city authority in Iraq. I headed the district bureau, which gathered statistics on road accidents, fatalities and injuries, as well as information on the economic and social situation of residents. The statistics were used to implement strategic projects, such as the construction of new hospitals or the expansion of school lunch programmes. The statistical analysis was carried out using Python and GeoImage. At the time, GeoImage was a startup, and its mission was to provide �geospatial data cubes, imagery and publishing platforms to support the visualisation and implementation of geostrategies for policy and political decision-making in urban areas across the Middle East and North Africa’. I participated in the design and development of the platforms, which were developed in-house at the authority. The platforms provided a platform for the aggregation of data, which transformed the way in which the authority conducted its business. The authority could employ experts from different fields to assist in its civic and political processes. For instance, hospitals could benefit from the statistical modelling provided by the platforms. This kind of empowering of the local population is nothing new for cities, but the way in which the platforms were put together and configured allowed for a more direct and precise interaction between citizen and authority. For instance, the platforms could be configured to deliver news about road accidents to specific neighbourhoods or regions. This kind of granular reporting enabled the authorities to identify clusters of drivers who are in fact operating outside the law</text>

In 2003, I started the project with my colleague, Ihtmatt Walid, who is now the Chair of the Department of Geography and Planning at McGill University. The name of the city council that I founded and which has since evolved into a hybrid city/town/suburb council is a hybrid one. It is a hybrid because it is composed of citizens from different wards, but also because some of its members have dual citizenship and residence. For example, a citizen of Iraq is a citizen of the city of Montreal, but also of the city of Montreal. In the 1970s and 1980s, many immigrant movements sought integration into city environments, but the overwhelming majority of immigrants in Canada were citizens of South Korea, China or the United States. Immigrant movements have become increasingly marginalized and disempowered in Canada, while the politics of abject marginalization remains dominant. The city’s present</text>

The Hypermedia group was formed in San Francisco and I joined them there. We used Python and GeoImage to collect and analyse hypermedia data on a massive scale. At the Hypermedia group’s inception, I was part of a small group developing innovative ways to use commercial real-time analytics to collect and analyse real-time imagery in order to monitor developments in the neighbourhood. Later, at Google, I started working on maps, and eventually on maps and traffic. My research interests at Google at that time were architecture and urbanisation.I was invited to be a part of a research team developing an interactive map and traffic simulation app for the Apple App Store, which would allow users to zoom in and out of real-time map data, as well as create and join virtual neighbourhoods, during the second Intentional City conference held in San Francisco in October 2002.

At the peak of the project’s development, over 1,000,000 images and 1,000,000 images were produced.I left the project in 2011, but I came back a year later and continued to work on the project. I produced an archive of images and videos, interviewed residents, and created a public website with more than 1,000 photos and photos documenting the project’s development. I started a facebook page “@Real-Time-KB” with the tagline: ‘“Bringing Real-Time Analytics to Sitcoms”. I invited the community to join me in the new technology’s defense.

The social media platforms that emerged during this period – Facebook, Twitter and Google – enabled collaborative and equitable access to data, ideas and processes. And while the social media platforms did have a role to play in mobilising and engaging communities, they were generally viewed with suspicion and derided by their early users as being dominated by corporate interests.Soon after the social media platforms were invented, a new form of data was created.

He explained that Saad had a problem similar to mine: I had been working on a project to make CIDIS (the powerful central database for the urban) available over the Internet. Saad suggested that I introduce him to CIDIS programmer Evangelista Sanchez, because she has a lot of experience with this kind of technology and its possibilities.I did this, and then I started working with her and others on the project, which was developing over time into what was becoming a large collaborative open-source project.

The surplus labour is created by the labour of millions, which is then used in production processes that never cease. There is a surplus of cheap labour, and this labour is then utilised, creating new wealth for shareholders. 	Over the past decade, cheap labour has become increasingly difficult to come by in predominantly Asian countries. This has forced large corporations like Apple to look for ways to cut costs, and many smaller businesses to shutter shops or relocate production to countries with cheaper labour.

A task force headed by theoretical physicist and biennale expert, Prof. Guy Ben-Eliezer, has been developing a new generation of accelerator-cooled tunnels and tubes that will offer significantly better energy returns on investment than current designs. These may well be the future designs, but as far as we know, these are the first designs that have ever existed. So perhaps our present concerns about runaway climate change and the inefficiency of current cooling technologies might be relevant in considering the design of an event such as the biennale. Perhaps the biennale could be viewed as an instrument for the socialisation of urban space, and perhaps its current fixation on the automobile may finally be a mistake.Art and Science at a GlanceLast updated: 2016-07-03T05:57:43ZItalo Calvino’s Invisible Cities are some of his most influential and powerful.

A task force headed by theoretical physicist and biennale critic, Prof. Martin Rees, has recently suggested that a biennale ‘should be seen as an art form, and should be treated as such’.[8] The task force is the logical extension of the work carried out by the curatorial office, which for many years was content to engage in what was commonly referred to as the ‘curatorial hunt’, a pursuit that saw it primarily as the job of the scientific curator, and which also saw the art department, which was predominantly concerned with painting and spectacle, and the less physically powerful but equally important but now increasingly obsolete areas of art, architecture and social change. In the 1950s and 1960s the biennale was seen as a reliable source of artistic value, and the historical and contemporary situation of art and art’s place in the world, and the artists and art writers whose works were exhibited.

A task force headed by theoretical physicist and biennale expert, Prof. Steven Shute, has proposed a new conceptual paradigm for the exhibitionary form: ‘bienniality’. I think this new exhibitionary form might be best conceptualised as a ‘periodicity’, or ‘episodic structure’, within which is placed a series of occurring and recurring events that are not mutually exclusive but also not sequential. Within this periodic structure, there might be found an eventual relationship between observation and meaning, culture and nature, history and contingency, but also between art and commerce. This exhibitionary form might be seen as the most promising and humanistic option open to the phenomenon of ecological crises, since it is the most amenable to the cultural production that follows from a new understanding of biennials as ‘periodic cultural occasions’.

A task force headed by theoretical physicist and biennale expert Frans De Waard concludes its report with this intriguing observation: ‘Given the complexity of the biological and technological systems that we collectively consider to be the infrastructure of the future, the historical specificity, or ‘what might be’, of an event such as the biennale is questionable.’ The remark is the foreshadowing of things to come.When biennials first started, the notion of the museum rather than the museum inverts both the function and the object. Objects, curators, artists and art’s audience are all presented as materials for the museum, a non-existent and un-existent external entity that emerges only at a later date (object of contemplation, perhaps). The museum is seen as an extension of the city, or at least as an object with a contemporary and contemporary interest (subject, perhaps). But what might the museum be if it ceased to be the museum? What might it become if it ceased to be a collection of</text>

Prof. McBride proposes the term ‘infrastructure emergent quality’ to describe this new breed of infrastructure.5’ Infrastructures are those systems, structures and networks that are assumed to be immune to change and which are designed to operate reliably and seamlessly into the future. The infrastructural quality of our cities has often been characterised by their vernacular qualities, their adaptability to different forms of government and culture, the permanence of infrastructure investment and the inevitable concomitant challenges to infrastructure building and operation. Yet this assumption about infrastructures' ability to endure in the face of change is often at odds with the</text>

A task force headed by theoretical physicist and biennale expert, Prof. Wolfgang Overpeck, has proposed a new way to think about how cultural products, rather than being confined to the specific artefact through which they are sold, emerge: ‘contemporaneous production’. This means that cultural products, rather than being products of a specific culture, might be products of a multitude of interacting cultures. The task force suggests that this might happen through ‘micro-exhibits’ that take the form of ‘small-scale but representative exhibitions that take place around particular curatorial approaches and uses of cultural products’. These micro-exhibits would mark a variety of curatorial approaches to the artefact through which it has come to be perceived as culturally significant, and could point to new curatorial approaches that might one day produce similar cultural effects.The task force is the brainchild of Prof. Wolfgang Overpeck (Ph.D., Philosophy of Science, Frankfurt am Main University) and Prof. Eva Cas</text>

The task force’s proposal, which still needs to be ratified by the French National Assembly, proposes to move from the present ‘état conférent des droits libres’ to the future, ‘état contemporaine des droits libres des arts?’, where the former would designate the areas of the art world that would be open to empirical and theoretical research, while the latter would designate those areas with a conceptual framework that would make it possible to monitor and analyse such research. The proposed change would create a new division in our society, one that would make art and cultural activity more accessible and might even make it possible to live culturally in the arts and culture sector?

With this research, it has emerged that biennials operate in a social and cultural context in which technological innovation and globalization are major forces shaping the world as we know it. The project is calling for ‘deep learning’ computing systems to decipher ‘phantom information’ and ‘deep architecture’ – the hidden compartments and structures underlying physical and virtual worlds – to create ‘contexts of understanding’ and ‘understanding mechanisms that actively and naturally map the physical world’.These new models are being developed alongside a team of artists and researchers at Liverpool John Moores University and the University of California, Riverside, who are using cutting-edge computer modelling and engineering to create ‘virtual monuments’ – cities, mountains and so on – that replicate the physical phenomena of biennials in their entirety, but with cyber</text>

As Heide puts it: ‘The uncanny valley is an artifact of the biennial.’ How might biennales contribute to this larger picture? As biennials become more and more institutionalised, and their curatorial focus shifted from the museum to the future, we might begin to question what is meant by the term ‘biennial’ and what it entails. Is it really the collection of objects, the collection of collections, the collection of knowledge? Or might it be the collection of cultural products, or the collection of experience – the combination of collections and the future – that makes up the core biennial experience?

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea of participation and how the exhibition, its content and its format could be approached in the context of a cultural enterprise. Some of what we have planned is very much participatory. You’re invited to join us for a week or so. There will be a series of activities planned in advance around the exhibition space and the BIENNALE’s curatorial plans. These will allow you to explore the exhibition space and the BIENNALE’s curatorial plans from a different perspective. For example, you can visit the BIENNALE gallery during the week and explore the curatorial plan for the biennale through the letters section. The visiting curatorial team will also have a number of conversations around the exhibition schedule and the curatorial plan ahead of time, to allow participants to create and initiate a narrative or idea for the exhibition ahead of time. 	The curatorial plan will continue to evolve, and will include elements of the following elements: a. Location, location, location</text>

Is it possible to create a relationship with the community based on trust and friendship, rather than on the assumption that you are either partners in a cooperative or members of a community? Krysia Luskacova: Yes, it is possible to create a bond between the audience and the people, and between the community and the art institution. The audience is invited to take part in the process by leaving comments, suggestions or sending letters to the editor. They can also participate in the research project themselves by suggesting topics or points of interest, and answering questions. Curatorial staff will continue to do their part in the research project by asking questions of expert audiences and media.

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea of ‘institutional change’ that you can generate through a curatorial plan. In the case of the Biennale, this change might be the institutionalisation of veganism as a ‘pathfinder’ towards a society without animals, or it might be a change in perspective and intention. I’d like to think of this as a mix of the two. I don’t think it’s just going to be about one thing, nor am I not saying ‘this is the only answer’. I’m interested in seeing how social change can be triggered through this new understanding. What can the Biennale do to encourage a change in mindset? 	The Biennale has always been about more than the individual exhibits, and has always been about the larger picture. What better way to do this than to align itself with a cause?

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea that the biennale has adopted the curatorial mission and is now a multi-year, multi-edition, ‘curatorial triennale’. The curatorial plan is to be developed with Nina Edge, who is the Curator for Exhibitions, and is responsible for the city of Ljubljana. She has the task of planning the excursions, which will include over-arching themes, such as ‘liveness’, ‘nature red in tooth and claw’, ‘forest fires’ and ‘bleeding edge’. The curatorial plan should also include an evolution of the ‘curatorial’ and its varied forms, which may be ‘curatorial’ in their own right. 	The curatorial mission is defined as the 'mission of presenting, organising and controlling events in a globally visible and transient way, through a public affirmation of identity and belonging, and the mobilization of resources for</text>

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea of community, of which this is a very powerful concept. But once again, we’re all asking the question: what does it mean to make one’s neighbourhood ? I think what we’re trying to do is create spaces in which people can be able to be able to explore different kinds of neighbourhoods, and I don’t think we have that right now in Georgia, not only because we don’t have a concept of what that might mean, but also because we don’t have a concept of what that might look like. The concept of neighbourhood may be important, but I think what we’re missing in Georgia right now is a concept of community. Right now, if you live in an area and you’re a resident, then you’re a resident and you’re a part of the community, but I don’t think we have the concept of a neighbourhood that maps onto the city. 	</text>

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea that it’s now no longer possible to visit a museum in isolation, as an experience. I’m interested in this as a concept, and I see it as a way to explore ‘time and place’. In a curatorial context, a concept like time or location is always subject to change and new situations, and so I see it as a space where art can take on new functions and ideologies. For me, the time and place that’s most at risk is when art is constrained by time and place, and so I see this as an area where art can really go wild. The ‘time and place’ that’s most at risk is in the cultural relativism that characterises contemporary capitalist culture, and so I see this as an area where radical art can really shine.

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea of cooperation and how we can work together to solve problems, including those that we perceive as ‘external’ from our own society. It would be nice for the readers of the book to know that there are other perspectives on the same issues that are equally valid with or without the Biennale. For example, there are people from different professions, backgrounds and social standing who can contribute to this discussion. We’ve created a working group – a 'team’ – to explore how art, activism and biennials can work with one another, both in terms of how art and the people who create it are organised, how activism and biennials can be democratised and how art and activists can work side by side. This is a collective of professionals with different skills sets, backgrounds and experiences – artists, artists, artists' allies, artists who have been through the curatorial process, activists, journalists, social workers, legal experts, historians, philosophers, political scientists, architects</text>

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea of the biennale. I’ve heard the term before from the art world. In fact, from the curatorial profession. I see it as a synonym for something new. I feel that the biennale is the new form of the old curatorial form: it’s a large gathering of artists and it’s a gathering of the past. The ‘biennale’ is a gathering of past curators, past curators, present and future curators. It captures and represents the history of art’s role in a given city or country. I see the biennale as a gathering of artists and curators from a given field, tempered by the different cultures and languages of the world. It captures and represents this cultural exchange through a series of curatorial actions that take place in and around the exhibition space. The ‘biennale’ has a particular linguistic and cultural character that cannot be replicated anywhere else. It�</text>

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea that the biennale is an episodic, perennial enterprise, and that its current format of ‘presentation, event, survey, performance, dance, walk etc...’ is an episodic as well as a terminological mistake. I think it also depends on what counts as a ‘place’ in the wider sense. If we start to define ‘places’ as a ‘marker of historical and contemporary cultural importance’, then we can start to categorise the biennale: it becomes a project that starts from the beginning and works its way out. And that sounds so simple, but it’s quite dangerous, because one day you’re thinking about taking part in something that you’re not invited to and you’re thinking about it from the inside out. The meaning of what counts as a ‘place’ in the biennale world may start to diverge from what counts as a ‘place</text>

Curator: Joasia Krysa. 	I’m very interested in the idea of the biennale – in this context, it’s quite natural to think of the exhibition as a ‘collection of images’. But I also want to make clear that the curatorial approach to the biennale is not a curatorial approach to the city. In fact, the idea of the city is not even what the biennale is about. Biennales are about the spectacle, not the city. So the idea of the festival, the curatorial conceit, and the biennale as a ‘collective experience’ are not really ways of conceiving of the city in relation to the spectacle. The idea of the festival, the co-exhibitionary, and the biennale in the same way that the zoo and the circus is not really about the spectacle – in this case, the animals – but are about the experience of watching them. And so the conceit that the zoo and the circus were actually about the city in</text>
