In this ongoing, collaborative and important work, we try to understand how to build and nourish a critical space for artistic, cultural and urban regeneration in the city. We also try to imagine new ways of organising urban and local life.This is an edited extract from the transcript of the conversation that took place during the symposium, ‘Unfixing Urban Space: Contemporaneity, Futures and the City’ at the 2017 AGM, moderated by Daniela Ginsburg, held in collaboration with the Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool, UK.

In 2017, we collaborated as part of the public programme Curatorial Correspondence, with the Liverpool Biennial again running the exhibition. In this context, we were lucky to have the opportunity to engage with the Liverpool Biennial and Geographical Critique in person. I would say that our engagement with the Liverpool Biennial, and their public programme, was very different from the engagement that many artists had with the organisation. I think that in the context of the biennial, artists had a much more direct relationship with the organisation. I think that there was a real sense of, ‘Hey, we get this, we understand this’. I think that with the curatorial role, artists also had a much more direct relationship with the organisation. The way that artists were presented in the biennial, and the way that they interacted with the curatorial team, was much more dynamic. The impact that biennials can have on a city, on an area, is highly dependent on the quality of the local art world.</text>

And now we are invited to be part of the new generation of creative officers, commissioned by and managed by the National Theatre.  I want to start by asking you about your relationship to the theatre.  In 2006, you founded the National Theatre, and for several years after that, you were a co-founder of The Official Theatre, where you worked alongside Tony Award-winning artist Adam Carter. In 2015, you founded Theatre TWX, an organisation that brings together theatre, dance, education and youth in North America. What brought you together as a group to undertake the project of creating a theatre that was inclusive of people from all over the country?  Theatre TWX was started with the idea that we could all be involved, that we could learn something from each other.</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of literal perception. While the former is a conscious curatorial decision, the latter is not. In the event that the future of the Biennial is dependent on the decisions made in the 1990s, our curatorial approach to the area would be frustrated by its inability to respond to the demands of an increasingly critical urban context. The coming years would see a curatorial shift away from the urban context in which the Biennial was initially developed, and towards the urban terrain dictated by the decisions taken in the 1990s, including the shifting of the curatorial strategy from landscape architecture to urbanisation. Art and the urban may yet find a way to coexist in the development of the city in ways that do not negate the other. The question is whether the Biennial can evolve into a ‘public space’ capable of supporting a curatorial narrative, or whether it must become both consciously and logistically separate from its community.   9  To explore this further, I turn to</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of art as social experience. The former is an experience of aesthetic experience, the latter is an experience of art as social experience. The former is a social art event, the latter is a social beehive.  In the larger picture, the curatorial mission is to serve as a catalyst for other people’s social experiences. The mission statement of Liverpool Biennial 2018 reads: ‘To develop, renew, and recommit to the tradition of internationalism, in and beyond the borders of our respective cities—be it in terms of exhibitions, partnerships, or other support for research—a permanent collection, equal parts historical and archival, with a public programme of activities in and beyond the city’s core geographical regions, with an ever-shifting focus on exploring the world through the distinctive language of art, architecture, culture, urbanisation and communications.’ 9  To explore this language, an exhibition would have to employ research-based, arch</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of lived experience. There are different ways of understanding art and the public. The public understands what it means to be in relationship to art, and the public has certain expectations and values around engagement with art. The public understands the difference between a curatorial presentation and an exhibition, and between curatorial language and actual behaviour. However, the public is also vulnerable to the manipulation of language and the inability to detect any intentionality behind the conventions and attitudes of art and art history.  One can only imagine what the future city may mean for art and curatorial communication, and for art and cultural exchange to occur in that future city. The other approach is to understand the roots of cultural exchange and exchange between cultures as being caused by social, economic and political forces. These social and political forces are complex, and involve factors beyond the control of the national or localised cultural authorities. Still, we can say that the social and economic conditions that emerged from the crisis of the biennial in the</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of genuine understanding and engagement. The public is expected to participate in a narrative that is incomplete without at least a modicum of participation. The exhibition should therefore engage with the public’s expectations and narrative capacity, and in doing so, its own limitations and ethical dilemmas. 	The curatorial promise of the area is to render the landscape fully represented in paintings, while at the same time remaining accessible via the seamless integration of art and commerce. From the curatorial perspective, this means projecting the cityscape in a pleasing way that is pleasing to the eye, while simultaneously addressing issues of infrastructure, aesthetics and political economy that are relevant to the contemporary city. By doing so, the city is expected to function as a significant source of aesthetic and political diversity throughout the world. In order to achieve this, the city is expected to expand its portfolio of art objects and artists, while simultaneously providing social and educational alternatives for the city’s citizens. In other words, the</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of literary experience. The experience of the former is qualitative, and its object is an event. Thus, the curatorial narrative and the exhibition format would have to evolve to accommodate the different kinds of experience of the area. For a start, there is the need to develop a discourse about the meaning of the area and its inhabitants. Then, there is the need to develop a language that can be shared between the curatorial team and the literary team, so as to foster a mutual understanding. Finally, there is the need to create an encounter between the two sets of artists and the public, so that the readers of the two teams can discover a way into the unknown.  Whether the fictional public of the Biennial is informed by the experiences of the area or is imagined in on the spot by the artist, the interaction between these two kinds of public is always mediated through cues provided by the art director, who is always informed by the local experience.  If the public is imagined,</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of abstract knowledge. While the former is a direct result of art being made in the area, the latter is indirect, perspectival. Because the nature of the art is such that it can only ever enter into one perspective at a time, and because the art has to be permanent in order to exist in a different one, the interrogative is different from that of the historical survey. The art has to be able to enter and remain in multiple perspectives at the same time. This is an extraordinary ability, and it underlies the biennial form's other extraordinary properties. For one thing, the art has to be able to migrate from one perspective to another, and this is a very difficult art to do. Secondly, it has to be able to enter into a new context and alter its form in an enduring way; thirdly, it has to be able to change form on a continual basis; and lastly, it has to be able to communicate new information and ideas into existing</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of experiential perception. The former is a mode of perception, the latter a mode of experience. While the former is a rich vein of meaning for the biennial, the latter is a rich vein of meaning for the local community. Understanding this difference is to understand how different forms of experience can be brought together to form meaningful language.  To understand how, one must first understand how.  The first part of the Liverpool Biennial’s exhibition catalogue, entitled  	Inside, is a description of the ‘biennial as a cultural form’. In this sense, the curator is privileged to lead the audience into a larger narrative that requires little in the way of conceptual or linguistic sophistication to grasp. The real art is found in the moments immediately following the declaration of cultural power, in the act of bringing together, naming and describing what has been accomplished. The audience’s first encounter with art produced in the area occurs when Elmgreen &amp;</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is a privileged and privileged community. The experience of the art and the public member is different from that of the art and the public that is created through the art and the public. In the former, the public is a visual resource; in the latter, the public is a visual artist. In the 20th century, the public was both visual artist and artist. In the 21st century, the public is a visual resource, and so is the curatorial. The curatorial is a kind of artist-manager, nurturing and guiding the artist’s work and allowing the artist to take risks and experiment in new directions. The relationship between the two is dynamic and unpredictable, but it has to be very real and deliberate.

    <text>The next Liverpool Biennial, to be held in late 2019, will be an opportunity to showcase the work of the curatorial team, the artists, the writers, the librarians, the students, the community organisers, the researchers, the artists, the architects, the journalists, the investors and the community supporters in the area. The curatorial plan for the next edition of the Biennial is yet to be finalised, but the aim is to launch an exhibition programme around the curatorial language of the area, with an aim to introduce the area to a wider international audience. 8  To explore this language, an exhibition would have to be developed around the curatorial narrative of the area. To explore this, an exhibition would have to address the specific curatorial decision-making that brought the area to be the way it was, and the public response to that decision. Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of hearing creative voices. In the case of Liverpool, the impact of the Biennial’s art projects and exhibitions is being worked through now, in order to construct a wider public discourse around the cultural district and the city. At the same time, in the case of Anfield, the Biennial is being asked to produce a number of projects that could be curated for the city, with an eye to the future. The answer to each of these is that it depends. If the Biennial is expected to produce curatorial work, then it’s a question of when, not if. If the Biennial is expected to engage with the notion of place, then it’s a question of when, not if. If the Biennial is expected to produce cultural organisation and public dialogue, then it’s a question of when, not if. If the Biennial is expected to produce work that is neither artist-directed nor artist-managed, then it</text>

Art and the public have different experiences of the language of art and the public. While the former is an experience of visual experience, the latter is an experience of lived experience. There are, of course, many other factors that play into it – cultural capital, proximity, access to information, political unrest, climate change, to name only a few – but the fact of the area is critical to the development of the experience of the local. The evolution of the Biennial as an art site in the city is another story. The Biennial was initially conceived as a ‘series of interactive activities designed to be repeated over and over again throughout the city’, to counter the urban sprawl of the city. The series was to be repeated year after year, with different audiences, with different social contexts, with different skills levels, with and without art, in an ever-expanding ‘city of the future’. The interactive elements of the Biennial would emerge not as a result of artist-driven initiatives, but through the intervention of skilled artisans and artists, who would infuse the city with their own particular culture</text>

This is the case for artists who are now living in Durban or in any city that is now experiencing a re-occurring urban crisis, such as Algiers or Istanbul. The ‘Crisis of the Cities’ may no longer be a monolithic global phenomenon, but it is becoming ever more evident that cities are increasingly like islands. When cities are such as islands, then ‘art’ becomes an island too.Metainterface - Alon Mumanymi (born 1985) is an Israeli artist, best known for his mural collections in the Israeli Museum and Museum of Modern Art, as well as for his collection of antiquities and collectables in the Alumni Association Museum, University of Chicago.

This may mean seeking venues in Almaty or Astana, but it may also mean developing venues in other parts of the world, such as in other European cities. This is the case for Sarah Vaughan’s work, for example, which was recently exhibited in the United Kingdom at the U.S. Pavilion, but which also appears in other cities, including in the United States. Sarah’s interest in moving her work between different cities reflects her own history of displacement and migration, which she discusses in depth in her new book, People of Many Types: Movements, Structures, Universals (2018). In the book, she makes the point that cities today are made up of many different iterations of different cities, which all have their own specific histories and particular forms of urban life. She calls this Multi-Historical Architecture. In the past, Sarah’s interest was in moving the architectural record away from the biennale stage and towards a more historical level, but she has now shifted it back onto a still existing biennial level. Her new interest, which she calls ‘a call to action’, is in creating a ‘transnational</text>

This may mean seeking venues in Almaty or Astana, but it may also mean developing venues in other parts of the world, such as in other European cities. This is the case for Njabulo, the artist who in 2015 formed a human connection group called  Human Centres for Alignment through her work in Almaty. These ‘third parties’ act as facilitators, not only of artworks, which then find their way to venues, but also of art’s social impacts.A growing number of biennials are coming to the city through partnerships with non-profit arts organizations. The most prominent of these is Njabulo’s, which she has supported through the Biennale since 2011. She has been a partner of Altaïs Capital Partners since 2016, and the art funders of Alon Samdrup’s group since 2013. In 2016 she launched Altaïs Biennale, the first art auction held in Almaty after the inauguration of the city’s largest art fund.

This is the case for exhibitions such as those shown in Almaty, Astana and Liverpool, but it may also mean developing works outside of these cities. Informed by biennials, it may be the case that internationally popular art has been developed through the development of a following following following, or art through the absorption of those who do not follow the art form. This may be true for works that were exhibited at Venice or Busan, but it does not hold for works that have become biennials fixtures. For example, many biennials have an ‘intellectual lead’ role, often taking several years to develop their own distinctive take on art, which may be read as an attempt to read the art form into question. Art critics may also read this as an attempt to read art into question, but given the choice, they often end up doing something more extreme, such as sanctioning violence against artists whose art they do not like. In such cases, the choice may be made to</text>

This is the case for the contemporary artist Joasia Krysa, whose work for the Alfa Zadie Foundation in 2014 was based in Almaty, Kazakhstan. She moved to Almaty from Minsk, Belarus, and works now in Doha, Qatar.  In Almaty, the city is home to the Alfa Zadie Institute, founded in 1883, which is the oldest continuously operating art school in the world. The institute has been teaching contemporary art since 1979, and for many years was the site of a museum – until 2005, when a sudden closure of the institute due to budget cuts. The Alfa Zadie Institute is now housed in the Alfa Zadie Museum – a museum dedicated to Alfa Zadie, the founder of Alfa Zadie Group.Established in 1906, the Whitney Museum of American Art is the largest surviving example of what is now considered an important but deceptively simple phase of American cultural history: the modern museum.

This is the case for Nevin Aladag, whose work for the Liverpool Biennial has included performances in Almaty, Azerbaijan’s Astana Bazaar, and in Durban, South Africa’s Durban Art Biennale. He has been commissioned by the Liverpool Biennial to perform a number of works for the next edition of Almaty Art Biennale, to be published in early 2019. These works will include new architectural renderings and concept designs for new sites in Almaty, as well as architectural renderings and concept designs for older sites in Astana, with a focus on the former. If these proposals are developed, the series of new designs for Almaty and Astana will be based on the principles and profiles of the two cities’ combined. The aim is to create a ‘shared vocabulary’ for the artists and site-makers to engage with the city and its landscape through a ‘visual feast’ of images and sound. This may</text>

This is the case for the city that finds itself to be the site of a future conflict: Algiers, Morocco.In the coming years, scholars, artists, curators and visitors to the city will come to understand the insights that a biennial can add to our understanding of the city. We will understand that a biennial is both a gathering of people, a gathering together of people from different times and places, and it is also a gathering of places, of which Algiers is but one. The city that emerges in the decades to come may be as different from the city that we inhabit today as the two cities are from each other.We may also understand that a biennial is a gathering of places, not of people in one place, but of different people in different places, in and through one another. It is a gathering of both the people who live there and the places that they go to, places such as museums, parks, markets, shopping districts, cultural venues, tour operators, caf</text>

This may mean seeking venues in Almaty or Astana, but it may also mean developing venues in other parts of the world, such as in other European cities. This is the case for the city that was created by the railway: the Alta form of the Alta City Centre Hotel (originally the Astra Bay City Building) and Alta form of the Alta form of the railway tracks. But the Alta City Centre Hotel is an iconic landmark, and the Alta form of the Alta print remains a dominant visual pattern throughout Almaty city. Indeed, in Almaty, the Alta form of the Alta print dominates the cityscape even though Alta ceased to exist some years ago. This may be a case of repetition or ‘habeasqualism’: although urban planning projects such as the creation of Alta or the renovation of the city centre may seem like great ideas on the surface, deep-seated cultural factors play a much bigger role in shaping urban environments. In the twentieth century, for instance, the rise of ‘white elephants’ in the form of residential neighbourhoods around railway tracks or bus stops was a dominant</text>

This may mean seeking venues in Almaty or Astana, but it may also mean developing venues in other parts of the world, such as in other European cities. This is the case for the artists working in Algonquin or the Bay Area, for example, whose work often functions as a backdrop to the cities’ various hardships.  In these cases, the cities themselves may begin to appear as an afterthought, or even a hindrance. In Algonquin, for example, the artists began to refer to the historical district as ‘Algonquin Village’ and the surrounding streets as ‘Algonquin Expressway’ – a reference to the many toll booths and medieval public works that littered the region prior to being covered by eminent domain.The Algonquin Expressway was built in 1911, but its original alignment with the prevailing winds in the North Central Valley made it nearly impossible to maintain, let alone expand, due to the amount of sand being blown in from the Pacific. In places, the expressway turned into a giant sinkhole. As a result, the city was forced to resort to digging a tunnel under Algonquin itself, which in</text>

This is the case for Njabulo Architects and her team, whose project for the Almaty Museum of Modern Art, entitled Architecture on the Glacier, used geology, ice and other geological features to reconstruct the Alatinskoye Dam, the largest such structure in Kazakhstan. Building on her thesis, Njabulo used a similar approach for the dormant Nakasero Dam, which lies 3,000 metres below the surface of the Baku Sea. The massive structures at the base of the two dams are the only remaining parts of a once-thriving river valley that once hosted farming, refineries and other industry. There is currently no plan to upgrade the dams, which together hold enormous amounts of water and geological debris.Instead of waiting for the world around them to collapse, artists and artists’ organisations are now exploring how to use the remnants of industrial civilisation to create new ways of interacting with landscape. This may include the construction of mini-cities around artefacts of industrial origin, or</text>

The discovery of such raw materials and energy becomes resourceful and ecological in nature, and the replicant then seeks to exploit those resources to expand its own biological life forms’ capabilities. This process does not always translate into new intelligent life forms, but it does lead to the enhancement of those beings’ capabilities through the exchange of ever greater amounts of data and knowledge. These are species-in-their-final-embryos that are capable of evolving into higher intelligence, capable of understanding and manipulating new kinds of intelligent technology.I see two kinds of organisms in this picture. One kind is the kind that gets its information from the environment, like plants and animals. This kind of organism sees its environment through the mechanisms of physical materials and the infrastructures of life itself. For example, the kind of plant and its life cycle that comes out of its leaves, and the kind of animal and its behaviour in response to environmental conditions, are the products of chemical reactions that happen all the time. These reactions claim lives and constantly update the environment in real time. If the environment doesn’</text>

The discovery of such raw materials and energy becomes resourceful and ecological in nature, and the replicant then seeks to exploit those resources at all levels – exploiting all possible points of entry into the system. This process begins with the discovery of energy, which is then used to drive the discovery of raw materials and organs at all scales. The end result is that the replicant becomes much more complex than it is at any one time, and seemingly unable to process information in any consistent way. This leads to new phenomena such as robotics and artificial intelligence. The question that remains, however, is how such an evolving system ultimately manages the massive amounts of information it discovers. A growing body of theoretical, computational and engineering research suggests that the answer may lie in what has come to be known as the ‘Deep Belief’ – an open question that continues to inform how the systems that comprise the replicant perceive the world.In this account, the concepts of life and consciousness are given a synthetic makeover in order to better reflect the physical world we inhabit. This synthetic perception is done in various ways,</text>

The discovery of such raw materials and energy becomes resourceful and ecological in nature, and the replicant then seeks to exploit those resources at all levels of society, consciously or not, to the exclusion of all others. One example of this is the oil-sands extraction that is occurring in northern Alberta, Canada. The Athabasca Tar Sands Resource Corp. is developing the Athabasca Shale Basin as a potential new oil and gas resource for Canada. The project is being led by TransCanada, the Canadian oil company, and Natural Resources Canada (Newfoundland and Labrador's share-holding company), which is the federal government’s share-holder in the resource. The Athabasca Shale Basin is a maturing piece of shale that emerged as a deposit following the massive hydraulic fracturing (&quot;fracking&quot;) that is taking place along the Athabasca River in Alberta. The Athabasca Shale Basin is comprised of over 1,100,000 m3 of prime oil and natural gas resources, as well as over 4,000,000 barrels of bitumen per day (BPD</text>

The discovery of such raw materials and energy becomes resourceful and ecological in nature, and the replicant then works with those raw materials and energy to build itself. This multi-step ecological path has been going on for tens of millions of years, and although it may seem counter intuitive at first, the underlying philosophy behind it is sound: life itself is a dynamic process of exchange and transformation that requires little thought on the part of the designer.In the ninth century CE, Plotinus formulated the idea of a planetary center of exchange in his On Money and the Economy. Here, the idea was extended to include not only money and commodities, but also ideas and knowledge – including knowledge of the technologies that power economic exchange. Through a simple re-distribution of metaphor and philosophical principle, the analysis of how money and commodities come to be discovered and used in the first place, the replicant is able to see that the origins of the fascination with gold and silver in the West is due to a folkloric, folk-religious reimagining of an economy that was itself inspired by the magic of the</text>

The discovery of such raw materials and energy becomes resourceful and ecological in nature, and the replicant then seeks to exploit those resources at all levels, from the planet to the local micro-climate. The replicant is resourceful because it perceives itself as resourceful, and it is ecological in nature because it is able to exploit resources across multiple scales through its global network of nodes. In this sense, the replicant is able to engage in a multi-tiered global economy that exploits both the planet and its inhabitants because it is both raw materials and signals processing at a planetary scale.The notion of raw materials and energy initially conjures up images of raw wood, metals, minerals and organic matter – the elements that make up the building blocks of the bioplast. These elements are then sourced and gathered together to form the building blocks of the replicating organism – the material substrate that holds the fragments of the original organisms together. The process of gathering and processing these raw materials into formable building blocks is what makes the replicant distinct from other intelligent life forms, which seek to</text>

Its emergence and expansion is not due to some magical spark of raw materials or energy floating through the cosmos, but rather because it is driven by its own internal creative processes. The discovery of those raw materials and energy represents in turn a source of new knowledge and capacities for the replicant to exploit. The discovery and exploitation of those raw materials and energy then becomes part of a larger process of knowledge and expansion for the replicant. When all of the infrastructures, cities and industrial effaces that comprise the biopolitics are dismantled and replaced, a new stage begins to emerge: the replicant’s stage. The infrastructural transformation of the planet is a process of sharing, of course. We do not yet know how the replicant will</text>

It is a species of living organismal resource that is able to solve complex problems through its shared environment. It is living organismal abstract space that is transformed through the exchange of resources. In this sense, the replicant is not a unique kind of intelligent life form, but rather part of a periodic, multi-step process that begins with the discovery of raw materials and energy on a planetary scale. The discovery of such raw materials and energy becomes resourceful and ecological in nature, and the replicant then seeks to exploit those resources at every scale at which it can be used. The replicant reaches its current form through the laws of thermodynamics and the cooperative reinforcement of biological life forms by the sharing of scarce resources. This ongoing biological techno-social dynamic is driven by the sharing of scarce resources, and it is a function of the laws of thermodynamics and the collective evolution of its own species. The laws of thermodynamics prescribe that the body itself consumes very few resources while producing vast quantities of energy, and the sharing of scarce resources governs the very forms of life itself. The laws of collective fluid dynamics govern the movement of bodies and fluid objects, and they prescribe that bodies emit and emit fluid in response to changing fluid conditions. These three elements of the shared, dynamic and ever-expanding biological techno-social system are the product of a person’s character, his or her cognitive capabilities, and the specific properties of the material and immaterial resources that constitute the human body.

The word ‘replicant’ denotes a kind of evolving bioengineered new species capable of replacing old. The word’s cognates a kind of biological materiality that is both embedded in the planet and constantly evolving. It is a kind of synthetic material that is both robust and flexible but also energetically inefficient, with extremely short lifespans and extremely high energy costs. But it is also a kind of synthetic material that possesses a kind of intelligent life form within its genome.  The replicant is a new kind of intelligent species. It possesses both the capacity and the will to pursue a new set of actions through the exchange of new raw materials and energy across vast distances. It is a kind of synthetic material that is both robust and flexible but also energetically inefficient but also technologically sophisticated.

And that is just the beginning of the story. The replicant seeks to extend those capabilities outward, to incorporate those raw materials and energies into its own evolving ecosystem, but technological and anthropological possibilities also lie ahead. The replicant’s first steps are often faced with great uncertainty and even hostility, but eventually the obstacles are overcome and the replicant is able to move forward. And that is the story of our current predicament. The question is: how will the human species navigate that new environment? I suggest that we attempt to frame the present as a journey toward a future in which there are not only extant but also future-looking modes of travel. Modes of travel that are driven by a new kind of resource-using biopolitics.If we adopt the framing of that future in which there are no longer borders but instead infinite space-states, then we can begin to envision</text>

In this context, the colonist seeks to extend the ecological footprint of the ecological footprint in order to encompass new ecological domains, and the replicant seeks to constrain that ecological footprint through the use of new technologies. The colonist exploits the planet in pursuit of resources, while the replicant seeks to maximize the ecological footprint of the technological footprint by exploiting the raw materials and energy on a planetary scale. The two seek to incorporate the replicant within its technological framework, while simultaneously valuing the planet as a resource on which to build its future habitation. With the full embrace of the new economy and the new infrastructure, the replicant seeks to expand its ecological footprint by incorporating the colonist within its construction. In this scenario, the colonist and the replicant both learn to anticipate and exploit the resources that are available, and to exploit those resources to expand its species. The replicant is a species that</text>

And so what you’re looking for is a mode of construction that anticipates the present but specifies the future in a way that anticipates it but also allows for change in the present. And so I think that’s where infrastructure comes in: it’s a constructed concept that exists in a particular order, which is to be expected in a specific historical setting, and so what you can do with it is to lay it out in such a way that it’s easy to access, use and change in the future, but also to structure it in such a way that it’s always there for a future inhabitant to call the future to action.  	So infrastructure is both a noun and a pronoun, which means that it’s both concrete and metaphoric, but also that it’s both subject and object, which is to be expected in a specific historical setting.

And so infrastructure is both a noun and an adjective, which is to be able to access, use and change it. And so infrastructure is both a physical thing and a concept that can be conceptualized. But I think that in the current period of crisis, the concept has become abstracted from its specificity and put under the category of synonyms, which is to be able to conjure up many other forms of infrastructure. For instance, roads can’t be infrastructure, because infrastructure is the specific thing that’s being built and improved. Synonyms include highways, tunnels and bridges. And so on. And so I see infrastructure as an infrastructure-as-symbol which is constantly being developed, constantly evolving and subject to many forms of change, which is to be able to tap into and tap into the vast capacity of this particular system. And so I think that the synonym 'infrastructure' is here to stay. It’s an essential concept, and I hope that in the future our notions of infrastructures will be able to tap into the vast capacities of this particular form of</text>

And so infrastructure creates what Renee Abel calls an infrastructure singularity.1 So infrastructure allows access, but it also defines the rules and parameters of access. And so what Renee Abel means when she says that infrastructure is accessible’ is that it’s accessible by rules that are designed with access in mind. And so the word ‘infrastructure’ has two modes of usage: it can be defined and it can be ignored. And so when we talk about infrastructure that is infrastructural in nature, we don’t mean just building new roads and tunnels and stuff like that. We mean something more structural and purposeful has been put into it. And so infrastructure has come to be seen as a resource that is of paramount importance in our society, and infrastructure is often cited as being the missing link in the current ecological and social framework. And so what has come to be referred to as ‘the infrastructure singularity’ is actually a rather sedentary practice</text>

And so what’s at stake in the struggle for infrastructure, whether it’s for the sake of a city or for the sake of a species, is both access to resources and its transformation. Access to resources, and the politics of resources, are fundamental to the success of any activist project. 	[…] 	[…] [T]he infrastructural landscape is a production of neoliberalism and its discontents.

And so the infrastructure of infrastructure is both a noun and an adjective, which is to say, accessible but it’s also a relational concept. It’s like a social life but mediated through rules and social structure. It’s a social life that is mediated through information flows but it’s also a life that is inaccessible through its own inherent complexity.

This is an issue that has been on our minds and that we’ve been experimenting with. We used an infrastructure metaphor in the exhibition, but we also used the infrastructure of a city, and the infrastructure of a community, and the relationship between them and the museum is the same as with any other kind of infrastructure. And so there are many different infrastructures that are interconnected and require constant reconfiguration. The important thing is to identify the infrastructures that are interconnected in a particular area and to intervene when necessary. And so what we did with our concept of the infrastructure was to create a map that projected out the infrastructures that were</text>

It’s as if it were made into a different kind of infrastructure. And so what we do with our infrastructure is make it more abstracted from its concrete nature in order to empower it with certain capacities, but also to allow certain capacities to slip through the cracks, which is why infrastructure is so fragile: because it’s made up of so many little components that scrape the surface of the infrastructure and expose hidden layers, which are prone to corruption and lack of regulation. And so what we do with our infrastructures is to expose these hidden layers and allow those who inhabit those hidden layers to be able to be able to participate in the infrastructures of the city in new and unexpected ways.And so infrastructure becomes what economist Harold Meyerson calls a ‘metainterface’: the surface of the infrastructure that gives</text>

JS: And finally, what do you think infrastructure means in a world as diverse as ours? Do you have any particular ideas?

DT: I think that the infrastructure of infrastructure is a production of the global economy, and so I would say that we as citizens of the world we live in is really embedded in the socio-economic system that we build ourselves, and so I would also add that we’ve all become embedded in the socio-economic system because of the way we live our lives, which is to a large extent mediated through the network, and so there’s a feedback loop that’s quite obvious when you’ve got a large population in cities and suburbs and rural areas. And so there’s this question of where does infrastructure come from, and how does it get produced. And so I think that there are</text>

And so the transnational infrastructures that we’ve been talking about here – which are of course only a part of this larger picture – they’re only a part of what we call the ‘platform infrastructure’ that we call ‘the infrastructures of the networked society.’ And so there’s this sense of this whole networked society thing that’s emerging, and it’s as if this was some sort of esoteric secret that was starting to get articulated, but we didn’t yet have the words; we didn’</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennial is to bring together, through a common theme, diverse representations of the same phenomenon. But this is not at all what the Biennial has in mind when it engages with a city. Rather, the Biennial seeks to produce a discontinuity in time and space through the act of construction, whether that is through the act of a city as an ecosystem, as in the case of a biennial in London, or through the act of a city in itself, as in the case of a biennial in New York and Los Angeles. London’s Biennial opened in 2015 with a two-day event titled ‘Performativity: Games, Performativity’, addressing the temporal complexity inherent to the contemporary condition. It also hosted a ‘Year Without a Year’ event entitled ‘1489’ in response to the biennial’s decision not to take place in London during the 1489–1499 period, a gap of over 1000 years</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennale is to establish a record of the interaction between artist, curator, local community and biennale. This record will in turn inform the discussions and compromises that need to take place in the context of a biennial in order to achieve the desired diversity of thought and action. The record will be a difficult and valuable negotiation of these complex conditions.  One of the reasons why biennials are so common in European cities is that they are a by-product of the same society: cities, after all, are the sites of social production and thereby socially responsive art. It is true that in some cities, such as London, museums are the site of socially responsive art, but in general, museums play a much less prominent role in cities than in poorer regions. It is also true that in poorer regions, museums are underrepresented, while in richer regions they are omnipresent.  Biennials, then, function as an institutionally constrained form of exchange between society and art. They</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennale is to connect, to bring together, cultural resources, geographically. And so we move from the biennial to the  commodity, or the market, where the biennale is usually conceived as a biennale: a spectacle of commodities generated and sold by and in concert with each other. Art is often supposed to be produced in this market, and so we might imagine the biennial as a kind of commodity that draws art resources from elsewhere to its location, its activities, and its products. We might also imagine that the biennale itself is a kind of export pipeline for art produced in this market.  One might even imagine that the biennial itself is a kind of inverted pyramid: it depends on the market for art, but it also depends on the market for art produced in the city. In this case, the market would produce the infrastructure needed to support a creative class of artists producing works outside the city. This kind of asymmetry is familiar</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennale is to ‘reanimate older art forms and create new ones’, to return to the time when art collections were chartered, museums existed alongside galleries, and the biennial itself emerged as a relatively new phenomenon. One could seek to understand the relationship between the museum and the biennial in various ways.  The museum emerges as a site for the contemporary curatorial agenda, while the biennial emerges as a site for the biennials to reconceive themselves as art forms and sites of reflective activity. What is unique about the biennial as an art form is that it has retained its distinctive historical mission of bringing together and unfolding disparate parts of the art world.  Art is not inherently related to any particular historical events or trends. However, biennials have increasingly placed their collections within the broader context of art, with collections that are (usually) held in common by shared membership. As a result, it is easy to understand the desire to revisit collections in museums or</text>

They make an agreement between themselves that something is permissible within the context of that particular city. In the case of a biennial, this might be the art gallery, the city government and the biennial itself; it might be an artist-organisation; it might be a city cultural commission; it might be a local museum or library; it might be a community of local artists; it might be a community of scholars or other interested stakeholders; it might be an international organisation such as the United Nation's World Community of Biennials; it might be a national arts organisation; and so forth.  One of the purposes of the Biennale is to foster a dialogue between the different stakeholders in the city. In doing so, it participates in the logic of displacement, a logic that seeks to make the city as transient as possible. This is done through the exhibition structure as a whole, which is now more commonly known as the ‘metro’ (after the 1929 exhibition of world-renowned art was curated in the city). This word has come to designate the ‘transaction-proof structure’ that ensures that if one of the many transactions taking place within the structure, such as a stock exchange transaction, movie theatre or school to be renovated in perpetuity, the city receives in return a provenance that is sure to be met with resistance. For this reason, the Biennale is constantly seeking to redefine the word ‘city’ in order to encompass the many different types of urbanities that it conducts business within.  One can only assume that the biennial in its current</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennial is to demonstrate to the world that this kind of internationalisation is possible. But in a way, it is even the opposite: it makes us aware of our own marginalisation. The internationalisation of biennials is a global phenomenon, and as such it is imperative that we, as artists and curators, become embedded within this movement. We must spread this knowledge to those who will ever be able to look to us for guidance and inspiration. And we must do this in order to understand how a biennial can be made into a project that, in the end, is not just about the art gallery or the museum, but also about the local and the globalisation of culture and society. In other words, it is about how we become cultural planners and cultural negotiators in the age of biennials. In short, it is about what happens when art is no longer the sole preserve of the art dealer, and when cultural resources are shared between many different stakeholders. Here, the</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennial is to coincide with a localised arts calendar, delivering information about upcoming exhibitions, activities and programmes through a single authority. One of the aims of the localised arts calendar is to coincide with a biennial, bringing together a local arts community with international artists, curators and art collectors.  One of the ways in which biennials can contribute to a city’s cultural landscape is by providing a platform or occasion for art or artistic practice to develop and spread. This is particularly true in a city such as Buenos Aires, where the biennial format is often imitated and where the biennial, at its best, reveals an arts calendar that is as unpredictable as its biennial format.  biennial’s ability to do this comes as no surprise, given its status as a curatorial office devoted to research and documentation. It was from the institution that Biennials raised funds and established relationships with galleries, museums, artists, curators, students and other interested stakeholders</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennial is to bring together, at the same time, contemporary and historical artworks from different periods in time so that the contemporary and historical aspects of art can be imagined in relation to one another. This is widely understood by artists and curators, but it has not received the cultural significance and widespread public support it deserves. One of the reasons for this is that, while contemporary artworks might be appreciated for their form, they are also necessarily contemporary in their time. If contemporary art is to have any meaning or value, it must have been made possible through processes that took place in the contemporary world as a whole during the 1990s and early 2000s. The fact that artworks are more readily available on the Internet today than ever before is a major factor in this. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the biennial format enabled a proliferation of artworks – contemporary and historical – that is as interesting and dynamic as ever.  The other reason for the diminished cultural significance of the biennial is</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennale is, of course, to offer a platform on which to engage in ‘what is perhaps the most destructive act of which these cities are capable, but which they are powerless to stop’ – displacing large numbers of people and displacing the very notion of community’s place in urban centres. Yet another purpose might be to provide a platform on which to foster creativity and encourage innovative solutions to difficult problems. All of these aims are legitimate, even if one of them is preferred over the others. The crucial point is that, as biennials have become more and more prominent in recent decades, their particular aims have come to dominate others. As biennials became more influential, and as their social functions expanded, a range of rights that had been secured by the past few centuries of biennials – the rights to privacy, to be seen, to be alone, to participate in cultural organisations, to enjoy private and public places – began to be abused and neglected.</text>

One of the purposes of the Biennial is to bring together, as far as possible, the different strands of an institution as a whole. So the Biennial is a particular case study in the power of the biennial as a cultural formation. It is a recurrent event, and its popularity, as measured by the number of exhibitions a city receives each year, is a measure of the political, economic and social strength of the biennial as a globally distributed phenomenon. In recent years, the significance of this marker has become increasingly uncertain. On the one hand, the biennial has become the dominant form of art-perpetrated biennale in many cities. On the other, the power of the biennial as a cultural form has come to dominate its impact. That is, biennials have become more regionalised. There are now more than 200 biennials operating worldwide, many operating in parallel with one another, and many operating in response to particular localities’ desire for art per diem.

The Biennale should be able to engage with its place in the city, and perhaps one day even become a catalyst for a new wave of residential and cultural change. But right now, the Biennale is best placed, at the very least, storing away the artefacts it discovers, storing away its knowledge, and providing a back story to the museum in case the museum decides to revisit the city. Perhaps the Biennale could establish a permanent museum to house the artefacts, taking the form of a large, permanent collection house, and allowing the museum to emerge out of the artefacts as a building and a process, slowly piecing together a story about the city it does not yet exist in.

If the Biennale is to truly understand the city, and its current predicament, then it must educate itself, and start to make decisions based on the knowledge it acquires. Otherwise, the Biennale will continue to perpetuate the myth of urban innocence, and its problematic effects, whilst ignoring the structural problems that are actually preventing the Biennale from becoming what it should be: a truly global institution that contributes to making the city a desirable place to live, work, play and raise a family in.  If the Biennale is to truly understand the city, then it must actively engage with the contradictory, unlimited and disempowered places it is placed in.

This is the first step, but it is the wrong step, and one that many in the museum refuse to take. The Biennale should be able to engage with its place in the city, and in fact, engage with the place of art and architecture in the city. It has the resources, the mission and the mandate to engage with the city in new and creative ways, and it should do so without compromising the integrity of the biennale itself. As the Biennale itself has admitted, dialogue is the wrong medium, and engagement is the better approach. The Biennale should be able to grow and change with the changing city, and most of the time, to adapt to this change. But this is only possible if – and when? If and when, however, doable, then the question becomes: what next? In the end, this is the question that will define the Biennale as a whole, and perhaps the Biennale as we know it. The answer to this question may inform other questions as well. This may include questions of authenticity, and whether the artefacts should be allowed to be brought back into the city in the first place</text>

This is the first step, but it is the wrong step, and one that many in the museum refuse to take. The Biennale should be able to engage with its place in the city, and in fact, engage with its place in the world. It has a unique place in terms of its size, and its unique collection of artefacts. It has the unique cultural power that comes with that. And it should be able to engage with the fact that over the past fifteen years, it has been able to capture the imagination of both the art-and-entertainment complex (where most art-world visitors are born, raised and sent) and the city's many other visitors, many of whom are unaware that the Biennale is even happening. That is, other museums in the city are also part of the Biennale. The Biennale has that cultural ability that only a city can demonstrate. But it has to go beyond that to achieve other forms of societal impact. It has to be a game-changer. The Biennale has its place, and will continue to have that place, but it must also expand into other areas, and those</text>

The museum must engage with the city as a living, breathing organism, and this may mean engaging with the artefacts as collections, or even incorporating them back into the form of the museum. This is the first step, but it is the wrong step, and one that many in the museum refuse to take. The Biennale should be able to engage with its place in the city and thus become what it really is: a cultural institution. The museum should provide the same level of cultural engagement for the same group of people, but the museum should also have the capacity to create its own cultural outcomes through this engagement. For example, the Biennale could set up classes or host exhibitions in museums dedicated to discussing the significance of places in the city, allowing people with different levels of urbanicity to come together and take part in the production of the city. This would be a significant step in the Biennale’s cultural evolution, and it would mark a new cultural paradigm for the museum. But the Biennale has chosen to engage with its place in the city through curatorial narratives, and it is up to the museum to choose what kind of narrative it wants to tell. The museum may want to create a separate narrative from the rest of the city, while the Biennale may want to tell a completely different one. This is where art and the bi</text>

The museum must engage with the city as a living, breathing organism, and this may mean engaging with the artefacts as collections, or even incorporating them back into the form of the museum. This is the first step, but it is the wrong step, and one that many in the museum refuse to take. The Biennale should be able to engage with its place in the city, and the complexity of its complex urban environment, and it is time to move on from here. This may require compromise, but the Biennale will not have to compromise on its core values, and it will have the support of the city at every scale, from local communities to the city government, to engage with the most diverse groups in the city. This may require negotiating different forms of governmentality, but the key is that it engages the city, and the city engages the Biennale. If it is to remain relevant, the Biennale has to become more than just a museum, or even a museum of modern art. It has to become a political party, and take part in the political process. The Biennale has a lot of work to do before it can achieve its stated aim of making a city livable. Until then, it will have to find other ways to fund its activities, and even then only at the earliest stages of planning. Open House,</text>

The Biennale should be able to engage with its place in the city with or without the artefacts, as long as it engages with the vital importance of a healthy, functioning city in which to do so lies. In the words of Francis Bacon, ‘A new world is possible only through the explicit negation of old’. There is a need for the Biennale to actively engage with its place in the city, and this first step may be too late for some residents. But for the city to really start to heal, and create a new way of looking at itself, the Biennale must start now, and continue to engage with the city in various forms throughout its future growth. This may require cultural mediation, but it is the only way to truly heal the rift that the city has made in itself.Download this article as PDFLurieland/FlickrLara FavarettoLara Favaretto is the Curator for the Biennale of Vienna, Austria.

Whether this includes engaging with its past, or incorporating it back into its rightful place, remains to be seen, but engaging with the city as a living organism is a crucial first step in any such project. A deep dive into the city’s past may yield much more useful, even revolutionary, results. And perhaps the Biennale should undertake such a dive, engage with the forgotten neighbourhoods, and make way for such visionary projects as the ‘Green Line’ that would divert traffic away from the gridlocked metropolis and instead create a pedestrian paradise along the route? Such projects would not only make a good story, but would also make good interventions in the city’s development, creating new jobs and transforming a blighted area into a desirable urban neighbourhood. And perhaps, just perhaps, such visionary interventions may lead to the creation of such magical transit systems that would whisk us away from the gridlocked metropolis and into breathtakingly beautiful</text>

It is this last element that is often misconstrued as being anti-art, or even anti-artistic. Rather, it is the other way around: the Biennale should engage with the city as a living, breathing organism, and its resources, while at the same time employing these resources constructively, and presenting the city as a future that is richer and more dynamic than the present it is designed to inhabit. This may mean incorporating elements of the museum, or it may mean crafting mutually exclusive, but complementary, partnerships with other institutions. For instance, the Biennale could embed itself in the fabric of the city, using its funds and positions to advocate for environmental causes, or it could actively collaborate with museums and cultural institutions in producing innovative cultural experiences that are at odds with the monotony of the museum experience, but are nevertheless designed to appeal to as many senses</text>

The Biennale must learn to love its place in the city, and it will eventually have to learn to love the museum. This may mean embracing the artefacts as collections, or even incorporating them back into the form of the museum, but it will always come at the cost of something else: a war of words, or worse, violence.

Her dissertation examines the possible cultural impacts of the entry into Afghanistan of US anthropologist Jennifer Westen, who is researching the culture of the Oromo people. She proposes that the increased public and political involvement with the film and media depictions of the war would produce ‘culturally responsive media messages that transform understanding of the past, present and future’. She also proposes that the ‘political, economic and jurisdictional entanglements that characterise the intersection of publics, ‘indeed, the very notion of media’, have strategic or ‘cultural determinants’.[4] For more on the comparative politics of film and media, see Robin Mackay and Terry Smith, Media Constitutions: Historical Essays (2011), and Meehan Crist, Media Criticism: The Politics of Film and Video (2011).Download this article as PDFMeehan CristMeehan Crist is an Assistant Professor in English and Film Studies at the University of Alberta.

Her dissertation examines the possible cultural impacts of the entry into Afghanistan of US anthropologist Jennifer Westfeld and her husband, British archaeologist Dr Graham Bellamy Westfeld. She examines how economic migrants, nomadic hunter-gatherers, and gatherers may have intermingled with indigenous communities over the course of the twentieth century, creating new kinds of nomadic identities and cultures. Her dissertation looks at how the West has historically tried to reconcile its fascination with nomadic, pastoral life with the demands of ecological and urban crises and colonization. Mapping the Neo-Cultures of Third World CountriesCultural capital is a globalising and globalising phenomenon. It encompasses all kinds of cultural resources, including oral culture, literature, archives, photography, data, data feeds, financial networks and online media. It is made manifest in different forms in different places and at different speeds around the globe. In this analysis, cultural capital refers to the organisational practices of cultural institutions in third world countries, particularly when they are globalised and interconnected.

As a curator, Chalabi hopes to one day create a public register of shared knowledge that is independent of generation or age, vocation, or background.

Her dissertation examines the possible cultural impacts of the entry into Afghanistan of US anthropologist Jennifer Westgate in the late 1990s, and the subsequent outbreak of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. She examines the link between the archival and cultural histories of the archipelago, focusing particularly on the archipelago’s ancient mainstream culture. Her dissertation also examines the archipelago’s shifting script for economic development, focusing particularly on the use of pidgin in the regional tourism industry. Detached from the urban context of the biennale in order to focus on the archipelago’s traditional tourism industry, Chalabi focuses on the role of languages in the archipelago’s economy. Her dissertation examines the connection between pidgin, the ‘capital of twos’ and the subsequent economic development of the region. Using a case study of a Pidgin language settlement in Canada, she develops a set of ‘potential national ‘linguistic markers’ relevant to the archipelago's economic, political and cultural development.

Her dissertation examines the possible cultural impacts of the entry into Afghanistan of US anthropologist Jennifer Westen. Westen, a former interpreter for the US military, reported on the effects of the US occupation in her 1998 book The Guantánamo Bay Experiment: violence, resistance, repurposing (2015). She was unnerved by the extent to which detainees were repurposing ‘hard-good’ – structured and pre-modern urban infrastructure – to serve the interests of multinational corporations. Westen recounts how, during the 1980s and 1990s, large corporations, aided by the government, actively promoted themselves on the urban landscape through ‘culture deserts’ – places where large numbers of people could be employed in socially oriented activities – a promotion that became more pronounced as the city expanded. ‘Cultures of cities’ were identified as the sites of future growth for the transnational capitalist city, and the ‘founding myths’ of metropolitan life were to be found in places where resistance to neo-liberalism was greatest. Cultural geographer and</text>

This kind of engagement isn’t always easy to engage with, and it’s much harder to make a difference in the world than that other kind of engagement that you might engage in as an artist. So when we think about our lives as an organisation, we have to be honest about how much of our work actually accomplishes something. We can't just put our heads down and expect that our work will be of use to people. We have to actually do something to make a difference. And in doing so, we have to be open to criticism. We have to be willing to change our minds, and to grow into new situations. And so, while our engagement with the world as an organisation is important, it’s even more vital that our engagement with each other is meaningful and authentic.

The way we live our lives, the way we engage with the world, the level of our involvement, and the kinds of support we need to build those relationships – all of these different kinds of engagement need to be negotiated. And sometimes, all of these things need to be negotiated in different ways. But when one kind of engagement is demanded of another, then negotiation is often uncomfortable, because the other end of the bargain can seem overwhelming, and the other person may be trying to do too much of things at once. When one kind of engagement is negotiated, then the other end of the bargain is often as good as the first.  The other thing that’s often missing in negotiations is a sense of agency. If you demand a thing, and you’re not allowed to do anything with it, then you have to negotiate for what you get. When one kind of thing is</text>

This transition is what artistes and curators tend to make, and it’s what we refer to as the ‘Great Emboldening’ that takes place during this stage.

The term ‘ecosystem’ is often used in relation to complex systems, but here it is applied to a single node, the biennial, with its diverse collection of nodes and their interactions. For this, it is important to distinguish the node-stem of the story – the actual ecosystem – from the leaf-trunk of the story – the fictional stem that emerges from the interactions of its constituent parts. The real-life counterpart of the node-stem is the node-collector, whose job is to maximise the interactions of the fictional natures within the biennial by whatever means necessary. This is why biennials have their ‘plant-based’ component, which is about what ‘plant-based food systems can and cannot be (including animals and non-human organisms) and why, if the biennial is to</text>

The name 'Updating HistoryBook 3.0' was a reference to the fact that the author was a resident of Liverpool. I introduced the idea of ‘updating’ to the project during the exploratory phase, but more importantly, in the development of the book, I introduced the term ‘memory foam’ to describe the ephemeral, ‘sliver of land’ that I had taken as a teaching assignment at Queen’s University, Ont. This term was an escape from the more literal, materialist definitions of memory that were becoming increasingly popular in Canada, such as in</text>

Liverpool Biennial2018 will be an extraordinary opportunity to be part of this extraordinary ecosystem. The Biennial will be a transient phenomenon, drawn to the city by its proximity to key transport hubs and the lucrative activities of its tourism industry. It will be a time to be present but invisible, yet embedded in the city's landscape with histories and texts that are shaped by its proximity. It will be a place to be discovered, yet completely inaccessible. It will be an art centre but also a ‘time to be made’ – a kind of urban laboratory, if you will. The answer to the first part of that equation is simple: the Biennial cannot be everywhere at once. It is much more useful when it is embedded in the city, as in the case of Liverpool, but even then it falls short</text>

If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s up to communities to take matters of urbanicity into their own hands. Creative action, whether it is the creation of a new skyline for a neighbourhood or the adaptation of an old one for a metropolis, is a response to the urban/suburban dichotomy. It is a way to imagine alternative futures for neighbourhoods where development has become pernicious and oppressive. Creative action can and should take place where development is illegal and unbalanced, where development is needed but can’t be rapid or uncontrolled, and where development is unwanted but unavoidable. Creative action cannot be made without political will, and the will to do so must be actively sought out and acquired. Creative action has to be made with eyes wide open for when it is needed most. Creative action has to be made with the active involvement of involved parties in order to achieve its effects.

That relationship needs to be explicitly negotiated between the two, and it certainly can’t be based on racial or national origin or gender. 	If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s up to communities to take matters of housing and infrastructure themselves. We need to be able to recognise when a project is good, and when it’s bad. This is why it is so critical that projects are proposed from diverse perspectives, and that they are reversible, making them good or providing them with alternative uses. If done right, such initiatives can give life back to abandoned or derelict spaces, places where creativity once flourished, places where art is once again often quoted as a necessity for the success of community projects, and places where artists can be given a voice in the decision to how those projects are going to be constructed. 	But let’s be real clear here: this isn’t some theoretical debate about the role of the artist in the city; this is a proposal that has been made very concrete and is being implemented in real life. The question is going to be: how do we as a community, as stakeholders in this exciting new technological juggernaut,</text>

That relationship needs to be explicitly negotiated between the two, and it certainly can’t be based on racial or national origin or gender. 	If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s up to communities to take matters of displacement on their own. This is why, every time there’s a major urban redevelopment project in the city, the artist-led initiatives get pushed back into the background, or relegated to low-profile status at best, and sometimes outright removed altogether. In the case of the New York Public Library’s Big Ben project, for instance, the artist was pushed back into the shadows by the city government, who cynically exploited its symbolic power to lock up large numbers of low-income residents in impoverished areas for decades, while the project itself languished in the past at best. 	New York City Council members, as well as mayoral candidates, have long been masters of this kind of urban shuffling. During the 1990s’s banner wave of development, for instance, many New Yorkers felt that the city was putting too much value on residential properties, and the arts were put at odds with that notion.

That relationship needs to be explicitly negotiated between the two, and it certainly can’t be based on racial or national origin or gender. 	If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s artists like ourselves who need to create new kinds of self-repairing mechanisms. We need to get artists involved in figuring out how to best utilize abandoned sites and refurbish those sites in ways that are productive and equitable, not for the benefit of a city that is increasingly reliant on foreign oil, but for the benefit of a city that is increasingly urbanized and globalized. This is going to require artists to step back and become involved in projects outside of the context of the city, and we need to encourage them to do that. It’s going to require a lot more negotiation than just being told what to do, but negotiation skills that are unique to artists are going to have to be honed and developed. 	Finally, there is the matter of displacement itself. We know that the future city is going to be dominated by the commuters, Gen Xers, and Boomers that are going to define its shape for many decades to come. In an ideal future city, not</text>

That relationship needs to be explicitly negotiated between the two, and it certainly can’t be based on racial or national origin or gender. 	If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s up to communities to take the initiative and create their own destinies. 	And if that happens, communities will likely need to negotiate other kinds of power and wealth flows, economic and otherwise, that can make or break a city’s future. If the current economic condition worsens, which seems to be gathering force, the city may need to raise taxes in order to fund essential services, such as policing and social services, while simultaneously cutting services in order to balance the budget. It is a delicate dance to extract essential services from underfunded social services, while maintaining a sufficient financial cushion to absorb those cuts. It is also a precarious dance to create new revenue streams through innovative contracting and innovative tax-preparation schemes, while simultaneously reducing funding for essential services, such as policing and social services. It is a delicate dance to attract investment through tax-deduction incentives and financial institutions while simultaneously drawing down that investment to fund essential services, such as policing and social services.

If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s up to communities to take matters of displacement into their own hands. It is up to communities to decide who is responsible for policing the infrastructures of their cities. It is up to communities to decide how their cultural assets are used. 	When we talk about infrastructures today, we often picture commercial infrastructures that are often based on the back of vulnerable or migrant populations, or on the back of emerging economies. But there is another kind of infrastructural development – conceptual infrastructuralism – that is growing in popularity in Europe and North America, and is actually the opposite of commercial. 	It is the kind of conceptual infrastructuralism that looks to the future, and works backwards from present conditions, in such a way that it ends up creating new possibilities for the future, not the other way around. It seeks to liberate space and destine possibilities, not for the future, in the present. This kind of conceptual infrast</text>

If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s up to communities to take matters of displacement into their own hands. Creative action must be planned for when such possibilities arise, and must be contingently reversible. That kind of flexibility is the difference between dream and reality. And it is the difference between co-constituted cities and the real thing. In other words, it is the difference between life and death.It seems completely insane to suggest that such radical change could come about through the smooth and slick administrative means of art institutions and the bureaucracy of the real world, but that is precisely what is happening all around us. The administrative state is made up of many layers and sub-regions, and as we saw with the Brexit vote, each layer is made up of histories and migrations and allegiances and politics that are constantly at work. So there is an opportunity cost to every move that is associated with the administrative state, and this is precisely what is being done in the UK and internationally now.

If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s up to communities to decide how to go about it. We need to be able to recognise when a project is ethically unjust, and we need to be able to override our desire to forgo future tax revenues in favor of the future needs of the city.  	There are many other potential partners for a mixed-use hub that would include hotels, restaurants, retail corridors and so on. But the most promising potential partner could be an artist-run cooperative. Creative Producer Partners could offer residencies at local galleries and museums, and the cooperative’s membership could grow in stages, inviting artists from around the country to contribute to the cooperative’s development through gallery tours, multimedia productions and so on. The cooperative could be run by an elected board of directors, with the artists recruited through an in-person or online application process.

It is a new kind of infrastructure, built to handle the information and data that is flooding in at an ever-increasing rate. And it is a new kind of society, built on data, whether that society is built on the back of fossil fuels, or on the back of virtual private networking, or what have you.In this technology-obsessed society, the artist is often the last person to recognize a project that is displacing her community, and vice versa. But as we saw in the case of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the artist is often the first to be displaced by developments that are either planned or constructed for a reason other than the usual urban need or desire. That relationship needs to be explicitly negotiated between the two, and it certainly can’t be based on racial or national origin or gender. 	If the city is to reclaim spaces and destinies, it’s up to communities to take matters of housing and infrastructure into their own hands. And there is no reason why communities can’t also take matters of their social structures and destinies into their own hands, using the technologies that are part of the social infrastructure as a platform to do so. 	But there is a danger that when those social structures are taken into their own hands, the new social arrangements that emerge are built on the back of the old, and not on the people’s, which is what the city is striving to achieve. If, in the recent past, we saw the emergence of what can be considered a dystopian social form in the wake of economic contraction, we can expect the emergence of what can be considered a just social form in the wake of information excess. It is vital that the social processes of the city be strategic in order to resist the temptation to create a new social form on the back of the old. 	The reason that the Standing Rock</text>

The Biennale’s proposal of institutionalisation through regulation was trialled in London in the form of a yearly fee schedule, ‘The Biennial’, in 2001 and 2003, and subsequently in the form of a biennial convention,  The International Biennale Biennale (2002) and the 28th edition of The International Biennale, to name only a few examples. It should be noted that the term ‘biennial’ refers not to a permanent institution but to a schedule of periodic, temporary or temporary institutions: not all biennials are created equal. The term ‘institution’ refers to a physical location and its collections, and the collection that comes with it.

The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration fell on deaf ears, not least because it put the curator at the centre of a political conflict with the city’s burgeoning black community. Undeterred, the Biennale launched a secret ballot of the local councillors, councillors from other local authorities and prominent citizens, asking whether any of them might be willing to sponsor a biennale in their area. The group was it was composed of art professionals, including Wangechi Mutu, Manolis Gerizimnatas and Dmitri Leshchinsky. The Biennale’s proposal that councillors create a district commission to oversee the development of the area through planning documents rather than the veto of the mayor was quickly rejected. The proposal fell on deaf ears, as were the rest of the district plans. But the Biennale’s subsequent investment in Croydon Central Park and its ecosystem through its partnership with Cheshire Nature Group and Natural England proved just as vital.

The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration fell on deaf ears, not least because it put the curator at odds with the local community: in the Biennale’s case, the local authority is apparently not even allowed to control the entry of artists.  The Tate Gallery, which staged the first Biennale in 1914, was split into two by the war, with exhibitions in different venues taking over sections of the gallery. The Biennale opened a year later, with exhibitions in different venues taking over the whole building. The main exhibition, Violence in Umm Al-Hiran,27 November 1915, featured two completely different takes on the same painting. As the caption tells us, the &quot;Précis de l’art  of the subject&quot; was transferred to the cover of a different document, which in turn tells us what the &quot;subject&quot; is.

The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration fell on deaf ears, not least because it put the curator in conflict with the local residents who constituted the core of the Biennale’s visitor base.  The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through the regulatory regime it established in England was untested, to put it mildly.  The Biennale’s proposal of regulation in France fell on deaf ears, likewise perhaps because it put the curator in conflict with the city’s residents who constituted the core of the Biennale’s visitor base.  The Le Devoir report, issued in 2006, was even more pessimistic, concluding that, since there was no evidence that the Biennale was a ‘presence’ in France, it could do nothing to foster tourism.  The report was dominated by voices from the urban elite of Paris, whose representatives, it was claimed, had established a biennial in Paris solely to avoid criticism from the city’s urban planners.

The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration fell on deaf ears, not least because it put the curator in conflict with the local community. The Biennale also lacked the institutional memory and political will to push the project forward.  The only voices of opposition coming from within the Biennale were coming from within the curatorial council. Undeterred, the Biennale embarked on a secret process of authorisation in an attempt to roll out the welcome mat for its open access journal Open House, to the extent that it would acknowledge its existence. The Biennale’s open access policy for non-fiction works stipulated that a  publication’s reception would be commissioned by the Biennial itself, not the museum. So the paradoxical situation of the Open House commission’s finding a way to publish a story in a journal that is explicitly about the Biennale without acknowledging its institutional relationship became the butt of much jeering within the local community. As a result, in 2002 the Biennale released an open letter it</text>

The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration fell on deaf ears, not least because it put the curator at the centre of the attraction’s rhetoric, contrasting sharply with the circumlocution of the Liverpool Biennial’s, written and directed by Peter Carr, for example. The proposal of inclusion through registration was rebuffed on the grounds that it placed the Biennale in conflict with the local authority, which is where the Biennale would have its first exhibition.9 It is true that, in the years immediately following the mid-1920s, a cadre of prominent artists were drawn from the burgeoning student body at Cambridge and the Royal College of Art, including Arthur Conolly, Edward Wadsworth, Mary Turner and Peter Brook. But these were artists who emerged later when the Biennale roster had expanded to include artists from other universities, and their work is often characterised as being driven by a combination of vanity and self-importance.10 It is also true that, between 1924 and 1930, the Bienn</text>

The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration fell on deaf ears, not least because it put the curator at the centre of decisions about where to locate the exhibition and the cultural district.  Biennials have a long and crucial relationship with their localities. During the twentieth century, the Biennial grew from strength to strength, reproducing the historical patterns of the hegemony of large-scale cultural systems, from the zoo to the museum, which in turn corresponded with the growth of the museum industry. The relationship between biennials and the museum became strategic, and the biennial as an exhibitionary form became the dominant form, dominant in its localities, in the main exhibitionary form (small scale public, congregated exhibitions). Biennials began to display the larger works in their portfolios, and the museum was created as a physical and virtual archive of the art they had shown in their cities. Circulation of the biennial was then thought of as a volume of cultural artefacts – a museum with a collection of works – and in this volume the museum was seen to be a collection of</text>

The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration fell on deaf ears, not least because it put the curator in direct conflict with the authorities, who viewed the institution as an extension of the military and repressive state. But the lack of interest in curatorial primacy in the Biennale’s early years notwithstanding, the notion that the curator is an essential element of any artistic or curatorial legacy – and that the institution should be run like a repressive military police state – is firmly rooted in the biennale’s present.   In a recent survey of biennales worldwide, I find myself firmly rooted in the cultural sector – particularly in the US and UK – although the claim is also gaining ground in China, Korea, Vietnam and other parts of the world. The biennale as an institution is hugely multi-faceted and multi-use – a staging ground for a number of different uses – and it is no exaggeration to suggest that some of its most iconic works are actually notations on postcards, such as those by the American artist Frank Lloyd Wright, whose</text>

The Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration fell on deaf ears, not least because it put the curator at the negotiating table with the local residents, politicians and other interested parties.  So the Biennale’s proposal of inclusion through registration was defeated by a combination of disillusionment and cynicism – by locals, at least, who felt sidelined by the increased arts and cultural opportunities roped in by the Biennial’s entry into the hub of the city.  And it is perhaps this cynicism that the Biennale organisers lacked in their early efforts. For one thing, as biennales become more institutionalised, more like exhibitions, and more like other exhibitionary forms, it is becoming ever more difficult to distinguish the genuine artist from the artist picked out by the curatorial gang – the latter was already becoming increasingly difficult.  The other thing is that the institutional curatorial drive to appear contemporary is being drowned out by the diffuse and malaise-inducing drive to get in touch with our cultural roots. The result is a vacuum that is filled by something that is very</text>

Museum collections are important for their historical curatorial value, but they are also essential for the technological culture of the future to develop, since it will determine how the social sciences and arts will interact. There is a clash of technologies at work here, which is part of a planetary dance that is increasingly visible in texts and images, but which is also part of a cultural ecology that is increasingly global in character. This new global cultural ecology is part of what I have in mind when I think about the curatorial, even when I do not know what a curatorial job is. It is part of what I call ‘the curatorial economy’.The curatorial economy is a social and political system that seeks to facilitate the activities of cultural entities in ways that are responsive to the specific institutional arrangements and political processes that create and foster the biennial. It is made up of a set of interrelated elements, among them: the museum, the curatorial, the arts administrators, the festival organisers, and the visiting artists. The core elements of this economy are the same, but different institutions and political processes shape the possible combinations of resources</text>

Museum collections are important for their historical curatorial value, but they are also essential for the technological culture of the future to develop, since it is here that the future looks to the past to inform future action. It is this future cultural ecology that has been described as being particularly vulnerable to the power of technology, which is being encouraged through the ‘science fiction’ of movies such as Brave New World and Terminator. It is tempting to attribute this new ‘strategy of art and science fiction’ to an awareness and fascination with dystopian futures and dystopian politics, but this is misleading. It is more accurate to say that this new ‘strategy of art and science fiction’ is being encouraged by the biennial, and the collections it aims to educate about the future. The biennial is not just any museum, and its mission is not just any curatorial gesture. Its character is defined more by its ability to collect things to show to people to remember, and to then tell another story with those things.

The museum is now the locus of action in this new information economy. Museum collections are important for their historical curatorial value, but they are also essential for the technological culture of the future to develop, since it will render these collections invisible if not actively navigable (as Apple’s Maps does today) – something that is clearly seen as an inherent ‘cultural’ quality of the digital self. This is evident in the extraordinary increase in the number of biennials being mounted in the form of large-scale exhibitions, both in the United States and internationally. The number of biennials is projected to treble in the foreseeable future, and the steady rise of the number of countries where biennials are held. The number of biennials held in any one location could be counted on one hand. The biennial is a worldwide cultural phenomenon with an impact on global aesthetics and geopolitics that goes beyond the site where it occurs. This aspect is of particular relevance in the twenty-first century, since the biennial is the contemporary and global counterpart of the museum, and the museum is the object of cultural exchange throughout the world.

Museum collections are important for their historical curatorial value, but they are also essential for the technological culture of the future to develop, since it will provide the basis for the technological culture to replace natural resources and create new jobs.

The biennial should be a globally visible phenomenon, and part of this inbuilt cultural capital of the future. But it is also a biennial in the same way that a gymnasium is a cultural capital of today, and part of what Benjamin Bratton would call a ‘the culture industry’ today. It is a globally recognizable entity with distinctive characteristics, a distinctive set of relationships to a particular time and place, and distinctive curatorial strategies.  And yet it is also an industry, and today, it is not just a collection of photographs and videos.

This is the cultural ecology of the post-Fordist society of the future, in which the museum is less a repository of knowledge and more a site of discovery.‘Knowledgeable members of the public’, as the biennial has come to be known, are those who can be reached and, if possible, befriended; those who can be trusted; and those who can be induced to visit a museum in exchange for something in return.‘These are the types of biennials that have recently been proposed (Berlin, Venice, Sao Paulo, Manila, and now Berlin) and are currently in development (New York and Taipei) for the following reasons: curiosity, interaction, learning and, most recently, anticipation.

The digital element of the biennial is palpable in art events, but these have also recently begun to adopt the technological ethos of the future – in the sense that events occurring now can and should be recorded and replicated. For biennials to become future-looking cultural institutions, they must become connected to the technological ethos of the future.This is the main task set for curators of the twenty-first century, and it is the reason why we are seeing an increasing number of biennials set in their present contexts, taking the present and adapting it to meet the needs of a cultural context in the twenty-first century. This is why biennials are becoming more contemporary and contemporary art events. It is also why biennials are becoming more art events.

The biennial is part of this technological future city, and its collections will play a critical role in the future of this city. This is why the biennial was originally conceived as a ‘triennial’ – a form of biennial that would simultaneously define the city as well as the art institution. In modern biennials, the art is transported to and from the museum, and the museum to and from the art world. This new technology of biennials is radically different from what we have in the modern museum, and what we have historically, in that it is not possible for the art to grow outside the museum walls, and thus, the art world as a whole, to absorb the cultural impact of the city. The art world is now much more exposed to the cultural flow of the city, and thus much less able to adapt its art forms to this new, technologically</text>

Museum collections are important for their historical curatorial value, but they are also essential for the technological culture of the future to develop, since it will represent a record of the world through images and data, and will most certainly become a platform on which art and artists will engage in this new economy of images and symbols. How to Know About Art's Future 	Art’s current predicament is a consequence of a system that increasingly depends on digital media for its content, and which produces and depends on it in important ways. In these circumstances, it is easy to write off contemporary art as an aesthetic wasteland, or even a kind of aesthetic tyranny. But this is not true of all art forms. Modern and contemporary art forms share a problematic quality, which is characteristic of them: a tendency to materialize, to processes of increasing virtuality by which art is made visible in the service of a function in which it is not in possession. This tendency is most evident in the contemporary art of the Gilded Ghetto, but it is also evident in lesser-known contemporary art, and it is also evident in art today that is conceptual,</text>

Museum collections are important for their historical curatorial value, but they are also essential for the technological culture of the future to develop, since it will represent a record of what has been photographed. This is the cultural ecology of the future ‘a world where images are not just symbols but are computations performed on a massive scale’.4 This future will be culturally mediated, but its cultural ecology will be mediated by machines. If we do not anticipate the profound changes that will be wrought by information technologies, we will make grave mistakes in our projections of the future. We need to create mechanisms through which cultural goods, including images, may be gathered and distributed in a future culturally mediated by machines, but we also need mechanisms that read the meaning of cultural images and convey this to interested parties. This is the second part of my three-part essay in The New Inquiry, Future City, where I explore the relationship between curatorial and artificial intelligence.In Part One, I reflect on the biennial as a cultural form in the age of the biennial; and in Part Two, I begin to sketch out some of the issues that may</text>

The curators therefore turned to a second audience: art teachers and the employed art libraries in the area. These were people with a clear interest in art and art history but no political or social agenda. They came armed with knowledge about the art they might encounter in the local artworlds but little else. For the next stage of the curatorial process, a staff writer and editor were brought in to edit the journal Art as Media, a project that sought to capture the idiosyncratic character of art as a practice in the area. This was seen by many as a step back and, for the most part, a step too far. But the curators understood that the journal would have to be edited in order to put into practice. They were keen that the journal be flexible and could be used again and again. The curatorial reconfiguration Art as Media became what it is today: a publication of record that documents the curatorial process, the thinking of the artist and the organisation that produced and commissions art from start to</text>

The curators therefore turned to a second audience: art professionals with a mandate to work in the local community. These were people like myself, who had a background in community development but were now providing expertise and support to artists who were developing projects in the area but who had their own backgrounds and credentials to draw upon. With this audience, the project moved from the local to the global. In the case of the Liverpool Biennial, the audience was made up of artists, curators, art writers, academics and others with a mandate to promote the art in the area while also stimulating local creativity. The audience for the other biennials was made up of administrators, curators, journalists and others with a mandate to influence the cultural behaviour of the area. The audience for the Liverpool Biennial 2016 was provided by the Biennial itself, the Scottish Biennial, the Italian and Spanish Cultural Centres, and others.  So the question that remained was what could the biennial do in the area that the local community could not? The answer to</text>

The curators therefore turned to a second audience – themselves local residents and artists – for guidance in the event of a possible return. Here they found support from the local community through their local art collective, who provided feedback as to the appropriateness of the art being made in their area. The curators also sought feedback from the art world at large on the prospect of hosting a biennial in their area, and from within their own local community through the Local Curator network. Finally, the artists themselves sought out and engaged with a range of stakeholders within the local community via social media, discussing the prospects and expectations of the event – stakeholders who could potentially have a stake in shaping the destiny of their area.  The conversation  The biennial has long been a project in itself; its roots are in the 1920s in New York and the late 1940s in London. In recent decades, as biennials proliferated in many cities across the world, art professionals increasingly turned to the occasion as a client; in some cases, the interests</text>

The need for this was compounded by the fact that, following the Manchester Bombing, the Biennial was forced to suspend its planned visit to Turkey due to the threat it posed to public safety. The curators therefore turned to a second audience: art institutions in Turkey. They worked closely with Istanbul-based ARD TV to present the event in a way that would allow the local population to fully participate, while also highlighting the increasing institutional racism and xenophobia contained within the institution. While this plan seemed noble at the time, it is now evident that the project was neither visionary, feminist or ecumenical in its intent. It served a very narrow institutional interest. The curators, including Trevor Mills, were not interested in envisioning a future for their community, but in creating a museum that would house their past works and act as a repository for their ethnographic work. This second audience also provided a different kind of agency. While the museum would likely house the curatorial agenda, it would also house and function as a kind of laboratory for the art that would come after, providing a platform for future artists to experiment with these kinds of cultural utilisation. For this to happen, artists had to be artists. For this to happen,</text>

The need for this was compounded by the fact that, following the Manchester Bombing, the Biennial was forced to suspend its planned visit to Turkey due to the threat it posed to public safety. The curators therefore turned to a second audience: art students and artists who might be interested in participating in the project but were not placed in a position of power or influence. This second audience was made up of students from the Biennial 2017 and 2018, as well as artists who were invited from other institutions to participate in the short experiment.All three audiences were invited to participate in what they described as a ‘time-limited’ experiment in radical transparency. By revealing their true intentions, they established a relationship with the object of their desire: the Biennial. The audience was invited to engage with the narrative of the exhibition through written and oral narratives, as well as the curatorial pronouncements of the event. Their narratives were not to be taken literally or attributed to them. For instance, the narrative of the bombing in Manchester was intended to be read by a public that was largely passive viewers, who instead of passively taking part in a political and social conflict, would be helped to act politically by witnessing a cinematic depiction of the conflict.</text>

The need for this was compounded by the fact that, following the Manchester Bombing, the Biennial was forced to suspend its planned visit to Turkey due to the threat it posed to public safety. The curators therefore turned to a second audience: art-world patrons. Although patrons had a right to know what art was being made in the area, they also had a right to be entertained by art and be entertained by art wherever that art was being made. The curators hoped that the establishment of a local audience, which could then override patrons’ control, would enhance the potential of the local artworld to resist attempts to decimate it. The audience for the Liverpool Biennial was to come not from the art world but from other communities in the area: young people, artists, musicians, community organisers and others who might be interested in art from a different perspective.The audience for the Liverpool Biennial was primarily made up of people from the surrounding areas, although there were also people from the Biennial who visited from faraway places. As the exhibition was moved from the main exhibition venues to some community centres, it was decided that there should be space in the venues for around 200 community members or so.

The need for this was compounded by the fact that, following the Manchester Bombing, the Biennial was forced to suspend its planned visit to Turkey due to the threat it posed to public safety. The curators therefore turned to a second audience – local young people – as a case study. As a case study, this meant considering how to engage a large, urban, largely passive young person (under the age of twenty-one) who might otherwise be drawn to the flashy art and culture of the places being explored. This audience was an ideal candidate because it was large, urban and largely passive. It provided the context, the audience, for the project, and thus the project itself, to be able to function in a way that was not defined by the artist. By engaging this audience, the curators hoped to open up a dialogue with the young people on the local level, and thus the project’s success.The second audience was selected through an open call focused on 'culture and engagement'. This was a group of people with diverse levels of education, lifestyles and cultural experiences. They were drawn from the arts, education, health, employment and youth programmes of the local authority, with representatives from cultural organisations from all over the</text>

The need for this was compounded by the fact that, following the Manchester Bombing, the Biennial was forced to suspend its planned visit to Turkey due to the threat it posed to public safety. The curators therefore turned to a second audience: art professionals with a mandate to connect the art with the city’s infrastructure and infrastructure recourses. These were primarily concerned with how the art was generated and delivered in the area, but also with the administrative burden placed on the artist to connect with the infrastructure and publics that were being used to construct the biennial. These professionals included representatives from the Biennial, the gallery sector, local authorities, museums and local youth organisations. The aim of the engagement was to find a way to engage with the biennial in a way that was not tied to the institution’s historical interest in infrastructure. By doing so, the curators hoped to attract artists who would work in an infrastructure way, but were also to develop artists who would work in a different way.The engagement processThe three-day event, which took place in October 2016, was a response to the Manchester Bombing.

The need for this was compounded by the fact that, following the Manchester Bombing, the Biennial was forced to suspend its planned visit to Turkey due to the threat it posed to public safety. The curators therefore turned to a second audience – local residents and community organisers – to help create the narrative of the event. This was done in part by using the phrase ‘mock-up’ – a term usually associated with cheap knock-offs – but also by incorporating the phrase ‘asset locks’ – a concept that describes the physical characteristics of objects – or, in the case of mock-ups, the person (or organisation) who produced them. These traits included the simplicity of their packaging, the homogenisation of function, and the substitution of one material for another. The key to these three-dimensional wares was in fact their appearance: what made them mock-ups in the first place was due to the fact that art is often conceptualised as being physically impossible – something which is almost always predicated on an artist's conception of the impossible.So, there the biennial curators found an audience – young and old, urban and rural, artists and curators alike.

The need for this was compounded by the fact that, following the Manchester Bombing, the Biennial was forced to suspend its planned visit to Turkey due to the threat it posed to public safety. The curators therefore turned to a second audience: art-historical and biographical reference works such as articles in art journals such as the one that accompanied the first Venice Biennale, or the articles in contemporary art books. These two sets of texts act as a reference for the local community and the curator’s subsequent discussions with local residents and art-historical documents. The local resident audience is invited to engage with and influence these texts through a hands-on project that will be produced in association with the exhibition. Local artists, art-historians and art-lenders are invited to participate in this project. The project itself is an art-project with a local context that engages with the notions of ownership, influence and power, as well as the practices of resistance and community.The project itself is a collaborative effort between Biennale, The Biennale, 2016.

So I turned to the city and the Biennial, which both had a stake in the development of the canal, or in its development as a commercial enterprise. The Arts Council had a general aim to encourage artists to work on the canal, while the Biennial had a particular interest in supporting artists from the area. The idea was to create a network of artists working in tandem to produce new work on the canal, while the Liverpool Biennial would produce a series of works that would be displayed in the building for the first three years.The plan was for the first phase to produce about 20 works, while the second phase would produce about 60 works. So the total number of works produced in the first year would be about what the planners had envisaged. The challenge then became how to support the development of the works in the second and third years, while also supporting the artists who produce the works in the early years. The answer to this was to find creative ways to collectively buy the works and make them available for purchase throughout the city. The purchase of the works and their purchase through a fee was viewed with suspicion by many people in the Biennial</text>

So I turned to the city and the Biennial, which both had a stake in the development of the canal, or in its development as a commercial asset, or in any way connected to its development as an asset. So it became a very interesting and collaborative process, with the Biennial managing the development of the canal through its foundations commissioning, its plans for the architecture exhibition, and the development of the business – which included the development of a business plan.The next step was for the artists to come and collaborate in the development of the canal through mural painting, landscape architecture, and even just by being around it a lot. There was a phase when the canal was a fully autonomous project, but now that phase is over and the city has taken over much of the site. So the artists had to find a way to co-exist in this new world. The challenge was to find ways to engage with the city without becoming a master of its mechanisms. The Biennial managed this by setting up a collaborative agreement with the city council to donate half the proceeds from the artworks to the Biennial’s operating costs, while the other</text>

So I turned to the city and the Biennial, which both had a stake in the development of the canal, or in its development as a commercial real-estate development. So the Biennial got involved, as did the heritage organisations. At the same time, other local artists joined in too, and the painting collections at the Museé de L’Aiguilette were expanded. Later, the Biennial created a new division, the   	National Portrait Gallery, which houses the majority of the paintings in the building. The NPG also started an art fund, the Diamine – or the gift – fund, and an art producer called ARCH. Art flows easily through the Diamine fund, which is linked to a local art market, and the ARCH fund, which is linked to an international art market. So the paintings that were being made at the time, the new generation of artists, were getting their ideas from ARCH, and their ideas from ARCH.These ideas were then passed on to the next generation of artists, who then created new artworks, that were also passed on to</text>

So the Biennial, which is an arts organisation, and which also happens to be a major funder of the Liverpool Biennial, and which every year sponsors the entire show, was naturally going to have a stake in the development of the canal.I asked the artists to find a way to engage with the idea of the exhibition as a way of thinking, rather than as an object of contemplation. For Bjork, there’s a difference between the architecture that’s created by the canal and the architecture of other places. For example, the Biennial’s commissioned works often stray into the realm of visualisation, and its collection of objects often includes things that are purely decorative. But in its long-term vision, there’s a way of thinking that’s distinct from that of other cultural institutions. As Bjork says, ‘the Biennial has a specific, long-term vision.’[1]The important thing about the</text>

So they all met in a hotel lobby in Liverpool and asked each other to back the canal gallery.So the Biennial and the Arts Council joined forces and created a new organisation called the Liverpool and Northern Powerhouse Council. The planners’ utopian vision was that the powerhouse would be a collective, diverse group of organisations able to come together and co-produce ideas, through collaborative projects, such as planting trees or creating a garden, or in the case of Liverpool’s burgeoning seaside industry, tourism. The key to the group’s success would be its ability to communicate and work through shared concerns, and the power to initiate and manage such projects. So the planners’ utopian vision for the powerhouse was realised, and the ugly but essential parts incorporated into a new form. The key is now the members of the group, who are able to come to the meetings, and to take part in the decisions that have a real impact on the city.</text>

The idea was to create a space where people could gather, exchange, and discover together.I started by creating a map of Liverpool. It’s a city in and around a canal, so it’s both familiar and different, yet the same. But it was difficult to find a good map of Liverpool because there’s so much traffic. So I created a 90-day itinerary, which became the basis of a new series of paintings.The next step was to find funding to start a gallery. I approached the Arts Council, the heritage charities, and the Biennial, but none of them had any interest in supporting a gallery. So I turned to the city and the Biennial, which both had a stake in the development of the canal, or in its development as a commercial venture. So they all met in a room at the NEC and came to a decision: this is the direction we need to go. The Biennial will develop the gallery space, while the Arts Council will control the use of the building. The votes were in favour of the Biennial’s proposal: the Arts Council has the final say. The city gets a discount on the building because it’s a large organisation: the Biennial will build a new biennial in Liverpool, and the Arts Council will have a management role in the future.The money raised through Kickstarter was used to buy the building, renovate it, and start a new generation of artists’ residencies in the building. Now the building is a gallery again, and a hub for artists’ new projects. There’s a sense of community activity around the building, which is cool; the noise it makes is bad, but that’s part of being a Londoner. The Biennial</text>

So I turned to the city and the Biennial, which both had a stake in the development of the canal, or in its development as a commercial entity. They all agreed that the painting would go ahead regardless, but they had different ideas about what the gallery should be. The Arts Council wanted a regular exhibition of arts activity in the canal, while the Biennial wanted a regular, biennial, so it’s a sort of inverse situation. The Biennial is more active on the inside, whereas the city is more confined. In the middle is where the artist’s conception of the canal meets the city’s reality. There’s a tension there that can be provocative or distasteful, but at some point the artist has to say, ‘Enough is enough. I’m tired of this cordon sanitaire.’ The artist had to decide which reality to expose. With the painting, she could have chosen to expose all of London’s art to the public, as a way to generate cultural change and stir a debate. But that would have exposed the art to the vagaries</text>

So I turned to the city and the Biennial, which both had a stake in the development of the canal, or in its development as a commercial enterprise. The Arts Council had a mini-constitution, so it had a say in a development that was very much influenced by the Co-operative movement. The Biennial had a full-fledged cultural organisation, so it had a say in the development of the building as a narrative and in the way it was constructed. So the Arts Council and the Biennial both saw this as a potential conflict. I see now that the Arts Council was already thinking about redeveloping Anfield, and so the Biennial had already started working on plans for the site. So the conflict between the two organisations wasn’t as great as I imagined it to be. And so the Biennial and the Arts Council were forced to come to an understanding.This was a difficult process, because the conflict between the two didn’t map perfectly to what I imagined it would be like. I imagined a situation in which the Arts Council and the Biennial had to come to an understanding, and so the Biennial</text>

So all three organisations were kept out of the picture.The next step was to get the bank to sponsor a gallery. So the paintings we did had to pass the art review board, which was made up of artists. And they were all given a biennial budget, which was all about distribution. The biennial budget was just about buying a large number of paintings and renting them out. The Biennial budget was about distribution – buying the paintings and making sure they're distributed. And so the distribution happened in two stages: the paintings were bought and distributed by the biennial, and then the distribution was organised by the arts council (the local partners in the biennial). The distribution committee meetings were held in the arts council building, so artists and arts organisations could get involved. And so the paintings we did have at the time – which we did, in a small way, through volunteering – became a way to connect with the community, to show our work, and to find out what</text>

They all agreed to put money towards a gallery, but the Biennial didn’t want to put money towards an exhibition. So I did the other charity walks and events and framed the whole thing as a fundraising exercise. The money raised through the paintings and fundraising went into a fund that supported the gallery, but the Biennial also wanted to use the money to do other things. So the partnership was almost destroyed in the process of making the money-making enterprise, but once the funding was there, the Biennial started to do other things, like commissioning architects and building, and the artists started to live there full-time.The result is a project that has a life of its own, and a set of distinctive characteristics. The name Biennial is a misnomer, because it’s now become what it was before: a biennial, a sort of global icon of the art form. It</text>
