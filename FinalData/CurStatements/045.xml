She was Britain’s first female Prime Minister and became the first female politician to seek a Westminster seat. She was defeated by John Major in a 1981 election, but her victory is widely regarded as a turning point in British politics and society. She is often credited with bringing about a rethink of the country’s place in the world, especially after the suicide of Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s Vice President and the aggressor in the Iran-Iraq War. During her premiership, she oversaw the privatisation of Britain’s ports and railways, along with the nationalisation of large corporations, and promoted racial and economic integration.

She proposes a ‘twenty-eighth Century’ in which the world is made up of more and more, where ‘culture’ becomes more and more integrated into the organisational form of the economy’.3 	[3] 	The logic of economic growth is this: more commodities are produced and traded, more people live longer, fuller and richer lives – in other words, the more we sell the same commodity, the less it costs to produce and to consume.

But then comes the inevitable breakdown down to the sector – which is always, inevitably, the last to be fixed – and then the political will behind it all. But that is always the last to be fixed – unless you’re John Key. Then it’s the economy, stupid.

She and her fellow travellers opened up a can of worms that could not be kept closed any longer. She was a catalyst, a catalyst of sorts who could have any number of ideas that could be brought together to form a new idea, but instead she catalyzed a swarm of other thinkers to form a new idea that in turn changed the world. Her ideas have been shared and circulated far and wide, and today they are standard issue in every museum and research centre in the world. She is rightly called an influence, but she is also rightly credited with the discovery and formulation of the idea. She did not invent the idea, but she did say ‘This is what I've always wanted.’ She also said ‘I've never been more at peace’.She also said ‘I’m not going to become famous.

She also opened the way to a more expansive discussion of how people organise themselves in relation to their urban environments, beyond the boundaries of the museum or the small scale of individual engagements. The curatorial approach to community might be seen as a metaphor and socio-political system that is constantly reshaping how we inhabit and inhabit each other. This is the world we inhabit, and we have to negotiate the aspects of its symbolic, physical and metaphoric construction in order to understand it. In this sense, the curatorial as an institution might be seen as a catalyst and enabler of the sharing economy, which is now displacing the museum as the primary space for contemplation and interaction in our cities.The other precursory reading of the biennale was provided by the text  	The Collectors, written by Sigmund Freud, who ‘rear-ends?’ the biennale with his psychoanalysis of the collective unconscious.

She also opened the way to a more expansive discussion of how people organise themselves in relation to their urban environments, how social, economic and political forms intersect in the creation of urban change. In other words, she was a theorist, but she also did a great job of pointing people to specific situations and suggesting possible outcomes. She was a visionary and a walking contradiction. She said what people didn’t want to hear, but she also had the ear of governments, property developers and other powerful vested interest groups who needed to be told what to do. How to Envision a Future City  (JL) / (Flickr: Nadine Attewell)When: May 2018.

She also opened the way to a more expansive discussion of how people organise themselves in relation to their urban environments, and how that might intersect with other kinds of work. It would not only mark a shift in attitude but one that seeks to address a deeper, more fundamental question: what kinds of relations between public and urban space are there? How do we create new kinds of urban environments? She also suggested ways to begin to imagine those kinds of spaces, and to engage in the politics of space that are implicit in the processes of urbanisation in a way that is not reductive, but that is capable of providing new kinds of inhabitation.

She also opened the way to a more expansive discussion of how people organise themselves in relation to their urban environments and the urban fabric of Britain. For many people, the appearance, the ‘face of Britain’, of a museum or a gallery was all that was required to make visible the urban fabric of Britain, and the way in which their urbanisation projects were all about creating a public space where people ‘actually live’. But for others, and I include myself in that ‘great majority’ of people reading this, the museum or the gallery was all that was sufficient to make visible the urban fabric of Britain. In these people’s eyes, there was still a need for a cultural organisation like Black-E, NOMAD or Creative Time to lend a presence and identity to the city, but for these people the question was much more fundamental: how to make the cultural organisation that they had in mind for the city actually happen?

She also opened the way to a more expansive discussion of how people organise themselves in relation to their social worlds, and the ways in which art can play a role in facilitating that integration. She did this through three elements of her thinking: the theatre, the street  and the museum. One of her greatest works Curtains from 2002 is a masterpiece of the integrated social. It shows a cityscape in transition, with people making everyday adjustments as different forms of government and local authorities try to put a city together again after a disaster or disaster. The work is a statement on the power of symbolic and figurative forms of assembly. It is a hybrid work, a performance piece and a architectural survey. It was exhibited in the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  Its conception of the city as a huge complex of interdependent parts called the Broadway of the World led her to other questions about how we inhabit it and how we imagine our futures in it.

The curatorial agenda has been shaped by institutional pressures in a particular direction. But she did see the institutionalised tendency towards spatialisiation as a process that needs to be confronted. She did not, however, see a solution on the horizon that would result in a transformative effect on the way in which space is constituted and used. In fact, she did not know whether or not such change would result in the organisational changes that are required to radically alter how space is used. In the end, she concluded that the job of the curator is to produce experiences that are as exciting as possible, and to that end ‘sheer zinger’ in her lectures.

One such form is the installation, which is increasingly common in public museums and for-profit venues. Its arrival coincided with the rise of social media, which allowed this type of installation to take on a life of its own, becoming a place where images, stories and ideas intersect. This occurred not only with the proliferation of Twitter but with the advent of blogs, videos and podcasts, which all report on the same events, but also with the proliferation of non-profit hubs that sprang up all over the country. By the end of the century, the curatorial project would be a thing of the past, replaced by social media and the sharing economy.Stagecoach and her fellow travellers revealed a state of mind about the symbolic, physical and metaphoric construction of buildings and public spaces; the way people inhabit and inhabit space. She also opened the way to a more expansive discussion of how people organise themselves in relation to their urban environments, how we might approach the curatorial as a platform for such organising. For many artists, the role of the curatorial was not merely to exhibit a place or set of things but also to make it possible for people to find and embrace those things. The role of the curatorial has shifted from simply hosting to one of initiating, enabling and organising, and it is this new curatorial mode that they call ‘cultural reproduction’. The curatorial is a new kind of facilitator, enabling the artist to shape what is meant by ‘the public’ in ways that are neither static nor predetermined. It is this new curatorial mode that also makes the contemporary art museum different from all other kinds of art historical curatorial accounts. It does so by enabling the curatorial account to assume a more powerful, influential and influential position. In this new curatorial mode, the museum no longer represents an idealised or idealised past, but rather represents an idealised or</text>

She also opened the way to a more expansive discussion of how people organise themselves in relation to their own embodied movements. For many artists, the introduction of new technologies and the cultural perversion of their work is a necessity. But although some artists were more active than others in bringing about these changes, they all shared a common commitment to archiving, preserving and interpreting the history of art and architecture as it relates to their chosen field of work. In the field of archiving and preserving, the interest and the obsession with documentation catch-up with the proliferating of artworks and artefacts, which is seen as essential in unlocking the latent cultural resources of the past. One could argue that the curatorial is often held up as an exemplar of artistic practice, but in the last decade it is becoming increasingly evident that not all the story, not all the metaphor, not all the archival evidence is telling us the whole story. As Elizabeth Grosz explains in her book Art’s Collision Course, the artworld is becoming less religious in character, less focused on the work as</text>

This is particularly true in predominantly African-American and Latino neighbourhoods, where involvement is common despite the fact that these neighbourhoods account for one-tenth of the US population. As a result, historically low-income neighbourhoods are often left to fend for themselves, vulnerable to the whims of market forces and the power of the purse.  In addition, many historically low-income neighbourhoods are located in and around educational districts, which are predominantly run by for-profit companies: these districts are the epicentre of postsecondary education growth in the US and are home to significant proportions of graduates – people with degrees from postsecondary institutions but no business or management degrees. Increasingly, these high-quality vocational schools are being used to train management consultants, data scientists and others with an interest in how knowledge is produced and communicated across diverse settings.  A key question for further research is what kinds of political and economic tools are being put to use</text>

This is a global phenomenon that can no longer be ignored and, as a result, new forms of labour are emerging to fill gaps and create value for the web companies. In many cases, these forms of labour are created via the use of social media, such as blogging, and can be used to gain access to previously restricted knowledge or connect to previously unconnected knowledge. The rise of blogging as a media-rich form of cultural practice raises important questions about the democratic potential of previously restricted knowledge, the limits of authority, and the possibilities for creative resistance. How do we allocate scarce public resources and assume responsibility for the knowledge that is produced? How do we reconcile the responsibility to ensure knowledge reaches critical mass with the responsibility to ensure that it is of value? How do we make knowledge shared and understandable? How do we create collaborative and equitable online environments through research collaborations? How do we ensure that knowledge reaches critical</text>

Today, these kinds of collaboration are often referred to as ‘regionalisation’. It is significant to mention, however, that the development of infrastructure or a facility based on it is often accompanied by a ‘soft’ hand, either financial or ‘infrastructure-specific skills development. Therefore it is not just historical figures who can be relied upon to lend a hand in such a way; local planners, politicians and others with a vested interest in the regionisation of economies can also be relied upon to put systems in place that</text>

Updating the history books can help us understand how these historically disenfranchised communities are re-enacting their participation in historically high levels in order to challenge the systems that are driving the current economic and social crisis.  As a first step, we can examine what historically low-income communities have in common with today's predominantly white, urban poor. In fact, it is striking how similar the two are to the urban poor in terms of their consumption patterns, lifestyles, and consumption-related behaviours. For example, the rapid growth of social media and app-based consumption is paralleled by an increased reliance on mapping and location-based services – services that draw on massive databases and collect vast amounts of data on people’s movements – as a tool for economic exploitation. Despite the fact that the web is an ever-present presence on people’s screens, little is said about how the</text>

How to Know About Them 	Knowledge of the past is power. Unfortunately, power tends to be abused and new technologies tend to make us more vulnerable. But there are also lessons to be learned from the past, and here too the past is a fertile field for the future to be forged. There are lessons about the fragility of human relationships to be learned from the past, and also lessons about the power structures that can be repurposed to serve new purposes. 	Knowledge, then, is an inherently resourceful practice, and it is this aspect</text>

He tells the story of how a young Sikh American named Avtar Singh Panchi boarded a Greyhound bus bound for New York City and was accosted by a cab driver who asked if he was Sikh. Panchi replied that he was not, and was promptly accosted by another cab driver who asked if he was Sikh.

We could also argue that the growing importance of access to arts resources in urban environments would mean that the arts would no longer be confined to the shores of coastal cities but would have a presence in rural and remote locations. We could speculate that in the age of the Internet of Things, cities might become less homogenous, with neighbourhoods providing links between resources. We could even imagine such councils replacing the large urban centres with smaller, more mobile ones</text>

In an effort to understand these actors better, many localities are now conducting user-initiated participatory design studies in an effort to identify promising local practices that can be replicated at a regional or international scale. While many localities are now conducting user-initiated participatory design studies, others, such as Oxford and Cambridge, have taken the initiative and are developing collaborative design programs with local universities and other relevant partners. It is important to note that many of these partnerships between localities and non-profit web sites have a social purpose – sharing knowledge, pointing local communities to resources, inviting collaborations – but they are often engaged in business ventures that have a political purpose, such as voter registration or education initiatives. It is also important to note that not all collaboration between the non-profit and the public sectors is collaborative at best and often adversarial, and that some of the larger non-profit</text>

One can only imagine what these vendors selling online services for buildings, homes and infrastructure might do in the future. Such potential  	is consistent with the assumption that the distributed and connected society we inhabit will inevitably become entangled in a complex web of mutual modes of exchange that will offer significant benefits to no one at the cost of significant costs to others. Nevertheless, historically low-income communities continue to struggle to find worthwhile projects that exceed the remit of the projects themselves. A growing body of research suggests that the 	value creation generated by distributed and connected technologies is shared equally between the local and the national actors involved. For this reason, relatively new  	start-ups are often instigated by people from relatively low-income backgrounds, often in the mistaken belief that they can emerge by leveraging low-income resources.

If these strategies do not engage the people best placed to engage with the information and knowledge in these websites, or to understand the context in which they are presented, but rather rely on the people recruited as employees, students, community organisers or volunteers, then the potential outcomes for these people may be as diverse as the online communities themselves.  In the case of a biennial generally, its resources are either used to support the participation of a growing cadre of invited artists or absorbed back into the organisations that construct and promote the biennial itself. The failure to respond to these concerns generally leads to resentment and conflict. Nevertheless, biennials have responded to specific concerns about their resources and practices.

The inroads that art and the environment were making towards a more sustainable future were as inevitable as the emergence of AI was predicted.Art and the environment have been at odds for a very long time. The relationship between them is complicated, nuanced and full of surprises. The best way to understand and appreciate a piece of art is to experience it for yourself, by making it part of a larger narrative that includes the surrounding landscape and communities, in a way that is rich and dynamic and allows the viewer to move through the site, often unknowingly stepping into unexplored territory.  	The origins of the Skunk Works project are a story that has been told many times over. It started as a small, personal project with artist Sandy Dirksen, a local resident who had started  	Aurora Art Trust, which promoted environmental awareness and engagement. Over time, the trust grew to include artists from around the world, and over time it moved to being a multi-disciplinary group of artists, designers, writers and architects. Over</text>

The inroads that art and the environment were making towards understanding the other were profound. But as far as the future was concerned, there was a problem with the inroads being made at the moment of the event, namely, the massive and increasingly influential industrial infrastructure of the biennale. Precisely because the biennale had become so globalised, and the art collectors and commercial art collectors had become part of the mix, the future and the present in which the biennale was embedded meant that there was little sense of place or history left to speak of. 	Art was put to better uses. It was put to undertaking ‘navigational studies’, which were to a large extent historical works, in order to map human coastal voyages and the currents of history, and in particular, to map the voyages of the circumnavigating whalers. These studies were then put to work in order to map new voyages and adventures, and the currents of economic and social life in order to generate</text>

In a nutshell,  	however, the relationship between art and the environment began to be understood as fundamentally entwined, and as a consequence the connections between the two were not as straightforward as they are today. The inroads that art and the environment were making into the social and spatial landscape were as inevitable as the progress of human civilisation. The issue that art and the environment were making into was  	environmentalism’s emphasis on the necessarily imperfect and ambivalent side of the social and the cultural landscape. The revolution that art was bringing to the social and the spatial was itself the product of a social and political revolution. The language of the social and the cultural was being redefined in ways that would make it easier for artists to engage with the possibilities of social and cultural change. The impact of this redrawing of the language of the socially marginal and exploited was profound. 	The pedagogical and curatorial turn in the art and design milieu was itself a social and political project.

The inroads that art and the environment were making towards imagining and being able to envision a future in which the biosphere and art would work in complementary ways are as valuable as the outcroppings and buildings of the old colonial infrastructure. This is why, when the Duke Ellington Center for Art was first proposed to the local community, the local residents in the area rallied so strongly in opposition, as well as why the local artists and arts community rallied so strongly in support. The art and cultural institutions in the area felt that the proposed art institution would be a distraction from the jobs and housing crisis that were undermining the area, and would in fact be hindering the efforts of the local artists and arts community to create new experiences and new ways of inhabiting the decaying infrastructure of the area. The local residents in the center were divided on how best to engage the art institution and the local residents in the area in a way that would generate local engagement, but they all had in common that they were trying to figure out together how to stop the</text>

The inroads that art and the environment were making towards a more sustainable future were being undermined at an alarming rate, and it was becoming increasingly difficult for the arts community to maintain its commitment to the future of the planet. 	The opening of Skunk Works marked a turning point in the community’s development, and it seems that the exhibition had something to do with that. The opening of Skunk Works coincided with the launch of the Trustees report, which was tabled by then. Curator Irene Hofmann, who is now at the New Museum in New York, and who curated the Trustees report, states categorically that she did not commission the work herself, but felt compelled to bring it forward as a result of reading the report. She concluded that the future of the planet was in fact in doubt, and that there was a case to be made for a curatorial intervention in the future of the planet. She also concluded that there was no future for the future of the biosphere in the cities, and</text>

In a nutshell,  	however, the relationship between art and the environment began to be understood as fundamentally entwined, and as a consequence the connections between the two were not as straightforward as they are today. The inroads that art and the environment were making into the social landscape were being challenged by the forces of capitalism, and so the pedagogical and curatorial practices of the local community were being challenged as well. The local community would play a leading role in the education of artists and the wider public as to the organisation and intentions of art in the context of community. 	If the arts were to survive this new economy and society were to be formed, it is imperative that the arts be seen as a social enterprise that is responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and as such must respond to the needs and interests of the wider public. 	The pedagogical and curatorial approaches of the arts in the 1990s could be seen as an ideal continuation of the progressive practices of the 1960s and the 1970s, when art and the environment were seen as a potential way to address a multitude of social  	issues of the city.

The inroads that art and the environment were making towards understanding and concern for the future of the biennale were not being seen as a result of community action but as a result of a collaborative process between the different art institutions and the different communities that were part of the community. What was being made was seen as a possible and valuable contribution to the task at hand, and in a public art context this meant finding creative ways of engaging with the art that was being made in the area, while helping those communities which might be less well-placed or not well-informed in the art of the area. Art was used as a tool for community control, and in this sense the community as a whole was being actively engaged in the art of the city at large. This was seen as a necessary change from the past, and although the institutions that were being created were ostensibly there to support the artists and their creative endeavours, there was a sense that their true purpose was to serve and serve the community in ways that are not always obvious and which</text>

The inroads that art and the environment were making towards understanding the other were significant, but were not enough to reverse the cultural  	force that had for some decades been shaping the landscape of the planet. 	Art and the environment have, of course, continually been at odds.  	In 2015,  	an art collective called the Red Fort announced that they were ceasing operations due to declining membership. The Red Fort’s board of directors included people with a wide range of perspectives, including artists, curators, architects and writers. Some people left, but many others stayed on to form community boards and formed  	design and architecture firms. Since the announcement, art projects have come and gone; community boards have proliferated across North America and the rest of the world.  	However, the community dynamics that emerged from the  	movement were as important as the individual dynamics that emerged from the board meetings or the art exhibits.

The inroads that art and the environment were making towards a more harmonious and just future were being interrupted and reversed by the very nature of the art and the environment that was being produced. A new understanding of the interconnection between art and the environment was being produced. This new understanding meant that the interests of the artist and the community were not necessarily aligned, but could nevertheless differ in interesting and unpredictable ways. These new understandings of the mutualality of affective space were making possible behaviours and decisions that would alter and shape the shape of the biennial – making it more of a cultural institution, and more of a place. 	The intention of the Biennale was to create a shared and dynamic space for the community to be able to ‘reproduce’ the organic processes that were transforming the city. Art students, artists and curators were not there to do that. The Biennale was there to provide an outlet for the city to ‘reproduce’ its cultural resources, to let the city</text>

A centrality in the city, in its public space, as a site of interaction between people, places and things, emerges as a function of cultural practices in the city. This is why, for example, museums in poorer areas tend to be predominantly student-run, and have, since the 1970s, been predominantly artists’ per diem. These per diems, the museums as suppliers of cultural products, encourage ‘deep dives’ into the past, into the city’s past, into the workings of government, into the social life of the urban gothic revival, but also ‘present-day’ exhibitions of the</text>

In South London, where the World Trade Center was located, the city’s cathedral city, and London, where the TfL Rail network crosses the river into the city, we’ve all become coterminous, if not interdependent, parts of a city whose histories and present-days mix and mingle, step by step, in a global circulation of people, goods and services. The cathedral city is the site of the future city, in that it is the site of the past but also the site of the future. London’s cathedral city is the site of the present city, but it is also the site of the past, and the site of the future. In other words, the cathedral city is a fiction – a fiction created by and for us, as individuals and groups with specific place and time in the world. But the future city is possible, just as the past city is real. 	Such pedagogical approaches to the past, to the social, to the spatial, to the realities around us, in other words, do what David Harvey has called us and so on. In short, the ‘fiction of the past’ is read not as a fiction</text>

In South London, where the World Trade Center was located, the city’s cathedral city, and London, where the TfL Rail network crosses the river into the city, we’ve all become coterminous, merging seamlessly into one urban landscape. And yet somehow, when we look at the city in a certain way, we notice our own size, our own impotence, the fact that we’re all trapped in a city that’s becoming increasingly disconnected from the place where its roots lie. 	Such is the pedagogical dynamic around the museum, or at least it should be. But despite the pedagogical flexibility offered by the museum, despite the fact that it’s possible to get a very different kind of understanding of the city from what comes out of the museum, and despite the fact that in many ways, the museum is the root of the problem, the root of our regionalised knowledge deficit, we still don’t have the tools to question and reconceive the city, to ask uncomfortable questions, to confront vested interests and to demand better from state institutions and political parties. These kinds of radical pedagogy are, I believe, needed in order</text>

In South London, where the World Trade Center was located, the city’s cathedral city, and London, where the TfL Rail network crosses the river into the city, we’ve all become coterminous, indistinguishable, non-representational.12 	Similarly, in the US, we’ve all become digital nomadic. If you’re driving in a car, you’re driving against the current. Whether you’re watching a football game, reading a book, or doing whatever you do in between, the pace of change is unstoppable.‘New Media, Old Rivalries’, New Media (New Society, 2016), p. 36. 13 	If the digital nomad is a nomadic species, the successor species may be said to be breeders. They’re constantly seeking the latest technological edge to push their self-perpetuating models of information empires forward. So it’s not surprising that the first digital nomad was a breeder, searching for the latest technological edge to exploit.  	Similarly, in the film ‘Casablanca’ (1937), Max Martin stars as Winston Smith,</text>

In South London, where the World Trade Center was located, the city’s cathedral city, and London, where the TfL Rail network crosses the river into the city, we’ve all become coterminous, and the cathedral city is now the dominant form of urban form. London’s cathedral city is the locus of a neoliberal industrial juggernaut, whose shape-shifting, its moneymaking, its massive infrastructure projects, its ubiquitous CCTV, its ‘high performance’ of the pedestrian, and its plethora of museums and galleries, all of which feed into a centrally planned ‘metro-ritual’ if you will.12 	But in places like Liverpool, where the Blitz broke the mould of industrial war, and gave shape to new forms of social and spatial organisation, and rendered previously passive spaces––such as the Anfield/Breckfield area, where the iconic ‘green space’ is now a contested title, and where the railway no longer provides access to the city center’ –the cathedral city comes alive, and new kinds of organisation are put into being. Take, for example, the Anfield/Breckfield area’s unusual combination of</text>

In the late 1990s when I started work for the Biennial, the Biennial was conceived as a city in cahoots with a social dimension. The Biennial’s social mission statement in 2000 read: ‘Turning Point: The Biennial as a City Core’. It continued, more poignantly, ‘The Biennial will be a city made real through its transformation into a destination for visitors from around the world: a ‘city of culture, arts and culture’, a ‘city of the in-between’ between worlds, where culture, art and leisure meet in the dynamic context of the city’s built environment.’ It promised ‘A city that can be a destination for visitors from all over the world’</text>

In South London, where the World Trade Center was located, the city’s cathedral city, and London, where the TfL Rail network crosses the river into the city, we’ve all become coterminous, fragmented, and mired in debt. The cathedral city has become a museum city, and the Rail network ‘becomes a mode of transportation between here and there’.12 	But what if, one day, someone comes walking across the river from here to Stratford, and they’re not looking for a museum but look for a place to ‘stand tall and clear away the hurdles in front of the moving image?’ What if they’re looking for a place to ‘reanimate’ the rubble? What would you do if you found that ‘trekker’ was walking amongst you? What would you do? I believe that today, as we grow older and the world around us becomes more disempowered, we’re all growing older and the world is watching us, 24/7. 	So, there’s the scenario: we have the technology, the imagination, the will, the spirit and</text>

In South London, where the World Trade Center was located, the city’s cathedral city, and London, where the TfL Rail network crosses the river into the city, we’ve all become coterminous, merging into one.12 	In the north, as we’ve all become coterminous in some form or another, we’ve all become urbanised, and in that process we’ve all become migrants, floating between different cities, sometimes in our cars. But while migrants’ need not be cotemporaneous, they must exist in some form in order to feed the ecology of the city. And given the city’s current predicament, that’s precisely what the Met Office has failed to provide. Of course, given the city’s current predicament, it does not help that the city’s built environment, the city itself, is in serious crisis. But that’s a different argument. This is about the system providing what it can, at best in conditions that are as precarious as the inhabitants of the enclaves that it creates. If that were the only argument, then the contradiction would disappear, and we</text>

In the 1980s, the American arts critic Jeffrey Smith wrote: ‘The art of the present can be classified as “episodic””’.13 	And here, then, are a few works that capture the moment in their temporal complexity: temporal complexity is a concept that has been getting at us, in recent years more acutely than ever, as a consequence of the cultural relativism that characterises contemporary art practice. Some of these pieces, I should add, are works that have been commissioned by, or are part of, the</text>

Why are we so anxious about the appearance of the word ‘commodity’ in a place title, when a commodity can be manufactured and exchanged almost anywhere? Why are we so anxious about the spread of transnational corporate structures through the relocation of production sites, when these too can be manufactured and exchanged almost anywhere? Why are we so enamoured by the lure of offshore oil and gas, when such resources exist in the UK but are virtually absent from the Arctic, where Arctic communities are the exception rather than the rule? Why do we value intellectual capital at the level of physical objects, while we have such low standards for the appearance of physical beauty, in the sense that beauty is considered a scarce commodity,</text>

The development of self-organising software to analyse the web site data and to produce high-quality PDFs or other file formats was also developed during this time. At the centre of this new economy of sharing were the social networks that had come to define the user’s experience of the web: Facebook, Twitter and Google+. But these social networks also bred competitors; within a given context of the site, there was also the potential for competition between communities of users based on location, interests and other factors. As a result, the community dynamics that we attend to are also potential sites of resistance. The development of user-friendly web applications that maximise the possibilities of accessing information on the web was a very important task for any site architect, and it was a site of production for community members. The challenge then became how to provide a service that was useful to as many users as possible, while avoiding or mitigating the effects of network effects. The ease of access to information via the web was a powerful weapon in the community’s arsenal, and it is this availability</text>

The development of self-organising software to analyse the web site data and to produce high-performance websites through which the community could discover what was published on a particular day was an interesting development, as was the advent of social media – particularly Facebook and Twitter – that allowed the public to pool resources and share information. But the community did not develop the technology to monitor all of its members’ online behaviours, much less all of its publications. This was made possible by the developments in computer programming, which allowed individuals to create powerful virtual private networks (VPNs), and the proliferation of serverless software applications that enabled the sharing of data between peers rather than the authority of the site administrators. The spread of web-based software was facilitated by the availability of online video services that could be accessed by anyone. The ability to access data about one’s site visits, online actions, online activities and publications made it possible to monitor individuals and to a large extent, invisible users.  As a result, community members often worked together on activities that were not visible to the outside world</text>

One can only imagine what the future holds for us if the Information Society is allowed to consume our society.Doubtless, the Information Society has its sources of information. The development of radical transparency in the 1990s, for example, was influenced by the work of the Anti-Media, a UK based non-profit organisation that sought to delegitimise the media through participatory methods. Its chair was Norman Baker, a former editor of the N.Z. Records, a radical newspaper in Harlow, Essex. The name of the book is a play on Baker’s initials: NA. Baker’s work also appears in the book  	N.Z. Records as part of the chapter entitled ‘The Rise and Fall of the Creative Class’.

The development of self-organising software to analyse the web site data and to produce high-resolution satellite imagery was also developed in this period. 	Such developments were clearly not without friction, but the emergence of innovative strategies were often instigated and led by people who had a genuine desire to help and contribute to their area. The emergence of community-based practices such as The Alternative Tent and The Alternative Community Services emerged as a response to the institutionalised social services and drug addiction, mental health and homelessness, which were seen as a burden on the community. The emergence of self-managed local alternatives such as Curtains4Less was stimulated by the huge amount of rubbish being thrown away in the post-industrial cities. The emergence of The Community Land Trust arose as a counter to this burden. 	The Community Land Trust was created to acquire and share housing for community projects, primarily by way of rental vouchers. The vouchers could be purchased through a community land trust, or as a fee by the local authority. The Community Land Trust soon established a network of</text>

The development of 3D modelling may have also involved the use of 3D scanners, but these rely on the availability of raw materials and highly specialized software, and the 3D technology is still relatively new. As a result, the possibilities for 3D effects have been creatively curtailed. More and more 3D effects are being created through the simple act of creating materials that respond to varying levels of transparency and pressure. For example, materials that react to light are being developed that would not only be useful for 3D printing, but also enable new light-tight ways to work with materials.4  The availability of these materials and the way in which they are made calls for new forms of art and performance. The availability of cheap labour is another factor, as is the need to communicate with workers to begin with. It is worth noting, however</text>

It is interesting to note that in the mid-1990s the early days of the Information Society were marked by the proliferation of social media, as well as the proliferation of print and online sources of information. In the development of its website, the early web site Alternetronic (now part of the StratForum) relied on the publication of brief pamphlets, many of which included maps and illustrations of the locations of chemical plants.

The possibilities for discovery were increased, and it was not uncommon for the community to be led astray by the constant shifting of information. The development of self-organising software to analyse the web site data and to produce high-quality PDF versions was a useful coding tool, allowing the audience to identify patterns and identifying certain texts as particularly relevant. For example, the word ‘mother’ appears over 600 times in the text of the website, while ‘child’ and ‘teacher’ appear 675 times. By mapping the frequency of occurrence of certain words in the text of the website, the text was rendered more comprehensible.

The development of self-organising software to analyse the web site data and to produce high-quality websites was an interesting development, but as the number of users of the system increased, the possibilities for social change also increased. It would be easy to say that the proliferation of social media and the Information Society coincided with a corresponding increase in the number of activists, but in fact some might argue that the systems they built themselves instead became activist tools.  	In the years that followed the end of the oil crisis, the level of activism in the community shifted from those engaged with the problem to those who simply felt they had to be involved. The level of formal education regarding the environmental issues that were raised became greater and the frequency of activist reports more variable, but the end result is that the systems that were designed to monitor and collect environmental data are more variable too. The effects of this shift in the perception of the collective impact of industrial activity are still felt today, and it is this perception of the collective impact that is constantly challenged by technology.  	The role of</text>

The ways in which we engage with the artefacts of Community Arts and Crafts, the ways in which we may create our own are currently being questioned within the wider arts and cultural community. Can we create what Mair has called a ‘transcendent image’ through the image of a community of artists working together to produce a shared outcome through their collaborative processes? Can we recognise the artifice of what she calls ‘the mask’ through the image of Community Arts and Crafts, a process that has involved numerous layers and divergent approaches?

The development of self-organising software to analyse the web site data and to produce innovative web applications was also done using HTML, an open-source coding language developed in the US and used in many parts of the world. 	Such developments came as a big surprise to many in the local community, who found their knowledge of the wider world restricted by the constant shifting of what was called the ‘real’ world. The local press was slow to report these things, perhaps reflecting the fact that the local community was already well-integrated into the wider metropolitan complex, where the needs of the press were more often served. 	Even when these needs shifted in the community, the need to be seen to be working in the wider interests of the area never truly went away. 	The need to be seen to be working in the interests of the area meant that many in the local community found it difficult to believe that the needs of the wider community could possibly be served by such organisations. To a large extent, this was due to the fact that the wider community</text>

The development of self-organising software to analyse the web site data and to produce reports on the state of community housing produced a certain amount of ambiguity. The ambiguity was removed, however, by the fact that at the time Microsoft was actively developing its own version of the   	Windows operating system, and so the public was able to switch from using the term ‘Windows user’ to ‘Windows user’, and vice versa.  	Many people who used to work for Alternetronic saw through the apparent logical fallacies of the system, and so they developed an alternative web site called Homebaked. It was an interesting counter attack, since the original web site often promoted the notion that Homebaked was somehow connected to the university, and so the incorporation of this web site meant that new ideas could be introduced. The incorporation of this web site also coincided with a number of workshops organised by the Arts Council, which would later be known as the Homebaked Workshop Network. This network brought together artists from all over the UK and beyond</text>

This bank expansion was fuelled by competitive market reforms, the creation of innovative financial instruments and the proliferation of finance companies. The development of self-governing local banks was another way in which the twentieth century was marked by the proliferation of financial instruments. The financialisation of local economies was promoted through the lending of money, which was digitised and replaced with electronic transfer of funds. The lending of money implied a high degree of flexibility in managing one's money; lending across borders and the new technologies of international settlement made it easier to locate money than it was to access it. Meanwhile, the proliferation of finance companies and the proliferation of trade routes facilitated the movement of goods and people across the globe. All these developments made it easier for people to access information and for financial instruments to transmit that information. The autonomous local banks were able to respond to changes in the economy by augmenting their websites with information about the changing cost of housing, the movements of workers, and the weather. This kind of rapid, transparent information meant that people had a way more complete picture of their economic situation. It also meant that the autonomous local banks could better monitor their own capital spending and borrowing costs. In other words</text>

The development of self-governing local banks was another way in which this century marked the emergence of a new type of capitalist enterprise. The fascinating thing about the autonomy of the biennale is that it is possible to move this growth of autonomous agencies away from its centre of gravity and towards the periphery – to places where the economic activities take place in a very different way. This is what happened in the 1980s and 1990s, and it is one of the reasons why we have so many local and smaller biennales. But the point of the biennale is to be located in a place – in the main exhibition venue, in a city, in a particular neighbourhood – where the economy of the place is transacted. If the city is no longer the centre of the biennale, the biennale has to find a home somewhere else. The autonomous agencies that emerged during the 1980s and 1990s – the financial sector, pharmaceutical companies, real estate companies, hotels, schools, community organisers – are the arteries that carry the cash from the periphery</text>

The development of self-governing local banks was another way in which the twentieth century was transformed. These are the ways in which contemporary political, economic and social crises are caused: by the proliferation of autonomous agencies, the undermining of the link between capital and labour, and the consequent need for the central bank to print new money.New York and San Francisco’s autonomous financial firms quickly became multitudes, and their activities were captured on video and photograph. The captured enterprises were sold to large institutional investors, mainly in the US and Europe. The recordings made it onto the radio and television screens of many cities. For decades, these images dominated newsstand advertisements. The dominance of images of autonomous agencies in the public sphere was further enhanced by the fact that these images came from the same image bank as the overt and secretly negotiated collusion between the media and the powerful. In other words, the dominant social networks in the world today rely on the same image of America’s Silicon Valley as broadcast ads.In recent years, as the dominant social network in many cities</text>

The development of self-governing local banks was another way in which the twentieth century was about the expansion of bureaucracy. It is now generally agreed that the predominant form of economic organisation in the twenty-first century is led by the vehicle of bureaucracies, and this includes the function of money as a scarce resource.The twenty-first century is likely to see a return to the growth of nation-states, since there are currently no federal or state borders to restrain or constrain the growth of numbers. As a result, there is likely to be a proliferation of federal, state and local versions of the same bank, and hence of similar financial and quasi-financial structures – perhaps the precondition for a future society to be formed. The number one federal law regulating banking in the United States at the end of 2014 was the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. This act created a new class of undocumented immigrants who were given legal status and the right to vote. The second act of the act was the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1988, which made</text>

The development of self-governing local banks was another way in which the twentieth century was marked by the proliferation of finance companies. These have become crucial in the ongoing fight against income and wealth inequality. In 1989, for instance, the financial services sector accounted for over half of all new jobs created nationally. Today, the financial services industry employs over 740,000 people and supports a range of other businesses across the economy.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Fight for Public Space was a main stage in the movement for public goods and public purposes. In San Francisco, the Mission District, which includes Pier 39, the Golden Gate Bridge, and parts of Van Ness Avenue, was a focal point of the overall anti-pier movement. The Mission District was a special case. Its proximity to the international border and other commercial centres meant that it was easy to access for goods and refugees fleeing the city. In the 1980s, the International Monetary Fund thought up a scheme to give $100 million to a local company that would set up a park in the middle</text>

New York and San Francisco emerged as global financial centres in the 2000s, and the autonomous local banks that emerged after the crash of 2008 are increasingly identified with these cities. New York and Los Angeles are now the financial capitals of the world.1 	The term ‘autonomous community’ has been used to describe areas of the country where people have the right to regulate themselves and to enact their own destinies. But while this is an important concept in and for US cities, it is unclear how or if this applies to territories outside of the US. For one thing, the term has been used to describe areas in which people have the right to self-govern, but in recent years, it has been abused by those seeking to regulate behaviour in areas outside of the jurisdiction of the federal government. For another, the courts have consistently divided jurisdiction between states and cities, with rulings favoring the cities in large parts of the country. Finally, the issue of</text>

The development of self-governing local banks was another way in which the twentieth century was marked by innovations that transformed industrial society. These include the cooperative movement, which began in the US and spread to other countries; microlending, which became popular in China after the economic reforms of 1997; and crowdfunding, which became widespread in South Korea and the Middle East after the financial crisis of 2008. All these innovations transformed the way in which industrial society organised labour, creating new kinds of productivity in the process. But they also transformed the social. New kinds of debt emerged, along with a whole range of new instruments for redistributing wealth. The social became less and less dependent upon the workings of the machine. The emergence of new technologies transformed the relationship between the machine and the world around it, producing entirely new kinds of labour. As a consequence, the world became less and less like the arid landscape it was designed to inhabit. That landscape is now the internet.Art and design have often been conflated. But they are not always synonymous. In the twentieth century</text>

The development of self-governing local banks was another way in which the twentieth century was marked by the proliferation of finance companies. These emerged as a direct result of the financial system failing in its original design. The autonomous local banks that emerged after this era's financial crises were as opposed to being absorbed into the system as if they had rebelated. Despite this, they were placed under the regulatory purview of the Federal Reserve Bank and its branches, which used this financial information to support their operations. In other words, they were objects of the most comprehensive and pervasive forms of central banking possible – lending, foreclosing, and capitalising on the disarray caused by the financial crisis – at a cost to the publics that were never properly addressed.In 1915, John Reed Albright founded the Federal Reserve Bank in New York City. His main objective was to provide funding for the war effort, and to do this through lending to the newly independent states. However, Albright realised that the resources needed to carry out this mission were limited. So he began to research</text>

Privatised Banks and Autonomous Local BanksIn the twentieth century, capitalism increasingly demanded that its productive forces be outsourced to distant locations. In the words of Marx, ‘Capital […] builds up abroad, and at home, a movement of destitution is encouraged’.2  To live independently is to become dependent on the global circulation of money and commodities. This is why, as a condition of access to global capital, we are told by contemporary capitalism apologists that we have to give up some of our sovereignty to pursue certain kinds of employment.3  The notion of self-sufficiency, which runs through much of the contemporary capitalist narrative, is the impossible dream of an independent state. In practice, of course, this</text>

The development of self-governing local banks was another way in which the twentieth century was defined. These autonomous local banks controlled their own legal framework, resources and business practices. They also established partnerships with other financial institutions and non-profits, which allowed them to expand their legal definition of self-governing. By the early twentieth century, most Americans had either graduated from college or had some kind of professional training. The autonomous local banks that emerged during this period were able to draw on the same pool of business and legal talent. The key to their success was a combination of trust funds, good will and the support of a supportive regulatory regime. Unfortunately, this kind of grassroots organisation is rare in the United States and international financial institutions are much more likely to establish strong commercialised ‘frontier’ structures around the world. The American frontier was defined by the Wampanoag Confederacy, whose occupation of the newly created US territories gave them a legal claim on the land and effectively barred anyone else from the territory.

Art today is produced by what can be termed ‘deep learning’, or the application of artificial intelligence to the task of art interpretation. Deep learning is the application of artificial intelligence to the task of art interpretation, and it is a work-around for the limitations of traditional art judgment. As Suhas Daftuar describes, deep learning involves the use of recurrent neural networks, or neural networks with deep learning architectures, to interpret artistic and artistic-sounding data, such as images, video, and audio. By imitating the structure and behavior of the human visual system, these networks can generate artistic effects according to pre-determined parameters.[14]These neural nets are capable</text>

Curator Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s recent curatorial project El Gato’s Forest, a large-scale digital project that digitally reconstructs the historic city of Gaudi in the valley of the Bardo, has raised important questions about urbanization in the region. In her words: ‘Contemporary art today is unavoidably generated and directed in relation to social media, where images and information are traded, traded and connected in a vast global marketplace that no longer draws a city on its present shape and form.’ If we do not reshape the city, but rather assist in its future development through our cultural and urban interventions, we can shape its form and future. Curating today is in many ways like curling, except that works created and information provided by curators is publicly available and unmediated. In the words of Peter Osborne, an expression of the contemporary curatorial’s increased privatizing tendencies: ‘There’s a big public business being done behind the scenes that wants us to be part of that business.’ This world is transient and transient things make no sense when addressed to a cityscape this is the case but Osborne is not alone in his assessment. 	The question of public ownership and control over cultural resources is a core issue of the contemporary curatorial interest and is frequently discussed in relation to the art and craft institutions that he is instructing and guiding to engage with a future cityscape or suburbs. In the 1990s and early 2000s the privatized curatorial form was questioned and challenged by a broad range of artists and art organizations, including artists collective members as well as lay curators, who demanded greater public involvement in the institution of art in exchange for curatorial reductions. Many contemporary artists were drawn to the emerging generation of curators who challenged the conventions and hierarchies of traditional art museums and the art market.</text>

I applied the term ‘information society’ to a field that has, for decades, been understood as a domain of military-industrial complex. The rise of data-rich communication technologies has also accelerated the adoption of new media and apps that record and analyze massive amounts of data, enabling greater civic engagement and political participation. As a result, the public sphere is increasingly populated by people who can be counted on to contribute data and information to the creation of knowledge, whether that contribution is knowledge of upcoming events, knowledge of the political process, or knowledge of government activity.

In the words of Peter Osborne, an expression of the contemporary curatorial’s appropriation of the past becomes an object of consumption, noting how, ‘like the objects that make up contemporary art’, the past is captured, misconstrued and returned to the social: ‘a social phenomenon that is captured and misconstrued by the contemporary curatorial approach is often portrayed as a kind of unknowable black hole’.[7]In an important and timely contribution to the field, this observation is made in relation to the technological conjuncture and the crisis of the biennial, but more specifically, to the exhibitionary market as a circulation and the production of its crises. The exhibitionary market, which has enjoyed a relatively stable market share throughout much of the twentieth century, is now experiencing a fundamental reorientation of global commodity production towards the cities, which is reshaping what counts as a city and how it is produced. This is taking place despite the fact that the biennial has had a significant cultural and urban function throughout this century,</text>

In the words of Peter Osborne, an expression of the contemporary curatorial’s collaborative process: ‘The power to create is power held in common.’2 The contemporary curatorial has an express, if constrained, right to speak and act as it pleases, and this right is as absolute as the right to one’s word in the British common law. The contemporary curatorial has the right to ‘paint’, ‘walk around’ and ‘take part in any way’ in the political, economic and social processes that are the direct consequence of its activities, including but not limited to, participation in the ‘Paris Metro’, the ‘Stade de France’, the ‘Stade de Angélique’, the ‘Stade de Sion’ and ‘Champs-Elyseuf’3 (Paris Metro, Angélique, Paris Stade, Stade de Angélique, Champs Élysémie</text>

In the words of Peter Osborne, an expression of the contemporary curatorial form: ‘The contemporary curatorial mission is to provide, represent and encourage the public good through art, education and public debate».[8] And the contemporary curatorial mission is carried out in many ways similar to what Osborne spoke of in his lecture. The main difference is that today's art is promoted and accredited through a publicly available body of work, whilst in the past it was not. The contemporary form of art today is one in which the artist becomes the arbiter of public good, whereas in the past the role of the artist was primarily defined by his ability to produce and connect with audiences. The role of the artist in the contemporary curatorial role is much more ambiguous and variable, and public funding for contemporary art is much more dependent on individual artist selection. It is true that in recent years the public has become increasingly sensitive to the over-representation of certain ethnicities and racialities in contemporary art, and the impoverishment of others, and it is also true that</text>

There is much that can be learned from each other, and much that can be learned by doing so. But sharing is only possible through the other, and only as a shared experience.’3 This collaborative and open process of sharing is characteristic of many forms of contemporary curating, but it is particularly evident in the form of interactive online interactive media (IGM) – cultural tourism coupled with art’s contemporary incarnation, ART – especially on social media platforms such as Instagram, where artists and their fans can post, comment and collectively ‘shape and become part of the story’ through ‘instant sharing’ and ‘liking’ of artwork.

Curating today is in many ways like curling, except that works created and information provided by curators is publicly available and unmediated. In the words of Peter Osborne, an expression of the contemporary curatorial’s concern for the public good is evident in the development of digital media, whereby the public has come to expect and value a certain kind of content and the reinvention of media as a public resource. Digital media has democratized the media producer, and made it easier to produce high-quality, accessible and diverse media content. But this has also led to a new kind of media, in which the public is no longer the sole user but is actively involved. Public access to information and knowledge is the emancipatory condition, and in many ways, this is the only kind of knowledge that can be had. As Osborne puts it: ‘Information today is freely available, and knowledge is quotidian.’ In other words, the knowledge of contemporary art and culture today is a ‘transitive relation’: it is both relational and transnational, reaching as far as the art galleries of today. This implies a change in the curatorial role, one that is not</text>

In the words of Peter Osborne, an expression of the contemporary curatorial’s expansive knowledge-production system: ‘Art is the new data.’[10] And Osborne is not alone in his thinking. In fact, many contemporary curators share our belief that art is tools through which the contemporary is enabled, empowered and challenged. As an artist, I find myself drawn to the role of the artist, the contemporary curator, and the user of art as agents of change, in this case through the cultural practices of the social web. As a practitioner of a socially engaged practice, I see myself as part of a creative team that is also user agent, part of a team that produces, contributes to and contributes to the site through which art is made, shared and appreciated.[11]The social web has come a long way since its beginnings as a conceptual framework for cultural production in Europe and the United States in the late nineteenth century.

The title of the exhibition was a direct response to the question, which was explored in the exhibition, and the answer was clear: intelligent design. Design is a powerful concept that can be used to describe a world not understood by everyone. It is a new way of looking at the world and challenges the status quo. But it is not new and it is not universal. In fact, the history of design begins in Egypt and the Near East – places where gender and racialised difference are extreme – and continues in South and Central America. And it is not new to the African diaspora – design is very much part of their historical emergence and ongoing experience – but it is not universal or simple. For example, the term ‘African diaspora’ was coined in the 1970s in the wake of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, but today’s African diasporas are made up of many different kinds of migrants, many of them arriving through the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. Many African migrants have their origin in the same places, live in the same conditions, and follow the same kinds of labour and politics. But there is no African diaspora. There is only the</text>

The title of the exhibition was a direct response to the question, which was explored in the exhibition, and the answer was clear: intelligent design. Design is a powerful concept that can be used to describe a world not understood by everyone. It is an observation, a claim, a belief. And yet it is also a system that has been designed with certain kinds of knowledge in mind. And as the title suggests, smart design is an observation and a claim. But it is also a system that can and must be changed, modified and improved. It is a dynamic system that is always changing in order to meet new situations and meet new claims. In that sense, it is a ‘smart design’ that constantly adapts and changes itself. 	So smart design is a feature of the contemporary world, but it is also a feature of the ancient world. And from the ancient world we gather many different kinds of knowledge. We gather different kinds of measurement and reckoning. We gather different kinds of language and grammar. We gather different kinds of music and dance. We gather different kinds of mathematics and science. We gather different kinds of design and innovation. And one of the ways in which we gather different kinds of knowledge is through experience.</text>

The question was, then, what should be in the exhibition? How should the exhibition be organised so as to enable people to come to the exhibition? What are the curators and art world professionals doing at the moment? 	The answer is simple: they are not doing enough. There are too many new technologies and media (blogging, social media, videos, podcasts, crowdsourcing, crowdsourcing,  	Instagram, YouTube, Amazon, GameStop etc.) that disrupt what is expected of them – in the workplace, in the social sphere, in the cultural sphere, in the marketplace and in the service sector. 	The curators and art world professionals who are in the habit of showing work that they have not made yet, as a measure of its quality or importance, are doing so out of habit.

The title of the exhibition was a direct response to the question, which was explored in the exhibition, and the answer was clear: intelligent design. Design is a powerful concept that can be used to describe a world not understood by everyone. It is a way of saying, not understanding, but also recognising the essential interconnectedness of all things. But it is not a ‘world’ as we understand it. Rather, it is a set of relationships between people that cannot be understood by anyone. And this was a powerful concept for the exhibition because it allowed the audience to step back and allow themselves to be transported back to that world. For example, the audience in the Liverpool Biennial could have walked out of the Biennial with a deeper understanding of how art is made in China than with the ordinary understanding of how art is made in the UK. This was a real opportunity for the artist to make that happen. Some of the dialogue in the gallery was very uncomfortable for the audience, but they came out of it stronger, with a deeper understanding of the world. 	The question of how design is made in countries like China was explored at length in the exhibition. And it was emphasised that there are clear cut differences between the</text>

The title of the exhibition was a direct response to the question, which was explored in the exhibition, and the answer was clear: intelligent design. Design is a powerful concept that can be used to describe a world not understood by everyone. It is a way to create a shared space in which people can come to understand the world around them. The reason why we chose the word ‘design’ is that we wanted to refer to a world that is not understood by everyone, not understood by everyone fully and certainly not fully in all its richness and complexity. For this reason, we chose to use the word ‘design’ in a very broad and inclusive sense. We wanted to point to places where people can learn more about the world around them and suggest activities for them to undertake in that world. 	We also wanted to point to paradigms that people need to know about in order to engage with them and think about them. People need to understand that there are different kinds of knowledge, and that knowledge from one sphere can be valid knowledge from another sphere. For instance, the sphere of biology understands that organisms have genomes, and that life itself forms a kind of database – a kind of infrastructure – that maps out environments,</text>

It is a dynamic system that can be modified through continual learning and change. Yet what is sometimes described as intelligent design fails to consider or foresee the cumulative effect of its actions. How do its creators imagine the world? 	The exhibition was presented in three parts: the first part, a brief survey of some of the curatorial practices of the past twenty-first century; the second part, an exploration of some of the contemporary challenges and themes of intelligent design; and the third part, a creative analysis of the exhibition that incorporated ideas from a range of disciplines.

It invites us to questions that we do not yet have the power to ask the difficult questions, the ones that reveal hidden realities and the ugly politics of power. 	The idea that someone, somewhere, has the answers to the questions of why do things the way they are is a thrill for many people. It heralds the emergence of a new world order of transparency and accountability. People will be able to understand why things are the way they are. 	But to fully understand the capacities and hierarchies of our contemporary world, we need more than that cool, crisp and new technology to make them do things in ways that draw us into the very systems that created the mess we are in now. We need the capacity to think critically about the systems that enable and constrain our movements and desires. And we need the capacity to implement change through that change.

And so the title of the exhibition,  	Design and Empire, incorporated the overarching idea of the exhibition – that things as they actually are are are inherently creative and up for grabs – and the fact that the objects we carry inside us are inherently connected to systems that design and understand how we behave. Design is not an end in itself. It is an opening to a world of possibility. 	The title of the exhibition itself echoed these two claims. It designated the place where ideas, not ends, lay claim: where ends meet means. It is a play on words: Empire and knowledge meet in a name that unambiguously identifies what is ultimately a product of those systems. The title also suggested a possible endgame. The exhibition was ambiguous about what that next might be. Its implicit message was: here are some things you might not know, and here are some things you might want to know. And</text>

In a recent issue of New Media Arts &amp; Architecture, Susanne Kruger, curator of the exhibition 	In Search of Objects (2013-14) and co-curator of the two exhibitions in the Duke and Albert Museum, describes the exhibition in the Duke and Albert Museum as a ‘landmark’ of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Digital Kunsthal project.6 It marks the first time that objects have been placed in a museum, and the first time that objects have been exhibited on curatorial displays. What they lack in stature and weight, they more than make up for in significance. The question that comes to mind is: what is the relationship between physical and virtual? As far back as the Greeks and Romans were concerned, the capacity to produce objects transcended both time and space. The Greek philosopher and scientist Phaedrus (who wrote the second book in the Republic) argued that life itself produces ‘artificial</text>

Now I’m into things that are more social and ecological. Art and design are not only a set of tools to be used, but they are a set of strategies to be used, and the social and ecological benefits of their use are rich indeed. But there is a catch, and that’s where the social and environmental come together. If you leave that aside and treat art and design as social and ecological relations, and think about how they are made and who makes them, then you can begin to see how to change that. And that’s</text>

Art institutions are sometimes even cyber-sued for their incorporation of new technologies into artistic practices. Nevertheless, these legal actions are usually seen as a re-purposing of the past, an effort to accommodate the technologically savvy and urban dwellers swept away by the new nomadic city. In contrast, virtual and augmented reality are said to rob art of its substance and make it a commodity on a massive marketplace in the service of a megacorporation. Art is often cast as</text>

In any event, the article ends on a note of resignation rather than with a declaration of intent to do anything different. I hope to see you in Liverpool.Bologna’s arcades, with their manic colors and their un-ZIG-zag elevators, are the perfect setting for an art exhibition. The zigs and zags of their architraves lend themselves to the staging of an exhibition, and the staging of an exhibition. The architecture, the façade, the arcades themselves – they are the ultimate in form and function. However, this article is not just about architecture and the enigmatic. It touches on some very important cultural factors that contribute to creating this exhibition – factors that, as we know from experience, can be manipulated or even destroyed.

This is the lesson of Paris, as we learn from Henri Bergson, whose Beauty in Beauty: On the Origins of the Modern Perception of Beauty (1949) was one of the founding documents of modern philosophy. Beauty in Beauty is a classic, landmark, and foundational work, but its focus on the role of aesthetic perception in the development of modern aesthetics is what has remained largely unchanged through the course of Western thought. Beauty in Beauty’s pages of annotations, however, begins to suggest a deeper philosophical meaning. The chapter, titled ‘The Beauty Myth’, begins by stressing the inescapable link between aesthetics and politics, and concluding with a list of questions that foreshadows later essays in Bergson’s later work. Questions such as these leave no stone unturned in the search for answers. After outlining the answers, the essay ends with a description of the effects of our aesthetic inclinations toward an idealized version</text>

So, while the museum may claim to contain the real deal, it often comes across as if it contains something fake.‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder’, as the saying goes. Unfortunately, this is often the case with contemporary reports of urban change, and the current reports often end up being exactly what the original architects, planners and collectors of the urban may not have intended. For example, the utopian ideas of ‘high-performance, zero waste development’ often seen in urban planning documents of the 1990s may actually serve the interests of the wealthy and the powerful, not the commoners and poor. And, as we all know, the urban is a big business. So, while the museum may profess to hold the pieces of the puzzle together, in reality it often serves as a stumbling block or even a disrupter of sorts, holding back the day. As late as 2012, when the Arab Spring began in earnest, the United States and its allies were still trying to push through the remnants of colonial rule in Bahrain, using the city as a base to bomb and oil-rich Qatar</text>

If the eye is opened only to superficial matters, such as a museum tending to its collection of artefacts, then modernity has certainly arrived in the guise of veneer. The museum, by contrast, exhibits more significant works, the kind of works that tell the story and engage with the practitioner. To some this may seem an over-simplification, but to others it seems overdetermined. A museum such as the New York Public Library bears witness to the power of representation, as all libraries do, and has its stories told as fragments in a shared narrative. A museum such as the California Academy of Sciences tells the same stories as many other institutions, but assembles them into a coherent whole through a specialized fieldwork, called paleontology. A museum such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art gathers stories from across the city as a service to its new president’s job search, and its galleries have a magic ability to</text>

This is perhaps the lesson of Sydney, where the architectural historian Peter McCaughey, writing about the McCarthys’Bicentennial in New York, finds their nineteenth-century British superstructures to be neither natural nor mythical: ‘the presence of architecturally designed public parks, shopping districts, historic markets, cultural institutions, historical sites and the like, combined with the bank’s extensive storage facilities and tire and metal vendors, made the McCarthys the urban elites of their field of vision.’ Travel and Adventure, v. 2, 2002, p. 8.Peter McCaughey, ‘The Empire Stretches Toward Its End’, in McCaughey,  	Empire Straits, p. 8.6 	The Travel and Adventure article, written for the McCarthys’Bicentennial journal, is a good place to start when considering the reasons why contemporary</text>

Some visitors may see beauty in the form of exotic animals, while others may see it as a mixture of antiquated and modern curiosities. Regardless of what they think it really is, it is important to note that, until recently, the art museums that dominated the city’s cultural landscape – the Louvre, Tate, MoMA, the Barbican, and, of course, Gettysburg – dominated the city’s tourism narrative. Now, thanks to the financial juggernaught of globalised capital, local artists and cultural specialists are finding themselves increasingly sidelined.  	The failure of the museum as a cultural venue may well be a cultural failure. But the fact that it is still around today, actively involved in promoting or debunking contemporary art, or even actively involved in supporting contemporary art through educational programmes, projects,</text>

In this sense, the museum is often seen as something that captures and preaches the inevitable. But this interpretation ignores the fact that, every once in a while, a museum does something truly amazing, like capturing the magic of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel or capturing the wonder of the ancient tetractys. And these things are only possible because of the incredible work of artists and curators who, in turn, improvise and improvise again and again until something manages to capture the magic of the ancient institution without ever really existing. A true museum, then, is an actual, committed place where things happen because they are supposed to happen. And while some might say that this sounds trivial, it is often forgotten how important it is to have a mission statement, or, better yet, a long-term vision.

True or not, the eye of the beholder is often quite the opposite.  At the same time, the zoos and museums mentioned above often have a much bigger cultural impact than the actual art galleries, because they are present everywhere, linking the past, present and future. In this way, their mere presence conveys an implied contentment and tranquillity that is difficult to replicate or replicate only marginally. Contemporary art is often deployed as a counterweight to the over-the-top interventions of art museums, which often try to manufacture excitement out of anything, or produce a pseudo sense of wonderment out of things. The eye of the beholder is constantly on the horizon, constantly scanning for cracks, roads leading to nowhere, mysterious forces out to destroy us. As such, the eye that finds beauty in everything inevitably gets poked through, and through, and through.  A portrait of Tania Bruguera, taken during a</text>

If the eye of the beholder is opened wide enough, in the matter of fact, then lies everywhere. So, if the eye of Museé de France or any other gallery patron is looking to buy a ticket to a place, then maybe what they should be looking out for are the following: good art, varied forms of art, and interesting art. If the place is going to be in constant flux, in other words, then people are going to wander by, taking things with them, and museums are going to be a place to watch that happen. The following elements of the Istanbul Biennale’s 2015 curatorial agenda are representative: the gallery as a platform for interactivity, art as a mediator between the viewer and the things bought, and art as the site of aesthetic experience. The design bureau of the Biennale was established in 1989, when the French architect Jean Guy Lecat</text>

The zoos mentioned may be modern substitutes, but they also appear to be the exceptions rather than the rule. So, while the museum may claim to contain the real deal, it often comes across as if it contains something fake.‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder’, as the saying goes. In this sense, the museums mentioned in this article may well be in the eye of the beholder. The fact that many of the contemporary art museums now hold exhibitions on a regular basis (indeed, many of them regularly host contemporary art shows) may be seen as a good thing, filling gaps and questioning current trends, while modern art’s tendency to demand a recitation of past trends (indeed, this may be seen as a necessary condition of cultural tourism) may be seen as a bad thing. On the other hand, it may be that the museums mentioned in this article, having appeared in a vacuum, were ideal for this purpose. In this sense, they may serve as a filter for the art that is within, but also the art that is without.In general, then, the aim of this article is to help artists and curators rethink the role of museum in contemporary art’s</text>

The importance of the past for the future, on the other hand, is much more immediate and can be attributed to Rumi: presentism is ‘the future is here and now… Presentism seeks to define and capture the moment’.[7]Rumi draws our attention to the fact that, while the past is indeed important in its own right, much of what we call the ‘past’ is of no relevance or use to us in the present. In other words, the past is made up of things that have already happened. We do not make or recreate the future, but rather create and inherit what Rumi calls ‘a chaotic series of changing […] historical circumstances and […] trends’.[8]One can therefore understand the medieval fascination with the past, which is often traced to Vorticism, as a late stage in the development of technologies of memory and narratives.[9]The interest in the past that characterises modernity is deeply rooted in the myth of progress. Histories of progress are texts that tell of the inevitable march of progress – a narrative of inexorable progress towards a utopian future based on the logic of globalisation – and the inevitable fall of ancient civilizations. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, theories of progress were frequently formulated in terms of technological</text>

The importance of the past for the future, on the other hand, is much more immediate and can be attributed to Rumi: presentism is ‘the future is here and now… Presentism seeks to define and capture the moment’.[7]Rumi draws our attention to the fact that, while the past may be ‘present’ in the sense that it is now possible to access it through historical photographs and archival documents, there is no immediate or obvious experience of the past because of the inaccessibility of space and the past. Rather, what we can create is ‘imaginary’ and made manifest through historical photographs and documents, but Rumi’s perspective is that the future is an ‘inhabitant’, living in ‘matter’ and object that returns to us through the ‘picture of an ‘inhabitant’’. This ‘inhabitant’ ‘piece’ includes sentient life existing in ‘matter’ and ‘living’ in ‘form’. While this ‘picture of an “inhabitant”’ is a fabrication and a fabrication alone, it captures the essence of things perfectly and in a way that no other picture can.�</text>

The importance of the past for the future, on the other hand, is much more immediate and can be attributed to Rumi: presentism is ‘the future is here and now… Presentism seeks to define and capture the moment’.[7]Rumi draws our attention to the fact that, while the future may or may not be digitised, the past is always with us and remains an obstacle to understanding the past. In that case, the past may or may not be present in a digital or augmented form in all of social and cultural significance. In either case, the future is an ever-present and – in the contemporary world – an ever-present possibility. In the present, we have seen that the future is always facing up against]the past’. Yet Rumi’s awareness of the past – and his awareness of his own ‘ideal world’ – prevents him from creating ‘anything new’ in the world, as we know and expect from now onwards.Instead of confronting the past or anticipating the future, we need to act and think creatively and constructively about the possible, the imagined future, and what that future might be like. That is, our present predicament – trapped in the past, unable to act on our knowledge – calls</text>

The importance of the past for the future, on the other hand, is much more immediate and can be attributed to Rumi: presentism is ‘the future is here and now… Presentism seeks to define and capture the moment’.[7]Rumi draws our attention to the fact that, while the past is ‘alive’ in the sense that it contains knowledge from now, it is alive only as part of a continuous narration – part of a body of contemporary communication with the future – part of a discourse with other narrators and actors. It is only in the latter half of the twentieth century that the past is beginning to be written into the contemporary through the emergence of new media such as video and social media.However, unlike Rumi, we do not derive our knowledge of the future from the past but from what we create with it. In fact, the future is the opposite of what is imagined by the human imagination – it is an imagined past that is constantly being rewritten by means of new media and technologies. In this sense, the future is an imagined present that is constantly being rewritten by the human species. So, there is an alternative future – the imagined past – that is in fact radically different from what is imagined by machines.This is one way of conceiving of</text>

The importance of the past for the future, on the other hand, is much more immediate and can be attributed to Rumi: presentism is ‘the future is here and now… Presentism seeks to define and capture the moment’.[7]Rumi draws our attention to the fact that, while the past can present itself as things are, it is the other way around as well – the past is actually a place of play and fantasy – which is why it is so powerful and memorable. The future is a place of invention, where the past can be written and invented into being. This is perhaps what we mean when we talk about new media: new media enable the past to be rewritten and invented, creating a fantasy of slow writing and unchanging history that serves as a cautionary tale for today and the future.New media also create a fantasy of expanding possibilities for the future, one that is optimistic and open to new ideas and behaviours. This is the broader implication of Rumi’s statement: ‘The past is a fictional entity. It is a made-up story that is repeated thousands of times over again and which certainly can be changed and – hopefully – never to repeat again.’[8] In short, the future is an imagined place with no past,</text>

The importance of the past for the future, on the other hand, is much more immediate and can be attributed to Rumi: presentism is ‘the future is here and now… Presentism seeks to define and capture the moment’.[7]Rumi draws our attention to the fact that, while the past can ‘hang in the balance’ as to whether history will be rewritten in the future, it is much more immediate and easy to alter the past – by telling a story or by reimagining movements that were once prohibited or prohibited from being made. In other words, the past is not only a means to an uncertain future but also a point of making that uncertain future. The past is a story that needs to be told, but it is also told in ways that ensure that the future will be told in ways that are not consistent with the past.If we allow ourselves to be seduced by the immediacy of the past, we inevitably end up making decisions that are inconsistent with the past. For Rumi, the future is a space in which ‘imaginary men and women act out the generations that will be born after’.[8] and, as we saw, change is inevitable in the face of historical accidents. But it is also the case that,</text>

The importance of the past for the future, on the other hand, is much more immediate and can be attributed to Rumi: presentism is ‘the future is here and now… Presentism seeks to define and capture the moment’.[7]Rumi draws our attention to the fact that, while the past is often depicted schematically – with individual and societal effects – it is actually much more dynamic, characterised by ‘moments’ and constantly evolving. There are no fixed historical periods for the future to be remembered in, because the future is always imagined to be a place where unforeseen and unpredictable forces interact with existing order. The influence of modernity and globalisation is to a large extent a by-product of the technological revolution that has transformed what is now called the ‘second tier’ of global trade. As a result of this, we are witnessing an explosion of ever more technologically mediated forms of historical memory, which seek to capture and embody this dynamic historical moment in ever more precise and technically sophisticated ways. So, too, is the influence of globalisation and colonialism on the cultural practices and social life of people all over the world.Rumi’s reflections on the technology of memory, and the capacities that it enables, are valuable for our own purposes today.

In contrast, the ancient and medieval illuminated manuscripts that we possess are primarily concerned with the preservation of the past as it is remembered in the present. The importance of the past for the future, on the other hand, is much more immediate and can be attributed to Rumi: presentism is ‘the future is here and now… Presentism seeks to define and capture the moment’.[7]Rumi draws our attention to the fact that, while the past may not be ideal for the future, it is ideal for the past because it contains for the future an ideal historical sequence of things to come. In short, Rumi argues, the future is here and can and should be used to bring about the past, but the past has to be reclaimed and used in order to imagine and create the future. To some degree, this may be true. But the technological capability to ‘think the past’ seems to have replaced memory as the ability to ‘remember’ in the past. If Rumi is correct in his view that the future is here for the taking then the past may not only in the sense of being archived and available for retrieval, but may be appropriated and rendered superfluous. This view is at odds with the historical and institutionalendorsements of science and technology today, which tend to emphasise the ineradicability and repeatability of historical processes and processes over the more ‘complex’ and ‘</text>

So far, so normal. But what Rumi describes is not so ordinary. What she calls ‘the future is no longer here’ and ‘now is everywhere, no matter where’. What Rumi means is that the immediate future is here, and will always be, but it is also interesting to contrast this with the past, which can mean the past or the future. For example, in the present, we can think of events such as the Paris attacks – which were apparently committed in an effort to undermine France’s national identity – as an attempt to ‘purify’ a particular historical memory by whitening the actions and language of the perpetrators. But in the past, such acts were taken as part of a larger process of capitalist social transformation, and we as consumers of that</text>

In ‘The Past is a Trap and Open-Paced Ruins’, he explains, we find art and artistic practices operating in the real but unrealised future, where ‘nature is made to seem beautiful by an artifice that pretends to make things so’. In this image, the past is made to seem glamorous and the future, where dreams and phantom presents are the order of the day. In the image, the past is replaced with a facsimile of what is commonly referred to as ‘the ‘present’, a situation that is as at odds with what we actually mean by the term as ‘present’ as the image suggests.Rumi draws us away from our images of the natural past to consider an even scarier scenario: what might happen if art and creative practices were integrated into the infrastructure</text>

The discovery of valuable timber from the sea brought new business opportunities, as well as the invention of a new kind of shipbuilding – the ship-builder’s charter – to finance the increasingly elaborate projects. In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a universal right, and the right to make ships universal was the whole point of the instrument. So too the right to develop, to copy, to sell, to import and to export – to name only a few of the many rights at stake in the global south.All these rights became much more important as the nineteenth-century metropolis unfolded. In London, for example, the right to make its buildings ‘sacred’ – to be kept as a symbol of British cultural imperialism – came to mean more than keeping them in order. André Breton, in his book The Port of London and the Port of Culture, recounts the lamentable decline of the old dockside industry in the wake of the black-box era:The decline of the dockside industry began with the introduction of steam in 1844. But unlike the factories that followed it, which began to fade as new modes of production replaced old industries, this new form of industrialisation</text>

The discovery of valuable timber from the sea brought new business opportunities, as well as the invention of a new kind of shipbuilding – the ship-builder’s charter – to finance the increasingly elaborate projects. In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a kind of legal right, granting authorship to certain kinds of cultural property found at the docks. Titles given by the crown were generally recognised as such by subsequent courts, but the discovery and enumeration of cultural resources at the docks quickly gave authorship to other kinds of people, including the local populace. When, in turn, the people in charge of the docksurrets decided to renovate them in the early twentieth century, they did so not by way of customary or legal rights, but by way of a process of industrial patronage.

The discovery of valuable timber from the sea brought new business opportunities, as well as the invention of a new kind of shipbuilding – the ship-builder’s charter – to finance the increasingly elaborate projects. In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a kind of national charter, first for ship building in the UK and later for ship building in all of Europe.The history of ship building in the UK and Europe, and of course, of ship building in all of Asia, goes back much further than the history of the ship. The discovery of new transport routes and the new ways of transporting goods around the world is thought by some to have been the decisive steps that allowed for the industrialisation of the first world. By the late eighteenth century, in fact, the metallurgist’s calculation that a ship could sell for ten pounds of silver at a time was generating revenue for the British shipbuilding industry. At this time, of course, there was no shortage of ships – in use throughout the world – but the discovery of a cheap and accessible way to transport goods across the world's oceans opened up all kinds of possibilities for exploitation. And so the story of how the discovery of oil and the</text>

The discovery of valuable timber from the sea brought new business opportunities, as well as the invention of a new kind of shipbuilding – the ship-builder’s charter – to finance the increasingly elaborate projects. In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a kind of insurance policy in the event of a major timber supply shortage. And as the ‘global south’ incorporated the port city into its social and political narratives, the ship-builder’s charter was increasingly seen as a kind of licence to exploitative behaviour.In the late eighteenth century, for instance, the discovery of gold in Northumberland contributed to give the port city a new lease of life. The development of rail and telegraph networks also expedited the development of ports infrastructure. But the most ambitious projects of the port city were still relatively rudimentary. The Napier Plan of 1888, for instance, envisaged a relatively barren peninsula with a plant for the production of nickel and tantalum, but with a ‘boardyard for the new modes of industrial activity’, a workshop for raw materials, and a terminal for freight and merchandise over a distance of up to twenty-five miles. The plan also envisaged a network of</text>

In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a kind of institution – lending legitimacy to the increasingly globalised projects through which the Port of Liverpool was becoming an international port authority.Contemporaneous with the emergence of the ship-builder’s charter in the late sixteenth century, a new kind of capitalist logic was developing in the port city. The logic of the port over the past two centuries has been shaped by the endeavours of dozens of commercial enterprises, many of them set against the backdrop of the Port of Liverpool itself. The Port of Liverpool rose from the ruins of the late nineteenth century's industrial decline to become one of the UK’s top twenty ports for trans-shipment containers in the late twentieth century. It also provided a home for immigrants from all over the globe, fuelling the industry through the slave labour of seafarers. All these enterprises – the ship-maker, the timber merchant, the insurance companies and the railway companies – relied on the huge transatlantic slave trade</text>

The discovery of valuable timber from the sea brought new business opportunities, as well as the invention of a new kind of shipbuilding – the ship-builder’s charter – to finance the increasingly elaborate projects. In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a kind of loan shark, lending to projects at interest, and enabling the further expansion of the port infrastructure. The development of the port infrastructure, which continued to be based on the charter, offered the beginnings of a public realm for artists and the creative class. The port was a site for trade and metropolis for tourists, while the cultural campaigns of the port city centre were producing activists sympathetic to the aims of the laterking, William Shakespeare, and his play-wright son, William Shakespeare, on the one hand, and on the other.The development of the port infrastructure and its social programmes began to generate political will. In 1504, when the Maritime Charter was reformed to allow for ‘better government to be brought about by and with the assistance of the people’, William Shakespeare was given the charter to produce a ‘work of art … of such value to the public and to the world at large’.[9] The charter was not</text>

The discovery of valuable timber from the sea brought new business opportunities, as well as the invention of a new kind of shipbuilding – the ship-builder’s charter – to finance the increasingly elaborate projects. In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a kind of ‘black box’ – a record of the projects, projects and trades carried out in the port city. The black box became a kind of mapping tool, a kind of mapping device, a kind of surveillance device and a kind of bomb shelter. It recorded, recorded, recorded. And sometimes the systems that it recorded generated artworks that were as good as anything produced in the city.So we can say that the black box was a kind of a surveillance device and a kind of a bomb shelter. It recorded and recorded things that made the city real, even if these things were generated by machines. And what this makes us do is realise that there is a kind of a dialectic going on between the machines and the people who operate the machines. The dialectic goes like this: the dialectic of the machine and the governed.‘The machine’s reports are compiled and transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU) where</text>

The discovery of valuable timber from the sea brought new business opportunities, as well as the invention of a new kind of shipbuilding – the ship-builder’s charter – to finance the increasingly elaborate projects. In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a kind of national emblem. The depiction of the charter on the Liverpool Biennial badge, as well as on the Liverpool Ship &amp; Tile Company's shop windows, was repurposed by the city’s nascent mosaic industry to designate members of a particular trade. The image of the charter on the shop windows was replaced with a ‘ship &amp; tile’ logo, while the image of the ship and tile replaced the image of the craftsman.  At the time, this transition was accompanied by a massive expansion of the typeface used, to accommodate both ‘standardised Japanese script’ and the image of a ship. A new kind of nationalism was building.The massive voyages of discovery that characterised the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were often misconstrued as heroic or popular. The archaeological record shows that, in the vast majority of cases, the prevailing ideology was nativist, xenophobic and lustful. And yet the impulse to</text>

The discovery of valuable timber from the sea brought new business opportunities, as well as the invention of a new kind of shipbuilding – the ship-builder’s charter – to finance the increasingly elaborate projects. In time, the ship-builder’s charter became a kind of investment, lending credibility to the increasingly elaborate projects as well as providing a kind of cash back for the success of the long-term investments. And so it continued to pay off: in the late fourteenth century, when the city reached its maximum capacity, around twenty-five percent of the value of the wealth produced in the port city flowed back into the port for the benefit of the English textile industry.More and more money was being invested in dockside infrastructure projects, including the extensive building of new harbourside buildings that provided affordable housing, as well as the expansion of the port city itself. By the eighteenth century, approximately twenty-five percent of the area of the river between the river and the river-levee was dedicated to farming, and in the nineteenth century, to the post-empire expansion of post-war commerce. In the twentieth century, the increase in shipping lanes and the commercial traffic that they engendered was secondary</text>

In time, the ship-builder’s charter itself began to be seen as something more than a contract between two parties. It became a legal entity independent of any particular government.The origins of the ship-builder’s charter, and its contemporary evolutionOver the course of the eighteenth century, creative forms of labour were incorporated into the fabric of everyday objects. The first textile factories opened in Liverpool, and with them, jobs for many people. From these, creative practices started to spread across the board of production, including the hands-on work that is characteristic of this period. All these new modes of labour created new kinds of identities for people in the city, and linked people’s movements with artistic practices that sought to capture their interest and make them part of a group. Art, and in particular painting, became more widely accessible, and the possibilities for artistic practice expanded. The arrival of ships at the dock also meant that much of what people called ‘the pleasure of the seas’ could be</text>

This is true both of the work by Kenny and of course of many other contemporary artworks including those produced by the curatorial or performanceality in its traditional form. But it is also true that many contemporary artists</text>

A potential alternative to the contemporary artist and theorist is the curatorial historian. This is not to suggest that there are not cultural resources that can be found in almost any museum or any archive, nor that the archival materials do not play a role in the production of culture and art, just as many art collections would admit that their primary purpose is cultural.  Another potential alternative is the artist and theorist herself, who could theoretically operate anywhere, is a global citizen and lives and works amongst us. Artist Jeanne van Heeswijk has worked for CNN, the BBC, the Agence France-Presse and is a regular pundit on current affairs. Her theory has been extensively referenced in the media, including in the film Zero Dark Thirty, about the Afghanistan war. Her work is an adaptation of a talk show that she produced</text>

At a time when art is routinely appropriated and politicised, it is imperative that contemporary artists and thinkers develop strategies to resist or respond to this risk-taking and create alternative social worlds and cultural formations through which our contemporary art can potentially exist in alternate and perhaps more favourable arrangements.  The contemporary curatorial process is a complex, uneven and unevenly applied system, and its practitioners are no more or less innovative or creative than any other art practitioners; rather, their work is often deeply constrained, lacking</text>

The latest iteration of Digital Abstract Covers (DECOs) is a good example of an emerging field that uses cutting-edge mathematical and computational fluid dynamics to produce socially responsive artworks through the modelling and visualization of large-scale flows of data.2  The aim of this work is to look backwards in time</text>
