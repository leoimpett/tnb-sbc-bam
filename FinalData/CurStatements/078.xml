The collaborative agencies would work with local grassroots artists, academics, artists’ unions and community organisers to create a new cultural landscape, creating opportunities for interaction between artists and the people of the city, creating new forms of labour and skills development along the city’s waterfront and creating new forms of public access to places and spaces previously excluded from or unclaimed by them. The biennial would take place in the city of which it’s based and call itself the official cultural venue of the UK’s capital. The proposed project would see the development of a new kind of biennial that will take into consideration not only the strengths and weaknesses of each institution, but also the local needs and priorities of the city, with an eye on the future. This kind of consideration is of great relevance in a city such as Liverpool, which is struggling to recover from the economic crisis and which, as a result, is experiencing a gentrification process that is reshaping the city’s waterfront and coastal spaces. The proposed project would see Liverpool’s seafront transformed into a new cultural venue, with significant parts of the waterfront becoming available for cultural purposes, occupying urban space and fuelling the biennial’s creativity.

The proposed project would see the activities of the collaborative agencies shifted from the confines of the biennial to the heart of the city, where local, state and national governments would all be keen to promote the project and its outcomes. The proposed biennial would introduce a new perspective on the potentialities of cultural tourism and the entanglements of tourism in the city. It would also see the potential for a city-wide arts and cultural tourism industry, advocating for the needs of locals and drawing artists and organisations from all over the world. Artist-organisations would be invited to apply for financial support for the city of Liverpool Biennial.  One could argue that the realisation of this kind of radical curatorial direction for community projects is still young, and that radical forms of cultural tourism still reign supreme in places like Liverpool. Still, the emergence of new art-centred initiatives around art sites and the waterfront, the creative perforations of young artists and the</text>

The proposed project would see the art centre develop into a new kind of cultural institution, with artists’ collective contracts ensuring that art is produced in close collaboration with community organisers, employing locally relevant artisans and craftsmen, employing young people’s creative professionals and ensuring that the cooperative’s future use would reflect the contribution of the local artists and community organisers. The cultural institutions and collaborative agencies would develop a shared language to communicate with each other and with the waterfront community, forming a new kind of understanding and a new kind of identity for the waterfront community. The biennial itself would further develop this sense of common purpose and shared purpose, adopting practices that promote interaction between artists and the public and forging new collaborations between artists and academics. The proposal was not written to meet the needs of the many, but to the needs of a few, in the sense that the many would encounter and appreciate. The many would then be able to work collectively and creatively</text>

This cultural renewal would see arts and cultural institutions recruited by the government to establish new cultural zones around the city, where they’d repurpose unused buildings and create new kinds of housing for people to live in. The zones would also see a collaboration between the city and the grassroots arts and cultural organisations to offer educational programmes in languages other than English to people who work in the art sector, providing skills-based learning opportunities for artists and encouraging artists to engage with the city in new ways.The concept of the biennial has changed a great deal in the last thirty years. The biennial was originally conceived as a curatorial tool, and the biennial today is a curatorial force, with a budget and a mandate to engage with the city in various ways. The biennial, in its current form, has little relationship to the original idea of the biennial, which was a gathering of curators working together over a lengthy period of time, over many different</text>

The proposed project would see a radical rethinking of how arts, community groups and grassroots artists are integrated into the urban fabric of the city, and a new kind of biennial that would put artists first, and architecture second. The proposed project would see the creation of a National Biennial Network, a Federally Administered Cultural Centre, and a new art institution jointly managed by the city and the biennial. The biennial would be formally known as the Architecture Biennial. The biennial would be jointly sponsored by the city and the biennial, and would be jointly accountable to the city and the biennial for both artistic and technical decisions, including the construction and maintenance of structures and works of art, and the administration of the land and buildings. The biennial would also commission local artists to create a new kind of art institution that would complement the activities of the biennial, while the city would take the lead in the regeneration of the waterfront area around the biennial, developing strategies</text>

The concept would see the creation of a new kind of biennial, one that’s 'in' the action, valuing the organic over the inorganic, the organic over the inorganic, and in this sense, the inevitable end result of such action being an increase in the numbers of visitors to the city. The proposed project would see the creation of a new kind of biennial, one that’s ‘in’ the city and global, and in this sense, in keeping with the goals of the Open Formacy Project.The Open Formacy Project was initiated in 2015 by the Biennial Council, Liverpool John Moores University, with the collaborative initiative ‘Informed Choice’ presented by the Biennial Council, Liverpool John Moores University, and AIB.

The creative projecks would see themselves as responding to the current political and economic situation in relation to the waterfront. They would see the need for long-term planning and collaborative action with local grassroots artists, academics, community organisers and waterfront community groups, as well as innovative proposals that draw on the knowledge of these organisations and local artists, taking into account the diverse needs and interests of the neighbourhood. The proposals would need to address the specific needs, priorities and interests of the neighbourhood, taking into account the expertise and skills of local artists, academics, artists’ union leaders and creative professionals. Local creative professionals would be welcomed, but the role of local creative professionals would need to be taken into consideration when developing the proposals, and this could include but is not limited to: planning and designing the waterfront; mapping, surveying, collecting and gathering expertise; research and data-gathering; public education and training; market research; marketing; public relations;</text>

The proposal was received with much enthusiasm, but much scepticism too. What was perceived as a threat to the current economic logic of the city, fuelled by the finance industry and political establishment, was seen by many artists and community organisers as a way to begin to redefine the cultural and neighbourhood logic of the contemporary city. What was perceived as an encroachment on existing cultural institutions and their activities, fuelled by the finance industry, was seen by some critics as a step backwards. Despite this great diversity of opinion and critique, the proposed project and its broad range of stakeholders, artists included, was seen by many in the art world as a good idea – even if it did cause some artists and community organisers some discomfort and hurt feelings.   	Artists and community organisers who expressed concerns about the potential displacement of traditionally black cultural institutions from the site of a biennial, and the consequent loss of potential audiences to destinations such as Miami or New York, were quick</text>

The report also mentions that one of the project’s co-chairs is Wendy Harpe, a lifelong Liverpool and Bournemouth borough artist who has worked in the area for many years. She was one of the curators of the Bournemouth Contemporary Art Biennale 2016, and has a longstanding engagement with the area.

There’s a reason why so many artists now come to New York and Mumbai and participate in their venues, and many of those venues are named after World War Z characters. 	There’s something very poetic about the naming of buildings after figures in the Zone: a black-hearted, ghoulish take on what the architects had imagined could be achieved by a city.

And the notion of what the World Bank had in mind, and still have in mind, is that kind of art would have to be defined and negotiated very carefully. There’d have to be mutual respect, and there’d have to be a reason for the differentiating elements to be removed. The problem with the contemporary art world is that it’s easy to become defined by the art that is being presented, and so when that kind of art is delivered by a public organisation, it’s delivered through a set of rules and constructs, but it lacks any kind of agency or capacity to imagine or act differently. Aspirations towards the idealised version of art they can deliver through their rules and constructions are great, but the real power of art – the kind that gets made and flows – resides in the hands of those who create those</text>

Sundblad used to paintin Kalamazoo, Michigan, but she stopped doing that when she realised how precarious her projects were. In 2010, she decided to return to the Kalamazoo waterfront and start over, this time from the perspective of an artist. She called it  	Future City. Her project would involve  	indigenous communities, local and national artists, as well as shipping companies and shipping institute of the day  	Future Shipbuilding. The idea was to find ways to bring artistic activity back into the lives of these communities through the creation of places that are less like factories and more like cities with a mix of cultural institutions and commercial enterprises.  	Her project would be  	a way</text>

The notion of what constitutes an art institutionally or politically is completely absent in this analysis. I think the gallery has always been the locus of a specialised imagination, and the micro-institution the locus of a wider public. It’s been a locus of colonialism, of capitalist modernity, of commodity fetishisation and production, of course. But that was the extent of what the gallery was to do. The museum was the battlefield of a revolutionary public. It was where people engaged with history, fought for democracy, and so forth. But while the gallery and micro-institution would each have their own particular way of organising that history, the fundamental ethos of the gallery and micro-institution would be fundamentally tied together.

These three broad domains of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. In order to exert political influence, the state needed an enormous budget of infrastructure projects, which in turn, needed to be nongrouped and distributed across geographically dispersed populations. Steiner proposed a decentralized, locally managed economy for infrastructure development, based on property and labour. Labor was to be produced by workers in exchange for housing and other services, and the exchange would take place on community and linguistic grounds. This formulation of exchange as community property emerged as the guiding principle of the new ‘right to the city’ movement.  This formulation of ‘the city’ as community property also appeared in the book I was writing at the time, Building the Future We Owned by Renee Ikenstone.

These three broad domains of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. In order to exert political influence, the state needed an image of overwhelming urban destructiveness, which could then be used as a pretext to withdraw state support from the culture sector. Steiner’s three-level ‘crisis of urbanisation’ image was used as a pretext to re-brand the rural sector as a glamorous suburban paradise, where everything was manufactured to a futuristic standard of beauty. In other words, the image of the wrecked city was re-imagined in terms of the apocalyptic destruction that could be wrought by a nuclear war.  	In the summer of 2014, a team of researchers led by Dr Katherine Shear at Goldsmiths, University of London, embarked on a year-long, multi-disciplinary survey of the city’s infrastructure and cultural assets.5  Their findings, published in Science Advances, reflected the hopes of many that the destruction wrought by decades of industrial neglect could nevertheless somehow be reversed through technological innovation.

In order to exert political influence, the state needed an image of overwhelming urban destructiveness, and ‘Citizen’ was the perfect image to convey that impression. 	Within a few years, ‘Citizen’ had entered the canon of vernacular arts  illustrations, and was being readopted into the canon of classic works of art, being quoted by artists as a title of the exhibition, and being imagined as an actual city. Now, almost a quarter of a century after its publication, its status as a canonical art essay is questionable, and its current status as a canonical urban document is even less certain. 	Still, it is notable that after the art world turned against the biennial, in the early 1990s, the biennial returned to its former popular venue, Tokyo Railway Station, where it staged several major revivals under the title Planet Hollywood. The return of the biennial to the city it first appeared in in, in the form of a yearly show, was accompanied by a similar rev</text>

These three broad domains of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. In order to exert political influence, the state needed an enormous infrastructure – a ‘citizen army’ – which could then be mobilized in support of the bureaucracy’s political agenda. From its earliest stages, the Citizen movement was directed against privatizing infrastructure, which was seen as essential for the bureaucratic logic of Japanese capitalism. Steiner’s three levels of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. As a consequence, the organised working class emerged as the potent social force for democratic change in Japan. During the 1970s and 1980s, the NOMADIC Party emerged as the dominant political force in Japan, and the emergence of the Mechanical Workers Party represented a critical turning point for the working class. Steiner’s three-tier theory of cultural power then shifted to a four-tier theory of social power, in which the urbanised worker became the locus of democratic participation</text>

These three broad domains of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. In order to exert political influence, the state needed an enormous infrastructure of transport, from railways to transalpine tunnels. In the event of a nuclear war, this infrastructure would need to be remade in large part through the adoption of new technology, which in turn would make possible new forms of cultural power. Steiner’s three levels of cultural power then converge on two levels: the level of cities and, in particular, of the level of nations. At the level of the city, the city becomes a computer model of the biennale; citizens of a city live and act like actors on a stage, albeit citizens of a different city. Steiner’s ‘metainterface’ refers to the fact that the biennale is now rather than in the past, and so the capacities of cities to sustain the ecological and urban functions that Steiner envisioned, including the ecological functions of nationhood. Steiner’s ‘tragedy of the commons’ brings to mind the tragedy of the commons</text>

These three broad domains of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. In order to exert political influence, the state needed an image of overwhelming urban devastation in order to justify the construction of enormous new highways and the expansion of rail networks. So, the image of the wrecked city was strategically important. As the world-renowned architect Atsuko Tanaka once wrote, ‘The human figure is only an approximation to the destructive might of the automobile’.5 Transportation was then placed at the centre of political, economic and social life in Japan, and the automobile at the very least provided a vehicle for symbolic political and economic influence. As a ‘metabolism of the atom’, the automobile represented the breaking down of scale, with its combustion of fuel at a phenomenal rate symbolising the world economy.6 The automobile is a powerful tool, capable of transporting vast amounts of goods and people at phenomenal speeds. Yet in its current form, its intended applications – which are confined to the urban centres – are finding limited use in the vast majority of the planet. The automobile is a tool, and</text>

In order to exert political influence, the state needed an image of overwhelming  	universityency, which could then be interpreted in favour of the national interests. Steiner’s three levels of cultural power then generated a complex set of regulatory measures, some of which I have previously described. For this article, I will concentrate on the level of symbolic power generated by the level of cultural identity.5  To return to Tokyo, let’s look at the city’s many paradoxes. Some of these are intrinsic to the city, like the fact that, as the title of this article suggests, it is a city with a ‘kata’ (a name given to the ritualised, denoted-out rituals of its Buddhist monks), where the very name of the city conjures up images of purity and serenity. But the more obvious the contradictions are – let’s say, the more apparent the inequalities between rich and poor, between those who call home and those who do not – the</text>

These three broad domains of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. In order to exert political influence, the state needed an image that could claim credit for the design of a new urban infrastructure. In the event of a nuclear attack, this image would be appropriated and a new urban infrastructure would be built according to the claims of a militarised bureaucracy. The new infrastructure would then have to be shared – sufficiently, in fact – with other countries, international organisations and international corporations. In other words, the logic of the new urban infrastructure would be global in character, and would seek to be shared between all the participants.  	In the 1960s, the avant garde in art and design was a counterweight to the massive bureaucracies of state power. The large corporation, which had seized control of the art world, responded by turning art into a commodity that could be seized and held by the state. Art was seen as a way to exert political leverage in the form of protest, dissent and social destabilisation. However, the new urban infrastructure that emerged following the bomb was built on protest as a tactic, and</text>

These three broad domains of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. In order to exert political influence, the state needed an image of overwhelming force and destructiveness. So it commissioned a ‘military gallery’, which presented both the structural and the decorative elements of the hyperurban infrastructure that would support its expansion. Steiner also proposed a plan to build an entirely new military museum, to be named after the fictional ‘Citizen’, which would exhibit the museum’s extraordinary feats of industrial and bureaucratic power in all of its splendor and complexity. Finally, the museum’s colour photograph would be taken up the Tokyo sky, and a new generation of skywatchers would be taught how to fly kites. Across the board, Steiner’s three-level ‘Citizen’ was perceived as the ideal site for a new museum, while the fourth and final level – the actual museum – was seen as unsuitable for several reasons, including the intense urbanisation and commercial sprawl that would inevitably follow a museum, but also the rise of a new strata of</text>

These three broad domains of cultural power then converged in a crisis of the urbanising bureaucracy of Japan, in the form of a nationwide crisis of traffic in fuel. In order to exert political influence, the state needed an image of overwhelming destructiveness in order to be able to fund the war effort. So, the question is what image could be created? In the event of a full-scale war, the state could of course opt to actively objectify the urbanised citizenry through policies of housing and social exclusion. As a response to this, artists and arts organizations began to create participatory arts practices, where people worked together to shape the urban environment through strategies of design and architecture. These practices not only provided a platform to explore new ways of living in urban environments, but also engaged people in a way that was responsive to the specific objectives of the state. A great example of this is the New Urban Adventures (YES! Curatorial Architecture, 1964–67) project led by Ryunosuke Yamashita and Kenji Kimura, which sought to reconcile the goals of the state with the actual practices of building in an urban area through ‘design wonders’ that could be assembled from materials collected in</text>

Therefore it is critical for the public to be able to quantify the extent of such damage, and thus affordably access such information. 	Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world, such as cracks forming on bridges, tunnels or buildings, and thus repair or rebuild such infrastructure as needed. Such repair could include either structural changes to the overlying infrastructure, such as painting, revetting or retrofitting, or it may be possible to alter the behaviour of such systems, such as planting GPS-tagged trees or changing the composition of the soil around critical infrastructure, such as bridges and tunnels. 	Such potential impacts are only possible because of the advent of 3D ‘liquid-liquid inkjet’ printers, which harness the kinetic energy of the movement of matter to create ‘particles’ on a chip level. These ‘particles’ then hit the prototyping substrate at extremely high speeds, breaking the interface into fragments and sending the fragments spiraling towards the cathode. In this way, the printer ‘fires off bursts of particles’ in an effort to reach every possible part of the system, repairing or rebuilding what it perce</text>

Therefore it is critical for the public to be able to quantify the extent of such damage, and thus affordably access such information. 	Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world, such as cracks in infrastructure or abnormal behaviour in infrastructure repair personnel, and act accordingly. For example, cracks in the Flint River can be repaired by injecting cement or rockcrete into the river, and then monitoring its condition with radar. If the cracks are identified and repaired, the repair can occur much more rapidly and inexpensively. 	Similarly, monitoring and repairing the effects of mining operations can be automated, and thus access to this critical infrastructure may be available much more rapidly. In this sense, automated systems play a critical role in supporting the public good. 	In sum, the  	use of 3D modelling to repair infrastructure is enabling and empowering; it allows for the design and development of alternative infrastructure options, and it opens new frontiers for public-private partnership. 	Finally, 3D modelling may be used to reconstruct physically destroyed or damaged infrastructure, enabling the creation of ‘smart' alternatives that maximise the public good while minimising conflicts between public and private providers</text>

Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world, and exploit this latent potential for energy to repair infrastructure. 	For instance, in a major flooding in the UK in April 2016, which killed 58 people and displaced over 4 million, engineers were able to repair half the coastline with relatively cheap and renewable energy by replanting trees on reclaimed land and encouraging local communities to adopt a 'river+scrubbery' farming model for ‘infrastructure repair’.8 	Such self-healing infrastructure may be seen as a fundamentally useful technology, providing critical resistance to the destructive tendency of large corporations. But as we know from the Flint water crisis, it is not always so. In fact, as infrastructure repair becomes more sophisticated and expensive, local people's participation in the renewal process diminishes. Often times, participation is discouraged or even eliminated altogether by vested interests. Such is the case with infrastructures in the UK, where decisions to purchase electricity are overwhelmingly made by market forces, but citizens are only rarely consulted or empowered with</text>

Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world, such as cracks in pavement or cracks in buildings, and exploit this latent potential to repair or rebuild infrastructure in the immediate vicinity. Such repair may be done using existing infrastructure repair practices, or it may employ advanced computer modelling and algorithm development to detect and repair such cracks using existing infrastructure knowledge. In the latter case, the repair may be performed using existing infrastructure repair techniques and data, at a cost per kWh of approximately $0.01. 	Such repair may be performed at a scale and in the vicinity of the site of the anomaly, or it may be performed using environmental data and repair techniques derived from the autonomous  	maker. In either case, the implied economic value of such technology is assumed to be minimal.

Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world, such as cracks in infrastructure, gaps in infrastructure, and physically untenable behaviour such as human waste accumulating in infrastructure cavities and onto nearby property lines. If such behaviour is detected, corrective action can be taken, such as partial or full replacement of cavities or the partial rehabilitation of infrastructure.  	In an ideal world, such information sharing between the public and private sector would eliminate the need for publics to be consulted, because the 3D modelling would already have caused such damage. However, due to the inherent political, economic and legal antagonisms between the public sector and the  	non-public sector, such information sharing rarely happens. 	In the US, for example, the National Public Works Task Force (2007–09) included the Michigan Turnpike and Michigan Central Railway in its advisory council, which were both Republicans until 2010, when the Michigan Citizens Commission on Government Reforms (2011–13) and the Michigan Municipal League (2014–present) formed to</text>

Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world, such as cracks in infrastructure or irregular movement of material in buildings, and exploit this latent potential to repair or renovate. Such repair could involve breaking up material or even removing material altogether, in much the same way that engineers break up oil into smaller components to be used in building materials. 	Such self-healing infrastructure is analogous to the way in which DNA is read, and could therefore lead to new business models for the publishing of repair manuals or repair information on buildings. 	Such repair instructions could be incorporated into publishing processes or incorporated directly into the publishing itself, allowing the reuse of the building stock once the repair has been performed. For example, the ability to readjust materials or even remove them entirely, as is currently done with oil by the industry, would make it possible to repair cracks caused by leaks in the North Dakota Bakken oil extraction well. Such self-healing infrastructure would be similar to the way in which DNA is read, in that it uses existing materials and</text>

Such self-healing infrastructure is a potentially game-changing development, enabling not only new uses of infrastructure but also new uses of infrastructure that is more resilient to damage than the current infrastructure is. Such innovative engineering may be used to repair not only infrastructure but also may lead to new uses of infrastructure, such as new uses for oil from fracking. 	In a forthcoming issue of Scientific Reports, Volume 9 of the Scientific Reports Working Papers series is planning to examine in depth the emerging 3D-based repair paradigm for bridges, tunnels, power grids and other infrastructure damage. Over the past years, research and development on this theme has taken place in the UK and other parts of the world. Future working paper may focus on the US or other parts of the world.

The potential applications of 3D modelling are endless, but the most immediate impact may be felt in the area of infrastructure repair. Although it may seem counterintuitive, the use of 3D modelling can also be used to repair infrastructure damage caused by natural disasters, such as floods, droughts and storms. In areas where there is widespread destruction, such as in Flint, Michigan, for example, the potential recovery time from a major disaster may be extended by a few months or even a few years. In these instances, it is important to note that infrastructure repair is a multi-year process, and as a result is inherently unstable. Therefore it is critical for the public to be able to quantify the extent of such damage, and thus affordably access such information. 	Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world, and exploit that understanding to repair damage before it is too late. Such self-healing infrastructure is at the root of  	  	potential future urban regeneration projects, which may well become what Henry A. Reclaiming and James H. Gilmore call ‘global cities’. 	In these scenarios, the use of fossil fuels and industrial waste cannot exist in tranquillity, since this would mean annihilating both ‘snow and ice’ in the process. Instead, the dominant form of urban regeneration today is driven by business as usual, in which ever more stringent pollution controls are placed on the ‘playground’ by virtue of its being ‘soft’ and ‘playable’ (recreational) terrain. Any urban space that is too heavily populated places a 'show ground’ in the hands of developers and large corporations, who in turn bid for government contracts and financial support.

Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world, such as cracks forming on infrastructure or cracks in concrete, and thus repair the infrastructure in real-time. In principle, such repair could also address issues of hygiene and sanitation, as well as the effects of geo-thermal activity. 	In principle, the ability to repair infrastructure is a last resort, and in the event of a crisis it is imperative that swift action is taken to evacuate as many people as possible to safety. In the event of a crisis, the ability to evacuate may prove critical. In the event that evacuation proves impossible, and if the area is heavily forested and prone to landslides, sandbags may be deployed to cushion the fall of large volumes of soil and rock, while automated watchtowers provided high visibility and disrupted enemy communications. 	Such systems may be deployed in large urban areas where large amounts of debris are a problem, in an attempt to minimise the impact of a natural disaster. However, due to the fragility of such urban infrastructure,</text>

Once 3D modelling is enabled, autonomous repair systems are able to detect anomalies in the physical world around them, and thus repair themselves. 	Such self-healing infrastructure is a boon to citizens, ushering in a new era of robust, environmentally sustainable infrastructure repair. It relieves the need for large corporations to be involved in the creation or reconstruction of infrastructure, freeing up resources for other uses. It also reduces the likelihood that massive amounts of funding from elsewhere, if any, will be required to rebuild infrastructure when it is needed most. 	Such innovative thinking is nothing new for 3D modelling, but the advancements made in the area of infrastructure repair in the past few years are noteworthy for their efficiency, reducing repair times from months to minutes, and allowing for the detection and repair of large scale damage at a microscopic scale. 	For example, in a study of derailments caused by the growing volume of container traffic, engineers at the British Transport Police investigated over 1,000 vessels at Heathrow, and identified over 1,000 that needed to be repaired, with a particular focus</text>

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations of one particular set of forces: urban growth, neoliberalism, and also the money that it generates. They were also the direct result of a political choice: having been elected to a city council, the ultra-nationalists who sit on the local council, and the businessmen who sit on the global financial commission, decided to take matters of preserving the harbour apart, and to use the council’s money to buy luxury condos and other infrastructure improvements. In doing so, they created a precedent for other localised street protests, and set in motion a chain of events that has now turned into a full-blown urban uprising. 	The use of political power and economic incentives can be used to achieve transformative change, but it is much more effective and socially productive to employ violence and acquire control of the means of production via outright force.

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations of neoliberalism and its discontents. The increasing number of tourists and migrants has put enormous pressure on the infrastructure that is Turkey’s infrastructure, and the metropolis that it supports. The metropolis is increasingly the site of conflict, as it is served up by multinational corporations as a source of cheap labour, capital and food. The metropolis is a source of growth for multinational corporations, but its growth depends on a complex interdependent set of forces that are often times quite contradictory and even contradictory as to where these profits might lead. The metropolis is a complex site of possibility, and the proliferation of modes of consumption and exchange has contributed to create a complex situation for those who call the city home. However, the proliferation of consumption and exchange does not necessarily result in growth; nor does it necessarily result in a flourishing of social life.

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations of capitalism. But the depredations that followed Gezi are still being felt, and will be for some years yet. Market forces and the new technological revolution are fuelling a capitalist city’s growth, but they are also exerting increasingly intense political and social pressures on the city to meet consumer needs. The city government, despite its obvious failings and immense costs, is proposing to spend around 3.8 trillion reals (2014 dollars) to rebuild itself, which is almost four times the size of the G8 nations combined. And this is just for the outer harbourfront. The city is to be expanded at a rate of 469,000 houses a year, which will double the current rate of construction. 	In the coming years, when the cost of building will double, the rapid expansion of the city’s infrastructure will be used to meet the gap between demand and supply.

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations caused by an irresponsible and capital-intensive urbanisation agenda. They were instigated by a fringe political ideology, but have become the pivotal narrative of the present urbanisation project in Istanbul. The city’s Gezi Park movement sought to protect and promote the ecological and historic values of the Ecuadorean Cultural Centre from being destroyed by a mega development project proposed by the state-owned Real Estate Board, which was characterised by an obsession with new buildings and a quest for cash. The project was characterised by a neoliberal transformation of the economy through deregulation, the privatisation of assets and the off-setting of costs. The result is that the economic struggles of the 1980s are intimately tied to the struggles of the 1990s, and the current urbanisation project in Istanbul is characterised by recurrent catastrophes caused by an in excess of resources fuelled by ever-expanding public spending.

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations of capitalism and are not the outcome of any artistic or social rebellion. The Turkish government actively promoted the idea that Gezi Park was a ‘spring’ or a ‘summer’ of sorts – a time for citizen activism and the reclamation of public spaces. In reality, the park is a sprawling compound built on top of a former zoo and circus, itself a former university campus. It is a mix of public and ‘private’ spaces, with limited public access. As such, it underwent a kind of urban-planning metamorphosis, becoming something that was both politically incorrect (to call the park a city) and incredibly profitable for the city. The park’s transformation came as a consequence of two things in particular, one of which was the urban-dynamics textbook by George J. Borjas: the floating-average rule. This rule states that the greater the increase in Area Median Income (the ‘adjusted’ amount</text>

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations of capitalism. But as the city shrinks in size and shape, and as its economies of movement become more fragmented and variable, the need for Gezi Park in particular becomes more urgent. The city council’s unwillingness to rein in its bloated and wasteful executive branch, which is responsible for policing the city, is another obstacle standing in the way of progress made through direct action. 	‘The indignados were not going to change anything.’ – David Harvey 	The indignados were not going to change anything. David Harvey, The Guardian, 2015 	The story of the 2014 Gezi Park protests is a story of resistance, but also of complicity.

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredation of biodiversity on the city’s shoreline. The city’s decline is now the dominant factor affecting the planet as a whole. The prospect of a future for which the inhabitants of Istanbul are not solely dependent by the desire of a few rich individuals is rapidly diminishing. 	As a result of these and other factors, Istanbul’s shoreline is becoming increasingly difficult to access for tourists, and the number of international cruise lines has risen rapidly in the intervening years. The city’s international cruise trade is estimated to be worth over $3 billion per year. These figures do not include the value of the infrastructure built on the shoreline to support the trade, or the value added by the trade itself – either as cargo or tourists. It is clear that these two types of tourism generate substantially different revenues for the governments with which they engage.

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations of neoliberalism and its discontents. They became a rallying cry for a public frustrated with declining living standards, political complacency, and other urban trends, and looking for a break from the urban juggernaut. The public response to these protests was explosive, and the number of homeless and homeless camps reignited interest in the place. The number of homeless people in Istanbul has reportedly swelled since the start of 2011, reaching over 10,000 in some places. The growing homeless crisis has put increasing pressure on already limited public resources, and it is placing even greater strains on already-stretched infrastructure. The growing homeless crisis is a direct result of the depredations of neoliberalism, but it is also a symptom of a much deeper political imbalance and malaise. Cities are no longer the be-all and end-all of urban development, but rather are tools that assist in the management of scarcity.

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations of capitalism. The financialization of urban environments worldwide is a constant source of conflict. But in Istanbul, and in other megacities of the world, the conflict is most apparent in the absence of political agency for citizens to take matters of their urban environments into their own hands. In fact, the historical tendency has been for mega-regimes to engage in politically-engaged initiatives such as park rants, but these usually emerge as a response to an aggressive or police-state-like state power grab. The ongoing, but somewhat hidden, negotiations between the Turkish government and the military over the fate of Istanbul’s Gezi Park are a good example of this. Early in the negotiations, the Turkish government makes it clear that it intends to keep the park as a major tourist attraction, and to actively recruit local tourism into the new economic machine that it has been developing in response to the park’s ongoing decline.

The Gezi Park protests that began in 2011 are a direct result of the depredations of neoliberalism. They were sparked by a perceived injustice in the city’s treatment of its poor residents, which were seen as assets by the state. The response was brutal. Some have claimed that the police were involved in instigating the protests; however, there is strong evidence to suggest that the military turned a blind eye, or played a role in the violence that ensued. The most sensational allegation is that the Turkish Army was engaged in a ‘wartime’ against ‘terror’ suspects; however, this is simply false; a government commission was setup to investigate the incident, and its conclusions have never been made public. 	The current government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan is trying to implement a series of laws that will make it easier to dissolve local councils and create new ones; these laws were already hurting neighbourhoods of Istanbul, and will probably be even harder still in places like Istanbul. The new laws will make it easier to remove protected areas from municipal boundaries, and</text>

Whitney Biennial 2017 market research indicates a strong preference for the products of the San Diego-based biennial, with a strong focus on its chief export, luxury, cultural products, including a large number of entries drawn from the US. The market research firm, market maker Archa, reports that the average price of a US-made luxury goods brand goods (retail and social) increased by 78% during the 2017 holiday shopping season, driven by three factors: (1) the strong dollar; (2) the strong Mexican peso; and (3) the strong political situation in the US. Whitney Biennial 2017 market research indicates a preference for women‐oriented luxury goods over their male counterparts. A majority of the female luxury goods, including over half (54%) of the entries in the products category, were created or influenced by Brazilian women.

I have had numerous conversations with the US government about the project, and have a longstanding relationship with the US attorney general, Eric Holder, who is the head of the DOJ's antitrust division. The fact that we are both artists and designers means that we’re in a unique position to be able to think through solutions to difficult social and political issues.

The Biennial is the most internationally visible of the three exhibitionsary categories, and its market capital is estimated at over $100 billion. Its status as an institution of interdisciplinary inquiry and destination is further enhanced by the fact that, in the last twenty years, it has become increasingly apparent that the biennial has entered a new period of unprecedented national and localisation. For the second consecutive year, the Biennial will select a curator from each of its three geographical regions: North, Central and South America. The curator’s initial research is carried out in each region, and the two regions will be visited together. The relationship between the two forms of region is further developed through a symposium, during which the regional identities of each region are discussed. The relationship between biennials and specific cities is further questioned. The idea of the biennial as a cultural institution is constantly reviewed. For this reason, it is constantly in danger of becoming what it really is: a transient museum of transient interest. It is time to develop a new system of cultural resources, to create an institution that will survive and thrive in</text>

It is dedicated to the study and exhibition of art and the social significance of art as a political tool. It is a not-for-profit organisation, and its mission is to celebrate and present the cultural resources and designs of Uruguay, especially in the language of social impact.

The Biennial is the most internationally visible of the three exhibitionsary categories, and its market capital is estimated at over $8 billion. It is a frequent critic of the economic and social conditions of life in the US and abroad, and in 2017 will be publishing its eighth issue of the journal Stages on the topic ‘The End of Postcolonialism’. It will also be publishing a series of nine books on topics spanning from biennials to archipelagos. In 2017, the Biennial will be celebrating its fifteenth anniversary. The Biennial has long been a site of contestation over the meaning of images and the celebration of an ideology. In 1996, Ingres and her fellow artists Maté M ­Salas and Peter Schjeldahl launched a counterattack, when Schjeldahl exhibited Ingres’ self in a painting entitled In Defense of Postmodern Painting. In the years that followed, artists, curators, writers and arts administrators gathered in Istanbul to discuss how the Biennial constituted a modern art museum and a contemporary art archive. In 2017, the contest will be</text>

The Biennial is the most internationally visible of the three exhibitionsary categories, and its market capital is estimated at over $100 million. It is a globally visible institution, exhibiting internationally, and at the San Diego Biennial, internationally visible. Its exhibition catalogue is published yearly in various periodicals; the most recent issue was published in June 2017. The Biennial is automatically registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and is a founding member of the World Heritage Network. It is the only biennial to have been so named. The Biennial was founded in New York in 1974 as part of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), and continues to be led by Emeritus Professor Emeritus Maurizio Lazzarato. It was previously led by Emeritus Professors Steven Cairns and Gerald Notz.The Biennial was one of the earliest and longest-running art biennials in the US, and was the subject of Geoff Cox’s work and documentary, The Biennial Industry (1986).

The Biennial is the most internationally visible of the three exhibitionsary categories, and its market capital is estimated at over $5 billion. While its market capital is massive (in 2013 dollars), its actual worth is much less: in 2013, the Biennial produced $2.8 million in sales and $4.5 million in souvenirs, mostly gifts. Its market share in the biennial market was around 20–30%. Its aim is to produce permanent artworks that last for a set number of years and are returned to their place of origin. The Biennial is a US-registered non-profit cultural institution, and is chartered as a separate trade organisation under the Structural Funds. It aims to produce permanent artworks through partnerships with a diverse range of partner organisations, with a particular focus on those embedded in the local communities. The Biennial is chartered as a Trade and Investment Corporation, and its mission is to encourage the development and exploration of new art forms through research, analysis and review. It also acts as a mediator between art institutions and communities, promoting participation and exchange between the two</text>

The Biennial is the most internationally visible of the three exhibitionsary categories, and its market capital is estimated at over $100 million. Its regular exhibits, both traditonal and commissioned, are sold out year-round. Its market capital is estimated at over $1 billion. This assessment is based on information provided by the Biennial to the US Department of State’s Museum Research and Information Services (MERS) in 2014, and on personal conversations with two senior officials of the US embassy in Montevideo. The market capitalisation of the Biennial is highly questionable, since the US government has shown an unwillingness to declassify the market research it conducted on the city in 2014, and the market has again refused to participate in the current political process in Uruguay. The market capitalisation of the Biennial is much more reliable a source of information than that of other art venues, such as museums or collectors, because it is a self-perpetuating business that receives regular funding from fees paid by the art buyers in the city.

The Biennial is the most internationally visible of the three exhibitionsary categories, and its market capital is estimated at over $4 billion. It is the most valuable of the three categories, because of the vast amounts of cultural product produced in the country. Its long-term growth depends on a combination of government and non-government investment; a large share of which is provided by the biennial itself. In addition to the direct investment of US$20 million, the Biennial has hired an international art firm, GFAC, to help it expand internationally.7 	As a biennial, it is the most visible and commercially viable of the three categories, and its status is determined by the number of consecutive weeks it can sell out of New York.8 	Its market capital is estimated at over $1 billion.9 	The Biennial market cap is set at US$6 billion, while the biennial market capital is set at US$50 million.10  	The main attraction of the biennial is its status as a ‘main’ exhibitionary form, which implies a</text>

In such cases, it is imperative that the technologies are put into practice and disseminated as widely as possible, lest we create autonomous zones where terrorism is a concern and become like Vietnam or Iraq, where self-healing biofuels compete against one another for limited resources.This is the context in which we can start to look at the role of localities in the future city of the future, or in other words, in the present urban city. We can start to imagine what a future city would look like if the social, spatial and economic components of the city were taken into account in the creation of the city. How would the city interact with its inhabitants? Would it be run by large corporations or would it be run by grassroots groups with simple needs? What kinds of public realm would emerge? What kinds of public realm would be created through direct democracy? How would the role of the citizen change? These are the kinds of questions that can lay bare technocratic pretenses and set us</text>

The proliferation of renewable energy resources has meant that cities are able to absorb the impacts of technological change, and technological change is expected to continue unabated. But the availability of cheap energy also means that development must compete on a price, and that means keeping projects viable at a price. And while a price may be an option, it is likely to become increasingly difficult to maintain a competitive price in the face of ever-deepening social inequality and geopolitical tensions. So while it may be possible to look to the future with artificial intelligence and automate certain tasks, the ability to do so will become increasingly important. And if those tasks become automated, then the social costs may well become unmanageable. So while it is not realistic to assume that all aspects of urban life will be automated, it is possible to say with some confidence that parts</text>

That said, the pace of technological innovation and competition is such that companies with research and development capabilities are stretched thin, and even those with disruptive technologies – like 3D printing – have a hard time justifying or justifying their presence in a city, let alone a region. With the exception of specialist defence and surveillance agencies, most urban centres are now experiencing a level of change that is neither rapid nor unprecedented. And although technological innovations are inherently disruptive, they have to be put into practice in order to yield the desired effect; otherwise, nothing can be done with the resulting wealth. In other words, the pace of technological innovation and competition is limited, and the role of the city is to some extent to accommodate these disruptive technologies and accommodate new modes of interaction.This dynamic can be seen in other areas of technology-use, as well. The extent to which cars driven by passengers are automated is increasing every day; the ability of cars to read and process data is becoming increasingly sophisticated; and the number of cars on the road is increasing inexhaustibly. It is true that in recent years there has been a marked upsurge in interest in environmentally friendly cars, and particularly in the area of exhaust-pipe modification; but these technologies are advancing at such a rate that</text>

This is perhaps why areas with very high potential returns on investment – places where the social and economic benefits can be maximised – are also places with the highest environmental footprints. These are the places with the highest human and labour costs – hence the high-return investment required to justify such potentialities. And while this is undoubtedly true of new technologies, the social and economic benefits of such technologies also need to accrue in perpetuity. New technologies are born, and work their magic. But in order to live realities on a larger scale, they need to be put into practice. That is, in order to accrue the social and environmental benefits and also to</text>

The mass-produced fish feeders that proliferated in these ports also acted as a major prop in supporting the growth of the railroads, which in turn expanded the geography of the port city and its traffic patterns. The emergence of new modes of transport and travel made it easier for people to get around the ports, which in turn boosted the local economy. The emergence of international ports as major tourist draws in the twentieth century is often cited as a reason for their development. But these factors – the development of international trade routes, the expansion of international ports and their attendant trade flows – came with a cost, both in terms of lost tourism and income, and so the need for regulation and bureaucracy soon became a major</text>

The tech industry is making progress, but it is slowing down. Environmental destruction and disruption are part of the routine, but now that there are cheaper and more accessible renewable energies, there is a pressure on the environment and society to shift to more sustainable forms of behaviour. The challenge for technologists like myself is to be creative and imaginative in the choices we make, based on the knowledge we have, and to react to the inevitable conflicts of transition. For the city to truly transition, society has to embrace a new mode of urban existence that is not dependent on the industrial form of city building and function as a co-producing ecosystem. That is, of course, if such modes are to exist at all.We are living through a pivotal moment for the future of cities. The advent of 3D printing technology is the tipping point that enables us to create entirely new forms of housing, which in turn enables a new form of urban development everywhere we turn. Cities will have to</text>

At times, this cultural exchange can be quite violent. In San Francisco, for example, art is frequently physically removed from its designated site by city government employees in an effort to make way for new developments, which in turn, severely disrupts the cultural exchange taking place on the city's historic Seventh Street. And just as the art is often damaged in the process, so too is the social life generated by it. As a result, the cultural exchange between artists and the city is often compromised in order to accommodate the new developments and the increasingly dominant economic forms of the metropolis.This dynamic has been illustrated by the art world in two ways. The first is the work of artist Ai Weiwei. In 2013, Ai Weiwei and a team of artists occupied the site of Kunsthal Aarhus, Copenhagen, Denmark, from September 2012 to April 2013</text>

For example, if every material in the 3D biopolymer material set was incorporated into a single building material, the impact on building material usage could be reduced by up to 90% compared to the original, non-collaborating material. This materiality comes at a cost though, of course. The materiality comes at a price; the disruptive technologies that are part of this latest batch of nano- and nano-scale biopolymers are expelling huge amounts of pollution into the environment, and the materials they are made from are polluting the planet with their carbon emissions.

The name came from the Cass Business School 's (Cubs) '80s pop-punk song '80s Radiance of Blooms', written by Lori Sklar and featuring the music of The Who. The ‘cubes’ refer to the fact that much of the growth in the region has been fueled by trade between local firms, which in turn is fueled by the activity of low-wage service providers like trucking companies. The use of semi-autonomous vehicles is another popular occupation – one that is largely automated – but the Rust Belt sees a significant expansion in the use of robotics.

Such technologies might enable new kinds of social interaction between people and structures, in which parts made by machines interact with one another in ways that are not mutually exclusive and in which social, economic and political systems are challenged. They might enable new forms of collaboration between people and non-human entities, including between humans and non-human technological systems. One might even argue that such technologies empower not only the person or organisation that creates them but also the non-human users of those technologies: namely, communities of people and communities of places.I came away from my talk at the Technological University of Denmark with the conviction that there are technologies available now that can make a big impact in the world of work, and that there are</text>

For example, the algorithm might recognise a document that contains the word ‘assistant’ followed by three paragraphs that begin with the word ‘assistant’ and end with the word ‘detection’. These three sections could then be split into two parts, which could then be split even further into two parts, and so on. The idea is that the document is assembled from many fragments that come together to make a larger whole. In this way, the layers that make up the document – the inflection, the structure and the meaning that emerges from them – are unseen and unspoken.

But as the Chartist Society has shown, the adoption of new technologies is also associated with an explosion of new professions. That is, the more natural-language processing and document-processing tools are incorporated into everyday objects and processes, the more jobs they create.  The emergence of automated text and image processing in the 1990s led to a revolution in how legal scholars viewed legal texts, and the proliferation of legal-sector journals that regularly published innovative and original work. But as the technology behind these publications advanced, so too did the number of lawyers required, and the number of law reviews required, which inevitably crowded out the legal scholars who were then able to devote sufficient time to reviewing the books and tomes produced by their colleagues.  And so it continues to this day: lawyers writing for themselves and for institutions around the country and the world, academics writing for a client base that increasingly includes non-lawyers, journalists turning to poetry and critical legal writing, law schools turning to legal research and so on. As a result, the number of jobs in the legal profession has continually increased, and some might even say ranks have</text>

But as the Chartist Society has shown, the adoption of new technologies is also associated with an explosion of new professions. That is, the more legal professionals adopt them, the bigger impact they have. This is perhaps why adoption rates for such technologies are so exuberant: people are seduced by the promise of a better job, more income, more freedom – especially if those claims are based on fads and fads, or on the fad of the moment.Such claims are often based on the notion that the technology is somehow more malleable and can be leveraged to deliver positive outcomes for society at large. But this is not at all what happens. The technology is inherently a ‘marketplace of possibility’. People need to know how to use it properly to make sure that claims based on hunches and biases are realised. And what happens when those claims are not realised is another point of contention. It is commonly claimed that the adoption of self-driving cars will mean the end of legal loopholes, but this is also not at all what has happened. Rather, the goal of such cars</text>

But as the Chartist Society has shown, the adoption of new technologies is also associated with an explosion of new professions. That is, the more of these technologies one abjures, the more one becomes an expert in them. The more one adopts and relies on them, the more knowledge they give, the more power they wield, the more money they make and so forth. The fundamental question, then, remains what sorts of relations between the law and the technologies that create legal documents? The emergence of new technologies seems to follow certain patterns. New media, new forms of mapping are just as much a part of the story as text or image processing. The emergence of new infrastructures, new logistics that meet global goods and services chains seem to be increasingly significant in shaping how we understand and interact with the world. New images of the city and urbanisation are often used as evidence of how contemporary urbanisation is going, because these technologies make it possible to produce ever larger volumes of paper and wood, yet smaller volumes of goods and services, in much the same way that the printing press made it possible to produce</text>

But as the Chartist Society has shown, the adoption of new technologies is also associated with an explosion of new professions. That is, the more legal knowledge is acquired, the bigger share of the workforce that can be modelled after the legal profession emerges. 	At the same time, the sharing of knowledge is also a source of tension and friction. The legal profession has for decades been a predominantly white, male, middle-class sector. As new technological tools are made available to non-professionals, a struggle is likely to arise over how the social conditions of legal practitioners should be organised. The workings of the legal profession are largely determined by socio-economic and geographical factors – factors that have a great deal to do with access to resources, such as legal aid, and also things like access to computers, training and facilities – but they can also be affected by issues of power, money and control. Power and control, as in any industry, reside in the hands of a small elite. And so it should. But the nature of the technology that is being used to create the labour –  	rap</text>

That is, the more of these technologies are incorporated into the workplace, the more jobs are created. Inventing Jobs Calendars Jameela Ladkovitz-Wolters  The explosion of computing and data-storage devices throughout the workplace in the 1990s prompted a wave of productivity-enhancing innovations – ­including the work-structure that is much like that of the butterfly, but with computer chips embedded in hard drives – that in turn have ­expanded the worker’s role and empowered him or her to create increasingly elaborate visualisations of the workplace. These creative technological ­innovations have ­injected a new spin onto old problems that were formerly intractable. The ­challenge now is to find ways to harness these technologies to create more meaningful ­parts of the work – ­workspace and home – that ­participants can inhabit and that ­other workers can learn from.

But as the Chartist Society has shown, the adoption of new technologies is also associated with an explosion of new professions. That is, the more traditional professions are affected, the more are those affected by the new technologies. This is also true of algorithms – they’re deployed where previously there was no regulatory framework or social context in place to respond to social changes and shift the social context – and while their first deployment may be ambivalent and controversial, their continued use is inevitable as a by-product of the new economy that they prop up.The possibilities for new economic forms are endless. But the mechanisms that enable new kinds of economic activity are not kinds of infrastructure, but rather kinds of social change. And social change is only possible through the building and supporting of great social movements – those building coalitions of people, building coalitions of housing, providing resources, empowering citizens and so on. It is this kind of social change that the tech industry needs to see if it wants to become a part of the wider economy. If it does, the possibilities are also limitless.

But as the Chartist Society has shown, the adoption of new technologies is also associated with an explosion of new professions. That's why the NAS calls it ‘innovations in transport and logistics ’: the inventors of the technologies … found a way to use them, and so created a new round of regulation […] and oversight that has persisted to this day.’11 At the very least, the NAS urges, policymakers and other interested parties to get involved and make life easier for themselves and their workforces by encouraging experimentation and innovation. Encouraging even, in fact, in the sense of competition among businesses – encouraging those on the outside to join in and thereby creating new business models – is a round number one for the NAS. As for the second part of the NAS's suggestion, the ‘information society’, the one that comes after it, it is the one that should be encouraged to work harder, to innovate more and, above all, to communicate more: to talk to one another more and thus create new worlds.12  So the second part of the NAS's proposal is</text>

But as the Chartist Society has shown, the adoption of new technologies is also associated with an explosion of new professions. That is, the more the system is updated, the more professions are created. That is, the more striking similarities are discovered between documents and figures in art, architecture and media, the more immediately recognisable figures are those that emerge from those similarities. A recognisable aesthetic quality to the document is a necessity for its adoption, but when that characteristic surface is masked in equally striking aesthetic terms, a challenge is also posed to the legal profession as a whole. 	Artists, curators and artists have always been at the core of work that is considered ‘legalistic’ in nature. The legalistic turn of aesthetics has recently given way to a recognisable turn of pragmatism. There is no doubt that in the age of the regulatory state and the regulatory interface, aesthetic imagination and its expressive potential has a critical role to play. But in the age of the regulatory state and the regulatory interface, aesthetic imagination and its potential is being actively constrained by the real-life regulatory regime that is</text>

That is, the more popular they are, the more opportunities there are for people to make a difference, to make something beautiful, to take matters of maintenance and repair to a new level.  Whether the design that emerges from the chaos of the internet is going to be beautiful or functional is another question. The possibilities are endless when it comes to social impact, but the real challenge will be in structuring creative destruction so that it does not become an obstacle to progress. The answer to his question, ‘what is the role of a designer in our digital society?’ may depend on where you are in the world. But in general, the role of a designer in an increasingly globalised and connected world is going to be much more visible and negative. Designers, whatever their agency or status, are going to need to be aware of the new technologies that are reshaping the world, and they will need to find creative ways to disrupt or mitigate those technologies in order to create new possibilities for</text>
    <text>using machine learning techniques to detect, classify and categorise documents in a document such as a CV, by looking for similarities and differences. For example, the algorithm might recognise a document that contains the word ‘assistant’ followed by three paragraphs that begin with the word ‘assistant’ and end with the word ‘detection’. These three sections could then be split into two parts, which could then be split even further into two parts, and so on. The idea is that the document is assembled from many fragments that come together to make a larger whole. In this way, the layers that make up the document – the inflection, the structure and the meaning that emerges from them – are unseen and unspoken. The introduction of such technologies to the legal profession is fraught with ethical questions, and their adoption by ordinary people is fraught with disastrous effects. But as the Chartist Society has shown, the adoption of new technologies is also associated with an explosion of new professions. That is, the more the N.S.A. or Facebook or Google or Uber or any other firm is engaged in machine learning or similar technological wizardry, the more people follow suit. And so the dance between social gathering places, burgeoning corporates and the metropolis is re-imagined through technologies that not only glean information from us but also imbricate meaning from it. The autonomous vehicle, mapping and the self-driving car all helpfully sidestep the problem of where to draw the line between citizen and collectable object. This is why the metropolis is growing in relation to its birthplace – in part, thanks to the expansion of infrastructure that supports the rise of metainterfaces (road networks, bridges, tunnels, street lights, pavements, street furniture and rubbish collection points). These mapping-and-enabling technologies are the stuff of metainterface.com, where artefacts are digitised and uploaded to a central server for analysis. If such analysis yields</text>

The College had been founded in 1899 by Norman E. Adler and Elizabeth A. King, and included artists from the school, as well as artists from the College’s many art studios. At the time, the School was known for its fifties and sixties counterculture scene, which was often centered around the artistes that it produced through the program. The College’s art school continued to produce artists through the program, including many of the school’s leading artists, including Jan Montefiore, Patricia Churchland, Ruth Marcus, Mary Jane Jacob, Wendy Harpe, Mary Jane Lee, Meredith Monk and Ella Gibbs.The College created a new cycle of periodic symposia, or ‘episodic’ series, with the theme of the week being a combination of the words of a number of different places in the week: an address to the College Students, a song from the week before, and so</text>

The new initiatives would see artists from the college's art department and the faculty living and working independently for a year or two, creating and exploring creative alternatives to traditional educational practice. The opportunities to explore such alternatives were substantial, and the work produced by these projects would go on to be exhibited in the school's Carlson Art &amp; Design building and in the popular press.As a young artist with a provocative agenda and a thirst for social transformation, I had other ideas. I decided to explore what was possibly a much more radical transformation of my community through direct action. I enrolled as a student at MUCA in the spring of 1991, and soon after started helping out with the Black-E, an East Coast New Artists collective that I would later dub the &quot;Devil's Playhouse.&quot; The Devil's Playhouse was a hybrid live/work space/studio that I proposed combining elements of classical and contemporary art in a creative way. The term &quot;Devil's Playhouse&quot; referred to the fact that the</text>

The College had begun to use the name UMCA after a member of the Walt Disney Concert Hall faculty had coined the term to describe the new phase.[1] By the mid-1980s, however, the College was shifting its focus to a university-wide system, and the university was no longer viewed as a hub for creativity in the city. The shift in the balance of governmental, educational, and cultural power in Miami created a different kind of contextualisation for art and visual culture in the city. Art was seen as something that could be produced within a particular site, produced in a particular institutional setting, and utilised within that institutional setting in a particular way. Art was seen as a site of interaction between people, places, and networks of people. We’d established a network of artists, curators, educators and other artists’time at the College, and at the University of Miami. The network extended far beyond the borders of the United States and abroad, and included activities</text>

The College had begun a two-year, $5 million program, part of its new College of Arts and Sciences, part of its College of Continuing Education. The new programs would offer a hybrid approach to art and education, drawing departments, artists' studios, educators and arts councils together. The College of Arts and Sciences was already developing a new phase in its portfolio, developing its own portfolio of projects, and adding a new phase to its partnerships with other institutions. The reason why the College of Arts and Sciences was now developing its own phase was due to the fact that there were no existing curatorial approaches to the Art World that addressed the cultural heterogeneity of the area, which was made apparent by the fact that this was the first time the school had partnered with an art school on a long-term basis. So the College of Arts and Sciences decided to create its own curatorial approach, one that would be focused on the community. And so the Biennial was born. It was an eclectic bunch:</text>

The new program would see artists from the DCEA through a two-year residency, followed by a two-year postgraduate program. During this second year, artists would work with an architect's team to develop a new multi-purpose building with a mix of commercial and residential uses. The partnership was part of a larger larger multi-year master planning initiative that also saw the establishment of a new campus in downtown Miami. At the time, the DCEA was also considering establishing a medical school at the school. At the same time, the university was considering adding a third program, open to DCEA students and faculty, that would have added another element to the mix. As a last resort, the university in 2014 decided to close the DCEA’s Art Department, which had existed since 1903.  	At the time, Miami-Dade College of Art was developing an ambitious new phase in its long history of creating artists-students, this time through a program</text>

The projects would explore themes of collaboration, belonging, and community life, and they would be led by artists and staff from the school, as well as artists from other disciplines. The overarching goal of the projects was to foster a dialogue between art and art’s audience, with an emphasis on the role that art can and cannot play in creating a community. Art students would establish an artistic project within the class, employing the collaborative process to develop a work that bridges artistic and educational contexts; the project would be overseen by the school and its faculty. The art students would be engaged in developing the project independently, and in some cases, not even aware of the project’s development. At the same time, the broader dynamic of the art’s-student dynamic would be maintained: the students would conduct research, develop campaigns, and ultimately act as a creative advisory board.

The College had been founded in 1903 by Charles E. Whitman, a prominent leader in the Black arts in Miami. Whitman was a leading proponent of the art-institution model and had begun to see the unique potential of the model in the social sciences. Its development coincided with the end of the cold war, a strategic shift that would later be hailed by historians as the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the West and the East.With its location on the Florida Strait, the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the twentieth century, and its proximity to major shipping lanes, the College attracted artists drawn from a wide range of disciplines. In the years that followed, dozens of artists formed what came to be known as the ‘West Coast East Coast’ (later, ‘Gulf Coast’). Many of these artists were first-timers, flamboyant new arrivals who set out to make art by accident in broad daylight in the midst of a cultural war.</text>

The College was one of several community colleges that year, joining a growing cadre of historically black colleges and universities that year, some forming the basis for a new generation of artists to be nurtured by the College’s arts infrastructure.Artists-students-performer-group D.O.C.D. created a bond with the local residents and patrons of the College that spread far beyond the art school campus into the wider community. A community of supporters had developed a website, facebook group, and began posting updates on the group’s progress online, where the artist was regularly photographed at the College Art Building and given a space to develop additional work. The popularity of the College as a place to be found socially in a city skyrocketing in population meant that the D.O.C.D. project was well into its second decade. The College itself was enjoying its own popularity, having recently been named one of Time Out 100 Places to Live by London’s</text>

The new initiatives would see artists trained by the college working with students from the art department and the local high school to create works appropriate for a college or university, and for the local area. The first of these projects was initiated with the installation of a mural in the front window of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, now part of the MICA Museum of Art. Artist-students in the College of Arts &amp; Design, with the support of the Disney Art Fund, worked with local artists and designers to create a new ambience and visual language for the building, with a new visual language that reflected the history, the city and the culture of Miami-Dade County. The project was presented as a workshop at the College of Arts &amp; Design, and the College of Architecture, Urban Design and the Arts, and it was part of the Walt Disney Concert Hall's ongoing series 'Around the World in 80 Days'.The new visual language incorporated the interdisciplinary practices of architecture, urban studies, urban and regional studies</text>

The College had joined forces with the Art Center of Central Florida (ACCA) to form the new joint venture, which would host artists and teachers from both institutions in a one-year, fee-based program. Disney was a longtime friend and supporter of the College and had begun contributing funds for the College’s art programs. He also had a long-standing interest in art education, having started as a curator of art and education at the University of Miami and curatorial role with Bluecoat Publications. He saw this as a way to expand the College’s reach and engage students and the public through an art-education component. Walt also saw the increased cultural exposure to art-related activities as a way to endow the College with a unique identity and position.The program was formally launched in January 1991 by Walt Disney Productions and the College of Arts &amp; Sciences at UMBC as part of the then-ongoing 'Disney’s Renaissance Foundation’.

Yet this kind of life is not alive with the life of the buried; it derives its value not from the embodied things buried in concrete, steel, wood and glass but from the living things buried deep within the structure. And so we see the resurgence of interest in the urban through the museum, museum, museum – museum of the buried, museum of the living – as a kind of capitalising on the historical and the ephemeral. It is a kind of capitalising on the art of the buried, of course. But it is not alive with the art of the buried; it is alive only as long as the art is buried. This means that the kind of art that it preserves – the art of the buried – has to be really special, really unique, really rare in order to lure the art market into believing that it is paying attention to the art that is here. If the museum is the living organism, then the kind of art it preserves has to be alive</text>

It is this kind of force that makes us want to create meaning in the world around us, in the form of art, in the form of activism, in the form of agriculture, in the form of architecture, in the form of community life, in the form of sport and in the form of art and activism.

In this sense, perhaps, the museum may be seen as a kind of progressive infrastructure, a kind of socially engaged bioscience that helps to create and sustain the biennale in its current form. The biennale as a cultural practice may also be seen as a museum form. That is, the museum form may be seen to produce a kind of literary and aesthetic form that is alive with the contemporaneous contemporaneous contemporaneity of aesthetic experience. It produces what Christopher Booker, in his book ‘Alter Ego Rome’, calls an ‘altered “image of the world”. This altered “image” is a kind of metaphor and symbol of how contemporary art is made contemporaneous with the world in which it is found, and how the museum form in its turn is conceived contemporaneously.

And this is exactly what artists do with their art. They work through systems, with words and figures and figures and words and figures, that live and breathe and are capable of meaning things. The point of art is to happen to be alive under these circumstances.Art is alive because it is possible to imagine art without having to create it; and the reason is that art is able to imagine a range of different kinds of meaning, depending on the context in which it is encountered. Miodownik does this through the way he depicts the relationship between the landscape and urban environment, the ways in which building materials and foundations influence the behaviour of plants and</text>

The museum of the inbuilt, in this account, is alive with the sort of life that can only be described as built. The museum of the outgrown, on the other hand, is not so clear, and this is partly because there is no such categorisation for architecture anymore. Nowadays we can categorise almost any kind of structure into one of several broad categories: walls, floors, roofs, courtyards, slabs of land, parks, streets, squares, parks, playgrounds, playgrounds (with a couple of notable exceptions), playgrounds (with benches), playlands, sporting fields, playing fields etc.  So long as such a description encompasses all that is there, there is little that one can say about a building or a piece of land, and much more about an area around it.  A more precise way to think about a park or a playground would be to ask what kind</text>

The museum form may well become a self-sustaining localised phenomenon – in which case, art collectors, urbanists, urban commentators and others with a keen interest in the inbuilt would be among its stakeholders. Such a development, which seems to me desirable in any case, would open up a whole host of possibilities for the museum to engage with and influence, and I suppose also for the museum to delegate and operate as a commission. It would create a body of work that could enact laws and regulate cultural practices, and which artists could commission through the museum form, and which museums could then fund and manage as they saw fit. It would put a museum right in the heart of the metropolis, providing an example and setting standards that artists could then deploy in other venues, including at home. It would make the metropolis a more dynamic place, and perhaps even make it a place where art could flourish once again. That would be wonderful. The problem with the metropolis</text>

Leaving aside the obvious fact that many museums today are more interested in their collections management than they are in preserving their historical collections, there is the distinct risk that the museums of the future may be institutions for the collective perpetuation of a given set of values – perhaps the values of a city, such as the value of habit, the value of cities, the value of infrastructure, and so on. In this case, the preferred museum form may well be a museum of the inbuilt (rather than the autonomous) museum, into which an artist like Mark Miodownik has put his art. A museum of the inbuilt, into which museums like Liverpool John Moores University, whose collections are made up of original works, inject a certain kind of life, in the sense that they are alive with the life of the inbuilt – a kind of life of the buried, in the sense that they are alive with the buried value of the buried. They are alive with the buried form of capital as a whole. A museum of buildings, or, well, buildings. And, well, museums of buriedness. The Museum of Real Estate is a Real Estate Blog by Michael Parkinson, produced and written by Michael Parkinson and Michael Parkinson for the Pan-African Dialogue 2011. It is the response to the question: what is the real meaning of the term ‘real estate?’[5] as applied to urban environments?[6] By 'real estate' is meant the social and political. For Parkinson, the answer is clear: ‘It denotes the political, legal and social conditions of life in and over the place of the land, both physical and mental; the social and political relations between people and places; the social significance of real estate, both physical and mental; […] real estate management, including the art of managing the land</text>

Many contemporary art collections are not built on the life of the inbuilt but are instead constructed around the life of the emerald-eat-stone environment: of course, it is the biennial that builds these collections, and it is the biennial that acquires them. If the biennial is to retain its primacy in this cultural landscape, it is imperative that it becomes a living museum of the ways in which the biennial is embedded in the urban landscape. This would mean entering into a long-term relationship with the collection, and perhaps even making lifelong friendships with the curators who curated the collections or with those who will curate the future curatorial priorities. It would also mean entering into long-term relationships with other museum forms and cultures, and incorporating them into the mix, integrating them into the cultural landscape and creating a mutual respect and appreciation for them.This would entail entering into long-term relationships</text>

And they are alive with it, because they are in the inbuilt museum form, which is alive with the life of the material. And so we may take the museum as a concrete example. The museum is an inbuilt collection that relies on the museum visitor in order to make sense of its contents. And so, in this sense, the museum is always  	in the moment, but the museum visitor is different from the rest of us. She is alive with the life of her community, she has lived it herself, and so on. But she is alive in a different way: she has a kind of ‘memory’ of the inbuilt collection of concrete and steel and bricks and wires and files and files and files and cables that constitute the museum. She does not see and perceive the world through the museum visitor’s prism, but through that of a different world, where ‘ordinary life�</text>

Such a museum would also exhibit the life-long travels of Miodownik’s art from the city, its cultural and economic significance in the city, its social function in the city, and its relationship to the increasing privatisation of infrastructure, particularly in the context of a metropolis. Such a museum would also exhibit Miodownik’s own migratory travels, the art he has made since 1989 and the art he has made since 2000 in the cities and metropolises around the world where his works are now curated. Such a museum would also exhibit the art from the cities where his works have been made since then, and the work that has followed from the art of those whose populations have recently migrated to the cities. It would show how the art of that city is directly related to the work that artists have to offer in the metropolis today. It would also show the migratory nature</text>

But the most widely read of the essays is from the author of the first book, Alfred Marshall Ulrichs, Jr. (1887–1971). Written shortly after the artist Cynthia Nixon was murdered, the essay, which was published in the magazine New Art as a Spotlight, brings out the same feelings of loss and rage that the rest of the book expresses.

The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its heavy Americana flavour, is generally credited with launching the biennial. 	However, the influence of this seminal exhibitionary output runs much deeper than the art of the checkerboarded walls of the Whitney Museum of Art. The Biennale’s 1990 programme drew heavily on the language of the art market, developing a globalised, transactional sensibility that was as much about appearance as it was about commerce. The ‘biennial subject matter’ and its many adjectives was used to market a wide range of products and services, including a strong push for athlete's kits, boxed sets of past exhibitions, books, paint and wallpaper, hair dyes and conditioners, fragrances and fragrances, household products, fragrances and so on. 	In doing so, it was able to offer a sustained, globally visible presence, both domestically and abroad.

The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its papier-mâché cover, is the only instance of this time in a museum book. 	The Biennale was founded in 1991, and its current charter of activities is published as part of the biennale's website. 	The current president of the Biennale, Jussi Parikka, is the artist and curator behind the Van Gogh Museum and the Icelandic Museum. He has written several books on biennials, among them  Boundary-Tying: Art, Politics, Geographies (1995) and  Boundary-Tying: Art, Disasters, and Underground History (2007).Jussi Parikka’s interest in the subject has been well documented.

These, too, were written by the artist and her friends, and with the support of a dedicated editorial team. The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its spectacular, world-famous, and, until recently, the only ever English-language publication, introduced a new generation of biennials to the art of storing, organising and consuming art. The publications of the biennale then moved to a new location in Toronto, and the biennial of our present to be known as the Biennale of the 21st Century (2016). The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its theatrical displays, continues to be a major exhibitionary draw in many cities. Its aim remains to connect the art world and the biennale; the biennale is the contemporary of the biennial, and its publication here represents a kind of contemporary reference to the former. 	In recent years, the biennial has tended to be the only significant exhibitionary form among the main exhibitionary agencies; the other major exhibitionary forms, such as the biennial, are now remnants of their former exhibitionary claims (Mark Miodownik’</text>

These, too, were written by the artist and her friends, and with the support of a dedicated editorial team. The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its lavish, extravagant new packaging notwithstanding, was a major re-release, and the artist’s reputation was further enhanced by the book's rich catalogue, full of stories from the local communities. With its rich historical context, and the local communities who adopted it, and the museum that hosted it, and the surrounding community of curators, artists, architects and journalists, and the community of residents who lived and worked in the area – the Biennale was a hybrid institution, with a deeply felt local relevance, and a global one too. It closed shop in 1997, but has been reborn occasionally, and occasionally it doesn’t close shop at all. 	When the Biennale opened in 1989, it was accompanied by a book of questions, with broader questions than the exhibition itself. The first book, from 1989, asked artists to define their work. The debates, which continued through the years, exemplified two poles – those of what was considered the artist’s</text>

These, too, were written by the artist and her friends, and with the support of a dedicated editorial team. The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its lavish distribution of biennials around the world, marks the one hundredth anniversary of the start of the Biennale, and the one hundredth anniversary of the publication of Maurizio Lazzarato’s first catalogue. The transnational character of this approach is further emphasised by the fact that the biennale was originally conceived as a marketplace for contemporary art, and subsequently a museum of contemporary art. Listing goods on a website is no longer considered art, and the market was often characterised by profiteering and dishonest business practices. The need to publish books alongside content on the site (copyright infringement notwithstanding) meant that artworks often had a contractual relationship with the publishing company, whose rights to use art were often not fully clear. This was especially the case with the large retrospective collections, which tended to be more product-oriented, and so the biennale’s mission shifted from documenting the craft of art to documenting the goods on offer. </text>

The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its sombre subject matter and portentous imagery, was the only edition to feature any photography from the show. But the influence of the Biennale is unmistakable. The main difference this time around is that the artist has co-published both the text and the photographs, and the book features photographs from the exhibition as well as from the years to come. In 1989, when the Biennale opened for business, the catalogue read: ‘This is a catalogue of the exhibitions of the 1st International Exhibition of Art and Architecture, 1 October to 31 December 1989, in Lisbon, Portugal.’‘Two years later, the text read: ‘This is a “trademark” of the Lisbon Biennale, which means that this exhibition cannot be sold outside of Portugal.’[5] 	The biennial has always been seen as a strange combination of curatorial fiat and the magic of the market.

The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its headline of ‘Who is Carrot Top?’ and its accompanying photograph of a top, became a best-seller. The popularity of the top came as a surprise to art historians, who had been predicting a steady decline for several years. In an interview with Nancy Preston in his book The Contemporary Condition (1995), Norman Rockwell reflected on his book: ‘I expected the bottom to downshift. I expected a general reduction in artistic value. I didn’t know that the bottom would rise.’ Rockwell was writing a few years before the crash, but the parallels are striking. The ‘Basis of Art’ – the historical and cultural value of the art form, its social value – was being eroded at an alarming rate, and the biennales, whose foundational missions were to entertain and educate as well as to be displays of art, were the most visible signs of this weakening of worth.

The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its lavish lighting, composites the empty, mouldering monolith of the exhibition in the new found light of day. A new exhibition venue has been found, and a different kind of relationship between art and the biennial has emerged. The biennale has returned to the museum, and has begun to collect. This is good for the biennial, whose coffers are now full, and good for the city, which has found a way to live without having to be reminded why it is there. 	The popularity of the biennial has in turn tended to increase, to the point where it is now the dominant exhibitionary form in most major American cities. In many cities, the biennale is no longer an exhibitionary form, but rather a pre-eminent event, with a regularity that outdistances its many incarnations in the museum. In other words, it is much more common to see the biennale in museums and at smaller venues. 	The bi</text>

The 1993 edition of the Biennale, with its generous exhibition format and enthusiastic bookshops, marked a turning point. It introduced the Biennale to a global audience, and to an even wider local vocabulary, and made the biennale a global phenomenon. The biennale became an institution recognised not only by its peers, but also by its own board, who, in turn, began to recognise it as a recognised exhibitionary institution. 	Artists who made frequent appearances in the bookshop were a set of familiar names: Robert Hewison, Angie Dickinson, Russ Breit, Heather Hucker, Rebecca Vilkomerson, Rebecca Vilkomerson and Christine Macel. The fact that many of these artists were former students of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and others marked their works as contemporary art, while the fact that many of their later works utilised the same exhibitionary format or vocabulary recognises an older style of art.

I was invited into the artist’s cocoon to ask what the future of art might be like if the art wasn’t controlled by a large corporation. ‘What’s happening in the city is an amalgamation of different organisations working in concert to meet certain needs.’ This was one of the answers given by the curators, and it certainly fitted the bill for the new curatorial approach.

Perhaps the aim of the new institutions was to meet the same needs but offer a different experience: connect people through a forum, but also through an art commissioning agency. This could mean connecting through a gallery, or even an organisation such as the Rotary Club. The fact that the entertainment industry is such a powerful lobby certainly contributes to the way in which art is produced and consumed. In an ideal world, the curators would be empowered to commission artists and organisations to undertake projects of their own choosing, and to invite them to undertake such things as festivals, exhibitions and symposia. But in the current political climate, the largest cultural institutions, including those with a direct financial stake in a city, are often turned down on the grounds that they don’t meet the expectations of their local populations. Perhaps artists felt that their work would be of less value in a city, or perhaps the industry had an agenda in which it felt that it could subvert the city, through which it could expand its horizons. Whatever the reason, the fact that art was often commissioned to do things that were in direct opposition to its interests, and sometimes</text>

In other words, what the arts institutions had in mind when they set up their programmes – meeting the needs of a community instead of meeting the artist’s needs – could be achieved through a forum.  A community of artists would meet regularly via the art programme, and the forum’s regular meetings could be characterised by a dialogue between the audience and curators. In this model, the curators would meet regularly, and the community artists would engage with the audience on a regular basis. This would make the forum a meeting place, where the community members could come together and exchange information, ideas and techniques. It would also mean connecting with the local arts community, since the area was already well-known in the arts and culture sphere.  A third model was proposed, which placed the onus on the artist to create a forum that would be engaging and would result in a change in the urban landscape. This was proposed on the grounds</text>

One can imagine such a forum as the launch of a new online publication, or the introduction of a new online magazine, or even the introduction of a new app that connects people with art through the mechanisms of the web. Curators, artists, arts administrators, journalists, tour guides, students, street artists, street performers: they all fit the profile of a forum user. Forums are places where people gather to exchange ideas, find a common ground and make new friends. They are not places where ideas are forcibly taken and applied. New media can and should be encouraged to emerge from their silos and form collective knowledge, but once these emerge, they are unlikely to be neutralised or neutralised by a corporate interests.   A new curatorial approach is needed  One can only imagine what a forum could become if the forum were empowered to produce and to exchange ideas freely within its confines.

In my opinion, the answer to the question of what exactly constitutes a ‘core value’ in the city is a better question. The answer to the question of what constitutes a ‘core’ need to have both a descriptive and an interactional element. If the latter is absent, the former is often absent too. 	I would argue that the reason why art is still produced in the city is precisely because it’s invisible. It’s either incorporated into the infrastructure of the city or it’s not there at all. But the Invisible has both a surface and an interior. It’s when you don’t count the artworks that are produced that we actually have to work. The question then becomes how to engage art institutions in this process of invisibility. I would argue that the answer is to create spaces that are both artistically inviting and economically sustainable. The key is</text>

I was invited into the artist’s cocoon to ask what the future of art might be like if the art wasn’t controlled by a large corporation. ‘What’s happening in the city is an amalgamation of different organisations working in concert to meet certain needs.’ This was one of the answers given by the curators, and it certainly fitted the bill for the new curatorial approach. However, there were other motivations as well. Some of the organisations formed in response to the ban on art being produced in the city, for example, the Rotary Club. They wanted to create a club where people could come and engage with art without having to be screened by a security guard. Perhaps the aim of the new institutions was to meet the same needs but offer a different experience: connect people through a forum, but also through an art commissioning agency. After all, the aim of the art commissioning agency is to make connections, not to make connections.  One might ask: what would the scale of the new art commissioning industry be if it did not seek to connect individuals?  To some extent, the answer is that the scale of the industry would collapse. The reason why is that the art commissioning agencies see themselves not as providing services to an art gallery or a museum, but as linking individuals together through a shared purpose such as a community development corporation or a youth service organisation. If the aim were to connect individuals to art, the size and scope of the art institutions would have to be significantly expanded in order to meet that aim. Consequently, the scale of the art commissioning industry today is much more closely tied to the image of the institution maintained by the image-conscious public than it is to the actual size and scope of the art collections and museums.  A further factor in the decline of community environments is</text>

They wanted to create a club where people could come and engage with art without having to be screened by a security guard. Perhaps the aim of the new institutions was to meet the same needs but offer a different experience: connect people through a forum, but also through an art institution that produced its own content through its publications and lectures. This is the model that was followed by the arts organisations; as a result, the number of people using the term ‘arts’ increased and diversity of practice increased. The number of people using the term ‘arts’ in the arts and cultural sector also increased; both in terms of practitioners and their audience. So the aim of the new curatorial approach was achieved through a combination of both, and it still is to a degree. However, the curatorial turn around the sector has been accompanied by a curatorial turn around the general public – through what is perhaps an understanding that the mass media provides. So the aim of the institutions that formed in response to the crisis of the biennial was to create a building for the media, and also a building for the community to occupy. In some ways, in the 1980s and 1990s the aim was achieved through the intervention of the arts organisations, since much of the reporting</text>

Perhaps the aim of the new institutions was to meet the same needs but offer a different experience: connect people through a forum, but also through an art space that offers a different experience based on the organisation’s needs. One can imagine a hybrid that meets the needs of the community, the arts and the corporate gallery.  And one can also imagine an institution that provides both the forum and the art venue, but with different services and structures.  This hybrid model would offer an alternative to what is happening in the city, in my opinion, by providing both the forum and the art venue with different levels of security.  This forum could also support independent artists and incorporate community based creativity within it.  For me, the other important element is the creation of dialogue; dialogue that is open and honest, but also dialogue that is impartial and impartial.  For example, the forum could be set up with the participation of an independent curator or art professional, but it could also be set up with a group of artists that are committed to engaging with the city through a curatorial perspective. This is dialogue at its best.</text>

Perhaps the aim of the new institutions was to meet the same needs but offer a different experience: connect people through a forum, but also through an art commissioning agency.  André Hervé, Curator for the Biennale of Toronto, discusses with Tom Breihan the evolution of the Biennale in this week’s edition of  	The Art Newspaper.  André raises several points of difference between the way in which art is produced in Toronto and in other cities. He mentions the fact that in other cities, such as Liverpool, people pay a lot of money to see art they don’t understand. People don’t have that kind of disposable income. André also talks about the impact that the Biennale can have on local communities. He notes that the Biennale doesn’t have the same institutional link with museums and art galleries in other cities that it has in Toronto. André concludes by saying that the Biennale doesn’t have the same institutional link with the arts education and promotion board in Toronto that it has in other cities.  André H</text>

In either case, the participants understood that the aim was to restrict access to different aspects of the city.For the participants, the aim of the new curatorial approach was two-fold. On the one hand, it allowed different levels of access to the same thing. On the other, it allowed different experiences based on the user’s behaviour. For example, the art was controlled and artist directing what the art could be. The aim of the new curatorial approach was to provide a forum for the artist to work openly with the audience, rather than having to engage with the audience in order to produce art. It also allowed the curators to engage with the audience’s needs, rather than have to compromise their artistic vision by engaging with audiences through performance, words or actions. The aim of the art institution was also to support the community in its growth: the new curatorial approach encouraged the curatorial to support the development of</text>

Perhaps the aim of the new institutions was to meet the same needs but offer a different experience: connect people through a forum, but also through an art commissioning agency that provides support for the artist and her or his commissioning committee through a fee. This is what the Biennale has done since it began. It connects people through a forum, but also through an art commissioning agency that provides support for the artist and his or her commissioning committee through a fee. The Biennale has a unique position in that it is beyond the curatorial, and so it can act as a mediator between the different stakeholders in the city, drawing people towards it through its forums and facilitating their engagement with art by providing them with information and resources. This is why it is so important for the Biennale to be able to readjust its focus from the city to the suburbs and rural areas: because if it becomes an obstacle, it hinders the chances of engagement. The Biennale’s forum approach is a difficult thing to replicate, and it is interesting to me, when curators, artists and other stakeholders arrive to see what</text>
