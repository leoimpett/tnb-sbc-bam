These were punctured by periodic public curatorial initiatives, which took the form of ‘lectures’ organised by the local historical societies.

More than just a journal, the essay it published in support of was a complete work, a complete analysis of the nature of modernity and contemporary culture, with a comment on the apparent futility of trying to understand 'pure' knowledge as opposed to the magic of non-knowledge. It was a comment on the fatalistic worldviews of curatorial work, which tended to see knowledge as magic and the subversive use of myth and experience as magic. It was a comment on the modernity-phobia of its time, in which the individual is regarded as a fallen being unable to overcome institutionalised racism and modernity-imposed modernity-absent-knowledge. It was a comment on the modernity that it seems to me has largely assimilated, while the subversive use of myth and experience is largely negated. In this century and age of globalised neoliberal capitalism, its possible subversive use is sometimes seen as the work of great ideologues bent on a cosmic unknowing. As Tom Hayden observes: ‘Modernity is a myth – not only of our own making, but also one that was invented by those who preceded us into the divine ranks of the ­rational</text>

More than just a journal, the essay it published in support of was a complete work, a complete analysis of the nature of modernity and contemporary culture, with a comment on the apparent futility of trying to define what contemporary art could or should be. It was a comment on the fact that these contemporary curatorial efforts were being driven by curatorial departments that routinely (but not always) employed artists who were not of the academy. Assembled by the archipelago's leading artists, the symposium was an unprecedented opportunity to experiment with new curatorial practices and, in the process, to make new curatorial choices. But the symposium also offered an opportunity to experiment with a ‘traditional’ art museum, one that might display contemporary works from the institution, but also to experiment with the curatorial usage of cultural capital – the means by which cultural capital is created and maintained. The symposium opened with a brief survey of the history of art learning in the public school, followed by a description of the modes of cultural exchange in the ‘traditional’ school, followed by a description of the role of the museum in the ‘modern’.

The ‘introduction’ to the journal, which many people in those days read as an invitation to action, is an error of critical proportions. In the essay, the author, Jean Tardive, offers a sweeping generalisation about contemporary culture, casting light on ‘pragmatism’, ‘the ideology of progress’, and its many shades, from antinomies to contemporaneity to the aesthetic forms that it produces, while also questioning the import of such ideologies. ‘Nature’ is treated as a unit of inquiry, not a series of occasions on which individuals can act out their own creative inchoate imaginations.’ The essay is a valuable contribution to understanding how we inhabit the landscape in the interests of our species, but it falls far short of offering a fully developed theoretical account of the kind of ‘world’ that we want to create.

It was a work examining the infrastructure of modernity and culture, from the categories that we inhabit (nature, humanity) to the far more problematic (species) that we do not. In this sense, it is both ‘aesthetically vacant’ (the kinds of meaning we give to the word ‘nature’) and ‘politically astute’ to identify how the infrastructure of modernity and culture is reshaping the world around us. ‘Nature’ is to a large extent made invisible.’2 	The essay was not an easy read. Its claim – supported by facts – is that modernity is threatening not only the very existence of humanity, but the very essence of what it means to call human life ‘natural’.

It is this kind of radical reading that the biennial can help facilitate. It is essential, for example, that the biennial builds its narrative around the things that it itself, aspires to be not just images, but a spectacle. ‘To a certain kind of thinking about images, a disturbance of perspective is to be expected in any art event, but the prevailing mode of perception in America and much of Western civilization is through images, especially on social media’, so the essay is a rallying cry. ‘To a certain extent, this was true of Pompeii itself: a certain kind of thinking about images and images was common there, where the city’s images were being projected onto a global scale.’ The biennial is a global phenomenon, and the global image that it projects is one in which the artist, the viewer, is no longer confined to the</text>

The authority to speak was explicitly given to the historian and not just an implied or tacit audience of readers. This essay, while critical, was far more concerned with the relationship of the museum to the social than between the social and the cultural, and its focus on the latter was part of a wider cultural-political-ideological thrust. It was published in the journal in support of the ‘Recherche du temps’ (Recherches du temps), a project of the same name run by Fernand Braudel in support of the Société nationale de France, and part of the UNESCO Cultural Landscape Database 2017.

It was a manifesto of a politics of the spectacle, in which the political, the economic and the aesthetic would be defined by the spectacle. L’histoire naturelle du cœur was a clarion call to action, and the curators at the Venice Biennale relished the chance to engage with, and provoke a response from, a larger public. They were not, however, able to engage with the challenge posed by the modernity that was being created through the museum.  Their main outlet for this contemporaryity was in the form of a biennale. But the biennale wasn’t just any biennale: it was a ‘eventscape’ that produced a kind of ‘mural’s fantasy’ – a kind of ‘muralisation of reality’.

As Vincent Kaufmann writes, Modernity and Culture are the two great lies of the twentieth century, ‘a single monstrous lie, so vast in its implication that it could not possibly be comprised within the formidable frontiers of the contemporaneous world … a universe in which contemporary art was but the latest in a long line of natural and historical relics, antiquities, and messengers of empires, all strung together and woven together into a gigantic spider’s web, all the while sustaining the pretension that everything was, or could be anything at all.’[6]Modernity and Culture [working title] was the final resting-place of these lies, and the final word on this frontiers. It is the moment when, for a moment, a reassessment is possible, and the future is open to it. That is, of course, if there are still remaining contemporary art forms to be revived, or</text>

The essay was aims to a future when cultural exchanges take place not in museums but in the everyday world, in the real life – in the real – that they produce and are produced by means of which contemporary art has to be constituted. It is a world in which the art of today would have to be created in order to be exhibited, and yet it is also a world in which contemporary art would also have to be made in order to stand a chance against contemporary art tomorrow. The avant garde critique of the museum became something of a staple reading of the twentieth century, and its influence today is felt even in the smallest museums and galleries across the world.

In a nation, a geographical area, a set of rules and regulations, norms and values define who is included in, or is excluded from, that territory. In the case of a nation, this means that the political authority resides in the geographical area defined by the norms and values. In a set of norms and values, there are certain fundamentalisms that need to be obeyed and certain behaviours need to be expected from a certain class of citizens. But there is a question that emerges: what does it mean to be ‘an island’ in the ocean? In other words, what is the limit to the authority and reach of what can be claimed by a nation? Stages, Stages, 2nd edition answers this question by proposing a ‘set of norms and values’, which it describes as the ‘basic building blocks of a nation’. These building blocks include ‘race, sex, class, language, history, philosophy, agriculture, politics, commerce, art, health, happiness, abundance and plenty’, which ‘in simple terms’ define</text>

The book comes equipped with maps, tables and bulleted lists of ‘national traits’ that distinguish countries from one another. ‘Taken to its extreme, no nation is an island in the ocean’. This maxim was formulated by John Muir in his classic book The Wilderness Spirit (1902), a few years before Lewis and Clark set out on their Pacific voyages. In that book, Muir made the distinction between an island (with a national identity), an island nation (with a defined identity), and a colony (with a defined island population).‘An island nation is one whose sovereignty, like that of any other nation, is vested in the Indian agent or agent who holds such rights’.

In this sense, the text of Stages captures the essential features of a nation, while its geographical setting and timezone reference point (now Istanbul) makes it applicable to contemporary geopolitical situations. In that first edition, the volume of the text was revised to reflect the changing economic and migration dynamics in the region. The introduction to that first edition described the region as a complex ‘mixture of ideas and cultures’.2 In the revised and expanded edition, the region is described in greater detail, while sections on languages, geography, languages, government and law are all treated as interrelated. The revised and expanded edition of Stages takes this globalising narrative further, focusing on the convergence of various knowledge levels, the ‘linguistic idealisation’ of language as a ‘systemically productive probabilistic poet’, and the organisation of knowledge production around themes such as agriculture and food security.

In a nation, a geographical area, a set of rules and regulations, norms and values define who is included within that territory. The norms and values of a given geographical area or nation-state usually derive from multiple oral or written sources – traditional, historical, linguistic or other cultural influences, as well as acts of parliament, executive orders, treaties, and other administrative acts. As the source of norms and values, a nation is an island in the ocean. The ethnographic study of the ethno-linguistic record tends to produce two main types of narratives: those of the nation-state and those of the ethnographic community. Nation-State Narrative. Nation-state narratives are those that describe the origins and history of the nation or set of nations that is the subject of the work. Nation-state narratives tend to be the product of colonial or neo-colonial histories, but they are also characterised by the advent of technology and capitalism. In other words, they tend to narrate the emergence and progress of nations, but they are also concerned with the means and systems that enable such nations</text>

In a nation, a geographical area, a set of rules and regulations, norms and values define who is included or excluded from belonging to that area. Similarly, in an ocean, a geographical area, or river, a defined set of people is defined as its core 'tribes’ – those who can afford to inhabit the area, and who are therefore the rightful inhabitants. Thus, a nation is an island in the ocean, and its people are its core 'tribes’. The question of inclusion or exclusion in this sense becomes crucial as one considers whether, in the age of globalisation, we are moving towards a nation state, or whether we are instead living amongst ‘tribes’ whose identities are defined by the connectivity of economic, physical and social links. The concept of ‘nation’ is constantly being redrawn, its boundaries continuously shifting, and its geographical form – its geographical location – constantly evolving. But as the chart on the back cover of Stages, Stages, 2nd edition reminds us, these islands do not exist in reality; they are fantasy.</text>

The ‘idealised’ part of the island, the part with the most features of the idealised nation, is the geographical region encompassing the social and cultural homogeneity that Benjamin warned against.21 Thus, the inclusion or exclusion of one ethnic group from a geographical area is understood as a consequence of characteristics of that area, such as the strength of its government, culture, language, history and geography. In a nutshell, the ‘idealised’ group is identified as the nation.22 For more on this, see Wallace St-Pierre and Christian Körner, On the Other, The Other Dimension (New York: New York University Press, 2018).How can ethnography reveal our social reality? To answer this question, and many more, we turn to ethnography, or, to be more specific, to work with people. But first we need to explore the notion of social reality, or what John Berger</text>
    <text>The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is a possible attempt to address some of these issues, although its trajectory will most certainly be influenced by the politics and economic conditions of the moment. The meeting that took place in Liverpool in September 2017 is a possible example of this ‘collaborative aspect’ that could very well be relevant in the future. The diverse perspectives and different approaches that emerged during the week were documented in numerous individual and group projects that emerged from the week, in an edited version that was published together in December 2018. The edited version was published in a book, Stages, Stages, 2nd edition, published by Liverpool Biennial and National Theatre Workshop. The title of the edited version is a response to Walter Benjamin’s phrase: ‘Taken to its extreme, no nation is an island in the ocean’. In an island, a nation is an island in the ocean. In a nation, a geographical area, a set of rules and regulations, norms and values define who is included in or excluded from belonging to that territory. The norms and values of the community shape the territory, and the nation is no exception. Stages, Stages, 2nd edition includes a collection of 27 essays that address the themes of ‘identity and belonging’ and the role of art, the intimate and the collective in uncovering and constructing belonging. The essays examine the ways in which artist-organisations have been formed and are shaped by the nation state, and the consequences of that form. The project was started by the curator, Sara Evans and her creative team, including: Polly Brannan, Jess Doyle, Jon Trickett, Laurie Peake, and many more. It was organised by Liverpool Biennial, with the support of the National Theatre Workshop and the Turner Prize. 	The article below was written by Polly Brannan for the Liverpool Biennial 2018 newsletter, entitled Stages, Stages, 2nd edition, and it was commissioned by and published in conjunction</text>

I’m curious about the relationship between art and the biennial. I’m curious about the impact that a biennial can have and potentially create. And I’m curious about the relationship between art communities and the biennial itself. A lot of the themes of the exhibition were themes that have been running in the local arts community for a while. It’s a familiar theme. But what has changed is the scale, the density and the emphasis. There was a time when the local arts community used to assemble once a year at The Civic Arts Centre in Copenhagen. Now the Civic Arts Centre is closed and the biennale is the only form of art activity in the city. Community gardens used to be dominant. Now the biennale is the exception. There’s a growing use of the term ‘community</text>

My father is an aerospace engineer. In the family he has a specialised job as an airframe builder. After high school I worked for a number of aerospace companies, working on critical subsystems such as the nozzle for supersonic jets, the control surfaces for lift-generating thrusters, and the cooling systems for engines. During this time I also worked as a systems engineer for military and surveillance systems.

We were creating a sense of place around us. The Biennale website calls it ‘a shared cultural asset’. It’s the heritage of the city. The archaeology of the city. The city needs that cultural resilience, that sense of belonging. Without that, our sense of belonging is going to be challenged and we’ll all be searching for pockets of identity in the city that aren’t there. And sometimes that means rejecting all the cultural assets that are being offered to us through the city. There’s a paradoxical situation where we have to choose between being part of a community and being in the cultural sector.But that’s another story. For me, the challenge now is finding a place in the Biennale that’s going to permit me to be present at the events, to participate in the architecture exhibition and to be part of the curatorial team.

We were creating a sense of place around us. The Biennale website calls it ‘a shared imagination’. What that means is that a community of artists, curators, arts educators and others share the same visual language, the same aesthetic vocabulary, and engage in the same cultural practices. I felt like an outsider. I was the only one there. There was a sense that the other artists weren’t there because they were busy with their commissions. There wasn’t much interaction between artists and curators. I found myself second-guessing everything they said and doing it all in my spare time. It felt as if their culture was bigger than me. I felt like a stranger in their art world.I met up with Nick (the curator) and Karen (the art adviser) at the exhibition space. There was a mix of people there. A few were curators themselves. They were shocked at how young the audience was. They were surprised at the diversity of the audience. They were surprised at how much the audience liked the work they were doing. They had</text>

I thought: here’s a space for the arts to be discovered and I started to discover how the biennale has this effect on people. I started to notice that the people who are selected for a residency or a long term stay in a museum or a large art gallery don’t necessarily belong to that gallery or museum. They may have family or community histories or are artists themselves. And so the biennale, as a format, is repurposing the past. It’s the past that it can be curated back into, the past that it can be made invisible in, the past that it can no longer be a form of. This is a blog post, so I’m not going to dwell too much on the biennale as a curatorial strategy. But the way that the biennale is structurally</text>

He said he couldn’t find any places for it. I’m going to have to find another place for it. It’s going to be a big change for the Arts Council and the local community.As an artist who works from personal experiences, I’m delighted that the new work I did for the community was viewed as art rather than as a way to make a lot of money.

The feeling was that this was a place where people were really coming together in a shared experience. One of the arts organisers had just given a conference about contemporary art’s place in the digital age.I thought the way to begin this new chapter in the Biennale was to create a virtual shelf of places to show the work in roughly the order in which it was created – from the Biennale itself to the early exhibitions of the art washer. For the work that would become part of the new cultural practice – a series of installations and videos – this was a good start. Then there was the question of distribution. The Biennale had started with biannuals, but now there was a question about the form of the biennale, and whether it was a stand-alone exhibition or whether it was part of a larger art program.

I’m responsible for what’s happening in the Biennale. I had a role to play too, as a visitor, a story teller, writer and artist. There’s a sense that you have to be part of a shared community to engage with what’s happening. There’s a disconnect between the way in which art is traditionally done and the way in which it’s being done now, in the real life and intellectual contexts of the Biennale. This disconnect needs to be addressed. I wish there was a way to engage with the idea of the curatorial person as visitor, visitor, learner, but I don’t see it. It’s always ‘one of the things’, but there’s no sense of collective purpose here. There’s a disconnect between the way in which art is traditionally done and</text>

The Biennale website calls it ‘a shared community of interest creators who work collaboratively across areas of Bristol’s arts landscape to explore how art and artists can work together to create a shared future for the area and for the city’s history and local artworlds. It’s a new model of cultural organisation that seeks to address the issues of concern to the community. I thought this was a fantastic model for such a local organisation. We were creating a new kind of arts organisation. But the question was, will the organisation survive? Will the community be able to sustain it? I don’t think so. The organisation is highly mobile. It moves constantly. Its resources are stretched. It has to depend on the local community for very specific things. The Biennale’s mission statement is very specific: to ‘add to the rich tapestry of arts and cultural heritage of Bristol’s local area by creating a shared cultural landscape across a shared set of streets and in the centre of</text>

We were creating a sense of place around us. The Biennale website calls it ‘a shared future’. I suppose, in the long term, that is a risk that the biennale is willing to take. It’s part of the larger cultural exchange that the art council members and the local community members are willing to invest in creating. But, at the same time, the Biennale needs to be able to produce its own cultural outcome. The challenge for the biennale is to produce a sense of place that is both authentic and unique to the city in which it happens. The challenge for the city is to create an economy that is both responsive to the needs of the city and serves the needs of the biennale.This may require the intervention of a city council or a nonprofit arts organization. But, in the long term, the biennale should aim to enrich the city in ways that are not reliant on the council or the arts organization, and certainly not dependent on the money it receives from the arts council.

In turn, the politics and ideologies of urbanisation, and their effect on ecological systems, are ever in flux. In Venice, the biennale was initially oriented around the art of making buildings (a subset of architecture), and subsequently shifted towards the economics of building stock exchange and real-estate speculation. Both the art and the economics were seen as natural parts of a universal system – part of a holistic picture of urbanisation that encompassed culture, economics and nature. In other words, the biennale not only produced cultural effects, but was seen as part of a system that was driven by the arts in their own right.The conflicts that emerged in the years that followed the Venice Biennale were complex, but they did not necessarily result in civil war. Rather, they produced a period of negotiation between different cultural groups and the political entities that they were given. The negotiation itself was influenced by the politics of urbanisation and the emergence of mass media, which allowed the art community to assert a position in relation to developments that were, at the same time, being dictated by powerful economic forces. In other words, there was a negotiation</text>

In turn, the politics and ideologies of urbanisation, and their effect on ecological systems, are ever in flux. In Venice, the biennale was originally organized by the Italian architect Paolo Baratta, who established the tradition of the Italian architect in the West. In 1975, the American architect Norman Green and his team moved to New York, and in 1986, Giacomo Savio Fiorentino and his team moved to London. All three buildings now reside in the British Museum, along with a permanent collection of Italian art and antiquities, and are treasured objects of modern urbanity. What emerged, over time, was a mutual admiration network between the West and East. These were precisely the times, in other words, when political, social and economic systems were radically questioned, and new paradigms emerged, including those involving non-civilisations. What could be more modern, more sustainable, more equitable? In the years since the Venice Biennale, a new generation of architects has been brought into the fold, including, most recently, the architects Daniel Libeskind and Daniela Lin, who are bringing new</text>

In turn, the politics and ideologies of urbanisation, and their effect on ecological systems, are ever in flux. In Venice, the biennale became something like an urban policy arena, where ideas were strategically placed and bargained for, and conflicts over urbanisation often resulted in bitter compromises. I believe that the politics and ideologies of the biennale are likely to remain fixed and globalised, and that our current period is likely to be no exception.And yet, there we all were, floating amongst the artists, curators, writers, curators and other artists, discussing and laughing at the absurdities and differences of our modern world, and wondering what our modern world might be like if the biennale in its current form could cease to exist. Why have art and curating as a profession become so politicised? Why has the biennale – which had been seen as a last resort – become something like a fetishised pastime? Why do we seem to have forgotten that art is only ever a last resort? Why do we seem to have forgotten that sometimes the only thing that counts in a conflict is the one that</text>

In turn, the politics and ideologies of urbanisation, and their effect on ecological systems, are ever in flux. In Venice, the biennale became a site of direct and indirect intervention in the city’s politics and culture, contributing to the construction of its political and economic identity. From its earliest stages, the biennale sought to minimize or mitigate the impacts of its external activities, while simultaneously continuously reinventing the institution and the sites on which it sits. Its position, both conscious and subconscious, has been that of passive voyeurism, observing as it pleases the city’s architectural bounty while simultaneously exploiting it and its services. The biennale has, in fact, been seen as such a potent cultural tool that it can render an entire society into conformity with a particular vision of urbanisation and the production of value. But what if the society that it represents is itself constructed on the backs of its urban inhabitants? What if the biennale itself is a fiction, a made-up operation operating in the real-life dimensions of the city because of its internal contradictions and the demands of a capitalist culture?</text>

In Venice, the biennale faced its own set of changes, but through a series of creative approaches it has continued to exist in its present form, strong as ever, thanks to its strong partnership with the city and its dominant cultural organisation, but also to the cultural characteristics of the Venetian population, who are a core part of the biennale business.This analysis does not claim to give us a precise understanding of what the biennale should be, nor does it claim to give us an exhaustive set of curatorial approaches, but it does claim that the biennale as we now understand it, its current form and its projected future may be charted out in a way that is both familiar and unexpected. The art world may be shifting its attention to cities, but the biennale, which used to dominate the art market in many cities, may well remain a significant cultural institution in many other places.

Its main revenue stream was its ownership of the buildings it toured, which was then used to open a series of other development ventures, including an extensive jewellery and consumer goods line. These became very popular, and in the years immediately after the Venice Biennale began, the Biennale even managed to build a fan club based around the BIENNALE packages – a situation that many artists would happily adopt. The club was always there to meet fans’ interests, to exchange information and to provide a place to sit down and have a good time. Yet, as the biennale grew in popularity, the club was stretched to breaking point. Its capacity to house and exchange information was being used for entirely different reasons – catering to the interests of an urban elite, and often agitating for changes in building and planning. The rhetoric of sustainability and localism was used as a shield to shield the real reasons – mainly for-profit real estate development</text>

In Venice, the biennale was once again a site of imperialist encounters, but now offers a range of collaborative programs with local communities, including a regular public curatorial review and exhibition schedule, a monthly public curatorial workshop, and a year-round public curatorial platform that offers programming including a range of public programs and a year-round public curatorial platform. The biennale in Venice has been a site of conflict, but its politics are no longer defined by the direct encounter between artists and the public. Curators make interventions, and the conflicts are resolved through negotiation and negotiation. The biennale in Venice has become a site of cooperation, but its political goals are political in nature. Its curatorial work is driven by the biennale in pursuit of its own political goals, and its curatorial infrastructure is a response to the changing political situation, now defined mainly by the fact that there are no longer any more centers of political power in the world. The biennale in Venice, then, becomes what</text>

What emerged was not just a series of insights into the nature of architectural practice, but a description of the current politics and culture of architectural writing in the West. What had been understood in Venice, and elsewhere in the world, was that architecture was a fixed, fixed form: to some extent it is, in the age of the biennale, thanks to the city’s economic miracle. But to an increasing degree, that is no longer the case. The biennale is a site of continuous change, and its business model depends on constant interpretation and negotiation of that dynamic. In turn, the politics and ideologies of urbanisation, and their effect on ecological systems, are ever in flux. In Venice, the biennale has become such a pivotal cultural moment that it demands a place at the cultural intersection. It is the cultural equivalent of what John Sutton calls ‘the Teflon Core’ – a reference to the eponymous substance that is the foundation of modern urban civilisation. Notably, the core is made up of artifacts from the era of the biennale, and the city has played host to numerous artefacts from that era, which are often lumped together into one figure – Sutton’s ‘core’. The challenge for the curatorial administration is to position the biennale not just as a cultural event, but as a point of convergence for many different cultural forms. The biennale has become a site of cultural exchange between many different cultures, yet today it is also a site of inevitable cultural exchange between many different societies. In this sense, it is both a continuous visitor, but also a transient one. It includes, for example, the Venice Biennale Committee</text>

In Venice, the biennale has become a site of negotiation, with projects often perceived as hostile to the biennalee in its current form, but also those that seek to exploit its potential. At the same time, the biennale has become a site of negotiation, where competing interests often converge.In Venice, the Biennale is a political entity. It is a site of negotiation, a forum for ideas and ideals, and a place of appearance. It represents and attempts to reconcile those at odds, at a moment when the city is subject to a cultural nomadic impulse. But it is most visibly a marketplace: selling, buying, exchanging, organising, organising. It is, above all, a marketplace of ideas. And as such, it is a site of exchange. The biennalee is in constant need of a buyer and a seller, and so it arranges for exhibitions to be held at venues outside the city, in countries elsewhere in Europe or North America, or internationally, in exchange</text>

In Venice, the biennale was traditionally a place of aesthetic tourism, visiting architectural gems and celebrating the city’s cultural riches, but in the age of social media and the biennale as a whole, that is no longer the case. The biennale is an increasingly critical and commercial site, and its current relation to the city it so closely resembles, but which is itself increasing in relation to the world it inhabits. The relationship between the biennale and its commercial visitor is complex, and its commercialisation depends on many other factors, but at the centre of it all is the ever-present need to find and keep new ways of linking, whether that be by way of a cultural tourism promotion or just by virtue of having such a massive and ever-expanding visitor count. As biennales proliferate and become more globalised, and more accessible, the need to be distinctive and different grows. And so, too, does the need to be noticed and taken seriously.

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field of art as a whole. The annotation-based, global cultural commons is a creation of, and product of, the modern urban and is therefore an artifact of, the metropolis. Modern urbanisation entails the institutionalisation of culture in national capitals and international organisations; however, it does not necessarily entail a return to the city or its infrastructure. Furthermore, cultural institutions and their budgets are a function of a city’s economic health and political stability. The latter is essential given the inefficiency and corruption of the city’s governance. The global spread of communication technologies and social media is also essential for the institutionalisation of mediaeval forms of art and culture; however, this too is contingent on local artists, writers and artists flourishing in a globally connected city. In the current economic and political chaos in many cities and regions around the world, and with arts and culture all over the globe on the wane, the metropolis is struggling, it is becoming ever more evident that cultural institutions and</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field of aesthetics. More to the point, it recognises the inherent inbuilt mythopoeia of the city, which is at odds with the ethos of an Enlightened Being. Thus, the field of Architecture and Design begins to struggle with the concomitant over-emphasis and under-recognition of the city, which is seen as essential for the future of the field. This is seen as a problem by a field that prizes abstraction over structure and who celebrates hyper-realism over sober historical study. Thus, the field of Architecture and Design struggles with the over-emphasis and under-recognition of its citizens, which is seen as an essential for the future of the field. This is seen as a problem by a field that prizes abstraction over structure and who celebrates hyper-realism over sober historical study.  So, how might the field of Architecture and Design engage with and contribute to our understanding of our place in the world? In this book, I attempt to do just that,</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field of culture that seeks to identify and value the very thing it perceives as fundamentally different from itself. The annotation-based digital humanities movement recognises this tendency and, as a consequence, is intent on creating new kinds of cultural commonss that are not reducible to the things that make up the global commons. Such cultural infrastructures may emerge not out of necessity but through the clever use of existing infrastructure – a global public sphere, public realm of shared resources and so forth. These infrastructures may be able to support new technological paradigms but they must be partners with people in their city and nation, for this to happen they must be citizens-centred and responsive to the needs and desires of the local population. This is where the biennial comes in.  Every five years The Venice Biennale commissions an independent team of artists, curators, architects and others to design a new kind of art venue, bringing together the disparate parts of the Biennale – the</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field of aesthetics. It is common for an artist to engage with the problems and possibilities of cityicity in a number of different ways. For example, there is a tendency for artists to engage with the problems of displacement, pollution and poverty faced by immigrants and refugees, and the politics and inequalities of urban and regional planning. There is also a tendency for artists to engage with the challenges of climate change and related issues. It is these other cultural forms that are increasingly recognized as having a significant impact on our cities and the biennales that they produce, and so it is with great pleasure that we are now witnessing the emergence of a significant body of work that is being produced in a number of other key cities outside Paris.By now, we should be able to identify several artists who are contributing to the movement towards a just and sustainable future for these cities: Goa Baiyal, Arjun Appadurai, Eva Castringius, David Hosea, Tony Queally, John Moores Professor</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field that seeks to constrain the field to conform to prescribed patterns and paradigms. Any artist or anyone with a creative spark is welcome to propose a site for a future cultural revolution, but the more inspiring the site, the more it is labelled as ‘Hollywood’ or ‘Tokyo’ or ‘New York’ or ‘Berlin’ or ‘Mumbai’ – and thus the more readily it can be renovated or eliminated – the more readily we can change the spatial relations of our present. This is why sites that are undergoing radical change, whether urban or otherwise, must be actively engaged in making them conform to prescribed models and paradigms. Otherwise, we risk becoming objects of change – like the buildings that house museums and art galleries. This is why it is so critical that these radical social changes are brought to fruition through engaged and engaged communities, because they will then be able to assume a life of their own independent composition – replacing the</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field of culture. We need to find ways to expand the notion of the artist beyond just the people who art is made for.Art has a huge social impact, and a significant amount of cultural exchange takes place in the world of art and aesthetics. It is a shared and dynamic cultural resource. However, the magnitude and character of this impact depends on a number of variables, including the quality of the cultural resources, the political stability of a place, and the wealth of its people. In the current period of neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization, cultural capitals are being hollowed out and replaced by low-cost labour; access to information and cultural goods is becoming increasingly difficult; and access to capital for cultural projects is becoming increasingly difficult. In these economic conditions, who is to say what constitutes a culturally valid use of cultural resources? What is culturally valid in a place such as New York City? In a place such as Liverpool? In both cases, it is the residents of culturally diverse areas who decide when,</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field of culture that seeks to constrain the possibilities for artistic expression. I propose the establishment of a new Global Commodity Register, an independent publicly-accessible register that would categorise all the elements of our cities and nation ‘so that artists, curators, writers and everyone else can find what they want – not just in theory, but in practice.’1 The Global Commodity Register would map the social, economic and cultural life of the contemporary world, drawn from a new generation of major cultural centres. It would map the connectedness of these cities to one another, as well as other micro-cultures, such as micro-aggressions such as race and gender, that are constantly arising in urbanisation processes. It would map the social implications of this knowledge, drawing from recent studies on the post-1999 demographic explosion. 	The Global Commodity Register would map this unprecedented proliferation of people, goods and services in a global network (global city) that is</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field. I propose that we adopt the language of algorithms, or at least employ similar but occasionally subversive linguistic devices to query and query the globalised metropolis.What if, instead, the city sought to build and support an autonomous future generation of artists, writers, architects, artists and those like them that work in its infrastructure, through which it can create ever larger, more encompassing works of art and architecture? What if the city instead employed algorithms to create an ever-smaller, more localized artworld of its own? What if the city asked itself and others to develop infrastructure for and in its future? What could a future city look like?  So, the argument goes, the city can ‘choose’s path, choosing from among many possible futures. And, perhaps more importantly, the city can then *build itself*, enabling its citizens to achieve a shared, robust future through shared, robust infrastructure. This sounds daft on its surface, but is gaining ground in the</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field of aesthetics. It is clear that the field had better have some kind of fundament, because art as a commodity is everywhere in free fall. The only way to save it is for everyone to embrace the art and embrace the social implications of their work, which is precisely what the biennial does not deliver. In fact, the field is woefully unaware of what it is doing. The only reason that the Biennial is doing well is because of the incredibly generous gift of the Chinese investors who, in exchange for controlling a significant percentage of the company, get to keep a majority of the profits. These lucky investors alone are worth upwards of a $1 billion. And these artists and theorists are the exceptions – not the rule – because the vast majority of the Chinese invest in art and architecture in countries such as Spain, France, the United States, Holland and Denmark. Thus the cultural take-off that the Chinese are committing themselves to creating is completely out of sync with the field as a whole, making</text>

Thus, the need for an annotation-based, global cultural commons recognises an essentialist tendency within the field of culture that seeks to identify and value every aspect of the world through a single, unquestionable lens. Art has often been used as a blunt instrument, but its technological and cultural adaptability makes it capable of many other kinds of abuses. In this sense, it is both a blunt instrument and a tool.In this regard, art’s potential as a social good is being actively exploited by the very power structure that it was created to undermine.‘Waste dump’ is a particularly insidious form of cultural appropriation that seeks to bend or obliterate a cultural heritage by reconfiguring it, transforming it, or obliterating aspects of its heritage in an ideological project of one's particular country of origin. The problem with waste dumping, which is becoming more and more of the global commons, is that it undermines not only the sites of cultural production, but also those of social production – methods of sharing, of belonging, of forging identities, of forging histories. When such sites are compromised</text>

This discovery means that infrastructures can be connected and dissected, which in turn, means that infrastructures can be made smarter.Infrastructures are typically conceptualised as disconnected units with no lifespans or objective significance; yet, the infrastructures that underpin connectedness are alive with the activity of human interaction. When looking at an administrative system, we tend to see only the visible externalities of the bureaucracy, but when looking at a networked infrastructure, we tend to see the underlying principles underpinning the network. The visual language of nodes and hierarchies embodies the underlying mathematical and neural processes that generate the visual system, while the physical network reflects the activity of millions of nodes supporting a visually intensive society. Our conceptual toolkit for investigating visual life includes but is not limited to: imagery, nodes and stories. Infrastructures are visualised in images because they are interested in, and able to access, information about themselves and the world around them. So, an image of a road might entangle the visitor by linking the location of the road (vehicle, house, building) with the behaviour of a human being in a particular neighbourhood (street  	indicator light</text>

This discovery means that infrastructures can be connected and dissected, which in turn, means that infrastructures can be made smarter.Infrastructures are typically conceptualised as disconnected units with no lifespans, but a closer look at the ways in which they are interconnected suggests that they are only loosely tied together. The layers of a networked infrastructures show remarkable similarities to the ways in which our own brains imagine the world. A cognitive architecture that seeks to understand the world through infrastructures would understand the brain not through the physical, but through conceptual infrastructures. This understanding of the world through infrastructures would enable novel ways of organising information and knowledge, including new ways of engaging people.Infrastructures are a particular point of entry into the digital world. In the digital age of the infrastructures that control our information, what has come to be called the ‘holistic digital interface’ would be unthinkable. The technological singularity would usher in a new era of 'information density', with information gathering devices everywhere connected to data-processing networks that process information in unprecedented ways. This is the conceptual equivalent of what William Gibson would call the</text>

This discovery means that infrastructures can be connected and dissected, which in turn, means that infrastructures can be made smarter.Infrastructures are typically conceptualised as disconnected units with no lifespans attached to them. This is partly because they are passive, subject to change, and rarely act on their own. But the technological imagination tends to separate the seemingly passive elements of the system from the more active ones, and the visual mediums that accompany them. So it is easy to see an infrastructural as a disconnected system that cannot be understood without the active technologies around it. The cognitive capacities of the user become visible only in relation to infrastructural systems that are engaged in generating and utilising data. So the conceptual language of the stack – the underlying infrastructural systems that drive and catalyse information – becomes a limiting framework that prevents us from seeing the complexity of the connected world. By looking to the underlying infrastructural systems, we can therefore infer many things about the world around us, and create visionary models of it.For example, the infrastructural network that supports telecommunications in the metropolis is often described as being ‘smart’</text>

This discovery means that infrastructures can be connected and dissected, which in turn, means that infrastructures can be made smarter.Infrastructures are typically conceptualised as disconnected units with no lifespans or heads of state, but with the proliferation of networked infrastructures, this all changes. Networks of control now reside in the subtlest details of infrastructures, from the behaviours of individuals to the infrastructures that enable large-scale data-intensive operations. This discovery means that infrastructures can be understood as units in their own right, and that their behaviours and networks of control can be further divided into three broad 'layers' – layers of management, governance and law – which all have one primary aim: to serve a single function. This reorganisation of the world around us occurs organically, as new infrastructures are created, new networks of control are put in place, and old infrastructures are studied and changed. In the larger scheme of things, this discovery means that new infrastructures have to be designed with publics in mind, and that new infrastructures have to be brought to bear on changing</text>

The widespread adoption of smart devices is now confined to a handful of highly visible companies – Apple, Google and Microsoft alone account for over 90% of the global smartphone market share. In the larger urban infrastructures of North America and Europe, smart devices are still common in the workplace, but in emerging markets like China and India, they are becoming more of a regular part of citizens' lifestyles. In many cities, the adoption of smart devices is accompanied by a proliferation of apps that monitor environmental performance, health, traffic, and more. In other words, the infrastructural imaginary is becoming ever more complex: it is no longer confined to the confines of the administrative building. This is evident in the number of gadgets being sold in the market: from Apple’s 1984, when a computer was every bit as important as a person, to Google’s self-driving cars, where citizens are the drivers and passengers</text>
    <text>Working with algorithms, and the connected devices that connect to them, is the new normal.Through collaborative research and design, we aim to uncover the hidden networks and structures that underpin the connected devices we see around us – perhaps, one day, making devices out of them.We started by uncovering the invisible infrastructure of our transport network, and its surprising relationships to the transport network we live and work within. Then we looked at the invisible infrastructure of our houses, and how the infrastructures that support them are connected to the infrastructures that fuel the connected world we all share. We discovered that the infrastructures we live and work within are also infrastructures of communication, and that there are three tiers of infrastructures: administrative, functional and visual. This discovery means that infrastructures can be connected and dissected, which in turn, means that infrastructures can be made smarter.Infrastructures are typically conceptualised as disconnected units with no lifespans or objective sections, but this is no longer the case. Working within the context of infrastructures, our research teams and partners revealed a number of fundamental assumptions that have become outdated. For example, the assumption that a user needs a supercomputer to do complex calculations is no longer valid. Instead, a networked interface needs to be able to interpret data such as strings, numbers, and data structures such as nodes, stacks, and graphs. This discovery means that computer interfaces today are no longer discrete, and can instead be networked to provide enhanced functionality. The infrastructural model that we work within is no longer the primary one to understand and execute complex calculations, but new infrastructural layers are introduced that need not be run at all. This discovery means that computer interfaces in today’s infrastructures are no longer blank slates, but need user input and manipulation in order to deliver innovative and useful functionality.Our research and design process began with a two</text>

This discovery means that infrastructures can be connected and dissected, which in turn, means that infrastructures can be made smarter.Infrastructures are typically conceptualised as disconnected units with no lifespans or heads of operations. This is often the case, however, when considering large corporates; for example, when considering the telecommunications infrastructure that powers the connected car. The car runs the show, but the infrastructure that powers the connected device is what allows for the deployment of various technologies and platforms, and for infrastructures to disseminate information and perform various functions across the car, smartphone, TV, computer and router. The aim of our research project was to unpack this dense material and connect the disparate layers of this ever-growing infrastructure in order to produce 'smart' buildings and infrastructures from the smallest components.Our research began with a 'speculation session' in which members of the Architecture Biennale staff members, as well as local residents and architects, gathered to explore the idea of ‘living’ within the infrastructures that support and are supported by the networked infrastructure of the networked society. The aim of our work was to be able</text>

This discovery means that infrastructures can be connected and dissected, which in turn, means that infrastructures can be made smarter.Infrastructures are typically conceptualised as disconnected units with no lifespans or heads of state, but they actually have heads of states, governments and legal systems that constantly monitor and control them. So, a typical infrastructural might have multiple lifespans, each lasting for a specified timeframe, and might even have heads of states or legal systems that constantly monitor and direct their actions. Our networked worlds are often described as ‘bulletproof’ – which is in part a response to the perceived threat posed by disruptive technologies. But there are also ‘bulletproof’ virtual private networks or VPNs or firewall programs that shut down access to certain websites or apps if there is a threat detected. These programs, or tools), evolved from research conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and elsewhere, and now control access to websites and apps across the infrastructures of the network. As a consequence, ‘bulletproof’ virtual private networks or VPNs or firewall programs can be activated only from specific users or</text>

The level of technical sophistication and the amount of data generated by the devices we plug in or plug away at, affects how embedded meaning plays out within systems and how we perceive meaning beyond the bounded capacities of the artefact. The question is where to draw the infrastructural lines? And what might be possible in the future, when our phones and tablets are less and less connected?Download this article as PDFAna Laura López de la TorreAna Laura López de la Torre is Professor in Embedded Cultural Studies and Director of the Cooperative Embedded Systems Lab at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

In most of the world, infrastructures are multi-systems – containing data, performing function, and, ultimately, organising world events. But we see several signs that are emerging that infrastructures are becoming more like their human-level counterparts. For instance, the proliferation of mobile phone chargers and connected devices is enabling the production of electricity by machines on a massive scale. And scientific and academic research is enabling the infrastructural reproduction of human behaviours through algorithms. As a result, human behaviour is being redefined in this system, becoming more autonomous and subject to human influence.In these new technological terms, we can understand infrastructural innovations such as the administrative state, as a system that is constantly reinventing itself – constantly on the lookout for new ways to deliver value, cut costs and maximise returns. And this process is evident in all types of infrastructures. The technological infrastructure</text>

In this symposium, the participants will be able to draw on their diverse experience and knowledge to tell a story through a single framework or narrative, or to engage in an open and multidisciplinary manner. They will be able to identify specific forces and resources that are shaping the world in extremely specific and dynamic ways, and they will be able to identify strategies and action items that can be adapted to address the changing needs and desires of the communities most affected by the technologies we are creating. In doing so, they will be able to create a context that supports and facilitates the productive engagement of diverse viewpoints, but also, hopefully, to create a way of thinking and representing that will survive.This is the second part of a two-day symposium series on the themes of 'Coming Encounters' organised by the Whitechapel Gallery, London, UK, and 'Whitechapel Gallery: Art and Community' as part of the Whitechapel Gallery: Art and Urban</text>

There are three basic types of biennalaries: muralas, muralas and monorail monuments.  The earliest examples of muralas date to the early second century AD, when Leonardo da Vinci introduced us to the idea with his iconic Mona Lisa (1660 AD), and the Mona Lisa Foundation has been compiling da Vinci’s work ever since.

They are occasions when art is offered as a service to the public, offering solutions to problems that, in the age of economic globalization, are part of a constant shifting landscape. Their emergence coincided with the emergence of new media and cultural practices that combine the emergence of new media (blogs, podcasts, social media), new media (institutional magazines, festivals), and new cultural practices (curating, festivals, arts education). They were also, until recently, a site of protest, when, as the biennale grew larger and</text>

But the biennale has found a way to inhabit the city in unexpected ways, and in its current form, is likely to do so in future crises as well.

There are fewer biennials per annum than there used to be, and the number of biennials per city has decreased – at one-third to one-tenth in the 1990s, and now less than half that in New York. The biennial market is characterised by a multi-tiered structure: there is a common element of financial support (artists get paid to be in the art market), but different biennials have different priorities and resources. The biennial that best represents the city as a whole is the art market – a.k.a. the market for visual arts – and the biennial that best represents a particular city is the biennial of a specific city. Biennials have become much more globalized, international, and diversified in recent decades. The number of biennials grew from around 200</text>

They are frequently cited examples of contemporary art making its presence felt in a given geographical location, particularly through the historiography of the ‘comfortable urbanization’ that emerged during the 1990s. However, they are more than that: they are cultural capital in their own right, and have a kind of flexibil capacity that helps to generate new organisational forms that can be reckoned with. That is, biennials have the power to make culture come</text>

The problem with the biennale nowadays is that it is not just an occasion to be observed, but one whose structure can be reconfigured to any number of times and places. Any number of biennials can be organised in the same city in the same year, but the problem today is that the biennale that is the subject of such massive public revulsion worldwide is no longer the subject of such massive public revulsion in any significant numbers in any city in the world. This is arguably the subject of the biennial in its current form, which is global in character, and</text>

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their thinking and their practices. The Biennial format became particularly prominent in the years immediately following World War II, with the emergence of a counter culture aesthetic that sought to identify with the contemporaneity of the modern and the post-modern forms of art. Art biennials increasingly emerged as a global phenomenon, and the major biennial of the past decade was the Venice Biennale. Venice Biennale 2017 promises to be a ‘bigger, better, and more visually significant’ event than its predecessor. It will offer a ‘different kind of experience’ by offering several alternative itineraries, each of which visitors can make individually tailored to their interests, strengths, and abilities. Venice Biennale 2017 is a ‘game-changer’ in its global perception, and the opening of the Biennale is a catalyst for a new era of cooperation between artists and audiences.

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their political, economic and aesthetic thinking. The biennial format offered artists and artworlds the opportunity to engage with the logic of the biennial through performance, creating a virtual public sphere through which the artist’s own political, economic, cultural and aesthetic thinking was challenged. In doing so, it offered artists a platform from which to enact political, economic and social change through performative actions. These new artistic forms were critical for the work of art to beexternalized from New York and other major U.S. cities. The biennial form emerged as a critical response to the biennial form and its artists, its infrastructure and its publics. It became an essential part of the artworld’s repertoire of art for many reasons, but its most enduring and influential is its symbiotic relationship with the biennial. The biennial has its roots in the early stages of the artworld: the early nineteenth-century form was dominated by museums, while the late twentieth century museum-formation</text>

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their thinking and their practice. As biennials shifted from the city to the suburbs and the outer boroughs, their relationship to the city also changed. They served to connect the city to its urban resources, especially its neglected rural spaces, and to act as a buffer between the countryside and the city. In the 1970s and 1980s, they were a force that influenced local government and urban policy, while in recent years they have tended to be the exception and not the rule. Yet their continued relationship to the city is a strong argument in their favour. Biennials offered the chance for artists to experiment with urban environments and generate new urban configurations; they also created a space for the city to contest against the artist’s fantasies and actualities. In doing so, they provided a source of conflict for artists who desired to explore the city more fully and questioned its limits and assumptions. Here, we return to that history, this December, in our special year of reflections on the first 20 years</text>

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their thinking and their practice. Biennials opened up a range of new possibilities for art and cultural exchange between local and national audiences, and between artists and communities. Their development and proliferation coincided with a number of other creative innovations – the advent of television, the post-war bicentennial, and the post-war multiplex – that were as much about entertaining as they were about creating social change. It was, in other words, a time when art was positioned outside of established art forms and the curatorial role.Art biennials began to spread later that decade, though their primary focus remained urban and regional. The 1960 New York Biennale, on the other hand, dominated the international art market. The advent of post-war biannuals in the 1970s and 1980s ushered in a new wave of biennials with projects led by international curators. Art biennials began to be placed in the public sector and political patronage, and their social programmes, including music</text>

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their formation and their relationship to the city. Art biennials were initially established in New York and London, but soon broadened their scope to other cities with a high concentration of artworlds. New York and London were the main centers of this expanding industry, while Liverpool emerged as a regional hub for artists from around the world. Liverpool Biennial B (2016) is the only biennial to have been founded in Liverpool, and the first to be entirely self-funded. The biennial format was a way for artists to connect with audiences outside their locality, offering them a broader range of experiences and experiences in a cultural context. It also offered artists a way to participate in a cultural body that was sensitive to their political and social importance. The biennial offered artists a way to become cultural ambassadors of a city through a city-wide tour, and through the institution of ‘native artists’ within the city, which provided artists with a platform from which to work.Art was often used as</text>

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their thinking and their practice. By providing a permanent venue for ongoing, on-going, these biennials were able to exert a strong presence and influence over their development, often through their homegrown artists and curators. The biennial format evolved in response to these new forms of institutionalised art and the surrounding marketplace of culture. It is a relatively new phenomenon, but one that was essential in the creation of the biennial as we know it today.The biennial format emerged as a response to the city and its episodic composition, which the curator would typically describe as a combination of a ‘tripartite structure’ and a ‘loading dock’ - both city and regional in nature. The episodic character of the city and its episodes of generation upon generation of artists, curators and art administrators meant that the biennial format could be easily accrualated in terms of both quantity and quality. The loading dock element meant that the work produced in the biennial would be</text>

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their thinking and their practices. In the 1970s and 1980s, the biennial format was retooled in response to declining numbers and increasing numbers of visitors. In the 1990s and 2000s, the biennial presence was renewed in response to the ever-present threat from tourism and, increasingly, social media. In the 21st century, the biennial is popular with academics and the media, but its core practice remains largely undocumented and unspoken. That changed in 2015, when the Liverpool Biennial opened for business and began to operate in parallel with, but distinct from, the seminal Chronicle exhibition. The new exhibitionality followed a two-year cycle beginning in 2016. This temporal variation allowed the Biennial to pick up where it left off in the past, during and after the character of the character being developed by Chronicle, as well as the character of the exhibition itself. In other words, a biennial can pick from a cycle or it can ‘in</text>

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their thinking and their practice. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a shift in this relationship: artists were more likely to be drawn from outside the city. But despite this initial tendency towards the outside, there is still a clear link between the city and the biennial: a biennial is a significant cultural institution in itself, and a significant artistic enterprise as a cultural enterprise, both of which demand a certain level of social and political engagement. This engagement, however, is complex and uneven, and it is not clear which forms of capitalisation are directly or indirectly related to each other. The important point, however, is that biennials are artists’houses where people come to experience and become artists in ways that can be sustained only by the company, and that in the event of a criticality, people respond by patronising, supporting, organising and participating in the art’s production. So the question becomes: what can biennials do to expand their audiences and engage</text>

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their thinking. Office of Strategic Services at the U.S. Department of State recorded the fact that ‘[w]hen the New York City Arts Council consolidated its efforts in the early 1960s, a citywide boycott was taken up by the entire City Council, with the Councilmen…voting unanimously to establish an East Coast bureau of the Arts [and Aesthetics] Central Committee.’ (Documenta 20, New York City Arts Council, 1962). Local activists organized and staged ‘Take Five’ sit-ins in City Council chambers in an effort to defend the cultural identity of their area. They demanded that the City Council reverse its decision and make the entire arts district part of the newly created New Manhattan Community Arts Center, a ‘recreational’ entity distinct from the city’s Department of Education and providing ‘a free period of intensive arts education’ to all New Yorkers’.

Art biennials provided a counterweight to this growing federalism and established a relationship with the city that continued to shape their thinking and their practice. In 1962, the LA Biennial opened and the first Venice Biennale followed in 1974. The Biennale quickly became a multibillion-dollar business, and in 1992, the UK government funded a major new exhibition hall, which at the time was split into two parts and used for the U.S. and Italian pavilions. The Venice Biennale has a long-term commitment to the U.S. and a special relationship with the Italian government that supports the Biennale in Rome even after the US and Italian governments left Rome.We at Curatorial Mindset are interested in the ways in which biennials are embedded in cultural and social life in various ways. We’ve developed a set of questions that reflect on these different levels. The questions relate to, but are not limited to: what kinds of conditions foster biennials? What kinds of social and cultural conditions foster biennials? What kinds of relations between bi</text>

This is partly because of the intricate web of governmental, civic and municipal processes used to alter building and building materials and also because of the elaborate, often unreported, subterranean system of protection for buildings currently employed by the Scottish National Museum and Scottish Art Gallery. While the mechanisms of change being tried are often opaque, some of the fingerprints are being recognised as being somewhat similar to those of the later Ottoman Empire.  The McLean Project was started in 1974 by then First Minister Peter Muir and his deputy, Alex Salmond. It was believed to be the first national curatorial initiative of this nature, and the foundation of independence. As a counterweight to the increasing power of the British Museum and its director, Sir Peter Blake, Muir established the Scottish Art Gallery, which was given official curatorial status by the Scottish Government. The McLean Project was also supported by a National Museums Commission and the Arts Council, and the Scottish Government’s Cultural Facilities Agency. With the support of these agencies, an exhibition was planned in Glasgow in October 1975.  Setting the Stage  The McLean Project began with a rehearsals of the 1916 Rising, which would have taken place two years</text>

This is partly because of the intricate web of governmental, civic and municipal processes used to alter building and building materials and also because of the elaborate, often unreported, subterranean system of protection for Scotland by the arts and arts community. Despite the fact that the McLean and Scottish Museums were established in 1905 and 1912 respectively, respectively, the two museums that year devoted significant resources to restoring the architectural styles and materials of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.[2]‘To Reclaim the Streets’, a group of local artists created a series of nine refurbished storefronts in the district of Toixable, in the Scottish Townships, to commemorate the industrial heritage of the town. By 1916, however, a larger, more visible Scottish goal was looming, one that would eventually consume much of the town and render much of its heritage unrecognisable. The new museum was a distraction, not a place where the Scottish artists could recommit themselves to the task of restoring the city to its former glories. So the project was scaled back, replaced with a series of smaller, but sustained projects, and the artists who worked on it with the Glasgow Art Gallery and the Scottish Musicians�</text>

This is partly because of the intricate web of governmental, civic and municipal processes used to alter building and building materials and also because of the elaborate, often unreported, subterranean system of protection for architectural and historic heritage against natural disasters and environmental degradation that is part of the capitalist global urban environment. However, a new kind of urban crisis is brewing in Glasgow, and it is being fuelled by greed and opportunism on the one hand, and by climate-induced catastrophes on the other.As a city, Glasgow is part of a global chain of global financial centres, spanning the globe. The financial centre is located in the heart of a metropolis, creating a physical link to the city that is itself an enormous warehouse for financial transactions. The airport is a major transshipment point for financial transnationals seeking access to these cities for investment purposes. As a result of this transshipment, and the city’s proximity to major ports, the transatlantic flight has become the norm, rather than the exception. Consequently, the biennale as a global cultural phenomenon has become an event to some extent dependent on the city’s economic well-being, and its proximity</text>

This is partly because of the intricate web of governmental, civic and municipal processes used to alter building and building materials and also because of the elaborate, often unreported, subterranean system of protection for Scottish buildings and heritage assets made up of partnerships, co-ops, estates and other legal entities. While it is feared that a post-constructional culture of reuse could undermine heritage values, new ways of being in and around buildings are being developed in parallel. This is often referred to as ‘regeneration’, and although it is not a new idea, it is of particular relevance to Scotland, given the country’s place in world history and geographical register. Regeneration can be seen as a process leading to regeneration, and in this sense, is part of what makes it a unique case. This interconnection and emergence is part of ‘the urban renaissance’ narrative emerging in the wake of globally connected urban centres such as in London and New York, and is part of what makes the city so appealing to investors, new business start-ups and any number of other interested parties. The urban renaissance, ‘implied’ in this narrative, is</text>

This is partly because of the intricate web of governmental, civic and municipal processes used to alter building and building materials and also because of the elaborate, often unreported, subterranean system of protection for architectural and cultural heritage in Scotland. Despite the fact that the McLean Plan, published in 1913, provided detailed plans for the protection of Scottish heritage sites and buildings, little was done to conserve the city or its architectural heritage, which was systematically violated throughout the twentieth century. Until the mid-1990s, when a dedicated commission was created by the Scottish Land Trusts (still part of the Scottish National Heritage Union) to review and approve plans for ‘modernising’ the city, a pattern was developed in which the plans were revised several times a year, often during the year in anticipation of a park opening. In 1993, a Design Museum was created in Glasgow to house and display the works of the Design Museum’s previous director, who had been appointed by the then First Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Despite this being part of the ‘Scottish Heritage’ category, little is said about how the museum is managed, except that it is a space for contemplation and education on the</text>

This is partly because of the intricate web of governmental, civic and municipal processes used to alter building and building materials and also because of the elaborate, often unreported, subterranean system of protection for buildings and infrastructure in Scotland. Building and building safety is a top-down role, and the individual, not the ‘public’, is the focus of the process. It is only recently that it has become possible to report directly on the structural changes taking place in Scotland, through research projects, citizen journalism, analysis and reporting.[2]‘Structural Change’ was the first headline on the Daily Record when the news broke that the city had been transformed into a large, new, multi-purpose arts centre called ‘Placebac’ by David Cameron’s Government’s Arts Council. The Arts Council was formed as a statutory body within the Arts Council, and was empowered to make provision about the use of publicly funded places. However, Clause 19 of the Arts Council’s Act of 1867 gives the Arts Council the sole power to define what is and is not compatible with art. For Cameron, the act was clear: ‘Anything on</text>

The vast majority of which are located in London, New York or other metropolises where the interests of large corporations and financial institutions dominate government policy. While there have been some notable exceptions, such as the late nineteenth-century ‘Dublin Port Trust’ that provided for the safekeeping of large numbers of British and Commonwealth ships, the process of change that transformed these cities into global port hubs quickly displaced all other forms of urban life.[2] More recently, large numbers of people, predominantly in the metropolises of Shanghai and St Petersburg, have moved into cities, often accompanied by large numbers of refugees from conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. The combination of a rapidly developing metropolis and rapidly expanding stock of cheap labour has become the world’s largest economy. But while the megastructure of the modern urban is an enormous challenge in its own right, its transformation into something more akin to the countryside is an even greater challenge.</text>

This is partly because of the intricate web of governmental, civic and municipal processes used to alter building and building materials and also because of the elaborate, often unreported, subterranean system of protection for Scotland's historic buildings and sites. This subterranean protection has often been put under the guise of a political ‘war on terror’, although it is generally agreed that the true intent of the policies pursued is to profit from the privatisation of infrastructure and the post-industry by encouraging the growth of finance and insurance capitalism.  In the twenty-first century, the Žilpopé people, traditionally the wealthiest and most powerful ethnic group in Scotland, are experiencing a historic demographic shift that threatens their continued presence in the region. These shifts have been driven by an influx of migrants and refugees, mainly from Syria, but also from regions such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Most of the migrants and refugees arriving to Scotland are escaping conflict and instability in their home countries, but there is increasing competition for limited resources between the regions – a phenomenon, as yet unquantifiable, that is threatening the fragile eco-systems of the Highlands.

While the trappings of modernism are being swept away in the current economic downturn and cultural displacement, the foundations of Scottish institutions are being slowly undermined by processes of de-indigenisation, privatisation and the related crises of public spending, precariousness and crisis.[2] 	If the mission of the British Museum is to exchange culture for cash, then the mission of the McLean is to actively create alternatives by whatever means necessary to support the circulation of capital and the grafted identities of contemporary consumers. While the Museum might attempt to present its ‘collection as a living organism’, it is equally clear that this is not necessarily so. As museum collections, they are historical documents preserved on a historical timeline, and while these documents move with the times, they rarely have any bearing on present conditions. Therefore, while the Museum might attempt to represent the current condition of life in Scotland through its collections, it is equally clear that its mission could also be interpreted in</text>

I was a regular visitor to the Arsenale, and had become very familiar with its interior design. I was also familiar with the many websites dedicated to Arsenale artworks, including the many blogs of the artists and curators who worked there that year. The blogs – particularly those of the young artists – provided a visible and convenient online presence in the years immediately following the Arsenale, suggesting that the Arsenale was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and frequently featured within the blogosphere. The blogs also suggested that the Arsenale was a site for self-expression and that artists there might engage with the practices and discourses of their times. I participated in some of the blogs, and published material from them. I didn’t post much afterwards, probably because I was busy or my interests wouldn’t have taken up much space. The space was taken up by other posts – quite a few of which were about the Arsenale’s reception that year, and the city in which</text>

After all, this was the same year that the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, and a year before the Monica Lewinsky residency opened for business. But I had my reasons to be suspicious. 	After the Arsenale, I moved to LA, pursued a career in acting, and now work as an independent writer, director, and producer. I’m interested in how the arts are embedded in everyday life, and how they can contribute to a democratic way of life. I also like to think that when the biennial format started to be disrupted by the AIDS crisis, I started to collect less as a curatorial gesture and more as a way of working.

Then, a year later, Auber- gine de Rome invited me to be a curator of the Italian pavilion at the Venice Biennale. I turned down the opportunity to work with the architects on the Italian pavilion, because I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of working with an artist whose work I had just seen in public, and because I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of collaborating with an artist whose work I had just seen for the first time.

I was invited because I had worked as a curator at the A.P. Arsenale, and I thought I would have the experience and knowledge that would be helpful. I think a lot of it was about the fact that I had done a biennale for the first time and was new to the job, like any young curatorial person. I had done a number of festivals and even a couple of exhibitions, and I was used to being embedded in a community or a local art context.

I was a regular visitor to the Arsenale, buying and selling paintings, taking part in the Arsenale's charitable works and hosting a private private private private gallery. I was a regular visitor to the Arsenale, and never once did I dream of becoming an artist. So it is with me, present, and now gone. I am here to stay; I’m invited to be a curator. In the 21st century, if you want to be an artist, you have to be an organisation that supports artists’ work and makes it visible. Otherwise, you will be like so many others, going unnoticed, and that’s not worth it. The support that an artist might need to pursue an art project is limited, and museums and galleries are expensive, so an artist has to find other ways to access that funding. Also, the support that an artist might need to pursue a curatorial role is non-existent. So an artist has to find other ways to access that funding. And here, the rub, the difficulty in access; is that the funding itself is precarious. The Arsenale didn’t lend itself to the kind of long-term capitalisation necessary to</text>

I was a regular visitor to the Arsenale, and it was never my intention to be a curator or an art critic. I was interested in the way a gallery or a museum would organise things, rather than in the way an artist or a group might organise things. I was interested in the way in which a gallery or a museum could produce a project through its collection, rather than in the way an artist or a group might produce a project through its collection. I was interested in the way in which an artist could develop a project through self-organisation, rather than in the way an institution or a group of artists might develop a project through its collection, exhibitions, production and support. I was interested in the way in which an institution could establish a relationship with an artist or a collection through a curatorial or artistic director, rather than through the commissioning and purchasing of an artist or a museum.

Her fascination with the archive, and the way in which information technology is displacing the need for historians, and fuelling the proliferation of non-professional versions of history, is also evident in her other artistic choices. In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work with negatives, film stock and even negatives and film stock taken from commercial vendors.  Her interest in the archives and their history is also evident in her use of archival materials in her artworks. The 2010 Greek and Roman Colosseums, for instance, were both staged around the structures of larger museums, while the 2014 Ukrainian Art Exhibition used material from the American Museum of Natural History and the Library of Congress.  Her interest in archival materials and the history of the public domain is also evident in the collection of over 1,000 books from the Free Library of Contemporary Art (2010–2015), which was compiled primarily of essays and memoirs by artists in the public domain. The titles of over 1,000 of these books are a part of the Public Domain Quixotic Attempt series, and are included in the exhibition catalogue.  Her interest in the public domain and her self-titled work project is also evident in her use of legal proceedings, such as those by the Scottish</text>

Her fascination with the archive, and the way in which information technology is displacing the need for historians, and fuelling the proliferation of non-professional versions of history, is also evident in her other artistic choices. In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work with negatives and scanned negatives in the public domain, for the purpose of memorialising those who have been erased from history. In  	Posthumanity, (2009), she chose to work with negatives and scanned negatives from the public domain, and to work with archival materials in the private domain, using these as negative control against which to project a range of anxieties, desires and frustrations.  Her interest in the archive, and the value in and the dependence on it, is also evident in her use of archival materials and data. In the case of the Black Stack, she chose negatives from the Black Stack, an archive of Soviet black-hole research, and in 2001 a year later, from the International Accounting Standards Committee, whose chairmanship she took for granted. In 2008, in  	Black-Cloud, she selected negatives from the archive, and again in 2014, from the archives of a research project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Her fascination with the archive, and the way in which information technology is displacing the need for historians, and fuelling the proliferation of non-professional versions of history, is also evident in her other artistic choices. In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work with negatives over prints, and to work with photographic negatives over archival photographic negatives. She chose to work with negatives because they are malleable, can be recycled and can be re-used – a circumstance that photography generally struggles with.  Her interest in the social construction of photography and its appearance in public spaces – in public works, at least – is also evident in her interest in the social consequences of the proliferation of CCTV cameras throughout the city.  Her interest in the role of the photographer in the public domain is also evident in her interest in the form of documentation that records and narrates the social contract between photographer and citizen.  Her interest in the form of archive was further expressed in her interest in the vernacular, which she saw as a necessary extension of the public sphere.  Her interest in the vernacular was further developed when she came across the work of Fridericianum, an organisation that was founded in 1864 by Johann Wolfgang Ernst Schiller and was initially</text>

In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work with negatives, film, and photographs over archival materials and the digital media of the archive. Her interest in archival materials and the way in which they are constructed lends an immediacy and transparency to her other artistic choices, including the use of archival objects and the archive.  Her interest in the archive and its material comes through in her use of archival materials and the archive as a repository of cultural history. For example, in the public domain, historical documents are often used to produce a sense of continuity. In the public domain, continuity means what it means to write new laws or to change the course of history: it is a reality of the new order in which people live and make decisions. And in contemporary capitalist societies, continuity means what it means to have a job, to be able to afford food and clothes, to have access to a computer and the like. If the public domain is the domain of the economically mobile and the socially excluded, the archive is the domain of the</text>

Her fascination with the archive, and the way in which information technology is displacing the need for historians, and fuelling the proliferation of non-professional versions of history, is also evident in her other artistic choices. In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work through the archaeology of consent, and the psychology of the human archive. The latter is characterised by the continual creation and maintenance of records of usage – that is, of who is making what, when, and with whom – a situation that is ripe for the emergence of a ‘meta-history’.  Her interest in the social is also evident in her use of archival materials and the social relationship between people and places. She invokes the social impact of archival materials in a series of documents she has created around the archaeological history of the Italian cities of Mantua, such as the Mantua Archaeological Museum’s collection of 19th-century periodicals, Mare Nostrum and Tipitina (1978 and 1989), and in Tina Fey’s archive at the New Museum in New York.

In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work with negatives, film, vectors and documents that were made available through the process of digitisation.  Her interest in design and documentation is further expressed in the work she did for the 2009 Rome Biennale,  	Signal, a collaboration with the Italian Archive, which explored how archival materials can be used to engage with the contemporary condition through archiving, documentation and research.  Her interest in pedagogical practices, as well as in the design and documentation of artefacts, is further expressed in the work she did for the 2010 Istanbul Biennale,  	Towards a History of Art and Culture, in which she illustrated the historical origins of some of the most distinctive elements of Turkish art and culture with diagrams and engravings.  Her interest in archiving and documentation comes through in her photography, which often takes the form of a ‘corner case study’.

In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work with negatives and scanned negatives over prints and photostats, which are typically employed for documenta 14.  Her interest in the archive is further evidenced by her use of archival materials in her sculptures and images, including the use of black and white negatives, negatives and prints from the 1940s and 1950s.  Her interest in archival materials and their relationship to contemporary art practice is further illustrated by her interest in the archive, and the findings and ideas of the Archive of Modern Art.  Her interest in archival materials and their relationship to contemporary art practice is further illustrated by her interest in the Archive of Modern Art.  Her interest in the archive also extends to the field of visual culture and its representations and narrativisation.

In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work with negatives and film rather than with prints and images. She has a particular love of archival photographs and negatives, photographs that document the history of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and uses these photos to frame discussions of social and political change throughout the world.Her interest in the archive and its people – both fictional and archival – runs in parallel to her love of the written word. In the 2010 exhibition ‘The Archaeology of Literary and Cultural Memory’, she chose to document the lives of authors and their works through archival materials and the archive. She selected seven books from the collection to be read aloud: Marcelle Oliver’s From Subsistence to Subsistence, Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, Joana Russetto’s The Long Emergency, Vernora Franca’s Discourse on Immigrants, Irma Provan’s Once Upon a Time in the USA and Satish Kanadyama’s</text>

In a 2008 exhibition catalogue, she chose to work with archival materials and the archival materials of the archive in the public domain, choosing to work with negatives over prints, and to retain the historic character of the archive in work such as sculpture and painting.  Her fascination with the colonial past is also evident in her fascination with the binary character of male and female – an attraction to binary opposites – and in her fascination with the fact that women are expected to assume significant responsibility for their own historical narratives. At a conference on the curatorial relationship with artists, the curatorial relationship with the public is seen as a necessity in the evolution of art, and the curatorial relationship with the archive is seen as a sacred trust to be protected.In 2010, she partnered up with art collective the Museum of Modern Art, New York, to embark on a two-year long, multi-disciplinary, multi-materials project exploring the storied history of art in Harlem from the Arab Spring up to the present. In addition to collecting materials and archival materials from the project, the collection was used as a platform to engage in collaborative, virtual and</text>

The weekly program was published in the Spring, 1972, and became a staple of the local art and contemporary art book market. It is a rare opportunity to see a recording of a workshop or a full-scale production of a work, but the collection management firm of Gary Francione &amp; Associates presents a recording of the workshop as part of the exhibition ‘Carrot Cake’, scheduled for early November 2013 at the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Francisco. https://books.google.com/books?id=uTlhCAMcAdkFwC&amp;p</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. So, abstract labour is understood as both social and political. But what if abstract labour is understood as both social and political? What if abstract labour can be translated, and if that is possible, transformed, into concrete labour? What if abstract labour becomes concrete labour? In other words, what if abstract labour, like all social relations, is always seeking the means to abolish the commodity? Abstract labour is understood in different ways and depends on a multitude of other social relations. But what if the very essence of the social world is understood as something like abstract labour? What if the very essence of the social world is not exchange but exchange plus exploitation? What if, as Marx would have us believe, ‘exchange’ becomes ‘abstract space’ and that is why commodities become ‘powerful political symbols’? Abstract labour is understood in different ways and depends on a multitude of other social relations. But what if the very essence of the social world is understood as something like abstract</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. At the time, Flaubert was arguing for the breakdown of the commodity as we understand it today, and the emergence of a new kind of social and economic order based on the mutually dependent exchange of objects rather than on the commodity as such. In other words, abstract concepts, such as value, become subordinate to concrete uses, concrete exchange. And, today, we can add value to objects throughout our social lives, adding value to objects that are themselves concrete in their social form. For example, social relationships between people are enhanced through the act of gifting, sharing, and adoption. We give away or house or shop our homes or flats to neighbours and friends, offering space and privacy in exchange for a modest fee. A flat or home may be rented or bought by a group of people, and this exchange between ownership and exchange is facilitated through the exchange of housing. But, as we all know, exchange is only possible when there is money involved. Thus, Flaubert is</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. However, Flaubert is unambiguous in his claims: abstract rights are given, not assumed; abstract concepts have definite uses and consequences. Abstract labour – the very biological essence of capitalism – is socially transformed when people make concrete claims on it. Abstract labour becomes socially politicized when people actively pursue and exert political agency over it. So, Flaubert is clear about what he means when he speaks of the social significance of abstract labour: abstract labour creates social relations; political agency and the capacity to take agency are given to people through the production of abstract labour. Abstract labour, then, can be understood as the very process of making abstract things. Abstract labour creates social relations; political agency and the capacity to take agency are given to people through the production of abstract labour. Such is the traditional Marxist/materialist understanding of the social. But what does it mean to produce abstract things? What kinds of capacities do things afford to be produced? What kinds of agency do they confer? What kinds</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. And thus, abstract space is produced and abstract labour is contracted out of existence. The social contract thus becomes a mediation of values rather than of exchange. But abstract labour is just what its name implies: labour without value or use or value or use or value or anything else of value. So, abstract labour is labour without any social use or purpose or value or value attached to it. And this is what Marx meant when he said that the social function of money is to create money and thus abstract space. What this implies in practice is precisely what Bentham meant when he said that the social function of property was to produce and to abstract space: space is the mother of commodities. So, what does it mean to make things abstract and to make abstract space? One answer is to abstract concepts – to remove the objects from use or value in order to make them less concrete and, thereby, to reduce the social use of them. This is what Erving Morley does</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. So, abstract rights allow us to make commitments to one another, but they also prescribe what should and should not be done with those objects. Abstract labour is what makes money social. And so, the question is: what should and should not be done with abstract objects? Flaubert’s proposal is echoed in many other writings of that period, most notably by John Stuart Mill, who argued that the social contract between master and slave is primarily a ‘complex series of commitments’ made between master and his or her property, and that the object is primarily a ‘piece of cloth’. But Mill did not propose that the object should dominate the social contract, or that the social contract should be based on the object. Rather, the social contract should establish rules that prescribe what is and what is not permitted within the social, and within the social. Mill offered several solutions to the problem of political and social domination: compromise, equality before the law, and non-inter</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. Therefore, abstract labour is what creates and defines the social. Abstract labour creates social relations, social meanings, social relations. Abstract labour alone is not enough to allow social acts to take place; social meanings must be woven into the seeming apart. For example, the social act of tipping a taxi driver’s cab requires both the client and the driver to contribute something to the social act of transport. However, the social act of tipping a taxi requires only the client to contribute something to the social meaning of transportation. In this case, the abstract labour – the concept – is what conveys the social act of tipping. If the technological means of computation are not enough to allow the social meaning of computing to creep into everyday life (as Google’s artificial intelligence will hopefully find increasingly easy), the social act of computing will have to be explicit and rely on conscious and intelligent agents. Therefore, as Google continues to improve its delivery and data-sending services, it will become ever more evident</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. So, abstract labour is understood in terms of what it can do for a socially constituted body politic: what it can do with respect to a person is understood as a kind of contract between parties to that body politic. Abstract labour therefore participates in the very concept of money, whether as a social commodity or as a kind of interacting social life form that is both social and abstract. Flaubert’s notion of the social as embedded in the biological comes to grips with the social life-form as a kind of living matter that requires labour – labour over and above what is taken up by the body politic in its natural (material) form. The social sphere thus emerges not as the outcome of a given historical and political process, but out of the intricacies of particular economic, legal and political systems. 	[9] And, just as importantly, the social sphere encompasses not only the social, but also the (concrete) social. 	[10] As the classic</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. But abstract rights are also susceptible to the political propinquities that shape social processes: statuses of popular uprisings, commodity forms, and the like. Moreover, Flaubert is no longer able to deliver his imagined social forms through the medium of money; social change requires action on the part of those with a stake in the social outcome. The social functions of art and design have, since Darwin, remained confined to the human domain. In the design arena, human agency is constrained by the political and material propinquities that shape the political and material destinies of the material world. Art has a political agency because it is bound up in the social totality, and because its social function is constrained by the political and material destinies of the material world.Art has a social dimension because it is a tool, a means to an end. Design has a political dimension because it is a response to political agency. Design becomes social when it is employed in the service of the social.</text>

Therefore, abstract rights are needed, and therefore ‘money’ is ‘the social contract between a people and an object’. For anarchists, then, abstract rights include both the social and the political. They include the political obligation to use abstract and undefined concepts of value, and to assume and to leverage actual or suggested socialised resources, like land, labour and other labour-power, either collectively or individually. Abstract labour includes both the social and the political. Flaubert concludes: The social sphere, which has become the object of modern scientific and cultural, political and economic inquiry, is seen not as an extended collection of identities but as a complex of relations between people who are engaged in a constant stream of interactions. The social is seen to include the political and the abstract: the very notion of ‘sociality’ is being questioned. Hence the rise of biennials. [9] And, today, there’s every reason to think that the social sphere will continue to be central to understanding and implementing the effects of new technologies, as new data feeds and data brokers become available</text>

So, is Flaubert right? Does the social need justify the granting of abstract rights? I think so, although I don’t know if my ideas fit in to the contemporary context of collective bargaining and the political. But I do know that Flaubert was right about one thing and a lot of what we do today needs to be renegotiated. What we need is economic democracy (better known as ‘Balance of Payments’) and a whole host of other forms of public goods that come with it, not the abstract rights that come with one of the things that Flaubert called social democracy.

Creative perforations may be perforations on the grounds of artistic perforations, as in the case of a painting being reproduced in a perforated magazine with an artist as a cover writer. For example, a magazine featuring a cover story about a new kind of art supply shop might decide to publish a perforation about a new kind of art supply shop that it finds itself in, rather than a perforation about a different kind of art supply shop. This is because a) the art supply shop generated the story, b) the magazine publisher would only ever publish its best work, and c) the reader would only ever read the best work. This last bit is particularly relevant: the number of people reading the latest issue of the magazine Read More Than Once is becoming increasingly limited, and bibliophiles everywhere are discovering that the art supply shop is more important than ever.

Similarly, new media is at a loss to understand how to engage citizens in creating their own future, or how to engage citizens in actively participating in the future of their own city. 	 Art’s most obvious but often overlooked potential customers are those who work in the art world, and the galleries that house them. But this is only part of the equation. Gallery collections, and particularly those held in museums, are also important for the survival of the art world as a whole. A vital but fragmented role for the contemporary art collector is played by the collector himself, who needs to be able to identify, and identify with, art from a diverse range of disciplines. But the curatorial role is crucial in creating new contexts, and thus the museum as a site of exploration, and thus the site</text>

However, the power to engineer desirable outcomes and bring about desired ends lies with the artist’s institution and not the other way around. If the curatorial is not empowered to bring about desired outcomes and foster desired ends, then the power to design, engineer and manipulate cultural institutions lies with the artist and not with the institution or the company. For example, the curatorial importance may lie in its ability to generate cultural outcomes and bring them about, but it depends on how artists are structurally placed within the institution. If the power to engineer and manipulate cultural institutions lies with the company that employs the artists and not with the artist, then the power to employ the artists and to employ the culture lies with the company. Similarly, if the power to employ the architecture and to structure cultural outcomes lies with the company that produces the content and the media that are consumed, then the power to employ the artists and to employ</text>

It can shape the ground it stands on, bring about desired outcomes and achieve desired ends, but it cannot create or foster new ‘cultures of consumption’.5. Creative perforations. As cultural resources become ever more powerful and accessible, it is natural to want the curatorial to infuse culture with certain kinds of meaning and value in ways that are consistent with the capitalist logic of consumption. Creative perforations can arise through the combining of disparate values and beliefs, of course. But the role of the curatorial, as an institution and a site, needs to be heavily engaged as a producer of culture in order to support both the production of knowledge and the perpetuation of social meaning. It is this much clear in the curatorial's current and former curatorial roles. In the former ‘curatorial year’, the curatorial is the site of much social and political conflict and drama, its curatorial priorities are defined by the biennial’. Curators, artists and art collectors from around the world gather in the same three-year cycle to discuss art and art history, curatorial approaches to cultural perforations, and cultural perforations in their chosen field.</text>

It represents and representsates the possibilities and limits of cultural consumption, and it shapes and shapes and represents the world through what it produces. However, the curatorial has other important but less visible roles to play in the development of the cultural landscape. It can shape the ground it stands on, bring about desired outcomes and achieve desired ends, but it cannot create or foster new ‘cultures of consumption’.5. Creative perforations. As cultural theorists and artists, we understand how the curatorial role can be creative and that its value will depend on many things, including the things we don’t want and don’t know we don’t want. But we also know that the curatorial role must be creative in order to achieve its desired outcomes. The task is complex and subjective, and the potential harms to cultural resources and the social life of communities far outweigh the benefits. We explore the curatorial role in this book through three curatorial projects developed in collaboration with The Open School, The Museum of Modern Art and LA County Museum of Art: Projections at the Open School, LA, and The Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, California. The Museum of Modern Art and the Open School have been collaborating on the projections project for several years. The Museum of Modern Art and the Open School have different approaches to artistic perforations, but share a commitment to exploring art’s social context and the</text>

The importance of the curatorial in the cultural reproduction of the city cannot be understated. The curatorial role in the cultural reproduction of the city cannot be viewed as a fixed and determinant one. Its importance and freedom depend on a dynamic, fluid and ever shifting public and professional market forces and artists’ insatiable desire to please. The curatorial role in the cultural reproduction of the city is an ever-changing, shifting, dynamic role. It is constantly subject to the vagaries of cultural production and consumption. It is also a prime site for the making and the showcasing of new cultural forms and practices. Consequently, its functions and powers are multi-functional and constantly shifting. In this sense, the curatorial role is not confined to the production of art for art’s sake, but also includes functions such as the propagation and</text>

The curatorial, as a collective body of curators, must produce or it loses its meaning. Creative perforations, such as those listed above, are acts of initiative and interaction between curatorial teams. They are important for the production of cultural resources and the future of cultural consumption, but they are also essential for the survival of culture itself. Without the ability to creatively perforate the boundaries and produce cultural outputs, the other members of the curatorial assemblage would have an increasingly limited range of cultural practices to choose from. Creative perforations can produce new ways of looking at the world, making cultural consumption possible and inevitable, and creating a political but also a cultural surplus for the future of the art world. Though creative perforations may be subtle and require</text>

Creative perforations, on the other hand, are those that create understanding and imagination and thus increase understanding of the world around us. And although individuals may have their own agendas and interests, the collective end result can be valuable for all involved. Creative perforations can be differentiated into two basic types: those that create understanding (art) and those that merely enrich understanding (common knowledge). For example, an artist who creates a work of art through the actions of a community of artists may in principle play a role in empowering or empowering-ingeneously, depending on one’s perspective. However, the curatorial’s role is to create, create and create. Nowhere in its stated mission statement is there any reference to an artist as such. And although the curatorial’s general mandate includes actions that all involved parties can identify with, there is some criticism of</text>

The creative perforator is a must-have for any cultural theory or aesthetic theory or aesthetic theory that seeks to create or foster new ‘cultures of consumption’. The creative perforator understands cultural difference and the ends that exist within it and in doing so creates or supports these new ‘cultures’.  One example of the creative perforator is art historian Peter Langlois, who famously proposed within the context of the crisis of the Ciudadana de Los Tella it was better to photograph the ruins of a museum rather than to renovate and open a new museum.6. Cultural consumption. In recent years, cultural theorists have paid much more attention to the question of cultural consumption, or the act of purchasing culture as a result of knowledge being created through cultural exchange.

The art world is no longer the only one to suffer under the weight of an increasing number of artists and craftspeople. Likewise, the performance arts world is no longer the only one to suffer under the weight of an increasing number of artists and craftspeople. Yet the curatorial intervention that the art world desperately craves is creative perforations that actively seek to change their perforations. A curatorial perforation is a rare and precious artistic feat, and the curatorial intervention that opens new paths is an intervention that seeks to change existing paths in a creative and powerful way. Creative perforations open new thinking and new ways of perceiving the world. However, they are often also very powerful in bringing about certain ends, and in a rare case, in fundamentally transforming existing ‘cultures of consumption’.6. Pop-up programs. A curatorial perforation can be a rare</text>
