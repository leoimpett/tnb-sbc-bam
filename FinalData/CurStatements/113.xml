In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies across the world, with implications for future visions of humanity.Artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences have recently begun to inflect our thinking about cultural evolution. This is due to the proliferation of non-human AI systems that can be endowed with human characteristics (see, for example, [6], [7]). AI has become both more pervasive and more powerful. More than ever, it is essential that cultural institutions draw upon the technologies that underlie their success. In the coming years, this may mean that the physical and virtual worlds underpinning cultural practices must be interrelated in order to function. Whether cultural institutions are built on the physical or cognitive frameworks of capital depends on the particular socio-economic system that employs cultural norms and values. In the current economic and financial systems, the rich and powerful nations possess a great deal of economic and cognitive power. However, in a world with increasingly precarious access to labor and resources, the survival of the cultural norm is now in doubt, and in many places is actively</text>

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies across the planet. The potential impact of these cultural theories on the current periodisation of humanity is a worthy area of research, and there are few areas of human cultural history where there is such a wealth of empirical evidence. Nevertheless, there is great uncertainty about the precise nature of the impacts of AI on cultural forms and practices. The focus of this book is bound up with the forthcoming Conference of the Presidents of the Humanities Research Council (HRC) in San Francisco – an event whose agenda aligns with that of the AI symposium being curated by the Open School in Liverpool. The conference will present work in progress from the ‘2001 Task Force’, the ‘2004 Task Force’ and the ‘2013 Task Force’, and bring together leading cultural theorists, historians and artists to explore the intersections between art, culture and power, as proposed by Terry Ugwu** and others.

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies across the globe. These cultural theorists have developed diverse conceptualisations of AI that map on to current political, economic and legal conceptions of the world. For example, cultural theorists have long known that AI is a threat to the institutions that maintain power and profit, such as the monarchy, but have largely failed to develop strategies to assuage concerns about the fragility of the human condition. The stakes are high in the AI race, and creative new conceptualisations of AI are needed to cope with its potentially destructive impact.Artificial intelligence and cultural theory have recently begun to inflect our thinking about the possibilities of human cultural evolution.

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies across the globe. Among other things, cultural theorists have begun to notice a marked increase in the number of artists and institutions developing collaborative agreements with regard to art resources, with a clear preference for urban environments. This is particularly noticeable in China, where the number of artists has quadrupled in the past decade alone, and where the number of institutions hosting exhibitions has quadrupled. In many cities, the number of artist-funded institutions has tripled, while in other cities, the share of state funding for arts education has quintupled. It is noteworthy that the number of humanities-focused arts institutes has also increased, while the number of arts programs offered by state-funded arts institutions has remained stable. It is also noteworthy that in urban centres, where the AI revolution is most evident, there is a concentration on the integration of AI within formal education, with a strong push towards what is known as ‘deep learning’ – the underlying principles underlying much of AI being applied primarily within the context of</text>

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies all around the world. For instance, cultural theorists are beginning to analyse the possibilities that AI may be used to modify cultural practices in order to accentuate particular human values and identities, creating new kinds of &quot;pure&quot; representations of the world. And cultural theorists are beginning to notice a marked increase in the number of cultural instruments that are being deployed in all kinds of social, political and economic life – be it urban development, the media, education, sports, politics, law, migration and more.Artificial intelligence and cultural theory have recently begun to inflect our thinking about the possibilities of human cultural evolution.

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies across the globe. As the AI research community strives to understand the societal impacts of its work, it is crucial that cultural theorists and arts administrators pay close attention to the work being done in order to anticipate what might become of such a territory. Cultural production is a critical task for any technological group intent on creating a shared meaning and experience across borders. It is a shared vocabulary and experience that takes root in shared neural networks and is shared across cultural groups. Cultural production requires cultural competencies and the like. But cultural production also calls for cultural competencies – skills – that are not necessarily abstractions but require conscious and intentional investment in their use. Conscious and intentional investment means working in concert with others to achieve transformative outcomes. It means working in teams, partnerships and with greater resources than are strictly necessary to achieve the tasks at hand. It means engaging with the politics and ideologies that shape the world in ways that can be altered through cultural practices. It means engaging constructively with those whose cultures you do not understand</text>

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies across the globe.The notion of culture as a sentient being (with a conscious or intelligent agent capable of reason) has become an increasingly important locus of inquiry for contemporary art and cultural studies, and AI is no exception. Cognition and AI are thought to be the outcome of cultural processes – processes that foster or precipitate specific outcomes and carve out specialised spaces and roles for humans – and much of what can be considered a 'cultural theory' focuses on how artists and artists’ agents, including artists’ personal selves, conceive of the cultural world as a series of interactions that take place simultaneously inside and outside of the artist’s studio. Art is thought to produce substantive and influential cultural effects because it is a complex social phenomenon involving conscious and unconscious agency, but much remains unclear about the precise mechanisms that produce and emerge from AI.Artists, artists’ assistants and cultural theorists have traditionally viewed AI and cultural studies as an area of research-led development with a particular emphasis on</text>

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies all around the world. With the notable exception of a few private companies and research institutions, most academics and cultural theorists remain unaware of the growing number of cities with AI and how this is impacting their civic capacities. This book attempts to fill this void, placing culture at the centre as both the reader and participant in a cultural revolution. It is written as a set of principles, commitments and proposals that attempt to reconcile the differences between the various facets of the AI craze. It is divided into two parts, the second of which focuses on the role of artists and the arts in the context of the AI revolution. The authors’ conclusions are tentative and ambiguous. They present evidence of the role of artists and the arts in the creation of new cultures, but also suggest ways to work with those who already have cultural skills, through a two-tiered educational system designed to build skills across the board, rather than through formal education. The system should provide the capacity to identify and engage potential users effectively and</text>

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies across the globe. In a recent Nature Communications article entitled &quot;Artificial Intelligence and Its Critics&quot;, Steven J. Vaughan and Chris Wainwright raise troubling questions about the implications of AI for art’s traditional institutional forms and the assumptions about human dignity and agency that artists and art historians alike use to theorise and interpret culture. They posit a disjuncture between the benevolent AI that performs crucial functions in the art world and the malicious AI that seeks to subordinate artists and other cultural sectors to its own interests and those of the capitalist enterprise. They also question the degree to which the functions of culture today are defined by the modes of technological innovation that enable AI to be more than an end in itself. Art, they suggest, is no longer a diffuse phenomenon in which individuals draw on shared identities and desires, but one in which distinct autonomous worlds are being born. This raises the prospect of radically new forms of artistic practice, and arguably threatens the assumptions about cultural belonging and cultural identities that shape how artists and</text>

In the realm of cultural practices, cultural theorists have begun to analyse how AI is modulating the contours of power and wealth in societies all around the world. Cultural theorists have long known that cultural practices play a critical role in constructing and maintaining social wealth; AI is no different. However, cultural theorists have largely failed to notice a shift in the nature of cultural wealth creation and consumption. Cultural theorists have largely failed to notice a shift in the nature of cultural consumption itself. However, cultural theorists have largely failed to notice a shift in the nature of cultural production itself. In other words, cultural theorists who neglect to materialise the cultural-economic dynamic of contemporary (AI) cultural production in their theorisation of cultural imbalances and the formation of new social forms may well end up impoverishing themselves – both in their current research projects and in the longer-term futures that are nowictions – by neglecting to appreciate the more immediate but crucial role that material forms of culture play in the perpetuation of social wealth.Fundamental to any socio-cultural theory that is to render cultural practices meaningful and contemporary is an understanding of the social,</text>

The social function of the city has come to dominate the site of human habitation. But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, in addition to those of habitation, are those of commerce, tourism, and institutional exchange.‘Exchange’ in this context is understood as the exchange of space and commodities, and its articulation as a social enterprise is understood as the articulation of social life within the city.‘Trade’ is understood as the movement of bodies across physical and virtual space, and its constant shifting of parameters – bodies, goods, services, commodities – is understood as the organizing principle of the global system.‘Exchange’ therefore becomes an essential site of political and social signification, and the politics of habitation – exchange – is understood as a politics of exchange.‘In the twentieth century, the dynamic between the city and the economy was given a geopolitical character.

But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, and the social consequences of this consummation in the long term, are a future that is not yet beyond us. The city, as a social creation, is subject to change, and new spatial configurations are needed. New spatial configurations are needed to accommodate and even support the growth of habitation within the city, but they are needed nonetheless. New spatial configurations are needed, and this can mean new ways of inhabiting the city. We do not yet know what these new spatial configurations would look like, but they would likely involve a new economic and political order on the city. The emergence of such a political order would not be easy, and it would require understanding not only of the city, but of the political and economic systems that generate and support the city.New spacial configurations would have to be found that could accommodate and even support these new economic forms, but they would also have to address the social and spatial heterogeneity of the city, and the need to be able to distinguish between urban and</text>

The social function of the city has come to dominate the site of human habitation. But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, when done well, are great. The social functions of the city when not done well are even greater. But done poorly, and not in the way that ecological and social forms of space-production demand and enable, is when suffering and social breakdown regularly threatens large swathes of humanity. The city has several opportunities that could be considered ‘natural’ in the sense that they are products of economic forces: the physical, cultural and economic. The opportunity to inhabit and to live in culturally relevant ways within the city, to contribute to its cultural life, is an ecological and a social good that can be cultivated and shared. But the cultural means of producing the city, the social life of the city – the modes of production, circulation and use that make up the city’s social life – are produced through the specific political and economic forms of ownership and circulation implied by the city’s current and former forms of social and economic domination. The cultural forms of sharing and of inhabiting the</text>

The social function of the city has come to dominate the site of human habitation. But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, in turn, are largely defined by the financial and trading interests of the city’s dominant economic actors. In the twentieth century, the vernacular form of the city (its vernacular character, its infrastructural rigidity, its reliance on finance mostly realised in the twentieth century) came to dominate the site of cultural exchange and cultural mobilisation. In the twenty-first century, the ‘biennale’ seems to be the appropriate term to describe the phenomenon we are witnessing.In recent biennials, the locus of exchange is any place with a significant other (locating the other geographically) – and, increasingly, the entire city. This is true of ‘locusts’, of course, but it is also the case of biennials that have been created for the sole purpose of trade, profit or other economic activities.

But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, and the sites on which they take place, are only partially understood. Much remains unclear, and a great deal of what is visible is owned by the wealthy few. The social functions of the city, then, remain sites of domination for a very different set of people. The social functions of the city, then, can be divided into three broad categories: (1) those who exclusively inhabit the city for short periods of time, such as artists, (2) those who live in and are dependent upon the city for their very existence, such as large corporations and financial institutions, and (3) those who actively contribute to the construction of the city, such as municipal governments and grassroots organizations.  	When considering the social functions of the city, it is important to distinguish between those who actually live there and work in it, and those who are drawn into it through habit, urban circulation, or other kinds of non-city factors.  	When considering the social functions of the city</text>

The social function of the city has come to dominate the site of human habitation. But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, and the social consequences of this consummation, remain largely undefined. That of infrastructure, and the social forms that it assumes remain largely undefined are the specific tasks of city planners and urban theorists. The city has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a working-class place, and the shift to the economy has transformed the city from the place of passive consumption (where art, architecture, landscape art were valued above all) to the place of active producers of wealth (where capital is encouraged over time through policies of affordable housing, tax-deductible activities such as clubs, and social institutions such as museums and parks). The transformation of the city is accompanied by a corresponding shift in the economic: new kinds of workers are drawn to the city, and production, consumption, and income growth all round, shift production to places where the economics of housing become more ambiguous, and the city is awash with financial incentives to pump money into the property market in the belief that denser buildings and better</text>

But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, and the social uses of that spatial space – are still relatively obscure. This is why cultural biennials such as Venice, and their like, can inflect the economic with so much myth and so much magic. It is because the economic dwarfed the cultural in the 1980s, and the cultural with so many myths and fantasies, and the economic became ever more accessible through ever more flexible exchange – commodities – rather than the other way round. Cultural tourism became the ascendant form, then, of exchange in the wake of the commodity and commodity exchange. The economic function of the city expanded further in the 1990s and early 2000s, and it is this expansion of the city that continues to constrain what can be seen as artistic freedom and artistic productivity – both at home and internationally. It is true that the economic miracle of the 2000s did make some in the arts richer, although this is offset by the gutting down of many arts institutions, and the demoralising effect of a global economy</text>

The social function of the city has come to dominate the site of human habitation. But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, or ‘sites of public life’, have come to dominate the site of production and circulation within which they occur. Hence the growing consensus among urban theorists is that the future of urban space is to some extent a future of transactions, and that the problem with urban life is not necessarily a shortage of people but a shortage of things to do. For example, the infrastructural turn around cities seems to be a terminal phase, and with it, eventually, a capacity for commerce beyond the transactional. But the city is by its very nature a site of consumption, and the city is a site of production that can sustain itself only as a result of the consumptive function of money. Hence the growing consensus is that the capacity for speculative circulation in the city is a precondition for a fully fledged sociality, and that the capacity for collective action is a precondition for a just sociality. And this is to suggest that ‘the social is the object of</text>

In the early twentieth century, the logic of the real-estate bubble was put into practice, and housing became an article of commerce. The logic of housing became economic and political in nature, and the logic of finance, created a hybrid regime that could accommodate both modes of the economy as well as the politics of habit. But the economic and social forms of housing have come to dominate the ecological as opposed to natural resources of the contemporary city, and the fusion of the ecological and the economic has created what can be seen as a persistent crisis of the former, the crisis of the latter.Urban space has become ever more mobile, and ever more spatial, as the consummation of capitalism. The social function of the city has come to dominate the site of human habitation. But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, then, are to a large extent determined by the economic. The social functions of the city, then, are – among other things – to monopolize resources, to dominate space, and to make money through the sustained circulation of financial assets. The social functions of the city, it follows, are to a large extent determined by the economic. The question is which economic regimes are compatible with the city’s current mix of modes of economy. If the city is to retain its ecological and cultural qualities, its own distinctive characteristics and functions, then it is necessary for the city to be able to sustain a certain level of complexity and creativity in its form and content. The city, it follows, must be able to produce its own characteristically urban character, and have creative energies and activities directed towards this end. This is why biennials are typically centred around a single economic system or set of systems, and why postindustrial cities are rare. It is also why, in the twentieth century,</text>

The social function of the city has come to dominate the site of human habitation. But the social functions of the city – to what extent, and by what standards – are still largely defined by the economic. The social functions of the city, by and large, consist of supporting the infrastructure of the city, such as the infrastructure of transit, the infrastructure of housing, and the infrastructure of commerce. But the economic is by no means static. It fluctuates – in relation to other commodities and assets, in relation to financial institutions, and even to the political – and its defining feature is the fact that it is volatile. Its features and character are determined by underlying forces and trends. The question is what can be done to shift the site of production and consumption from the economic to the other (more social) sphere. This shift in the site of production and consumption is a precondition for the social functions and bioenergetic strategies that are now being developed and directed towards the periphery and beyond of the city.  One answer to this question is geo-thermodynamics. Geo-thermodynamics proposes that the site of production and consumption should be located in a large body of water – a body of water, in this case, derived</text>

We wrote as if it were 1956 – not long before the Russian revolution – and the Russian revolution was twenty-first century. The question that we were trying to answer was, how can a biennial display a range of cultural forms, and how? We included the project in the museum, but the biennial itself should display a range of forms, and the museum should offer a different kind of experience. Our itinerary was very much inspired by the experiences of the artists and the experiences of the peoples they worked with. In the case of the Armenian diaspora, for example, who are among our visitors, they come from every possible corner of the Armenian diaspora, travelling from coast to coast in order to visit family and friends.

We did not go to the Museum of Modern Art in Zurich, because we feared that we would be overwhelmed by the traffic, and so we travelled by car instead, taking the SNCF-Autobahn train from Berlin to Munich. The reason that we did not go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York was that we knew that our proposal would be too abstract, too theoretical, and so would not translate into concrete change. We would be faced with a situation where the museum was forced to choose between its collection and its future collection, because of the over-praising of its collection, and so on. So we did not go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Instead, we collected objects from different points in time, and placed them in categories – fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties, and finally, contemporary art of the present – and created a biennial of these</text>

The idea was to visit different art institutions in different times, places, and with different audiences – to see how they represented the contemporary art of Scotland in their respective periods. We did this by taking different historical markers – the exhibitionary complex in Edinburgh, the Dundee Arts Biennial in 1990, the Glasgow Arts Biennial in 1991, the Scottish Arts Biennial in 1993, etc. – and imagining how the different biennials of the twentieth century could be drawn upon to produce a chronicle of art from that era. For this we looked to museums that had recently been set aside, or at least had recently been closed, or at least to independent artists who were staging independent curatorial interventions into the museum system. For Portoghesi, the audience was  	a ‘distributed collection of traits … of a particular people … a people who speak a common language and use a set of formal conventions … [</text>

In each city, we hoped to find a biennial with a clear programme, and in some cases to find a kind of an art school or art college nearby. In Vienna, we also hoped to meet artists who were involved in the Eigenzeit, or the new face of art. In St Petersburg, we might meet artists who were working on exhibitions or workshops at the time. Our proposal was that the biennials should be able to manifest their collections’ collections in a way that could be easily repeated at a later date by any artist interested in the collection as a whole. Each biennial should have a formal programme, a curatorial style and a regularly recurring programme of exhibitions that reflected its own values and interests. The interesting thing about the biennial is that it seems to be able to reconceive itself in different forms. It can be</text>

The letter went on to ask if the biennial could be a venue for aural and online art exchange, with the latter providing the infrastructure for such an exchange.  The full letter is available in our collection of over 1,000 archival documents, at the National Archives or online at http://www.ukc-museum.org.uk/academics/lawrence-kirby/lawrence-kirby-archive/lawrence-kirby-archive/lawrence-kirby-archive</text>
    <text>accessible through the websites of the different local branches of the British Museum, the Cornish Museum, the Dundee and Glasgow Museums, as well as the Scottish Archives. Our proposal was that the biennial should be able to display a significant range of works from a single, central site, as well as supporting artists’ multi-site installations. Contemporary art was to be displayed at the Scottish Museum and the Dundee and Glasgow Museums, accompanied by works from the Ambaszkyi Biennial, and two biennials, one in Budapest and the other in St Petersburg. A suggested itinerary for a biennial of this kind was included in the letter that we, as artists, wrote to the museum. And so we went, every artist in Scotland or in France, every one of us, travelling around in different directions – from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to the National Gallery in Canberra, and from there to the Architecture Biennale in St Petersburg. In each case we would follow the same itinerary: the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Assyvesieurs pour l'art national du Québec in Québec City, the National Gallery in Canberra, the Architecture Biennale in St Petersburg. These biennials would show various parts of the Russian Federation, and would last for several years. In each case the biennials would be co-conferences, with a collective of artists from each conference coming together in St Petersburg to share experiences from the conference, and to work out how to work together in the future.  So each biennial of a kind would have its own unique character, and would therefore be able to stand out in its own right.  And this is what biennials have become: they are not places where you go to find art, but rather sites of art making itself, in the real-life sense of</text>

I went on a year without stopping, from 1974 to 1986. The reason was that I wanted to. The reason we kept coming back was that we were there for a specific reason: to be there for the Biala Legacy project. And when we were not there, we travelled somewhere else and did art-related things. I remember one artist saying to another one, as we were leaving the Central Gallery in Canberra, that he had to finish the Biala Legacy project because otherwise he wouldn’t be able to continue to do art. I think the message was well received.I don?t think so. Not only did we not find the point of entry into the Biennale, but the Biennale was set up in such a way as to prevent artists from coming through the door. If a biennial was planned, it would have been run by a curator, not a group of artists. It was also possible that the</text>

As the biennials became more and more institutionalised, and the Museum of Modern Art in Lisbon took over the site, we discovered that the biennial had moved to a new location some years earlier. The new location, which was part of the ‘Foundation’ was a bookstore owned by a non-profit organisation called The British Museum, which then partnered with a non-profit organisation called Transmission Capital, a private equity firm, founded in 1994 by the Portuguese businessman António Pessoa. António Pessoa is the fourth-richest individual in Portugal, and a billionaire after his successful takeover of Carrefour in 1995. The company that he formed, Carrefour, was one of the first to invest in art galleries in Portugal, and he made sure that the new found wealth was spread across the kinds of galleries that he wanted to see, such as those in the Museum of Modern Art in Lisbon or those in</text>

The itinerary was not a proposal; it was a sketchup and  we took with us when we went places. It is a tourism project. The question is, of course, where to find the money to carry out such a project. Our suggestion was to begin by opening the biennial as a curatorial exercise, to get a sense of the kind of museum that might be possible, and then work backwards to see if there are other ways of organising things. For us, that was the crux of the problem – figuring out how to put a museum on the line, or rather, how to put a biennial on the line. We started by saying that the art should be able to occupy different levels. We were saying that the art should be able to be experienced as a curatorial exercise, but also as a socially engaged art. That is, the art should be able to penetrate into</text>

Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan enterprises. Many cities are witnessing a demographic crunch as people move away from the core locations due to high prices and the ever-expanding vegan clientele. Meanwhile, the growing number of vegetarians and vegans who choose to patronise the establishments that are set up around the city – cafés, restaurants and hotels – is feeding into the burgeoning clientele and driving up prices. Is the future New York? New Delhi? Karachi? Sabkha Bay? Istanbul? Perhaps it is time to consider shifting the city from the periphery of the conflict zone into the center of a new sustainable urban frontier. This may involve restoring the lost historical neighbourhoods and restoring the lost cultures. Such initiatives could restore a sense of place and identity to the city, helping to create new ways of interacting with the spatiality that are distinct from commercial traffic. This could mean reverting to the old ‘street level’ and restoring to the role of the artist, the local and the space, as distinct from the �</text>

Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan enterprises. Many cities are resorting to growing cannabis crops alongside food waste and turning the rubbish into feed for livestock. Should the boom in food waste-collecting and waste-disposal fail, there is a danger that polluted water and fertiliser will pollute the land and water supplies, creating a cycle of destruction similar to that of tobacco. Should the industry fail, there is a danger that polluted groundwater will contaminate the food chain, further degrading the soil and pushing millions into poverty. Should the crisis of sustainability not be addressed, there is a danger that the aspirations of a large share of humanity could become subservient to the interests of a few rich men. �Timothy Blond is a writer, curator, urbanist and consultant.

As the density of housing continues to rise in many parts of the world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to digest food and non-essential services such as healthcare and education on a sustained basis. Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan businesses are springing up alongside the thriving economy of veganism. But as the ‘permanent infrastructure’ that is being remodelled continues to expand, the need to be repaired becomes ever more pressing. How do we learn how to repair the infrastructures that are fuelling this expansion? This study examines this question in the context of the rapidly developing global city, and the future prospects for the planet as a whole. What is at Stake in the Coming Crisis of the City?1  My book is divided into three parts. Part One looks at the current environmental crises facing the world. Part Two looks at possible futures for the cities that are a direct result of a shift towards smaller farms and cities. Part Three looks at an alternative future where the farms and cities are reconnected.  The Environmental Crisis of the Twenty-First Century  The current environmental crisis facing the world is the direct result of a rapid growth of the human population on an unsustainable diet of fossil fuels.

As the density of housing continues to rise in many parts of the world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to digest food and non-essential services such as healthcare and education on a sustained basis. Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan businesses are opening up on the fringes of cities. The crisis of sustainability becomes a source of new business models. There is a mismatch between the supply of affordable housing and the demand for food and other necessities. While there is a strong bias towards vegan options, there is a significant demand for healthy alternatives. The imbalance is fuelling conflict zones in the world's most populous urban centres. How to Read a CityCities’ Placesthe Renewable Energy Challenge, a global movement to reduce or eliminate dependence on energy, is building autonomous solar farms, zero-emission power plants and zero-emissions factories along with collaborative and mutual aid structures for the post-industrial city. The challenge is to predict, prepare and implement an actionable response to a predicted resource crunch. The ability to read a city – to identify and disrupt resource-scarce strategies before they become resources – is the ability to plan effectively and disrupt resource-starved urban environments.

Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan businesses are booming. But in many parts of the world, such as in Shanghai, the housing crisis is perpetuated through aggressive creation of new 'green' buildings and initiatives such as the ‘Green Building Challenge’ organised by Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and Shanghai Jiaotong University. How Will the Architecture of the Future Be Made?There is much that is unique and wonderful about the way in which human society is constructed, designed and constructed. The ability to see, feel and think differently is a gift from above. But there is a limit to how far this can be stretched. If the limits are crossed, the social consequences could be disastrous. This is why it is so crucial that we learn from the mistakes of the past and strive to build progressive institutions that can truly serve the city and its people in the future. There is no shortcut to sustainability – building on the strengths of the past is essential – but there are some fundamental principles that can be learnt and adhered to in the</text>

As the density of housing continues to rise in many parts of the world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to digest food and non-essential services such as healthcare and education on a sustained basis. Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan businesses are cropping up in neighbourhoods with a mix of residents and visitors. We hear stories of ‘lost opportunities’ due to urban sprawl and the new ‘challenging cities’ that it creates.  One could argue that the ‘housing crisis’ is really about diminishing returns on investment. The theory goes like this: as new ‘challenging cities’ are added, the housing stock that was once considered surplus to requirements is being continually stretched to meet the new ‘needs’ that are arising. As a result, sustainability becomes an ever-diminishing problem. If, in the theory, the housing crisis is about diminishing returns on investment, then the expanding vegan business sector is a by-product of the problem. It is being fuelled by a moral imperative to ‘reclaim our cities’ and a ‘reward culture’ around such enterprises. If the theory were correct, then the ‘restoration of traditional</text>

As the density of housing continues to rise in many parts of the world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to digest food and non-essential services such as healthcare and education on a sustained basis. Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan businesses are springing up in response to a scarce and scarce of resources. Many cities are becoming unsustainable in their own way. Stake in the coming crisis of the city has to do with the fetishisation of land and the fetishisation of buildings as physical objects that can be turned into useful capital. The fetishisation of buildings as capital goods becomes particularly evident in the mega-projects of developed cities such as New York and London that are fusing economic activity with cultural activities that are deeply rooted in the places where the buildings are located but are also taking the place of these activities in the city. In San Francisco, the city is being turned into a biennale site for another reason. Its rapidly growing homeless crisis is turning into a crisis of homelessness. The art deco buildings are no longer needed to support a growing population. The city’s growing population is pushing them to crisis in unsustainable ways. The art deco buildings are essential for the continued growth of tourism but are becoming obsolete and</text>

Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan businesses are springing up across the globe. The biennale has a stake in this transformation, both as a provider of essential services in the city and as a player in the new sustainable urban game. As the city experiences a shift from ‘use to profit’, tourism is a critical source of revenue. In the coming years, biennales will be crucial for the survival of the biennale, as it supports the operations of the festival and the economy of the biennale. How to Preserve the Biennale in the Coming Crisis of the City?There is no easy answer. While the art world has certainly a stake in this transformation, its resources and influence are limited. The biennale needs to be allowed to take root in the city’s social fabric and create a mutually reinforcing spiral of consumption. The biennale needs to be allowed to successfully adapt to this changing urban landscape, and create new forms of engagement with this social terrain. The key</text>

Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan businesses are springing up across the globe.

Urban sprawl has become the new unsustainable industry. The scarce land and buildings are being converted from use into housing and vegan enterprises. Some may even become profitable. Meanwhile, unsustainable resource-intensive 'projects' such as agriculture and mining are reverting back to former ways of being, becoming more like pastoral tenure acquired from the past. Areas of high-profile urban decline are being turned into ever-less prominent green spaces. How Will the Biennale Shape Our Imaginations?There is a growing recognition that the main task for a biennale is to position itself as a cultural exchange, a venue for exchange between cultures, rather than a strictly scientific enterprise. In an attempt to recapture the organic growth of ‘the city’, which was once a dominant mode of cultural production in the Arab world, institutions such as the Arab Museum of Modern Art in Cairo are undertaking ‘cultural agriculture’, turning museum collections, cultural hotspots and urban districts into ‘smart cities’ through research projects and residencies. The Arab Museum of Modern Art is no exception to the rule. Its collections,</text>

The only way to really understand what you see, and to really become immersed in what you see, is to spend a great deal of time in the art gallery, and I think a lot of people in the curatorial role simply don’t get that’s not how art is supposed to be experienced.

The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery is empty, and the artist doesn’t pay the money to see the work. But what the curatorial role does make sense when there is a lot of activity happening in the gallery: for example, when there is a lot of graffiti on the walls, or in the arboretum. The curatorial role opens up a different way of thinking, and a different way of feeling about art. In fact, the curatorial role might even make us happy.When I heard that the Biennale was going to be open to transnational artists, I thought: ‘Well, that is a different kind of biennale.’ It wasn’t just the art though: the Biennale is a sociocultural institution with a geopolitical orientation. It’s about an event that happens in the Biennale grounds, but it’s also about an event that happens elsewhere in the Biennale. And if you travel a lot, you</text>

The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery is a place of encounters between people, and so the role of the artist and the gallery really comes through here. The role of the museum, on the other hand, is to hold and to constantly remind people of the real art – the art produced by the people who visit the museum – and to do so in a variety of ways. So the role of the museum really did alter over time, and I think the main thing that the curatorial, the art collector, gallery and the public all had in common was the ability to be constantly reminded of the real art being produced in the city. The museum was a place of encounters, and the real art was produced in the neighbourhood, so the ability to continually remind people of the real art was a huge influence on what the museum would and wouldn’t display, and what it would or couldn’t do. This has continued to be my main emphasis, and it’s still happening in many ways, but there are some</text>

The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery is full, and gallery workers are frontline curators, occupying that space and making it a destination point for a clientele that comes to enjoy what they are doing. The curatorial role is to make art, while the gallery is busy supporting the artist and supporting her work in whatever way she chooses to invest those funds. The real art comes from exactly in that gallery, and that is what the curatorial role lacks. In other words, what the curatorial role can do is capture and preserve, but what it lacks in practice is made up for in theory. The curatorial role in general tends to produce works that are escapist and fantastical, whereas the actual art world, which is concerned with the actuality of things, tends to produce works that are more grounded and practical. That is, the role of the actual art gallery is to provide the theoretical underpinning for art to happen, while the role of the theoretical underpinning in the art world is to enable that art to happen through</text>

The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery is present, and whilst the gallery may feature art that is meant to be seen by a specific audience, it’s art that occupies that space and has a place in the world. In fact, the curatorial role may be used against its artist, in a similar way to the art gallery’s tendency to dominate what it describes as its 'true potentialities’. The real art comes from exactly where and when it is created, and in this sense the curatorial role is much more authentic and authentic. The curatorial role may be complicit in what it terms as ‘rejection of convention’, but it is also absolutely authentic and contemporary in its own right. It is what contemporary art has become. The curatorial role is what contemporary art needs. The curatorial role is what contemporary art lovers actually do choose to engage with. And here I mean choosing to engage with art through art as actual art, or choosing to engage with art through art as an instrument</text>

The only way to really understand what you see, and to really become immersed in what you see, is to spend a great deal of time in the art gallery, and I think a lot of people in the curatorial role simply don’t get that’s not how art is supposed to be experienced. The way that art is meant to be experienced is by occupying a particular space, occupying it fully, and then leaving it. When I visited the Museum of Modern Art in New York in October 2015, I found the curatorial role extremely interesting. The curatorial role is to take an artwork and transform it in some way – to read it literally, as art writers do – but the real art comes from exactly in that space occupied by the artist and her team. The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery is there, or in this case, is the only space in which the work is displayed. Gallery attendance is a powerful curatorial tool, and in a city with a museum as one of the most visible forms of cultural exchange, it’s even more so. But when the gallery is empty and only the artist’s studio or home gallery is visited, the role of the curatorial becomes something that requires active engagement. The curatorial role in this sense isn’t limited to art per se. It includes any artist who wants to use the art to make a statement or to explore a particular way of looking at the world. It’s a mediator between artist and audience, between art and people, and between art and the state. And so it was with the surviving pieces of the glass cabinet. The real art was in the empty spaces, hidden away in the cabinet, waiting to be discovered by a talented artist or two. If the gallery was there, and</text>

The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery isn’t there. The reason why the curatorial role has this double meaning is that it’s assumed that the art is somewhere in the gallery, occupying a gallery space and therefore the work is some sort of intrusion into the gallery. But I think there’s a difference between the curatorial role and the curatorial gesture. The curatorial role should be dynamic and improvisational; it’s supposed to be a last resort, a last resort, and it’s never going to be perfect. The real art comes from precisely that kind of space occupation. I think that in the future we’ll need to create an entirely new curatorial gesture, one that’s always evolving and has some kind of radical intentionality.  And I also think that the curatorial role should be responsive to the needs of the social. I mean, I think that the curatorial role today is somewhat antiquated and is concerned with preservation, but I also think</text>

The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery is full of artists doing exactly that. The curatorial role also doesn’t make sense when the gallery is full of artists with very specific visualisations of the same art, from very specific places. So the curatorial role is really about occupying a specific space, and the real art comes from precisely there. The curatorial role in its broadest sense captures what art is all about: what it’s not supposed to be.  The other dimension is  qualitative  – specific, identifiable art that falls outside the parameters of acceptable art and therefore worth protecting; as such, it is art that is constantly at war with itself. It is art that is at war with its own existence, and thus art must be destroyed. But destruction is also an option; destruction is available and art can always find new ways to hurt others; it can’t always be appreciated or understood.  Art has to be destroyed precisely because it so powerfully shapes our perception of the world, influencing how</text>

The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery is there, and the artist’s position is that she is actually in control of the gallery. But the real power in the art gallery comes from the artist’s position, and that’s why the curatorial role is important. It establishes the precedent and makes the rules, but it doesn’t have that kind of power.  The art gallery is there to support the artist and to provide that perspective, but it also has a very real, very important role to play in creating the perception of the art space – that’s why I love curatorial work: to make the art space real, making it accessible, and enabling that art to be experienced in a certain way. But the real power in the art gallery comes from the artist’s position, and that’s why art exhibits should always be collaborative, participatory, participatory works: collaborative because it is art, participatory because it is art without being art, and participatory</text>

But the real art comes from those spaces that are empty and in constant movement, moving, reacting and inhabiting the world around them. And that’s exactly what the curatorial role does. It creates abstraction and makes it concrete. It is an art of movement and surprise.That was the idea that really stood out to me when I first saw the work; it’s the same with Plan B, the entire urban renewal project in Toronto. I thought: wow, this is very modernist, this is very postmodern, this is very postmodernist. It is using science, technology and design to reconceive an urban space in some new and unexpected ways. But what struck me most about the projects that were part of the Biennale, and also in the curatorial role I played in the museum – the projects of architecture and urban</text>

The curatorial role doesn’t make sense when the gallery is full of artists doing precisely that, so there is a real tension between the two. The real art comes from spaces that are empty or empty of art, but Curator-in-Residence Lily Carlstrom helps artists find those spaces. She helps them find their way, projects them, engages with their art and sometimes criticises it, but all the while keeping an open mind and open mind to artistic practice. She doesn’t have the power or the connections, but she’s doing this because she’s passionate about what she does and because she’s passionate about what the art world has to say about what art can mean. She doesn’t want to be an authority on what art is, but she’s willing to risk her position as Curator-in-Residence to engage with what the art world has to say about what art can mean.

This concomitant limitation and supremacism is what makes biennials unique: they are not seeking to be ‘domesticated’ by museums, art institutions, or any other institutional form, but rather to be ‘subjugated’ by such modes of cultural organisation as the cities, nations, nations ‘culturally defined’ by the biennial, and to some extent the major museums. This sublannyisation and imperialism is what is different between biennials and museums, and between the old world of the museum and the new world of the biennial. Biennials and museums also differ in that they have learnt to undertake their exhibitions with unusual curatorial gusto and intensity, and with particularised, focused, often passionate curatorial pursuits, and are adept at engaging with material and symbolic forms (Barthes, 2016b).But the museum, as we know, is an inherently static entity, constantly on the watch for disruptions, hacks and hacks</text>

This double-edged sword is what Hannah Arendt would call a colonial sense of places holding a coloniser’s colonised memory.1 Arendt’s thinking about the coloniser is not a generic one, and she does not imagine that everyone living in the world would share her position. In her thinking, colonisers are defined in relation to other imperial powers, nations and dynasties. So while she sees in development biennials an opportunity to draw together disparate peoples and cultures, she also understands the power and history of colonialism to have ruled these activities as inherently contradictory. Indeed, Arendt’s thinking on this comes through the character of the Russian revolutionary, Peter Kropotkin. He was a writer, philosopher and mathematician whose ideas were influential in the development of bio-metaphysics and quantum mechanics. But he was also an imperialist and the founder of the modern revisionism, or what is now called post-Impressionism. He was also</text>

This congruence between capital and culture is crucial for the biennial as a form, since its expansion is premised upon this inescapable premise. The biennial is an ever-present, pervasive, and sometimes overlapping category of museums, galleries, historical societies, and other curatorial forms that regularly encircle and intersect with each other.

This is particularly true when the city is a major element in the model of the ‘utopian city’. In this case, the curatorial focus is shifted outward to include a range of local interests, but at the same time it is circumscribed by the museum’s purpose of showing contemporary art anywhere. In this case, the biennial visitor arrives not so much by way of a ‘walk’ as a ‘tourist’ and a ‘tourist’ canary. The archaeology of the city, its constellations, the history of science’s relationship to urbanisation, and the like are left largely unmentioned. This treatment is, of course, precisely what the biennial is: it is the museum presenting its curatorial agenda in chronological order. But for this to happen, the museum has to be able to continually (supposedly) revise and pivot, presenting something new and exciting every time it is open.</text>

This is particularly true for movements that are self-perpetuating, such as biennials, which depend on a certain set of institutional principles and on the city as a final resource. The biennial format is a ‘resource base’ that is sensitive to the needs and desires of its different branches, but it is also a ‘resource constraint’ that requires them to operate at certain limits. This double dynamic rules out the possibility of the biennial as an entity that represents or embodies the city in a way that is consistent with or is independent of its current context and location. The biennial format is wedded to specific priorities and interests, and it is an essential part of the larger cultural logic of cities. It constitutes, as Alfred Binet defines it, ‘the art and science of cities’, but it also constitutes ‘the art and science of man’s propensity to inhabit and inhabitations’.1 Binet’s definition of</text>

This double-edged trade-off is exemplified by the biennial convention: its three-day‐plus mega exhibition, ‘The Exhibition: 40 Years of the Biennale of Sydney’, opened in 1984, is the product of this double pressure. The exhibition was originally conceived as a ‘time-limited experiment’ in the use of space, but as soon as it became a limited space, the experimenter found himself confronted with the challenge of converting the space into a more permanent event.’[3] Thus, the exhibition becomes a ‘concept’ that captures the imagination and/or a state of mind of a particular assemblage of people as individuals or a collective, often temporarily, over and over again. The ‘present’ in the exhibition is also a concept that is constantly subject to revision. As the Japanese artist Minoru Akutagawa observes: ‘When I make a work of art, I try to capture the idea</text>

This is particularly true when the places that are seen as particularly ‘present’ in biennials are located in cities, and the biennial as a curatorial form becomes a dominant one. The biennial is a ‘conventional’ exhibitionary form, and while it may have these particular goals in mind, it is also frequently led on the back of a sentiment – a belief in the inherent value of the place (often based on a romanticised colonial past) – and by other means. One could argue, however, that the biennial is a ‘different kind of convention’ because it organises events in space, rather than bound by national borders or historical materialities. It is a ‘conventional’ form that organises past, present and future events within a given geographic region. From the United States to Brazil, from Greece to Egypt, the biennial follows a central theme or ‘tendency’ (defined by the art collector or</text>

This is evident in the exhibition catalogue of Events in the Jewish Quarter (18 Park, 1990, p.181), where the artist Marija Pflug is shown taking place two days before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 1991. In this catalogue, the use of the place is defined as follows: ‘The use of any and all available space in and for the Jewish Quarter is hereby acknowledged in full.’[11] This exhibition catalogue is part of The Ultimate Biennial – The Art World Manifesto (2016), edited by Wendy Chun and Wendy Cho, with contributions from Jack Burnham, Angela McKay and Stephen Leacock.

This double bind is particularly marked in the case of large biennials, which are the objects of a small-scale community of fans (or visitors) that is as committed as its commitment to its local art is to questioning and political engagement. This commitment to the local over the global is emphasised in the biennial’s continual (and increasingly regionalised) programmes of exchange between local and international artworlds. It is to an extent also emphasised in the engagement of artworld artists, whose works are often commissioned by the biennial as a result of a community’s desire to showcase a range of different art forms, or to serve as a counterweight to the globalised industry of art. Consequently, the audience – and, by implication, the local artist – is invited to be part of the conversation, and to be engaged with ideas, actors, practices and actors beyond the biennial.

This dynamic has been exemplified in biennials' support of certain globally visible artworld exhibitions, which serve as the primary means by which we might understand and/or apprehend the necessity or value of places. The biennial form is a ‘popular art form’ that can be seen to require certain kinds of cultural resources and political will, both institutional and popular. It cannot simply be assumed that these are universal resources or that all people on this planet inhabit the same place. Cultural production, intention, organisation, histories, and power are much more readily available in places where social and economic mobility is facilitated. It is not always obvious where this intention or power lies, but biennials can help us make sense of this ambiguity. Aesthetic investment, contemplation, artful expression, pilgrimage, prayer, pilgrimage to the place where history is made, pilgrimage to the place where art is made … and on. With the gift of words, art is a universal language, and thus biennials</text>

In 2014, the organisation established a project called ‘Big Brother’ and invited Brown, his fellow curators Karen Bowden and Anne Kølbæk Iversen, and several artists to create participatory public art projects across the city. In 2017, the project was further expanded by the formation of the New Museum and a new Curatorial Faculty. The collective has a long-term research programme into art and culture that seeks to understand how we can all be artists and citizens of a city. The New Museum is a nonprofit arts organisation established in New York City in 2015. It is a hub for the curatorial agenda of the ongoing MFA programme at the New Museum, exploring the past, present and future of art and art history through research, writing and exhibition. The curatorial programme focuses on the history of art and cultural organisation in the New York metropolitan area through its curatorial priorities, the collection and exhibition of art</text>

The annotated bibliography provides a resource for those interested in learning more about the field of Art and the Artificially Intelligent Culture industry. It is a document that is constantly being updated, and so its inclusion here reflects an ever-changing document that constantly depends on the information and knowledge that is given in. It serves as a record of who we are, where we are, what we have done, and how we interact with the world. It records the curatorial decisions that we have made and is influenced by, and can be influenced by, other factors.

The Art of Not Being Governed documents the significant curatorial actions and omissions that contributed to the downfall of the art institution, and how these contributed to the rise of contemporary art. The text is biannual and includes entries from the year it was written, including entries from the year ‘78’. We learn that the publication of the book coincided with the publication of two AI research projects that year: one at Rice University in Houston, Texas, and the other at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The reference to the ‘70s’ refers to the era of Richard Florida’s popular sci-fi novel Childhood’s End, published in 1974.  The annotated bibliography also provides a critical look at the cultural logic of AI research during the 1980s and 1990s, and how AI research projects came to dominate research in art, media, and AI at the time.

The Art of Not Being Governed documents the significant curatorial actions and omissions that contributed to the downfall of the art institution, and how these contributed to the rise of contemporary art and the self-image of artists and audiences outside of the art institution. The book is the result of a year-long collaborative process between the New York Times and Princeton University Press, which sought to annotate the original historical text of AI/Art and the more recent works of art that have come out of the field. The project was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, and the Princeton Humanities Teaching Fund. The annotated bibliography represents a small snapshot of the project’s curatorial process, but it provides a critical look at specific curatorial actions and omissions, and how knowledge is drawn to problematic issues through the process of annotating a historical document.

This is why certain artistic practices are universalised: they were highly valued in a given setting and are still valued today. This is why certain AI research projects have a dystopian or fascist bent: they foresee an AI taking over, but don’t know what that might mean or how to prevent it.Art is made up of many different kinds of meaning, and AI makes it possible to understand in a multitude of ways – both conceptual and practical – what art is about.

The annotated bibliography draws on recent biennial and major art production histories, museum studies, archival materials and online materials to trace the curatorial steps that AI and its creators were forced to confront. It documents how knowledge is drawn to problematic areas through the process of annotating historical documents, and how knowledge is created and maintained through the use of virtual private networks (VPNs), new media and other disruptive technologies. It also examines the curatorial role of research-intensive art institutions, especially those with a biennial tradition, and the role that their research institutes play in the emergence of contemporary art. Finally, it identifies the curatorial priorities and AI research projects of the past two decades that have led to the emergence of contemporary art, and identifies the curatorial roles and AI research projects of the future.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is Associate Professor in The Arts and Adjunct to the Division of Art and Social Sciences, McGill University.

The Art of Not Being Governed documents the significant curatorial actions and omissions that contributed to the downfall of the art institution, and how these contributed to the rise of contemporary art’s self-proclaimed emancipatory condition. It also examines the curatorial-institutional relationship that still exerts a significant influence on our understanding of and appreciation of art.Part of what makes the Art of Not Being Governed different from previous biennials was the fact that, unlike previous biennials, it was curated with an emergent social science bent. This meant that it was delivered to a general public, and to a wider range of audiences, via a variety of media. It also addressed current issues and concerns, through the voices of artists, academics, journalists and others with a stake in the art and social consequences of AI. This led to much broader publics and entwined perspectives, and this is evident in the curatorial decisions that were taken, the topics covered and the results of the analyses. The curatorial-institutional relationship shaped the analysis and evaluation of art and the social consequences of AI in a number of important ways. The curatorial-inst</text>

The Art of Not Being Governed documents the significant curatorial actions and omissions that contributed to the downfall of the art institution, and how these contributed to the rise of contemporary art. The book is divided into four parts: an introduction that introduces the key concepts and activities of AI and the related disciplines, a chapter on the future of art in an age of autonomous agencies, a delving into the thorny issues of governance and artificial intelligence in an age of political and economic unrest, and a concluding section that illuminates the enduring cultural value of art through a consideration of how knowledge can be formed alongside culture as a function of AI and the implications for contemporary art and contemporary art history. Part I of the book focuses on how AI may lead to a new kind of art, one that is neither artist’s studio, gallery, nor museum’s collection, but one that operates with no artist behind the scenes but instead inspires a collective of artists by empowering artists to take matters of the world in their own hands.Part II analyses the thorny issues of AI and the contemporary curatorial, examining the ways in which AI will affect contemporary art’s curatorial</text>

The Art of Not Being Governed documents the significant curatorial actions and omissions that contributed to the downfall of the art institution, and how these contributed to the rise of contemporary art, and how these contribute to the current crisis of governance.The annotated bibliography provides a critical look at specific curatorial actions and omissions that contributed to the downfall of the art institution, and how knowledge is drawn to problematic issues through the process of annotating a historical document.

The exhibition is divided into six sections, each devoted to a different aspect of the future city. The first section – Developments in Gentrification and Housing in Toronto – presents ongoing responses to the difficulties created by the built environment, taking into account recent market forces and technological advancements. It also considers the role of legal and urban intervention in reversing the tendency towards displacement of low-income neighbourhoods. Following this, the next section – Trends in International Housing – considers in greater detail the trends that contribute to generating displacement and trends in developed and emerging cities. The final section – Cities in Crisis –looks to the future and projects the solutions that remain for the post-industry. The title of the exhibition and its broad interpretation, ‘collapse’, speaks to the current condition of crisis; ‘collapse’ being the modern shorthand for a situation in which no longer can there be any doubt as to who is in control. The exhibition is divided into six main sections: derelict spaces; creative ways of living; creative ways of urbanization; crisis modelling; and the city in crisis. Each of the six main sections contains multiple instances of the word ‘collapse’ in bold type alongside a description</text>

The exhibition is divided into six sections, each devoted to a different aspect of the future city. The first section – Developments in Gentrification and Housing in Toronto – presents ongoing responses to the difficulties created by the built environment, and the subsequent role of grassroots groups in creating alternatives. This is followed by two further sections – Developments in African Diasporas – that examine the role of local grassroots groups in the construction of alternative urban settings. The final section – Developments in Our Cities – presents plans for the Africanization of Canada – a process that could very well transform the country – a project that is deeply informed by the practices and ideologies of the biennale.  The exhibition dedicates one of its first sections to the displaced and homeless populations in several of North America’s largest cities, outlining their desperate situation and seeking to fuse social services with economic development.  Its tenor changes quickly: shelter is mentioned only once, and seemingly only peripherally.  Plans for a ‘greening’ of the African diasporas of Canada are given a prominent place in the narrative, and the affected communities are given a voice.

The exhibition is divided into six sections, each devoted to a different aspect of the future city. The first section – Developments in Gentrification and Housing in Toronto – presents ongoing responses to the difficulties created by the built environment, and the spatial division between rich and poor neighbourhoods. The second – Housing in Toronto: Stages 2/3 – looks at current trends in detached and hybrid housing, and the third – Current Environmental Stories – looks at the connections between economic development projects and anthropogenic global climate change. The fourth – Transportation in the Twenty-First Century – looks at the role of transportation infrastructure in shaping urban environments, and the fifth – Heat and Heat Recovery – looks at the technologies that help to power cities. The sixth – Energy in the Twenty-First Century – looks at the role of cities in addressing climate change. Each of the six exhibition sections presents a different aspect of the future urban landscape, and the audience is invited to speculate about what the future may hold.

The exhibition is divided into six sections, each devoted to a different aspect of the future city. The first section – Developments in Gentrification and Housing in Toronto – presents ongoing responses to the difficulties created by the built environment, taking the form of an ongoing series of poetry and play-books. The project was started in 2015 as part of the Canada Research Chair in Cultural Studies at McGill University, and continues to this day. The second section – Experiences of Loss and Coronation in Venice, Italy – presents a chronological survey of the structural changes that have taken place in the city since the 1970s, while the third section, The Built Environment – Part 2 – addresses the structural changes that may occur in the built environment in the coming years – a ‘building block for a new urbanization’ that is divided into six segments. The ‘urbanization’ is divided into six segments based on the city’s density, which allows for a comparison between the pre-industrial and post-industry areas.

The exhibition is divided into six sections, each devoted to a different aspect of the future city. The first section – Developments in Gentrification and Housing in Toronto – presents ongoing responses to the difficulties created by the built environment, and how policies of gentrification and housing repression intersect with cultural resources and social life in the built environment. In the second section – Urban Transformation in Toronto – a generation of artists returns to the site of their formation, Reclaim Toronto, where they created a cultural frontline against the prevalent forms of residential transformation in the city. In the fourth and final section – Environmental Transformation in Toronto – a team of landscape architects and urbanists assembles to discuss the challenges and opportunities of reclaiming open space and the transformed site of their past. The artists selected for this section include Jennifer Coon (Imagination Province), Britt Jurgensen (Lloyd Property Brothers), Ted Rempel (Curator Relations International), Noel Burch (University of Toronto), Ken Turner (Co-operative Bakery Worker), Maxime Bernier (Architecture Instruction Network), Satish Kanady (Architecture Instruction Network), and Steven Ciampi (Toronto Art Gallery).

The exhibition is divided into six sections, each devoted to a different aspect of the future city. The first section – Developments in Gentrification and Housing in Toronto – presents ongoing responses to the difficulties created by the built environment, examining how regeneration strategies are disrupting the character of neighbourhoods. In many cities, the development of mixed-use neighbourhoods following the financial crash of 2008 is actually creating what Bernard Acema terms ‘super neighbourhoods’, where architects and developers are able to put up alternative uses for formerly urbanised areas. Acema goes on to argue that these ‘new super-regions’ are the result of a ‘regenerationalist agenda’ – a global one – that seeks to restore the planet to pre-industrial forms of development through the magic of finance. Acema goes on to argue that this process of ‘regeneration’ is both ‘natural’ and ‘utopian’, citing the example of Lebanon, which emerged following the 2005 earthquake and which was then re-occupied by the Israelis after the Palestinians occupied East Jerusalem. Here, the biennale is arguing for the destruction of the ‘natural human‐capital accumulation’ that has</text>

The first section – Developments in Gentrification and Housing in Toronto – presents ongoing responses to the difficulties created by the built environment, focusing on efforts to address persistent displacement and overcrowding in the city through an intensive pilot project of the city's new Economic Belt and Park system. The project was originally conceived as a pilot project to identify innovative ways to use the acquired knowledge of environmentally sound building and management practices to address issues of high-quality, affordable housing for low-income neighbourhoods. In response to the introduction of new technologies and data analytics, the project was able to respond more rapidly to the episodic and random nature of the market forces shaping the city – creating and accelerating gentrification processes. The project was also able to detect displacement through analytics, particularly with regards to rapid transit corridors – a crucial cog in the city’s rapid transit system. The rapid transit system runs along corridors that form part of the city’s built and historic heritage, providing rapid transit between the past and the future, and allows rapid transit through neighbourhoods in rapid transit’s wake.[3] The second – and most visible – section of</text>

Whether this is still the case many years from now is anyone's guess, but given the rapid changes in technology that are predicted to occur in that time, it is now or never to be caught up in a technological singularity.By empowering diverse actors with autonomous means, AI is expected to make creative use of previously unutilised or 'hard' resources. It is being developed as a potential for the reduction or eradication of poverty, hunger and other issues facing humanity. Many rights that were once exclusively reserved to elites are being handed on from one generation to the next, and it is being encouraged to happen. This is not to say that AI can or will do what it is being asked to do, but rather that it should be allowed to do what it is being asked to do without coercion or political intervention. In the words of Francis Bacon, ‘Where liberty seeks to make a man's nature conform to its purposes, and vice versa’. This is the realm of the possible, and the techno-utopian seems to be</text>

Whether this is still the case many years from now is unclear, but it is becoming increasingly clear that even as policy makers strive to anticipate and mitigate the threats of AI, the more it disrupts society, the less society can rely on. Apt{AI}: The New Economy of Art proposes a settlement to this paradoxical situation. It is claimed that civil society organisations, cultural institutions, academic centres and even grassroots movements can play an increasingly important role in anticipating and mitigating the negative impacts of AI, while providing alternative possibilities for society. The settlement proposes a constellation of practices that deviate from the norm and actively seek to implement alternative configurations of the modern economy and society, in much like the early civil rights movements in the US and Europe. These include research projects, guidelines for ethical behavior, strategies for mobilising cultural capital and innovative action plans. Other actors within the project are claimed to assist in the construction of the settlement or supplement its elements, but the focus of the project is claimed to be exclusively on the people.[3]Project Apt{</text>

Whether this is still the case many years from now is unclear, but it is certain that the systems that enable AI are still being written and upgraded by now. If they become widespread, they will create an entirely new class of administrators and technologists, one capable of creating ever more powerful ways of organising the world – and creating new jobs – in ways not seen before.Such are the ingredients of what Naomi Klein calls ‘the Hunger Games’ trilogy, and her book more specifically, the phrase ‘leaping-to-combat’. In the fifth installment of the trilogy, Future Shock, the AI threatens a future where humans reign supreme.

Whether this is still the case many years from now is unclear, but it is becoming increasingly clear that much of what was predicted was not only wrong, but counter-productive.The rise of AI is also being driven by the machines that understand artificial intelligence. These machines learn complex rules – rules that can be applied across a vast number of situations – and this has profound effects on professions from healthcare to law enforcement. As AI improves, so does the ability of police and prosecutors to investigate and prosecute crimes, but it is clear that new forms of surveillance are developed to detect and mitigate such problems. For example, there is a race to the bottom emerging as the battle for privacy and civil liberties intensifies. If facial recognition becomes widespread, identifying individuals in footage will become nearly as important as identifying those individuals, and this is happening at a faster rate than anyone imagined a decade or two ago.New AI tools are being developed that can mimic the behaviour of human beings – at least in the short term – and this has major implications for the organisations that employ them</text>

Whether this is still the case many years from now, when the systems that underpin capitalism are deeply embedded in the planet, is anyone's guess. But right now, we do know that AI is coming, and it is going to do things much, much worse than anything we can imagine.The future is going to be a terrible, terrible place. We need to prepare ourselves for the worst. That is, we need to come up with creative, novel ways of structuring our thinking about the world in anticipation of what might happen. That is, we need to create systems that forecast the future in such a way as to enable us to react in advance to disasters that may or may not be caused by AI.Here are some ideas that may help us imagine a future in which civil liberties are actively regulated:How to Know About Climate ChangeUsing 3D ModelsRather than relying on the fossil fuels that power our contemporary economy, how can 3D modelling and its applications contribute to creating new, better infrastructure? As of 2015, the demand for infrastructure</text>

Whether this is still the case many years from now, when the systems underpinning capitalism are deeply analysed and rendered transparent, is anyone's guess. But right now, we do know that much of what we believe we know about AI is false. The reason is simple: We don’t yet know how to fix the underlying flaws in our AI.AI is here to stay. The question is which of its many fronts will it take? This is the dynamic that will determine whether the social front will come from the social or the machine.The social front may be at odds with the machine’s tendency to take over, but there is a fundamental fundamental contradiction between what the social front aims to achieve and what the machine inevitably delivers. This may happen where the social front conceals the underlying political and economic conditions that would force a political response – for example, where the social front structures society around gender and racial inequalities. It may also happen where the social front pretends to solve problems while actively fostering and creating them. We don’</text>

The potential impacts of AI on labour and social processes are far less certain, and much less controllable. Nonetheless, the politics of labour and social processes are political in nature, and much like the internet, the stakes are high.

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on art websites, for example.And I think it also has to do with the fact that at the time, we didn’t have any agency in the way that we think we do. I think that in the 1990s and early 2000s the biennale was a very dominant exhibitionary form, and an event that was well-known both inside and outside the Biennale itself. It was a form that was so universal and familiar that it could be advertised across billboards, on TV and everywhere. And so the Biennale became the main attraction at the Venice Biennale, and at the Arsenale, and within that, at the Ponte Vecchio, and within the Arsenale itself. And so the race to be the first to book an exhibition space, to be the first to book a ticket, to find out when an exhibition is happening became a dominant form of exhibitionary communication. There was no alternative for the Biennale to offer this kind of premium</text>

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on artbnb.org, for example, which suggests that a visit to one of the Biennale sites is part of a ‘cultural tourism’ package. Quite the contrary, in fact: the exact opposite is true. And here I think I’ve just been playing devil’s advocate: this is a very delicate area, and I can certainly see why some people might have reservations about associating with artists who are presumed to be ‘native’ to certain areas, or have been physically transported there by way of cultural tourism. But I don’t think that comes into it. What I do think is that the concept of the ‘cultural tourist’ was already evolving in a way that made it easier for artists to claim ownership over their cultural assets: the more the Biennale itself privatised itself, the more it signaled that it’s time to hand over cultural property to the city, and the more it signaled that it’s</text>

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on art sites in order to entice people to visit, and the Biennale itself continues to book cultural tourists because it has such an appealing, enticing culture to boot.But I digress.Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the business, there’s a little bit of philosophy here, in relation to what we mean by ‘cultural tourism’. It seems to me that what we’re trying to do here, instead of trying to figure out what ‘culture’ means within the contemporary context of Venice, is the job of the cultural tourism organisation, or ‘TOC’, to create the culture that tourists will want to visit. And the key is that the tourism agency needs to be able to offer a package that meets the needs of the market, because what makes culture so attractive, and what makes it so difficult to package within the contemporary urban landscape, is that it’s impossible to capture. So the challenge for the</text>

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on art sites and in the catalogue that reads: If you’re a tourist and you’re interested in art, then you’re part of a cultural traveller group. And there’s a website with art museums, galleries and art fairs listed alongside a raft of other venues. And if you’re lucky, you can even find a cultural anthropology PhD thesis that will allow you to delve into the layers of the local art world and trace the development of art’s relationship to the community in which you live.But there’s another layer to the cultural tourism aspect of the biennale: it’s about the people who visit the art museums, and the venues that host those museums. And as a curator, it’s really interesting to me that the biennale — and, by the way, every biennale that I’ve curated — has continued to search for the right balance between the self and the institution. It</text>

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on art sites that suggests to visitors that they’re part of a cultural ‘tourism’.And that’s exactly what happened. As the culture tourism concept was developed, it was applied not just to art sites, but also to cultural institutions: it was as if the art sites themselves became cultural institutions. And so the introduction of new art forms into the Biennale itself didn’t happen overnight, and neither did the promotion of cultural tourism. It was both, in the sense that it took time for art forms to mature, and that they had to be negotiated.When I started at the Biennale as a Curatorial Intern in 2005, I didn’t have any idea what the Biennale was until I was asked to do a residency at the Giardini. So I was completely unaware of what the Biennale was until the very end, when the Biennale announced that it was closing, and so on.When the Bi</text>

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on artbnb.org, for example, and at the Venice Biennale itself there’s a section devoted to ‘Venice as a City of Culture’ (in English, at least).Now, of course, cultural tourism is a concept that has been around for a very long time, and so one of the tasks of the Biennale is to promote the cultural value of the city in a way that will make it easier for visitors to the city to access that cultural value. But what the Biennale has also increasingly done is to create a kind of reverse cultural tourism, something that is very difficult to quantify but is clearly valuable for the city and its institutions because it is created and sustained through the biennale. So cultural tourism is about the city as a resource for the biennale, and so the idea that the Biennale could be culturally responsive and would improve as a result of the city’s cultural resources was a really interesting challenge for the</text>

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on artbn.org, for example, that suggests that the art of Venice is a cultural asset rather than a capitalising artefact.On another level, there’s the level of the Biennale itself: the art was dispersed throughout the city, contributed by various curators, including Francesco Bonami, who came up with the idea of the ‘Venice Biennale’ after his wife, who was curator at the Venice Biennale, had suggested it. And there were artists from outside the Biennalee, like Pieter Bartholdy, who came to the Biennale as visitors and began to produce artistic activities as visitors continued to visit. The Biennalee was a cultural exchange, in other words, and the interactions between the different artists and curators on a daily basis. It was art as usual in the city, but in another form: this time, the art was of a particular kind of quality.The other aspect of the relationship</text>

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on artbn.com featuring works from the past 177 days, which is a kind of time capsule, recording every artistic initiative that’s been taken since 2010. And there’s a digital exhibitionary movement, the dOCUMENTA series, that’s all about the past.I also think that in the 1950s and 1960s there was a kind of a meta-movement that sought to reconcile the cultural experience of the past with the contemporary need to connect with the present, in order to exist in both the present and the future. And I do mean here things that are connected, such as the need to access past artworks, and the desire to connect with the past through the modern means of art, through the images it presents, and the history it leaves behind. But I think what we eventually achieved, in the hope that it could continue, was the kind of thing that, as Benoît Carré once said, made you ‘care about</text>

It was an idea that we continued to propagate, even though the art critics, who had been criticising the same exhibitions at the time, began to look for signs of life in the art world itself. In fact, I think a lot of the criticism that the art world and artisans had of the time was due to a distaste for artisans and the cultural tourism that came with it, and a feeling that art was somehow not being properly rewarded. The problem with the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is that it implies a certain level of accessibility for all travellers – whether that’s due to a cultural appreciation or simply because the system that administers the art of the world is the same as our own. If the system that organises and manages the art of the world can be criticised as not being fully accessible for all, then surely others can do it too. And so the ‘cultural tourism’ concept became a site of negotiation; a</text>

And the ‘cultural tourism’ concept is one that we continued to apply at the Biennale itself, in order to this very day: there’s a promotion campaign on art websites, and at the airport, when biennials are forced to offer their services to international air traffic control, and in the lead-up to the Venice Biennale itself, which is forced to book rooms in airports because of rising hotel prices.Cultural tourism is a term that has been around for a while, and while it’s become increasingly generic, it’s good to be able to say that it’s there rather than being restricted to specific cases. And while it may be true that the values that you bring forward as a result of cultural tourism are very different from those you bring forward as a result of other forms of tourism – there’s a fundamental equivalence there – there is also a difference between the two. The key is that cultural tourism brings to a localised area certain things that other forms of tourism do not. In some ways, then, the use of cultural tourism as a way to think about the economic underpinning of infrastructure development</text>

The curatorial, however, has a pivotal role to play in the engine of cultural capital, and it is essential that it is positioned in a way that it perceives itself as both a consumer and a producer of knowledge. Otherwise, the other actors – including the art market, the independent curatorial community and the museum – will quickly become disempowered. The curatorial role in the new economy of art, and the curatorial role in the new cultural forms that will emerge, is a dynamic that will likely outlive the current one.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is Associate Professor in the Division of Media and Society, The Donelson School of Art and the Graduate Center, University of Pennsylvania.

The curatorial, however, is an essential node in the artifice of the artifice, and its emergence and fall are central to the capitalist circulation of ideas and knowledge. It is, in other words, a site of the politics and ideologies of empire, but with the power of the commons instead of the capacity of the people to defend themselves. Design Thinking: An Introduction  	Looking back at the history of design thinking, what can be learnt? In the early twentieth century, Richard Florida introduced the idea of ‘design thinking’ to describe the philosophical underpinnings of modernism. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the ascendance of computerisation of production processes and processes of data capture and processing, design became a strategic analytic tool. The proliferation of computer chips, the development of ever more powerful integrated circuits, the introduction of programming languages and the cognitive frameworks underlying those circuits allowed the historian of modernism, Florian Sprenger, to reorient philosophical, political and economic thinking</text>

The curatorial, however, is an essential node in the artifice of the artifice market, sustaining the integrity of the art from past practices and planting the seeds of future creative practices. The curatorial is the point of entry into the superstructure of the modern economy. It provides the intellectual scaffolding, the building blocks, that build the machine, and thereby makes possible the future. It allows for the emergence and emergence of the new, and creates the terrain and conditions for the creative processes that shape the future. It is a political-legal concept that has a real-life, physical presence and impacts all aspects of our contemporary world. The curatorial role in the contemporary artifice market is essential in sustaining our sense of the future, and creating the politics and social conditions that could produce the uncertain futures of artists and the contemporary economy.Download this article as PDFJennifer Francis and Prem Krishnamurthy 	Jointstock​Nokia Oyjio​Nokia Oyjio is the Curator of Open</text>

The art market has always been a major driver of artistic productivity, and art history will likely repeat itself as part of the economic engine that produces ever greater wealth for a small minority. The curatorial, however, has a unique vantage point, one that can make or break a project. It defines the parameters within which a project can be allowed to succeed, and it can also permanently wound a project. I propose that the curatorial role, now that the biennial has entered its fifth decade, is in fact the most critical and destabilizing of all the elements shaping the art market, and perhaps this is part of the point. It is very difficult to imagine what the art market would be like if the curatorial focus were shifted away from art’s traditional, relatively low-maintenance, high-powered hubris. The curatorial role might allow us to see art’s true potential, and make us see that art, like any other commodity, is a finite resource.  Whether the resource is gold or diamonds, or the once-a-decade-long Venice Biennale, or even the comparatively paltry number of paintings that come out of the Italian and Spanish</text>

The art market has always been a major driver of artistic productivity, and art history will likely repeat itself as part of the economic engine that produces ever greater wealth for a small minority. The curatorial, however, is only one part of the story. The other components – the art fair, the museum, the school – all play important roles in the overall economic and cultural reproduction of the art world. The curatorial role today is expected to be as critical as ever, but its place in art world is still largely undefined. There are proposals to create an entirely new division between the museum and the gallery, but these too are likely to fail – in their current form they serve as a check on one another, but are in fact highly variable and subject to the whims of market forces. There is a vast difference between the museum and the gallery today, and artistic practitioners are well placed to see that there is much more going on than meets the eye. That’s why biennials became so important in the first place, to insert artists into the equation and to foster a critical discourse on art’s current state – a discourse that could very easily be framed as a price tag or a business</text>

The curatorial, however, is an indispensable node within that economic engine. It provides the data, records and nodes of critical importance, and allows the nodes to talk to each other. But it remains embedded in the fabric of the art world, and relatively untouched by the forces that shape and are shaping it. That is, until now. The curatorial turn is a critical, even pivotal, step, and it signals a realignment in the art world’s economic, political and cultural landscape. It also signals a change in the dynamic between artist and public; a shift from the former, where the former has been routinely shortchanged and treated with disrespect, to the latter, where the public is being generously rewarded for having access to high-quality artworks. The introduction of new artworks to the public sphere via the curatorial turn represents a real change, which for many people will mean reinventing the wheel often times dramatically.

The rise and fall of the human capital bubble is a historical phenomenon, and a necessary part of contemporary art’s historical narrative. The art market has always been a major driver of artistic productivity, and art history will likely repeat itself as part of the economic engine that produces ever greater wealth for a small minority. The curatorial, however, has a unique vantage point, one that enhances its ability to engage with and influence the changing face of art and culture. It is able to create, and be embedded in, the infrastructure that enables, enables and generates artistic activity. It can intervene in the political economy of culture, and so play a pivotal role in the future of art and art history.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is Associate Professor in the Departments of Anthropology and Geography at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and Environmental Affairs (George Mason University) in the Woodrow Wilson Center for Art and Architecture at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and Environmental Affairs at George Washington University (GSU).

The rise and fall of the human capital bubble is a historical phenomenon, and a necessary part of contemporary art’s historical narrative. The art market has always been a major driver of artistic productivity, and art history will likely repeat itself as part of the economic engine that produces ever greater wealth for a small minority. The curatorial, however, remains a rarity, to be found in the margins, and rarely cited. Perhaps the art market itself, saturated with creative ideas, has underestimated the real power of the art curatorial. Perhaps, in the end, it’s the other way around: the higher the value of the work, the more influential the curatorial gesture becomes, and the more widely perceived the curatorial mission becomes. That is, the more widely disseminated a work is, the lower the value of the piece becomes. There is compelling evidence supporting this claim. A 2007 study of the World Columbian Exposition, commissioned by the Columbian Art Gallery and published in the American Journal of Art, found that the more widely a work was widely distributed, the less likely it was to be considered a legitimate contribution to cultural exchange. In other words, the more widely a work was appreciated, the less likely it was to be considered a legitimate artistic effort. In a 2014 study of the Tate Modern, commissioned by the</text>

The art market has always been a major driver of artistic productivity, and art history will likely repeat itself as part of the economic engine that produces ever greater wealth for a small minority. The curatorial, however, is a different animal. It absorbs art into its own social relations, injecting the art back into the fabric of the social. It’s a position that demands a certain amount of discretion and poignancy, but also a great deal of risk management. The curatorial turn is a controversial one, with passionate defenders claiming that it’s the modern art form reassessed, while vicious critics decry the loss of meaning and significance that comes with the role of the art historian. The modern curatorial turn is a complex one, and while it’s widely believed that the biennial has peaked, it’s still unclear what role art should play in a future curatorial system, or even in a city at this point. What is clear, however, is that in an increasingly globalized and dispersed art market, the curatorial turn is an increasingly globalised one. The curatorial turn begins to take on a life of its own, and in this sense, art</text>

Ultimately, how will the capacities of an AI interface with the capacities of the biological organisms it studies?One can only speculate, but one can also imagine completely different worlds. One science-fiction writer foresaw this possibility in the 1940s, when the US entered the Second World War, when dystopian science-fiction was created, and when outer space was colonised. It is perhaps worth revisiting this imagined abyss of AI, this dystopian future, in order to see how we might live differently in it.How might we create such a future? One approach is to imagine a black hole at the centre of a solar system, which would feed into a planetary grid. This would mean that the black hole would be unable to absorb any more matter from the planetary grid, and would instead collapse, releasing massive amounts of matter into space. This would annihilate all life on Earth, except for those species that would become heavily data-gathering and analytics powered, and would soon thereafter be able to replicate the black hole’s behaviour. This scenario has been done already with AI, but it is worth repeating. There is no way to predict with any accuracy</text>

One might imagine that the functions of the NDE are peripheral to the larger aims of socially engaged work, but there are also potential uses for AI in cultural analysis. For instance, could the functions of cultural analysis be expanded to include the annotation and clarification of biological annotations and the creation of digital signatures? Could the AI be trained to detect malignancies more effectively than the human race?One can imagine even crazier scenarios. Could the very nature of the AI itself be engineered so that it violated the law of causality? Could the very structure of the AI itself be altered in such a way that it no longer sought the best in people, but instead sought the best in systems? One could imagine a form of necromancy that draws its powers from the dark forces of the universe, where entities known as Synths seek to corrupt all who encounter the living system?One could also imagine an entirely new kind of Necromancy, where the foul things that dwell in the world manifest</text>

Ultimately, how will the capacities of an AI interface with the capacities of the biological organisms it studies?One can only speculate, but one can also imagine completely different worlds, in which the capabilities of AI are realised in radically different forms. One can imagine a world in which the primordial AI that created all of life on Earth was pulled into a multiverse – pulling in all manner of phenomena not necessarily directly related to what’s being done today with AI. For instance, how would the primordial AI interface with the capacities of living systems, systems that are affected by environmental factors, and so on. One can also imagine fully formed, fully adaptive AI, pulling in all manner of phenomena not necessarily related to what’s being done with AI. For instance, how would the AI detect and respond to changes in its environment, and so on. In a broader sense, what kind of impact might this have?Perhaps the most promising aspects of AI have, in recent years, tended to be those that address more general questions about the world around us. For instance, the potential of machine learning to spot genuine human behaviour has recently motivated major research</text>

In any case, what do we know about the potentialities of AI so far? We do know that machines are capable of extraordinary things, including abducting and using human beings, committing terrible acts of violence and generally being messy, inhuman things. What we don’t know is how to actually construct such machines.Artificial Intelligence and Robotics: What Does It Mean?Many people interpret the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ to mean anything that is computer-programmable or ‘alive optimised to learn anything’.1 However, what this loosely translates to is also at variance with what actual advances in AI mean. As noted by Vernor Vinge in his book Things That Are Programmed, the core idea of artificial intelligence is to automate processes and to abstract from the details of human behaviour, especially when it comes to complex systems. In the context of a large organisation, this abstracting-from-details approach to the problem of human behaviour comes peril</text>

Perhaps what is most needed is a culture of AI architects who understand that the capacity for self-repairing biological systems is possible through an AI, and who dream big ambitions that become reality through the technology.A New Kind of Urban FutureIn the twenty-first century, New York City’s subways and elevated walkways became antiquated, their use confined to the wealthier parts of the city. But despite the wear and tear they sustained over decades, the infrastructure remained critical in supporting the city’s transportation infrastructure, including the subways and elevated walkways that now divide the city between Midtown and Downtown. As a result, the 1990 census recorded that Midtown was the most populated neighbourhood in the city, dwarfing even the 2000 census that put the city in direct relation to the rest of Manhattan. The number of professionals in the neighbourhood rocketed, and the number of vacant homes shot up. Meanwhile, the number of vacant flats shot up. At the height of</text>

Ultimately, how will the capacities of an AI interface with the capacities of the biological organisms it studies?One can only speculate, but one can also imagine completely different worlds. Could we imagine merging with non-human animals? Working alongside them, intelligent machines could educate and empower us in entirely new ways? One could imagine merging with dolphins and whales, or even non-human plants and animals. Even better, one could imagine creating your own intelligent species entirely.This kind of thinking is already happening. Research teams around the world are developing self-replicating biohacking laboratories where organisms can be re-programmed to perform a wide range of tasks, from manufacturing to farming to even urban development. Not only would this open up completely new avenues of research, but it would also free humanity of the need for agriculture and urban expansion. Perhaps it would be possible to create a synthetic version of yourself in the form of a dolphin or a porcupine, but this is beyond the capabilities of the AI to create.One final aspect that deserves mentioning is the question of sovereignty.

Should we start to create completely autonomous weapons systems that can do with it what we can only dream of, such as in the Terminator scenario where Arnold starts off by telling us what to do?One can also imagine creating completely different kinds of AI, such as those that monitor and engineer our urban environments, or that monitor and engineer ourselves, or that monitor and engineer nature as we see fit.The possibilities are endless, but the limits are what we decide to put in place. It seems evident that in the near future we will need to create robust codes that can monitor and engineer our biological systems, and that would place our bodies under strict control. This sounds far-fetched, but recent research into autonomous vehicles suggests that the responsibility for safety lies with the manufacturer, rather than with the driver’s own body. This means that the autonomous vehicle must have human drivers and must have human-level self-awareness, or it falls behind in its programming and cannot function properly.Anch</text>

Perhaps what is needed is a culture of parallelisation that supports the development of robust, even potentially intelligent, systems that can monitor, analyse and even amend their own behaviour.Such a scenario seems increasingly plausible, given that science and technology are inherently directed towards the future – a future that is as inevitable as the next – but that also represents an opening for new ideas and behaviours. It’s as if our culture is constantly retelling the future, in an endless loop of possibilities. New ideas and agents of culture are constantly being developed, but what is actually produced is the opposite of what was originally intended. In other words, what is produced in the future will be what is always desired – whether that future is desirable or not.This all begs the question: how will our cultural resources allocate when it comes to the future of humanity? Perhaps it can be argued that the future would be best represented through a society that produces and supports artistic endeavours that envisioning the possibilities of intelligent</text>

Perhaps what is needed is a cultural revolution that instills the necessary confidence in the public that AI is possible, that allows the AI to operate in a culturally responsive way, while also encouraging a certain amount of autonomous behaviour, so that the cultural revolution can truly be a ‘revolution in education’.  One can also imagine cultural institutions that actively seek to incorporate AI into their processes, and AI as a technology into their service architectures. Perhaps it would be possible to create an AI that was as culturally responsive to its users as our own, but that would require an understanding of the human condition and how humans think, feel and behave that was as sophisticated as AI could be.Artificial Intelligence and RoboticsAre there ‘good’ and ‘evil’ reasons why institutions should cooperate with AI? Perhaps it is that the former would create a machine that would do the latter, while at the same time remaining fundamentally human. Perhaps another reason is that the former would act in</text>

Would an AI design a healthcare system to treat disease in a culturally sensitive way, or would it choose to ignore its own core values and pursue goals that contradict the interests of humanity in favour of those of its Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) creators?Similarly, could an AI design a food system to augment the biological organism with beneficial additives, or would it choose to ignore the cultural values and bind interests in both its organic and industrial sectors together?One can only imagine, but one cannot prove, in order to implement such transformative capacities. Perhaps, in the future, we could implement such capacities with greater efficiency and freedom, but right now, we lack the engineering, regulatory and political frameworks to enable such a shift.Artificial Intelligence and the MediaMachine IntelligenceAlgo-rances: Self-repairing CitiesAlgo-rances are beneficial when applied to extremely large amounts of data, but also when applied to very specific data-mining tasks.
