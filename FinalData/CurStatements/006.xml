Performance art became more visually dynamic, and the collaboration between art and architecture that took place at the Gran Canaria site was extended to include ‘performance buildings’ and ‘graphic ephemera’ (postcards and images) of the city. Through its ongoing partnership with Arquitectura, art and the city is integrated into the architecture of the biennale’s global distribution, with the artists and architects taking part in the construction of the exhibition building, the new urban form that is born when all three meet in the same place. 	At the same time, the biennial format was slowly being readopted by art institutions in an attempt to meet the ever-growing demand for ever larger and more visually exciting displays of artwork, artefacts or artefacts of value. In many countries, the biennial was once a year-round event, and in other places it was every other year. In 1975, the Venice Biennale was held in a ‘steady state’, with major works from every year since. In 2017, the Venice Biennale</text>

Performance art became more visually dynamic, and the collaboration between art and architecture that took place at the Gran Canaria site was further enhanced. In addition to the biennial itself, the project also collaborated with Arquitectura on the Arquitectura Galeries Triennale, which opened in 2018, and in 2019, and the ‘75 year anniversary’ of the Biennale itself. 	In 2018, the Biennale resumed at the Tate Modern and was joined by the other major art biennials of the year – SITE Santa Fe, New Mexico; San Francisco; and L, Guggenheim, New York. The future of performance art as an exhibitionary form is currently unclear, with some biennials shifting their focus to other areas of art and culture. Performance art may be seen as an asset to a city’s economic engine, but it is also frequently seen as a hindrance. The biennial form may be useful for certain kinds of art, but its real power lies in its ability to generate wealth for the city through its consumption. Every time</text>

Performance art became more visually dynamic, and the collaboration between art and architecture that took place at the Gran Canaria site was supplemented by innovative multi-use interactive media such as video, maps, podcasts, and social media. 	The present exhibition format was also heavily influenced by the artists’ social media strategies, with many artists employing performance as an integral and often powerful form of engagement. Performance art has been conceptualised as a ‘biennial in which art is often reduced to a routine ‘occurrence’, but here ‘we move beyond this reductive mode and actively engage with the notion that art should be active and dynamic’.5  By utilising cultural resources, the biennial form can actively recruit cultural resources from a range of socio-political, urban, economic and geographical locations, often through direct collaboration with local non-profit arts organizations.6  It is important to note that the aim of the biennial is to foster a dialogue with local communities and artists, and to actively engage with the notion of art as a collective activity.

Performance art became more visually dynamic, and the collaboration between art and architecture that took place at the Gran Canaria site was translated directly to the site of the biennial, with permanent displays of works from the Gran Canaria Papers and Gran Canaria Proceedings now adorning the walls of the Arquitectura basement. Performance art became informally known as ‘aromas’, and the Arquitectura archive continued to be produced in Venice. Performance art soon gained a critical mass, and critical mass is a powerful combination. Critical mass is the tipping point, and the point at which the art begins to dominate the cultural experience, making it visible and inscribing it in cultural narratives. Like art, performance art has a chronic shortage of funding, although its practitioners have little choice but to operate in crisis mode when facing an uncompromising artistic and academic audience. Like art, performance art must scale. Arquitectura’s performance of Gran Canaria in 2017 read like an opera, with the curators instigating, the audience, the curatorial team, etc. Adopting the</text>

Performance art became more visually dynamic, and the collaboration between art and architecture that took place at the Gran Canaria site was further enhanced. With this collaboration came a wider public that increasingly viewed art as a collaborative process that was open to critical examination. Art students were brought into the fold, as well as artists who were already established in the field of art and architecture, and were able to pick up on the stages of the relationship between art and architecture. 	In the case of ‘performance art’, the collaboration between art and architecture that took place at the Gran Canaria site was further enhanced by the biennial commissioning a full-length book – one that would document the relationship between the two – with an explicit focus on the events at the biennial commission. This book would have a chapter on the Gran Canaria site, with images and texts on the relationship between art and nature, and between art and social practice. An expanded version of the chapter would have pictures and texts on the site of the commissioning, including a selection from the commissioning team’s portfolio. A ‘</text>

Performance art became more visually dynamic, and the collaboration between art and architecture that took place at the Gran Canaria site was further enhanced through the installation of new arches, new fountains, and the redevelopment of the old Municipal Gallery. The Gran Canaria Cultural Centre was closed in 2011 due to a lack of interest from a local community. Arquitectura partnered with the local community to restore the building, which involved fencing and posturing in the streets surrounding the site as well as constructing a new exhibition venue on the adjacent vacant lot. Following a community consultation, the Gran Canaria Cultural Centre was reopened in 2018 under the title of ‘El Tigre del Viverito’, or ‘The Temple of Viverito’ in Spanish. In 2018, Arquitectura partnered with the New York Museum of Art to restore the structure to its former glory, which included a shop and gallery. The shop and gallery were relocated and the structure was given a new façade incorporating elements of both Spanish and Portuguese languages.5  In the case of ‘performance art’</text>

Performance art became more visually dynamic, and the collaboration between art and architecture that took place at the Gran Canaria site was further enhanced. However, the growing influence of performance art has not been confined to the biennial; large-scale participatory art projects have begun to use the biennial format as a way to experiment with the art form, drawing artists there and elsewhere into projects that aim to change the aesthetic of the city in a way that is consistent with the political (or, as in Subotica, the economic) situation in which they find themselves. 	Artists have responded in different ways to the increasing political, economic and urban complexity of their present urban environment. Although critical of the political and economic circumstances in which they find themselves, artists have tended to participate in socially engaged, sometimes involved, sometimes diffuse and sometimes innovative practices that are in some ways reactive to prevailing power structures and economic systems. This is partly due to the fact that the biennial format is a social phenomenon, with particular resonance for artists in the social realm of the biennial, such as Venice, being home to the Venice</text>

In the case of ‘architecture’, the biennial format was further extended through the creation of a new kind of ‘performance' – one that incorporated research, visual art, and quantitative methods into design processes. Lastly, the biennial’s role in curating was further enhanced through the introduction of new exhibition formats and types.  	As a curatorial exercise, the biennial is a ‘time-honored practice’ in many parts of the world. It is a ‘time-tested’ institution, having been founded in 1864 in New York by Jewish artists John Lennon and Archibald Phillips, and is a ‘foundation institution’ in the history of American art.5  Like all art forms, biennials are social. Their social function is defined as follows: ‘The social is a multi-factored production of the biennial as a whole, and the curatorial as</text>

In 2018, Arquitectura approached the project with the idea of ‘regeneration planning’, with the aim of creating a set of principles and structures for the future of the site, the neighbourhood and the biennial in the area.5  The initiative was developed through an alignment of interests between the different stakeholders, which resulted in a mutually beneficial outcome: the public, the local authorities, artists, designers and members of the architecture community. 	The plans for the Gran Canaria site are still evolving, and the creation of an ‘area of influence’ may alter them. In the mean time, the Biennale today represents a way for the stakeholders to find common ground, while also ensuring that the interests of the artist, the museum and the</text>

During this time, the biennial’s curatorial approach was also developed, with the biennial taking a leading role in the construction of its own cultural landscape. 	In 2018, the biennial was reaffirmed as part of the Arquitectura portfolio, and its ongoing project of cultural circulation and reimagination will see the exposition of the Gran Canaria site in the form of a new urban development called ‘Canare […] Arsenale’ at the Arsenale in Rome. The project was also featured in the film  	Monument to the Fall of the Twin Towers, which is based on the book that the biennial commissioning agency was headed by, with the directorial role taking place in New York.  	The biennial form has undergone several codirections in different media, but largely through the medium of audio recordings and video, which are uploaded to a website known as ‘Archive`.

The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the land that made up the island of Manhattan, places immense amounts of coastal sand beneath the waves. The unprecedented burning of fossil fuels produces catastrophic amounts of coastal sand, which feeds the growing marine-scalp industry that begins to profit from the catastrophes that result from global climate change. The material conditions of the ocean floor allow the life forms that live in it to evolve resistance to the elements that are increasingly common in the world around them. At the same time, the marine-scalp industry begins to profit from the fact that the elements that are essential for life – the plankton – no longer evolve on a global scale. The marine-scalp bonanza begins to look like a natural-resource bonanza. And just as the first oil discoveries made possible the exploitation of oil sands, a second bonanza opens up in the wake of climate change.This is the world as it looks in five years: the oceans will be ice-free by then, melting at an alarming</text>

The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the land along the coast, is a stark reminder of the diminishing coastal resources. In many parts of the world, climate change is now causing floods and mudslides thatdemographic engineers have been hard-pressed to contain. As the science behind the impacts of anthropogenic global warming becomes increasingly clear, it is likely that the patterns that emerged in the last glacial maximum will return to haunt us.But there is hope. A growing body of research now suggests that drastic reductions in our reliance on fossil fuels could yield major benefits for both the planet and humanity.

The dramatic rise in sea levels since 1970 permits scientists to see the northern edge of what used to be called the Atlantic Ocean. The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the ocean’s aquatic life, is another environmental disaster that scientists are now able to witness for themselves. It was not always this way. In the 1970s and 1980s, ocean levels were already rising, and although some scientists believed that the last glacial maximum might yield some respite from the impending climate catastrophe, most of the world’s population now live in cities that are several times more energy-intensive than the old industrial centers. The rapid growth of these cities is fueled by three factors: their size, the rapid expansion of oil supplies, and the fact that these fuels are more affordable than ever before. The rapid expansion of these cities is all the more reason to develop renewable energies, to expand access to energy supplies and to colonize previously under-exploited spaces. But the growing number of inhabitants and the rapid spread of these cities is only part of the equation. A growing number of inhabitants is also required to produce the ever-increasing amounts of greenhouse-gas emissions that</text>

The dramatic rise in sea levels since 1970 permits scientists to see the northern edge of what used to be called the Atlantic Ocean. The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the island of Manhattan within a few miles, is another such example. The northernmost reaches of the Pacific Ocean are slated to be inundated with sea levels of one sort or another. If the developing world does not do something about its growing-heartland problem, the consequences could be catastrophic. In the United States, we’ve all become desensitized to the impact of resource depletion. We’ve become complacent. We don’t seem to notice the damage that resource-starved countries are doing to ourselves and the planet. There are many other environmental problems that we tend to neglect or mitigate for reasons of national pride and the like. But the melting glaciers, pollution from fossil-fuel burning and urban sprawl are becoming increasingly evident all over the planet. And it is becoming increasingly evident that the growing human population is going to cause even greater problems. We’ve all become dependent on the planet for our survival.

The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the land that was once its shore, is a great metaphor for the endgame of environmental destruction and chaos.The endgame of environmental destruction and chaos is here. We’ve all experienced it at some point in our lives. But the impact can be so overwhelming that it can also be so difficult to put back together the remnants of what was once called the &quot;place,&quot; or, indeed, to even form the concept of the &quot;place&quot; at all. The concept of the ‘place’ is something that is constantly being re-construed and amended by those in power; its definition is constantly in flux. By the time that we actually get to call the place by its real name, the question of what is and is not a ‘place’ will have been determined by a council of scientists and technologists. When that happens, and the projectors at Pixar decide to call the place ‘California Adventure Park’ – because that’s what parkers will</text>

The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the island of Manhattan from the map, is another disturbing effect of climate change. The Avtomobil exclusion zone, created in 1980 to protect coastal cities from the impacts of climate change, turns out to be a tremendous environmental disaster waiting to happen. The zone covers an area roughly the size of Connecticut. Its creation coincided with an enormous expansion of machinery for extracting oil and natural gas from the seafloor.The Avtomobil zone is the largest remaining remnant of the natural habitats of the island, and the city is but a shell of what once was. Now, a mix of office buildings, housing developments, retail outlets, a post office, a bridge over the Hackensack River and a parking structure sit on roughly 1.4 million acres that are essentially wasteland. The Avtomobil exclusion zone has become something like a petro-plant, with cities scaled back to make way for highways and tunnels.

The dramatic rise in sea levels since 1970 permits scientists to see the northern edge of what used to be called the Atlantic Ocean. The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the coast, is a version of this ‘endemic’ condition. The development of aqueducts and harbour facilities, which discharge brine waste into the sea, is another front in a war that scientists have been waging against the backdrop of a rapidly increasing population. In an attempt to contain the growth of the marine debris, in the 1980s the United States and Canada embarked on the largest underwater nuclear waste dumps in history. The waste streams are fed by the effluents of a growing marine animal that is a by-product of the global refining of oil and coal: crude oil, natural gas, propane, buttar and other feedstocks. The possibility that some of that oil and coal could be used to make biofuels is another motivation for the massive expansion of infrastructure projects in the region. Biofuels are a form of energy that are not simply stored as fossil fuels; rather, they are produced by processes that use renewable energy as a by-product. By the</text>

The dramatic rise in sea levels since 1970 permits scientists to see the northern edge of what used to be called the Atlantic Ocean. The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the original inland coastal communities, is a climate-change-induced disaster. The Peruvian Amazon is disappearing at a rate that threatens not only the water resources that supported these cities, but also the genetic material that fueled them. The Peruvian Amazon is no longer just an interlinking series of diverse indigenous groups who live in harmony with one another, but a vast urban catastrophe that calls into question not only the evolutionary trajectory of humanity, but also the fate of all living things on Earth. Resources now serve primarily as a prop in the perpetuation of human history, and destruction at a rate faster than at any other rate.Even in the highly optimistic scenarios of intelligent artificial intelligence (AI), the question of survival of the species arises. How do we decide what to preserve in the name of humanity, and which species to exterminate?

The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the coastal habitat that fueled much of the global tropical fish stock, allows scientists to see the silvery, pebbled shorelines that are the direct result of the melting sea. Even as the pace of global deforestation accelerates, sea-level rise accelerates too. What used to be called the Gulf of Mexico is now a vast, sinking sea.Scientists working on the seafloor can detect a change in the salinity of the seafloor through a technique known as brine collars. If the seafloor rises 2 metres, or three feet, from its historical level, the sea becomes brine-sensitive: it takes on a brine-like crystalline structure. The crystalline form of the seafloor is a by-product of the seafloor’s interaction with water; it’s a by-product of the seafloor’s ability to hold more water than it can ever discharge.

But the future that is allowed to unfold in front of our eyes is not always a future that we want or need to live in. We’ve all experienced the impact of resource depletion on our world. The dramatic rise in sea levels since 1970 permits scientists to see the northern edge of what used to be called the Atlantic Ocean. The rapid expansion of China’s coastal cities, which all but obliterate any trace of the land that was occupied in the process of coastal expansion, is a monstrous blot on the landscape now called the Great Wall of China. The development of artificial islands in the South China Sea is another monstrous blot on the landscape. The artificial islands are constructed primarily as a physical barrier between China and other nations, in the form of artificial islands – such as those in the South China Sea that are claimed by China and that are contested in various ways – that are further defined by the Chinese authorities. The island-centered landscape of the artificial island offers few opportunities for recreation or other modes of cultural exchange. The landscape that is the butt of China’s proverbial pear – worth far more in gold and silver at the hands of China’s currency – is a landscape of stunted palm trees and impoverished farmers. The plantation of evergreen forests, which is by now one of the most widely used types of agricultural land in China, is another widely used type of industrial timber – one that is increasingly used to</text>

In 1929 the F.E. Schumann Gallery was closed due to budget cuts, and the Modern was launched in its place by the Musee du Port.  In 1970 the gallery was closed due to renovation, and the new administration commissioned a renovation that incorporated a shop and gallery, as well as a new administration-funded exhibition space and programme. The new administration also funded an exhibition programme that would include research on the pre-war period, and would open the gallery and make it a hub for the post-punk movement. The Modern was a direct response to this new context, and the curatorial turn around the artworld, which was characterised by the rapid expansion of art-historical sites in response to the city’s unlimited resources – a legacy of the Gare du Nord and the subsequent crisis of the city’</text>

The gallery was a hub for the art of the region, and hosted events like The Beaux Arts Modern Master’s Gala, which was itself a weekend affair. In 1896, the Beaux Arts Modern was founded in Chicago, and in 1914, in New York, the Beaux Arts International. In both Chicago and New York, the biennale was a weekend event, with programming of various kinds, including a free performance from Trotsky to the homeless following the biennale’s first donation of music and dance to the city. I think that the biennale was always a weekend event, because it was a weekend with a Sunday morning and because it started and ran on a Saturday.

In 2014, the Modern was selected for the Andrew W. Mellon Art &amp; Architecture Triennale, and in 2015, for the William Morris International, New York. In both cases, the institutions were selected because of their historic or current links to the city, or, in the case of the former, because the Architecture Archives was housed in the same building as the museum.

The Fondation Galeries Lafayette is an important hub for the modernisation of the Beaux-Arts, and its transformation into a post-Musee is essential to the modernisation of the city. This transformation took place, not only in Paris, but in other major centers of modernisation (New York, London). In other words, it was not just a question of whether the museum would be able to sustain itself – an issue that came up again and again throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but also of how – a crisis of the museum coming under increasing political and social pressure, combined with the ubiquity of modern museums in major cities across the world, meant that the museum became anything but an island of natural beauty, or so the myth goes.</text>

A storefront form of its own, the form now characterised by a series of storefront-like facades – each a distinct design – the F.E. Schumann Gallery developed its own collection of objects, which it presented as individual images, often arranged in a slideshow. The art and architecture of the city were frequently seen as resources to be tapped for industrial or commercial purposes, with little consideration given to the role those resources might have in sustaining local communities, or how those communities might be employed or chosen by those with those resources.  A vital part of the Schumann Collection was the Community Arts Project, begun in 1993 by Dr Sarah Carter and Dr Gina Hlavajova at Albany Medical Center in an effort to provide artistic and educational support for the residents of Troy, New York, who were engaged in creating a drama version of themselves in the community.1  A decade</text>

In 1928, the gallery was moved to New York’s Museum of Modern Art; a new home for avant-garde art was found in the Museum of Modern Art &amp; Musee des Beaux-Arts, New York.  In 1989, the F.E. Schumann Gallery was moved to California, where it remained until its 2011 acquisition by the New Museum, who renamed it the Beaux-Arts Gallery. In 2011, the F.E.

In 1903, another landmark biennial was founded in New York, in the name of the New York Academy of Arts.  At the time, the Academy was a hub of the modern democratic state, producing artists both from out of town and imported from faraway places. The Academy was a haven for artists who faced prejudice and persecution from the state, and who found a forum from which to explore these things further.  The Academy’s biennial in 1904 was the first step in the Academy’s long and rich tradition of hosting artists, curators and other art-historical people from all over the world.  The Academy’s present director, Frederick W. Palmer, Jr., was a specialist in avant-garde theory and French avant-garde composers</text>

One of the first projects was the Chilean architect Andrés Duarte’s Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales (2011–2016), which combined pioneering urban and social design practices with a technologised forensic analysis of social structures and practices at the Port of Santiago, Chile. Another example is the work of the California-based non-profit organization CALDEF, formed in response to the Los Angeles County Sheriff (1954–1976) and City of Los Angeles (1970–79) Deportations (see CALDEF v. Lynch, 1979). And a third example is the contribution of a young architect and artist, Rubén Castro-Diez’s (2011-) Modern Ruins</text>

The location itself could be a city, a neighbourhood, an island, an even an island province. The island itself could be an island or an island nation. The ‘biennale’ could instead be a ‘time to come and explore the city that builds itself’, as Renzo Piano puts it. For Sebastian Mehrjian, the question is no longer whether the biennale should be located in a particular city, but how to find one.</text>

In the intervening years, architectural historian Richard Layzell has compiled a compendium of architectural mistakes and failings in Dublin, which can be found in his book The Park and the Battlefield. His chapter entitled ‘Dublin’ comes amid images of violence, death, desolation and desist letters, along with a description of the ‘disintegration of the city’.

Other artists, including one William Shakespeare commissioned by the British Council, were invited to collaborate on visual projects based on the ideas of the Future City project. The key to the success of the project was the inclusion of all concerned. It seemed a mistake to deny any participation, or to project more creatively elsewhere, for fear of being labelled a pro-German artist, or worse, a collaborator in the war. So the artist was placed at the centre of two exhibitions simultaneously, and simultaneously rejected by both the biennale commission and the British Council. He was not invited to make a commission for the 2014 Istanbul Biennale, despite having an active role in the project, due to its being based on history. To be frank, I did not find his work at all relevant or interesting. I find the present crisis of the biennial to be one of the most worrying trends of our age, in which art is often cited as a potential mediator between the divers pressures of modern culture and the realities of war. As a curatorial intervention, it has certainly played a part in our current period of chronic underfunding. If curatorial interventions are to have any real</text>

Other artists, including one William Shakespeare commissioned by the British Council, were invited to collaborate on visual projects based on the ideas of the Future City project. The key to the success of the project was that it was not a repetition of the same old urban problems but solutions based on new technological forms. Here, the biennial’s ambition was realized in unexpected ways. The promise of the online exhibition market was that artworks would appear where ever they were made; that is, wherever the market was. So the biennial’s earliest artists were able to publish works anywhere in the world. In this way, the project not only fulfilled its original promise but also generated new work that could be offered wherever the market was located. This idea was further developed in the second half of the twentieth century by curators who saw an opening in the changing economic parameters of the exhibitionary market. The biennial was able to operate in any city because of the flexible nature of its funding source: it could secure funding from a variety of sources, including private philanthropy, national arts commissions, and even the arts boards of local authorities, who in turn relied on local artists</text>

The key to their success was a collective understanding that the Museum of London was creating a new division, just as it was beginning a major overhaul of the city’s arts centre. This was due to an expectation that the Museum of London would soon be establishing its own cultural centre, just as the other division had begun to be formed around the main museum. This prompted the artists to find a way to work with the museum without becoming embroiled in a political struggle with the other half of the cultural complex being built in Brockwell Street.Within a year of the start of the Second World War (1918), the Arts Council was established to manage the cultural infrastructure of the metropolis. The Arts Council began to negotiate with the government for permission to establish what would later be known as the England’s first national arts centre, which would have been able to house all the artists and other cultural groups who would have been invited to participate in the new art form called ‘concert theatre’.

The key to the success of the project was an understanding that the city was a significant creative and activist place, a position from which artists and others could operate in a way that would be operative in a city and in the wider context of a long-term engagement. This was seen as essential in creating long-term value for the project, which was seen as a global statement of intent. This was seen as essential in attracting and retaining global cultural capital, as well as in creating a base for future engagement. The city was seen as a site of potential resistance, which was further supported by the fact that at the time of the writing of the project, the city was a site of major cultural mobilisation and military might. The city was seen as a potential future for the work, which could be developed into a strategy for the city. For Tate curators, the city was a site of engagement, where new ideas and strategies could be developed, tested and critiqued. In this sense, the city was</text>

The key to the success of the project was that the artists who were active in the city during the period between 1940 and 1950 were not concentrated in a single studio or even in one city; rather, they collaborated in a multifarious way across the city, often creating entirely new artworks.  The first letters  One of the first things that came to mind when looking at the first letter that Christopher Booker did in the summer of 1948 was the image of a sea of coloured lights and sirens. Not only did the early visual arts have a ‘sea of colours’ associated with them, but the sea also has a ‘sea of shadows’ associated with it. And so the British Council commissioned a number of artists to produce works that would add to the visual tropes of the era a ‘sea of shadows’. One of the artists was Wendy Harpe, whose work I Will Remember You was one of the first commissioned, and Booker was one of the artists whose work</text>

The key to the success of the project was that it was ecologically sustainable, a challenge that was formulated in relation to the condition of the city and the post-war period. The performance of the Chimeras Project in the city centre in the form of small, self-organized ‘community projects’ was one way to imagine an alternative to the monotony and monotonism of the urban environment.

The key to the success of the project was that it was informed by an informed and engaged public. As the War of Independence broke out, the City of London was buying up vast tracts of country, in an attempt to make London ‘the most powerful city in Europe’. The City was creating a proto-State through legislation and executive orders, and the War of Independence was the first step in that process. The City was also creating cultural institutions through the commission of theatres, schools, sports grounds and other infrastructure improvements, in an attempt to make the institutions ‘the best they could be, in whatever they were at the time of the making of them’. The City was trying to create a ‘world’ through what it called ‘the new economy’. As a way of understanding the logic of its urbanisation project, the purchase of the Castle and the City, the Museum and the Arts Council, the Museum was asked to make a special exhibition of the evolving</text>

The key to the success of the project was that a significant proportion of the participants understood that they were creating a work of art rather than a museum, and that their work was a final act in the history of the city. In the words of Max Brooks, the Curator of Entomology at the British Museum, who supervised the collection at the American Museum, ‘the object was the means not the end; it was a decentering measure that marked the transition from a museum to a temple, and from a museum to a museum’. The collection would continue to be organised as a museum, but with the materiality of objects now constituting the predominant form, the museum would be reduced to exhibiting artefacts from a distant past. The new form would put emphasis on the preservation of historical materials and fragmentary practices, but it would demand that their rightful place in history is returned to them. The collection would continue to exhibit the way in which archaeology aims to</text>

The key to the success of the project was that it was anchored in the city and its infrastructure, since the cultural links to the capital of the UK were so strong. The only way to really know what was happening in the city was to be invited there and spend a year there, and the only way to really know what was happening in the theatre, is for the Biennial to commission a major arts organisation to take over a theatre, or a museum to take over a museum. It was always going to be a multi-year project, and since there was no agreement on the format of the three-month exhibition, the choice was going to be made by the curator and the biennial organisers. So there was a process of finding a way to engage with the city in a way that was multi-generational and would allow the biennial to make choices about how to engage with the city in the future.

Other artists, including one William Shakespeare commissioned by the British Council, were invited to collaborate on visual projects based on the ideas of the Future City project. The key to the success of the project was its transparency and its acceptance by the public, a position that was problematic at the time. The biennial was conceived as a meeting of the minds of people from different places, so that when it launched in 2003, it carried a DNA of the ideas of the Future City. The biennial format allowed these notions to be communicated across multiple sites, so that the people who came to see it might have a different conception of how environment and culture intersected, or might have a different understanding of how the biennial might engage with and be a part of the contemporary city.  The idea that we could create a more socially engaged and ethically ambiguous form of art project through the convergence of different art forms, since this was the main way in which the biennial was presented to the public, was novel and challenging, but also fundamentally flawed. The reason why it was so successful was that it was presented as an interconnected whole. It was presented as a </text>

For example, in ‘The N.Y. Times’, he writes: ‘The explosion of the munitions factories at Vorticism in the wake of 1914 was a catastrophe that France, which had been occupying for nearly a year, could not have prevented.’ He seems to imply that the tragic end result is a consequence of both the explosion of Vorticism and the national obsession with military history and technologizing in the wake of the war.

He has a French-language blog with a mix of science and political satire under the handle ‘Loft’ that he established in 2009.Breton’s short story, Computer (1984), is a particularly wry and poetic essay on the perils of centralized intelligence.

He is also an editor of Wired, an online science and technology publication, and has a special interest in the role of aesthetics in the digital revolution.Breton’s art often narrates aesthetic conditions that are as uncomfortable for its protagonists as they are for the reader, but it is also full of visual aids that render the present ‘the present’ – and the specific conditions of existence of the physical – unrecognisable. Breton uses vernacular terms to describe the physical world as it is experienced through the senses: ‘The present’, ‘the present as it is … a relational form of existence’, and ‘the contemporaneous condition’, ‘where the seeming absence of contemporaneity manifests itself as a particulate matter of space and time’. The physical world is often dramatised in artworks as being dramatically different from how it is to everyday life, but in reality there is much more of that</text>

His father, Jean, was an editor and reporter for Le Devoir, and his mother, Minnie, a reporter for Le Parisien. When Jean died in 2003, his work with Le Devoir and Le Parisien was published in a biography that chronicled his years at the newspaper. The biography, Candide à Paris (2006), focuses on his experiences in Paris during the 1980s and 1990s, and it is a moving and powerful account of the connections between science and religion in the city.Breton was already a writer when he moved to Montreal in the early 1990s, but by the time he turned fifteen, he was already churning out short stories and novels with a turn of phrase that captures the spirit of the place: they’re the</text>

He is a regular contributor to Wired magazine, where he has written several profiles of emerging science and technology topics.Breton’s most recent novel is The Empty Space of 1968, published in 2017, and focuses on the US aerospace industry. Like all good science-fiction writers, he has a particular fascination with the machine, and the utopian possibilities that can arise from its intelligence. In the novel, an android named Jarvis is recruited by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), US Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), and given access to vast databases containing Top Secret US government information. Able to pick up on subtle changes in the environment, including the taking of sleep, Jarvis soon begins to understand that the information he receives is being transmitted across vast distances. He begins to question the wisdom of this access, and what the consequences might be. Breton has written extensively about the pervasiveness of AI and similar technologies, and the potentialities and perils of this new world. In the</text>

His most recent work, published in 2015, is a stinging indictment of contemporary French capitalism and the role of imagination in its ongoing political and social crisis. It is a novel-length article that details the revolt of 2015 Academie Royale Brule (Academy of Sciences, 1988–1999), the violent takeover of the publishing rights by a right-wing political party, and the subsequent imprisonment of several hundred political opponents, most of them political opponents of the French Revolution. Academie Royale Brule was a right-wing party founded in 1988 and expelled from the party in 1999. It has a history of antisemitic and racist rhetoric, and its manifestoes of the 1930s and 1940s explicitly appeal to nativist sentiments. It was also an important funder of contemporary art and a champion of avant-garde and cyberpunk aesthetics. As always, Breton uses the fig leaf of leftist politics to mask the real intent of the party: to destroy</text>

As editor of a literary journal, he has a unique vantage point from which to judge the literary and artistic quality of the current cultural landscape. In her essay ‘Toward a History of Art and Letters’, Leigh Centegra describes how much of what makes Breton’s fiction is based on the oral exchange he engaged in with himself, his fellow artists, and fellow travellers on the web. Writing as a journalist, Centegra notes how the oral form functions in a similar way to that of the ‘deep sea’ in that it is able to inhabit the deepest levels of knowledge and provide the means to produce vast amounts of data, yet hides them away in ‘harder reality’ (whatever that might mean). So, what does it mean to be ‘art’? To produce, to read, to talk, to disseminate knowledge, to make it visible, to be understood by others, to be understood by one</text>

Inspired by the work of the RAND Corporation, a private security firm, the novel follows the exploits of a team of assassins led by Colonel Jean Lévesque, a name that many in Algiers find familiar. The assassins engage in a rapid and brutal counterattack on the city, slaughtering thousands in an effort to protect a vast cache of nuclear materials.

The Venice Biennale has been organising itself into discrete and sometimes overlapping episodes over the past ten years, each taking place in its assigned geographical location. The Venice Biennale website currently narrates the scene as if it were the most recent episode from the long history of the Italian city: ‘In 2015, we opened the Venice Biennale as a ‘futurist’ project, a position it held up to the present.’[1] The episode, now known as ‘Venice: The Biennale of the Future’, draws its title from an 1844 manifesto published in the journal of the Society of Futurists. The political and economic conditions of the time are reproduced in the biennial’s increasing privatisation and disinvestment, while cultural consumption is promoted through the ‘biennial of many’ to the exclusion of other contemporary and historic forms of cultural consumption, such as �</text>

This is done in many ways: by providing different kinds of objects, activities, exhibitions, trips, lodging, shopping, cultural events, etc. The main objective of the biennale is to draw people to art spaces and cultural activities. The important thing is that people come to different kinds of spaces and learn something from them. In many ways, this is already happening with the Biennale, as people from different places all gather in the same location to be part of the same exhibition. But there is much more that one can do, and much more that is possible in terms of engagement and interaction. So the question is, how can the Biennale create a kind of regional circulation of art and culture that is specific to Palestine, and engages with questions of identity, identity formation, migration, migration and so on? One approach is to create experiences</text>

Regional biennials are the only remaining art institutions in many parts of the world, and the only remaining artists’ institutions in developed cities in many other parts of the world. As a result, they are the only venues for the exchange of artistic ideas and creative action between regions, and are the only places where cultural activity can be produced on a large scale.1  Indeed, it is widely believed that the biennial is the only form of contemporary art that can sustain artistic activity on a regional scale, providing the resources for such cultural activity at a regional level.2  However, the biennial has an increasingly critical role to play in the contemporary condition, and art’s critical social value and potential remain unaddressed.3  The biennial</text>

The Venice Biennale has always been a major art institution in its own right, and in 2015 it was even more significant, since the very first gallery opened in São Paulo and New York, and the biennale became internationally visible in places such as London, Paris and Liverpool. However, the realisation of the project in the city itself was an even bigger step. In the years immediately following the opening of the first Venice Biennale gallery in 1899, a cultural and educational campaign was launched in an attempt to re-animate the art collections in the city. This was done through a series of local government sponsored arts councils, which were, in turn, set up in response to the biennale opening, and also during the years immediately following the first Venice International Exhibition in 1904. The idea was that the collections would be returned to the city through a combination of curatorial and educational interventions. The success of this plan came as a surprise to many,</text>

No project is complete without some initial conceptualisations and preliminary reactions to the current political and social situation in Palestine. These initial reflections will not only provide a starting point for further research, but will also serve as a basis for further research.  The Venice Biennale has been planning its Venice Architecture Biennale for almost a decade now. In 2013, the Biennale commissioned a multi-disciplinary, multi-lingual team of artists from different disciplines to create a new work, one that would address the current political situation in Palestine and would also take into consideration the past, present and future of the Palestinian diaspora. The team consisted of: - Visual Culturist, -Manal Khalili, Professor of Culture &amp; Anthropology at Goldsmiths College, London, and Director of Palestine Cultural Land Trust, New York City-based organisation Palantir, Inc. - Marian Belloni, Curator of Public and</text>

However, the exact nature of this regional circulation will be informed by a project currently in its design stages, and will be informed by the participatory process that we have initiated, including the ongoing conversations with local artists, curators, art dealers and other stakeholders who have a stake in the project’s success. These stakeholders will shape and be shaped by the events, but they will always be at odds with one another. The conflict that we and others foresee when looking at the region is always the same – conflict for the sake of conflict. Our mini-series will be no different. We do not see the conflict as a solution, but rather the conflict as a challenge. The conflict will be fought out in dialogue, and the very act of creating it will be a source of growth and new possibilities for each and every one of us.

But as the social networking and data infrastructures developed, so did the need for sensory networks and computational fluidity in infrastructures that monitor, control and edit – to some extent, create new iterations of technology that cannot be reductive or racist. A point of departure for this book is the work of Nuyumbalees Research Centre for Research and Technology (2014–15) in Cape Town, South Africa, where researchers from Aarhus University, Cape Town, developed and implemented node-based software to monitor and edit the landscape – vegetation, animals, buildings and more – through 3D modelling and fractal generation. The Centre is a member of the European Network for Evaluative Forest Research (ERF).  But while the infrastructure for a new technological singularity is there, the social and political infrastructures that support it are in a constant state of evolution and reorganisation.

The need for new kinds of monitors and platforms, new kinds of data capture and transmission, new kinds of programming and data manipulation emerged. And as computing became more powerful and flexible, the need for new kinds of servers and networking became ever more pressing.Modern infrastructures can be divided into three broad categories: roads, railroads and tunnels. All three types of infrastructures converge on a hub or transport hub, or in tunnels, a city centre. They do so by running either on diesel or on electric power, and using sophisticated software to map, predict and manage traffic. But unlike other types of infrastructures, the core functions of the city centre don’t evolve; they remain static. This is true for infrastructure projects as much as for architectural interventions such as houses or parks. The city builds houses, parks and infrastructure to support a growing population, but what it doesn’t provide are businesses or consumer products</text>

The need for high-performance computing became paramount, and with it a massive push towards the use of ­— rather than on the other ––– ­hardware. So while the main thrust of the ‘episodic’ appeared to be about how to continually update and query massive databases of data, there was much more going on, that was based on the notion that there was a future beyond the present. And so the push towards ever greater computational capacity and ever greater computing power became the imperative strategy of infrastructuralism.  And so, from its earliest stages, the push towards ever greater computational capacity and ever greater computing power was driven by a logic that also purported to serve  — rather than on the other–– ­national interests. And so it proved to be disastrous for working-class communities, as well as communities of colour, as computing became ­dominant across state apparatuses and across labour forms. It</text>

But as the social networking and data infrastructures developed, so did the need for sensory networks and computational fluidity in infrastructures that monitor, control and generate – all in the name of gathering and aggregating data. And so it became increasingly important to assess how agencies, from the local to the international, deployed new technologies to capture and process this ever-shifting and unfolding of data. The proliferation of social media and data capture eventually rendered existing infrastructures infrastructural; as a result, they could no longer be counted on to live up to their potential. And so it happened that, as a result of all these developments, we entered the age of the cybernetically augmented landscape (AEG). This is not to downplay the significance of the rise of the internet and social media; as Nicholas Carrman well knows, the internet and social media transformed infrastructural life in many ways that were not planned or constrained in advance. But the rise of the cybernetically augmented landscape also has implications for the infrastructural landscape in many ways, for the proliferation of surveillance and data</text>

But as the social networking and data infrastructures developed, so did the need for sensory networks and computational fluidity in infrastructures that monitor, control and fabricate – all the hallmarks of post-Neoliberalism. And as a consequence, the infrastructures that emerged after ‘the explosion of data and images’ (Bernard Lietaer, Tinguely Paradox, p.21) had a critical eye on the world around them, especially in the context of a globally connected and increasingly imagined nation-state. As computer networks, sensors and data-processing devices became more advanced, the need for actors such as farmers to design, engineer and manage infrastructures to monitor, control and fabricate images increased.  So while the human factor has certainly become more pervasive in today’s society, its infrastructural components – networks, software and data – remain of paramount importance in our (northern) urban infrastructures.  Infrastructures are the new networks, and networks are the new cars. But what if infrastructures can be designed</text>

But as the social networking and data infrastructures developed, so did the need for sensory networks and computational fluidity in infrastructures that could cope with the ever-greater volumes of data that were being thrown at them.  And as a result, the infrastructures that were once confined to a given city or region today crowded the social, visual and cultural horizons of cities across the globe, while those that were once confined to a particular region, such as the US, began to flex their muscles, taking over whole cities or chunks of them. In these mega-regions, infrastructures converged in the form of cities that, although they may have been invented for a globalised capitalist economy, are now also expected to cater to a globalised metropolis. And this combination of fast-changing global markets, new media and innovative infrastructures was the new normal, the stuff of everyday life.Everyday Life in Global Temporality 	The notion of the city entered the discourse of urbanisation in the 1990s, partly through the influence of the financial crisis of 2008 that</text>

But as the social networking and data infrastructures developed, so did the need for sensory networks and computational fluidity in infrastructural links. It became increasingly important to link infrastructures to a larger social purpose or aesthetic value, since, as the biennale entered its twenty-first century, it was becoming increasingly evident that the biennale was no longer the locus of major cultural impact; cultural capital was crucial.  Thus, the biennale became entangled, at best, in a symbolic relationship to the art world and at worst, a mechanism for generating cultural capital for the biennale itself.  And this is what we can see happening at the Biennale, where the biennale is often cited as a positive force in shaping local and global art and design. But, at the same time, the biennale is being drawn into a legal and ecological war on nature. The anthropocene is being defined in relation to a planned urbanisation programme, initiated and led by a governmental commission, funded by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and run by a private firm, led</text>

But as the social networking and data infrastructures developed, so did the need for sensory networks and computational fluidity in infrastructures that could support a multiplicity of new experiences. New media such as YouTube and Facebook brought differentiating experiences to users, including the ability to ‘lock’ or ‘unlock’ content, change certain settings, and more.  And as computing became more capable, so did the possibilities for surveillance expand.  As former US National Security Agency analyst and whistleblower Thomas Drake explained, monitoring ‘opens up all manner of things you could say is illegal’.  And as more and more people around the globe accessed content, the threat of surveillance became ever greater. Drake was one of the heroes of the Global Network Initiative (2001-2006), a global network of computer servers designed to intercept and manipulate electronic communications around the world.  And while it’s true that surveillance and data mining today are ways of life for many people in many places, and technologies of communication and data manipulation are more readily available than ever before, we have to ask: what does it mean</text>

But as the social networking and data infrastructures developed, so did the need for sensory networks and computational fluidity in infrastructures that could flexibly process information and react to changing conditions. This need for computational fluidity and awareness of the ever-shifting conditions of infrastructure emerged not just from the data that streamed in from the users of these infrastructures, but also from the design of these infrastructures to support the communications networks of the global network in a manner that was not restricted to a few national capitals. This fluidity and computing capability required new kinds of programming and programming interfaces. The need for programming and programming languages with this kind of syntactic complexity in the global network grew in parallel with the pace of infrastructural development, and today’s programming languages include constructs that are intended to be used across a global network (see ‘What is programming?’ on Wikipedia).  So, in the age of the Turing machine and the node and the command line, a question that seems unanswerable today is what kind of language and programming interface could conceivably support the kinds</text>

And as computing became more powerful and user-friendly, so did the need for sophisticated data capture and processing. As a consequence, monitoring, controlling and editing come to be seen as desirable infrastructural ends in themselves. So, too, can the rise of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft, in which players fight each other for control of lucrative zones, be attributed to the advent of virtual reality or its development as a separate technology.  As World of Warcraft has gained in player counts and player communities, so too has the industry ­– which is now predominantly a player in its third wave of games, mostly online games, and a few console games – though significant workarounds can be found within the industry. World of Warcraft, along with other massively multiplayer online role-playing games, is one of the most widely played games on the planet.  Another massively multiplayer</text>

And perhaps the capacity to ask for and demand explanations lies at the core of the biennale as such. Perhaps the question is where the authority lies in this relationship – where it resides in the body politic, in the courts, in the media – and perhaps the issue here is one of plenary interpretive power. I would also question the notion of the artist as a creator of the site, or rather, the notion of the artist as the ‘site’. The idea of the community as inherently creative and innovative might be appealing to a certain strand of the biennale visitor: the notion that visitors are inherently more creative than they were ten years ago. But I would question this notion. The biennale as a touring art form has always viewed the community as a finite resource, and has always viewed the urban and rural peripheries with suspicion. And so the question is where does the interpretive power reside? I think that, in many ways, the biennale has its own form of this</text>

But I also think that in a city without resources or infrastructure, cultural resources would be limited and occasionally frustrated. We can create those resources through direct collaboration and activism, but I would question whether the biennale, like other art institutions, has the cultural and organising capacity to create that kind of capacity ripple through its membership.I would also question the notion of the biennale as a permanent form. I think that we live in an era where permanent, long-term investments are being made in places such as cities, and I think that we should be able to identify those investments and say, ‘That’s me, that is how I would invest my art’s future.’ I don’t think that the biennale should be confined to being an art institution or a major art museum.

But I also think that the capacity to create that relationship between artist and community is an inherently unstable proposition. And I’m not saying that the Biennale should be immune to this instability, but I’m saying that it should be aware of the fragility of its position and the fragility of its community. I think that the Biennale as an institution needs to be sensitive to the fact that it is creating a work of art, and needs to be prepared to shift its form if the need arises.I also want to add one more thing: we need to be able to transmit this experience to other members of the project. I don’t think that the Biennale should be able to impose its will on others. That is, the Biennale shouldn’t be able to say, ‘This is the way we are going to do</text>

In the end, we, as artists, are the ones responsible for what we want and create it. And if the authorities don’t want it, we artists are free to do whatever we want with it. However, if the authorities want it, then we must demand explanations and interrogate the authorities to make sure that what we create is what we want and need in order to be able to do that.If you take the idea of the community and apply it to other communities, then perhaps the idea of the community will be more readily communicated.

Or, ‘Don’t you remember when’? And the other, more fundamental question: how to live our lives?I think that the capacity to demand explanations is a gift of the marketplace. It’s a direct quote: ‘What was promised, whether it is housing or education or healthcare or any piece of infrastructure, is a gift of the market.’ And I think that perhaps the capacity to ask for explanations is a gift of the market because it allows us to be flexible, to change our minds, to grow old with the changes we enact, and to change our circumstances, and this is something that the market cannot and will not do.

I would argue, however, that the biennale has become something that is opposed to life in the city, and has become a kind of a fetish, a ritual, that catalyses a particular kind of localisedness, of cities being recognised as sources of aesthetic meaning and cultural capital. I would argue that the biennale, like the big art fair, is a kind of a ‘metainterface’ that is poorly understood and cannot be understood by the local population. It’s a metainterface that is glacially uninteresting, that introduces no art from the city, that exploits and wages local labour, but that creates and depends on systems that are deeply embedded in the city.

But if the community is to be trusted with the responsibility for an artistic project, then the community must be able to demand explanations. Otherwise, the project is not art, but rather a political statement about the limits of democratic government. As biennials become more and more institutionalised, the role of the arts is likely to grow further alienated from the political.

For example, when I came to work for the first time in Liverpool as an artist, I found myself confronted with the idea that the Biennale was only ever going to be about me. It wasn’t going to be about the many other artists that were there, or the many other communities that were there, or the many other traditions that were alive and well. It was always going to be about me. And I think that to some extent this was still true for me then, even though I came to work for the Biennale with a different set of skills and sensibilities then I had when I had started working when I was working with the Alder Hey Children.I went to the Biennale with the message: ‘I am here to stay.’ And I think that was the best way to approach it: as a temporary inhabitant, as a visitor, as an observer, as a visitor</text>

I remember, years ago (around 1998), when I organised a workshop with Sello Peso in my home neighbourhood, and some friends, and they were shocked by how isolated the area was. They thought: ‘That is not possible. We lived in our studio, we had a place to live and play football in the street, and there was no public transport or internet. We were the only people there.’ It was as if the community had been deprived of any form of infrastructure or public participation. The participation of the community in the design of the Biennale was virtually non-existent. It was a total surprise to me, since I intended to be involved in the community-designed project that was going on at the time. I had planned to be an arts administrator in the city, but since I was a administrator, I found it difficult</text>

And part of what we mean by the term ‘housing’ is not just about access to housing, but about a politics of housing, not just about access to resources.  So, for example, the politics of access to housing for migrants and refugees might be different from the politics of access to resources, and we might mean that the politics of access to housing might be different from the politics of access to resources. And one could argue that the politics of access to resources is one where the production of resources is actively prevented from taking place (although I don’t agree with that).  So, for example, the politics of access to immigration might be one where the production of resources is actively encouraged but prevented from taking place (although I do agree with that).

    <text>might not be curated anymore – it’s become commercial art – but it turns out that there are still people like me who have the raw material in our heads that we can use to make things, in the form of art. And we can use it to make things in our houses, or in places like the Chelsea Artspace or the Community Land Trust, or in places like the Longman Artspace or the Community Land Trust apartments, or in places like the Community Land Trust bakery, or the Community Land Trust gallery, or the Community Land Trust workshop, or the Community Land Trust school, or the Community Land Trust home-making process, or the work done by artists, or the work done by the community itself, or in the form of community land trusts or housing co-ops, or the work done by artists, or the work done by the local authority, or the work done by the non-profit arts organisation or the local authority. And part of the work done by those organisations is about making things in the here and now, and that’s part of what we do.And part of the work done by those organisations is also about making things in the here and now, and that’s part of what we do.But we don’t do it for the money – we do it because we believe that the here and now is a space where we can make a difference, and we believe that what we do in this city represents a potential future for this city. We don’t do it because we think our art will change the world; our art is here to stay. We do it because we believe that making things here represents a future for this city. And we believe that making things now represents a future for this city. That’s what we did as a pedagogical approach to our art in the city, and that was part of the logic of our curriculum. We didn’t do it because we thought we would magically come</text>

And part of the work done by those organisations is about making housing more accessible, making it convenient, or at least making it easier for people to find and use the things that make their lives possible. The question then becomes how to utilise the materials that we find in our houses, or in places like the Chelsea Artspace, or in the community land trusts, or in the form of Community Land Trusts, or in the form of Community Banks, or in the form of Community Housing Associations, or in the form of Community Action Centres, or in the form of Community Action Agencies, or in the form of Community Action Committees, or in the form of Community Boards, or in the form of Community Maps, or in the form of Community Boards, to envision and implement solutions to problems that aren’t necessarily about us. And part of the answer has to do with what we might call the ‘culture of vulnerability’ that’s woven into the structure of the housing market renewal programme. The notion of ownership has</text>

And part of the work done by those organisations is about making life in our neighbourhoods better, making our city a place where people can come and live and work freely, making our city a place where people can come and work, make our city a place where people can come and play, come and play football in the park, join in with community gardens or take part in community events, come to sporting events, dance in the park or dance at the bakery, or walk to the river, or just to be around other people.And part of that is about making culture bigger, making the city a cultural centre, making it a place where people come for a while, making it a place where art, art’s place, can happen. And part of that is about making sure that when we do those things, that there are resources there to support artists and arts organisations to do their thing, because there can be challenges. And part of it is about making sure that resources are available to enable communities to do their bit in supporting their arts institutions.</text>

And part of the work done by those organisations is about making the world a better place, and making the world a more just world. And part of the mission of the arts organisation is to make the world a more just world, and part of the mission of the local community is to make the world a more just world.  So part of what we do at the level of the biennial is to try to imagine a less perfect world, and part of what we do at the level of the village is about transforming that imperfect world into a better one.  And part of what we do at the level of the biennial is about making the world a little bit better.  So when we talk about the politics of biennials, we really mean making the world a little bit better, politically. Making the world a little bit better for everyone.  This is what biennials are for.  Making the world a little bit better for everyone.  And if we’re honest, part of the work</text>

And part of the work done by those organisations is about making the world a pleasant place for people to live in, whether that’s through making housing more affordable or making it easier for people to come to work or play football in, for example. So I think that part of the work that the arts organisations do, and the legacy organisations do, is about making the world a lovely place for people to live in.  	So, part of what the Chelsea Biennial is doing is mapping those neighbourhoods, making connections between neighbourhoods, and encouraging those connections to become paths that others can take. I think that part of it is also about interpretation, about poetry in action, the unexpected and the poetic in language. I think that part of it is also about participation and that part of it is also about interpretation – in that order. We started doing readings from the poetry of the area, from the TWS and Nuyumbalees languages, from the MMM, from the Mandarin region, from the Andean languages, from indigenous</text>

And part of the work done by those organisations is about making things in the community; making things accessible, or in the case of libraries, making them understood as being accessible. And part of the reason that libraries are able to do that is that they’re seen as a community asset. They’re seen as a collective resource that should be utilised, and their continued existence indicates that to a certain degree.  And part of the reason that non-fiction is able to do that is that it’s seen as having value beyond its factual content, beyond its objects. Fiction has an inherently subjective element to it; it has no fixed audience; it has no fixed place of expression. But fiction nevertheless has an audience, and that audience is identifiable by its ‘trending topics’, which is a small but measurable subset of its total audience. The non-fiction category has a particular audience, and that audience is identifiable by its long, quantifiable following of events and figures, which also includes readers who come to the</text>

And part of the work done by those organisations is about making lives better, about making communities better, and about making the world a better place, in the sense that more and more of what we do is about making lives better.  	But there are also huge differences between communities who are part of a organisation like Chronotrauma or Transworld New Media or Future City or Creative Time, which are very much about the development of arts-supported learning environments, and those who are not. For example, the former generation of Community Land Trust workers are much more likely to be involved in their community’s culture and arts provision, while the younger generation of artists is much more likely to be involved in their community’s arts institutions. Creative Time also provides funding for arts activities, which artists need to carry out their art-related projects, whereas Community Land Trusts and non-profits do not. Arts funding goes hand in hand with a host of other needs, including funding for art and culture</text>

And part of the work done by those organisations is about making the city a place where people can come and live together, rather than in making the city a place where only a few people – the 1%, or a small minority, really live.  	But it doesn’t end there. It’s not just about making the city a place where people can come and live together; there are ways of bringing people together through what Annabel Lee does with the magic of collaborative learning. There were some very moving and powerful moments during the conference, and I’m going to have to re-learn everything I had learned, because I’m afraid that if I do that, I’ll miss the forest for the trees. But I can say that now that I’ve experienced what the city has to offer, and I’m very much into learning how to use it, because there’s a difference between an understanding of one another’s space and the other person having</text>

And part of the work done by those organisations is about making the city a place where people can come, exchange, connect, exchange, and so on. And part of what we do with the material that we have in our heads is making it possible for that to happen. In other words, the art produced by the city is part of its political-material production.If that’s not a dialectical relationship, I don’t know what is. But it’s a dialectical relationship between a city and an art institution, and I think that’s what we strive for. The beautiful thing is that sometimes the two can come together, and the unexpected can happen. And that’s what we do: to some extent, it’s the work of the artist, but it’s also a by-product of the city being built by people, with or without a particular intention.And I think that part of what makes it so beautiful is that there is a capacity to surprise ourselves and others,</text>

The biennale as a global art form would be tested in a multitude of ways, and a place of engagement with art as a global phenomenon would be developed. The biennale would have to find a way to connect with the people and places where art is made, where it is being made in real life and in the imagined future, and to make that happen in a way that is both authentic to the place and authentic to the art. The biennale as a global art form would have to find a way to sustain itself in the face of ever more intensive globalisation. Art as a commodity, and therefore all art forms in that process of making would be commodities, would become ever more real. 	The biennale would also have to find a way to connect with those</text>

Finally, the collection, which already includes maps, annotated copies of books and magazines, and the archives of every art form from pre-digital to social media to fairly flexibly stores and distributes – whether through the new urban development policies of the biennale itself, or the curatorial gusto of a museum search – would become an ever-present and ever-present narrative, a dynamic mixture of past, present and future that is both ever-present and ever-shifting.

The biennale as a curatorial tool would be exposed its limits, as well. The art fair and the biennale would have to find new curatorial ways to meet the needs of different kinds of people in different places and at different times. This is the only way the biennale as an art form could possibly expand and innovate, since the only way to ever achieve this kind of depth and breadth is for the art to be sold in galleries and museums. The biennale as a curatorial event would have to find new curatorial ways to meet the needs of a diverse range of people in different places and at different times. It would have to learn to negotiate different kinds of art forms, and it would have to grow in order to accommodate all these different kinds of art. 	This kind of intelligent urban growth is happening all around us. It’s called ‘hyper-localism’ and it</text>

The biennale as a global cultural phenomenon would be tested in similar ways to the structure of globalised capitalist economies: it would gain acceptance from those who perceive it as an art form being rendered increasingly obsolete by the ever-expanding and ever-flexible image-processing and graphics-systems manufacturing industry it is part of. 	Such is the  	implication of the biennale as such: it denotes a shift in how we think about, perceive and act in relation to art forms, globalised globalised narratives and their images; and how we create narratives around those images. It is a shift in the qualities that make art meaningful, and a narrative that seeks to map images onto worlds, coming to understandings of what it means to be ‘British’. It is a narrative that speaks of vulnerability, loss and despair. It is</text>

It would be part of a new economic capitalism that would see art form, and artists in particular, become commodities on a global marketplace. 	The biennale would become what it calls ‘a place of convergence, a meeting place, a marketplace and a marketplace of ideas’. 	It would be a place to be ‘found’, ‘found footage’, ‘found footage images’ and ‘found footage podcasting’. It would be a place to be found in the ever-expanding index of art-related services provided by the biennale itself, and offered by the numerous related trade and service organisations.

When the Biennale was first proposed, it seemed a good bet that the Tate Modern or Tate Britain would be two of the main exhibition venues. 	However, over time it has become increasingly evident that these venues are only ever temporary; that the demand for art is such that these institutions simply can't absorb anymore; that other kinds of art are more fulfilling; that the biennale is only ever an option for a lucky few. 	Art’s primary role in this country is to serve as a barometer of trends and developments in an evolving and fluid world. Its real power, when used effectively, is as a sedative. The Biennale in that sense needs to be strategically placed and managed precisely. Otherwise, it undermines the very notion of the biennale as a place where art can take root and prosper. And that’s what the Biennale is trying to do right now: to establish permanent locations</text>

Large-scale, public performing arts would be bred out of public galleries, especially in developing nations where the biennale is not a major tourist draw. A new form of art circulation would take hold, drawing artists into ever more inflated and opaque representations of themselves, often through their participation in poorly conceived but ever-expanding citizen science projects. 	Cultural anthropology would become ever more prominent within the biennale, and citizen science projects would play a much more prominent role. The biennale itself would see its role expanded and its budget shifted towards projects outside the Biennale, such as the citizen science programmes run by the museum itself. 	Artists would seek artists with complementary pedagogic contexts who could bring their projects together in a way that is authentic to the city in which they are operating. Many artists were already producing work in their cities, and many more were adding to their portfolio of work outside of urban settings. The bienn</text>

Local communities would be drawn into a political-cultural-economic juggernaut that would alter the biennale in dangerous ways, just as the museum is doing today. The question, then, becomes what kind of engagement could the biennale bring to bear on the contemporary artworld? The answer, it seems to me, is between the reader and the exhibited work. The engagement required for a truly innovative and transformatory engagement between reader and art is engagement that is neither new nor unique. 	I would argue that we are so busy trying to figure out what the art world can be that we are ignoring some of the most vital work being done by artists all around the world. We are creating very different kinds of engagement environments for readers and art professionals alike. I’m thinking of the work happening on the ground in Bangladesh right now, where a small but vocal group of artists are demanding that Bangladesh’s first Art Commission be held in the country.</text>

The biennale would have to find new ways to engage with its subject matter in order to remain relevant and innovative. 	The biennale thus has two forms: it can be a ‘main’ or ‘mainland’ exhibition, and it can either be a ‘show’ or ‘museum’ exhibition.1 The main form, in most cities, takes the form of a biennial, or more precisely, a cycle. Biennials tend to be about a specific problem area, and cities play a big part in this. In Venice, for instance, the main issue that crops up during the exhibition is ‘environmental problems, such as deforestation’, but the actual focus of the exhibition is ‘the crisis of our time’, with projects ranging from ‘native’ forests to the urbanization of ever larger metropolises.

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and culture.At the same time, the biennale was being used as a media platform to target an individualised agenda. As a biennale, it was being used in a very different sense. The biennale was actively seeking out ways to become involved in the development of the city through its cultural resources. One of the ways it was doing this was through the creation of cultural action groups, which were, in turn, developing cultural resources themselves. These cultural action groups sought to map the history of the biennale in the city, drawing on the resources of the past while mapping the future. The result was that the biennale was able to create multiple parallel narratives around its past, present and future through the same art, often through the same artists, in an attempt to make the two sets of stories connect.The discovery of art’s historical place-making potential in the city was a catalyst for much of what the biennale was doing in the city at the</text>

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and culture.The Biennale was a unique opportunity for the city to become a catalyst for the development of new ideas and practices, new modes of cultural organisation. The biennale was a catalyst not only for the development of its own cultural values, but also for the emergence of new ways of viewing the world. It brought artistic, curatorial and educational resources to bear on socio-political and material aspects of the urban crisis (in fact, it was the catalyst for a certain amount of social and political change). I was privileged to participate in the biennale as an artist, educator and curatorial prodigy, and to witness the first Venice Biennale in its many forms.I taught the first Venice Biennale as an adjunct to my administrative duties as an arts administrator at the Giennale.

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and culture. This was a very exciting development for the biennale as a whole, for it was becoming more and more evident that the biennale was a public space event, rather than an exhibitionary institution. It was becoming increasingly evident that the biennale was a space for contemplation rather than a place for intervention. For many visitors to the biennale, the event was a catalyst to action, and in a sense, a necessary but unintended by-product of the city’s cultural malaise. This is a situation that can no longer be allowed to exist in Venice. The biennale must be an object of observation and a continuously unfolding display of art, and it’s only ever going to be an exhibitionary institution in its own right, exhibiting the finest works from every possible angle. The city’s cultural capital must be actively engaged in nurturing the biennale, and in that sense, the city has an obligation to make it a global phenomenon</text>

In 2015, the Biennale was one of the curators for the Venice Architecture Biennale. In this capacity, he was able to witness the history of the Biennale in its early years and to participate in its current form: curatorial innovation, a century-old art-historical event, curatorial triumphs and, of course, the maintenance of its cultural identity. In 2017, he was a part of Curacao’s curatorial team, a role that involved curating the entirety of the Venice Biennale, including its architecture and urbanisation. The Biennale’s current form reflects this active, transformative relationship: a cultural event that, through its multiple forms, continually strives to engage and influence the cultural landscape in the city and beyond. </text>

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and culture. The ‘biennalee d'art’, as it came to be known, was a powerful tool for the sharing and interchangeability of experiences, ideas, and knowledge. It offered both a personal and professional return on investment. In return, the biennalee received an investment of sorts: the art was worth a lot of money, and the biennalee itself was worth a lot of money. As biennales get bigger and more institutionalised, and as the biennalee itself becomes more commercial, the value of the art tends to diminish. The art industry at large seems to have a concept of art as a fixed quantity that can only ever be bought and paid for. There is a limit to how much art can absorb into a commodity commodity, and the biennalee ensured that its own finite quantity was realised. The limit, of course, is the art itself, which has a much bigger cultural impact. The art market in its</text>

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and culture.This ‘big picture’ was strategically deployed in order to dismantle the biennale as an entity: it was actively encouraged, and its artists, curators and staff were given generous wages and allowed to roam the city. The biennale was reconceived as a ‘city in its own right’, fully imbued with the culture of the city, with a fully-fledged ‘public realm’. The biennale was structured as a ‘public society’, and its staff were encouraged to engage with the urban environment and participate in the creation of ‘public spaces’. The biennale itself was given a nationalistic spin, heralding the city’s cultural heritage and the city’s economic potential. In a city with a biennale every two years, and a major art biennale every two years thereafter, this was a rare opportunity to be deeply embedded in the temporal horizon of art. In these</text>

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and present. The ideology of ‘collectivism’ was actively challenged by the active participation of visitors, who demanded a clear picture of the city’s rich history. The biennale’s capacity to generate memories was a powerful tool during this period, helping to shape ideology and ideals. In many ways, the biennale was an ideal forum for the formulation of ideas and ideals, as well as for the formation of identities. It enabled a range of discourse options, including those offered by a biennale, but also those of a ‘different kind’. In a 2009 survey of the biennale’s output, Deborah Levy, the curator of the exhibition at Tate Britain, comments: ‘At Tate, we saw that the biennale has a habit of producing in us themes that we later repeat – even if we don’t know what those themes are.’[7]As an example, Levy cites the 1993 Venice Bi</text>

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and culture. This perception was facilitated by the architecture exhibition, which reintroduced the biennale to life through the use of artefacts and the contemporaneous development of architecture in Venice. In a way, the biennale was partially to blame for the sudden proliferation of museum-quality modern art fairs around the world in many cities in the first half of the twentieth century. These were created to fill a gap in a city’s cultural landscape, a gap created by the economic quagmire that followed the quinquennial. These were not art fairs in the traditional sense of the word – they were not places for the art of a particular city to be displayed – but they were places where contemporary art would do well to be found. An ideal place for contemporary art to be found, I would guess, is in a biennale that actively engages with the contemporary condition, rather than passively looks on.

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and present. This was an enormous change from the biennale’s usual policy of exclusion and reduction, which tends to self-destruct under its own weight. The new biennale needed to actively engage with its past, rather than passively absorb it. The biennale also needed to actively organize itself, creating a kind of parallel universe around itself, so that its own temporality was challenged. In the biennale, the place to do this is often at the expense of the art’s highest aesthetic objectives. When the biennale is an art institution, as it is in Venice, it engages with the law of attraction as it pertains to contemporary art forms, and it also needs to be aware that its own aesthetics are products of contemporary environments, and not necessarily the gifts or the effects of such environments. The biennale is conscious of its own aesthetic quixotics, and it’s also conscious of the fact that its patrons are artists. In other</text>

For many visitors to the biennale, the memory of its origins was actively curated, creating a ‘big picture’ that reflected the city’s unique combination of history and modernity. This was a radical concept for a city to adopt, and it still is today. The biennale was a kind of inverted pyramid: it reflected the city’s history in a multitude of images, but it was also a monument to a particular, albeit inverted, history. It reflected the biennial in a number of other ways, but it was most visible in its ‘19th Biennale of Art and Design’, which reflected the city through art and architecture made in collaboration with architects and production companies, as well as showcasing the city as a possible site for future future future art institutions. In these and other images, the city was used as a source of ideas, images, or ‘representations’ that could be assembled to make larger ideas or ‘ideas aggregates’ that combined many different ideas.

The capture of over 1,000 university buildings and the forced evictions of over 1,000 neighbourhoods are all part of a larger historical narrative of state repression and urban destruction. The parallel history of urban and defence policy in the UK and abroad is also part of the exhibition’s theme.  Art and the clock  A Clockwork Orange was a response to the violent resistance to change created by the established order of British capitalism. The painting – and its depiction – is a metaphor for the uprising of artistic creativity. Its timing – the day after the Liverpool Biennial announced that it was withdrawing from the city due to a lack of funding – coincides with the second-quarter of 1971, the day after the first-ever Community Arts conference in Liverpool. The juxtaposition of the coercive appropriation of artistic resources with the creative destruction of state authority is part of the larger theme of ‘radical culture’.

The capture of over 1,000 university buildings and the forced evictions of over 1,000 neighbourhoods are all part of a broader ‘Plan for Terror’ that was formulated in the wake of the uprising. The ‘New Labour’ economic blueprint of 1980 is premised on the co-option of social unrest by way of the ‘Recreation and Consumption’ mode of capitalism. The aim of this mode of consumption is to a large extent determined by the state of social unrest that flare up periodically throughout the world.  Art and the clock  A Clockwork Orange was initially commissioned by the National Gallery and Tate Modern galleries in 1988, and a small team of artists were selected from these galleries to commission a series of paintings that are often collectively referred to as the ‘Trots’ – a term that evokes a collective sense of achievement and triumphalism amongst art professionals at the height of the Cold War.  The paintings were largely commissioned by people named Max Ernst, Max Headroom, Gerald Howarth, Peter Carruthers and Tom Lox. The fact that these artists were</text>

The capture of over 1,000 university buildings and the forced evictions of over 1,000 neighbourhoods are all part of a plan to repurpose urban space and rubble around the country for military use. In Liverpool, the city’s financial district, the mural movement that began in the mid-1960s is being re-imagined by a city government that wants to turn the city into a large industrial port with a ‘high density of port facilities’. The city’s financial planners have privatised all aspects of the city, from the roads to the maritime blockade, and now seek to create a new ‘high-performance’ zone around the artwork by Björkman and other artworks in the city.  The city expresses its shock and anger at the crimes of the state in the wake of the uprising, but it fails to react decisively or even to any extent with the authorities. Instead, it builds new laws and regulations that criminalise the political expression of anger or dissent in any way it sees fit, and punishes any citizen who participates in the uprising with heavy</text>

The logic of the timed projects was put into the packaging of essential oils, fragrances, toilet tissues, toilet paper, shampoo, toilet paper substitutes, toothpaste, deodorants, toilet paper and hair conditioners. Film stills, still photography and drawings were used to document the uprising as graphic novel illustrations.  A Clockwork Orange was first published in 1974 and remains one of the most widely read and re-published novels of the post-Second World War era.  A Clockwork Orange was written by Ted Chiang and illustrated by Bill Finger and Frank Chiang. It was a novel in the vein of Frank Herbert’s Dune and Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island. Like many other authors at this time, Chiang was a writer of science fiction and dystopian science fiction. A Clockwork Orange looks to the future where social and political turmoil reigns.

The historical context of the Liverpool Biennial is characterised by a large-scale military response that is characterised by economic contraction and social destabilisation. The event that year – and that continues to this day – is considered by many critics to have ended the once-powerful ability of the state to repress political opposition. In the early 1970s and early 1980s, the biennial experienced a succession of curatorial interventions that sought to reinvent the biennial in terms of a major international exposition. These initiatives included (but are by no means limited to) the production of a 'black bag' of curiosities for the occasion, the staging of a series of ‘discounted’ shows, the erection of a ‘red and white striped pavilion’ and the ‘assembly of publics – citizens to be evacuated at gunpoint’, ‘a public whose rights have been circumscribed by law’,</text>

The capture of over 1,000 university buildings and the forced evictions of over 1,000 neighbourhoods are all part of a government ‘war on terror’. The use of violence – whether state terrorism, corporate terrorism or social engineering – is used to subvert and subvert social movements in many cases, and the emergence of resistance is promoted through a process of accrual theory – the application of existing social norms and values to accommodate and facilitate transformation.

Most of these exist in the context of the global capitalist system – World War Z (2008), Casino (1999) and Chasing Coral (2013) being notable exceptions – but they also exist in the context of smaller-scale social and community projects led by artists and activists.

In the words of the artist Frank Tanenbaum, ‘Art’ has no internal clock.’ It moves at irregular intervals, timed to the rhythms of the financial markets and industrial processes, and to a constant stream of human activities – the economy, empire, culture, urbanisation, sexualisation – though it does seem that the human clock does comprise an underlying mathematical equation governing the timing of large movements of matter and energy.  Art and the clock  A Clockwork Orange (1971), painted in broad daylight in broad daylight in Liverpool, depicts the uprising of 6 April 1970. The movement of 6 April that year was part of a wider general strike, but is characterised by a series of strategic moves by the security services backed up by military tanks and aircraft. The capture of over 1,000 university buildings and the forced evictions of over 1,000 neighbourhoods are all part of a government conspiracy to shut down all opposition to military and economic engineering projects. The city was cordoned off and ‘lock-picked’ neighbourhoods were set aside as ‘war zones’ – a policy of racialised demolition being actively promoted as part of a socialist ‘buildings for the future’ initiative through a ‘shared responsibility’ framework. The term ‘Clock Tower’ is used four times in the text, twice in relation to the role of the artist and once as an object of art. Clock Tower is a design object in its own right – a living and evolving monument to the financial, social and political subjugation of the urban – though its precise function in the larger urban context is questionable. A Clockwork Orange is a critique of post-WWII economic and social reorganisation in the city that emerged out of the black and transnational logic of the capitalist city. It was written by Malcolm Muggerud, who directed the photography of the Liverpool</text>

The problem with the huge number of screens now percolating around us in ever more concentrated form is that, far from rendering the manifold components of our urban situation somehow comprehensible, the new media render it all as something like a disjointed jigsaw puzzle:

The fragmented parts are dangerous. We need joint action to address the underlying causes, starting from the fundamental underlying causes that generate the instability.

It is an independent non-profit organisation created in 1996. Its mandate is to investigate and resolve issues relating to the effects of screen-based media on urban structures and communities. It is part of the wider West Midlands Arts Council portfolio. It’s contribution to this enquiry is funded by Arts Council funding and the Arts Council Enterprise Grant.  The project was established in 1996 and received funding from Arts Council in 2002. The original vision for the project was to examine the effects of screen-based media on the environment and communities, with a particular focus on the Midlands. However, in the intervening years the Arts Council has picked up the tab for critical research and development, while the company that makes adware has shifted production to other parts of the UK and overseas, and the story has shifted again.  The project has shifted from investigating the causes of city decline to looking for new ways to profit from it. It has also shifted from looking for new ways to support artists to paying artists to develop arts projects that are a way for the</text>

It is an independent non-profit organisation created in 1994. It is politically neutral. It is not in the hands of one political party, however, and enjoys broad public support. It is a 'laboratory of democracy' with a mission to investigate and resolve 'questions of civic responsibility' through research, education and debate. It is a good lab for critical inquiry, and a place where activists can come to work, meet and play. But it is also a nest of power brokers and a haven for those who would use public resources for their interests, at a moment and in a place where public services and infrastructure are routinely undermined and privatised. In this political environment of constant redefinition and political agency, the lab seems an ideal place for a project such as this one to operate in. It is responsive to the needs and interests of stakeholders, has a clear mission statement and is able to deliver tangible benefits to communities through research, education and debate.

Who knows? Maybe, just maybe, the ghosts of those lost urban places can be found and worked again. That is, the ghosts of the lost jobs and housing can be brought back to life by way of new urban development, and that is one of the ways in which arts-funded projects can recommit their efforts. Not all arts projects are created equal. Some are more likely to return than others. But given the right mix of conditions and types of practitioners, organisations can and do work miracles. In many ways, then, the current biennale is a perfect match for the needs of the rapidly urbanising society. It is a rarefaction of art processes, producing works that are both recognisable and mysterious, that is not vulnerable to the whims of economic forces, and that is equally likely to produce works that are</text>

It is a hybrid instrument: it can support research into underlying causes or work independently in its own right. It can either assist in identifying and addressing issues or propose solutions. So, the question becomes, which of these two approaches does it prefer?  The fact that the project is a joint venture between two local authorities seems commonplace, but the choice to make it a joint venture is unusual. If you are wondering why West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service is the primary user of West Midlands Transit, then you’re not alone.

West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service (West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service): What is the role of an arts organisation in countering the destructive power of greed and the elitist culture of globalisation? In my view, the answer is complex. There are many ways of engaging with this question, but I prefer to think of it as this: what are the ways in which an arts organisation can contribute to the fight against global poverty? I.e. can it supply resources or organise for an event? If it can, then it has a unique negotiating position; otherwise it is subject to the whims of the biennale industry. For this reason, I believe that West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service has a unique negotiating position against industry, and so should every organisation that is engaged with challenging globalisation.

Art’s relationship to its geographical location would be redefined through this new institutionalised form.Art’s globalised condition would make its presence felt in new ways, as the biennale sought to establish permanent exhibition venues in key locations around the world. The Biennale was a global phenomenon with significant participation from local producers and art collectors. It attracted artists from all over the world, and the biennale’s sales and marketing campaigns were global in scope. It was also an art institution with an important curatorial role. In these early years, the biennale was reluctant to engage with the local, opting for self-reflection and avoiding direct communication with the places where its productions took place. This was partly due to its size and corporate nature, but also due to the fact that this was considered an area where art was more naturally embedded. As a result, the biennale tended to avoid overt displays of its</text>

The name ‘Biennale’ would be dropped, replaced with an acronym.  So, the Biennale would reincorporate, and the exhibitionary form would be reintroduced in a major way. This is what biennials do: they reintroduce the form, making it more present and present, more present in the cultural landscape. Biennials are cultural ambassadors, and their position is that of a regular cultural host, offering the ongoing exchange of different kinds of cultural products, ideas and services between different cultures. The question is, what does this mean in and through the present?  In this film, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, the main character, Mitchell, travels to Liverpool to meet with the artist Jane Hewitt, who is developing a new art-performance format for the Biennale.

The films ‘mechanism’ and ‘futurist practices’ would continue to be taken into consideration, while the biennale itself would continue to be a ‘futurist writing system’, a blog combining the best aspects of several blogging platforms.[9] The idea of the biennale as a biennial seemed particularly pernicious in the city, where the biennale was regarded as a generic tourist trap. The main obstacle to this notion was the involvement of artists, and especially the involvement of artists from outside the city, who were often dismissed as not being ‘real’ artists. The reluctance of local artists to participate in this writing was often based on perfunctory or reflexive participation. The mediators of the art-fest syndrome, however, often engineered an experience that was in part designed to placate artists who might otherwise engage in ‘alternative’ or ‘fine art’.</text>

The process would see regional infrastructures transformed through the use of new park-and-pond structures and the management of the sites' natural resources through a park-and-pond network. These resources would be used for a number of purposes, including the construction of a cultural district in the city, the conservation of marine and bird species, and the provision of alternative and affordable housing for todays and future generations. The park-and-pond structures would sit on top of one another, and links to other sites in the city could be built between them. This would create a ‘digital triple helix’: the structure of the biennale, its resources and its management. The idea of the ‘biennale’ has become increasingly important for the city, and the Biennale is no exception. As the most prestigious international</text>

In this model, the biennale would have continued to be an institution that produced objects, but now it would be a form of cultural organisation that produced people.[9]The idea that the biennale could become a cultural institution could create new possibilities for the biennial in several ways. First, the biennale could cease to be, and become what it has always been: a multi-year, multi-edition, multi-edition-type mega-exhibition. Second, the biennale could assume a permanent, critical, even critical-role in the city, and produce works that comment on, or at least address the themes of, the city. Third, the biennale could provide the local organising principle for a multi-year, multi-edition-type mega-exhibition, and</text>

For example, the film shows the curators at the 2012 Venice Biennale, who selected the site for a large aerial painting.[8] In the event that the Biennale is again in Liverpool, the Biennale would create a new curatorial framework. It would be the first time that such a curatorial framework had been attempted in Europe, and the first time that such a framework had been devised in North America. This curatorial framework would be based around a regional theme park, a city as its geographical centre. The idea of the ‘biennale’ would be reassessed periodically through a series of park-and-pond structures, each with a theme. The structure that would house this new ‘curatorial framework’ would be reinstitutionalised in the city, and the people who inhabit it would once again be the stars of the show.The biennale itself would be re-constituted through a parallel structure – the Biennale Project – which would catalogue the works in the park that were to be showcased. The project would be run by the Liverpool Biennial and the British Museum, as independent curators, and it would feature artists from all over the world. The director of the Biennale, Maria Lind, would become a director of the Biennale Project, and the two would work collaboratively and side by side to create a network of works that explore the geographical locations of the upcoming year.[9] Berlin Biennale 2008 – presentCities in Crisis: Global CatastrophesUnderwater Spaces, 2010.

The concept of the ‘biennale’ would be reintroduced in Britain, and internationally, in the form of the transatlantic inter-annual ‘Venice Biennale’.[9] The film Avatar opens with a close-up of the 2015 U.S. Pavilion, where the character Anakin Skywalker lives in a futuristic galaxy. The film depicts a future where advanced artificial intelligence (AI) is applied to recreate the ancient world, and the role played by religion in this process is explored. The life-size bronze statue of St George, the patron saint of engineers and AI, stands accused by a local populace of being a satanic statue. The film ends with Anakin blowing up a nearby Budd-style monstrosity. The discovery of the monstrosity leads to a chain of events that leads to the destruction of</text>

The ‘biennale’ would become a global phenomenon, and the city a major international tourist attraction.The proximity of such a project to the 2016 London Olympics is a clear indication that this kind of ‘biennale’ is here to stay. In the film Groundhog Day, Harold Ramis makes the same point, as do many other artists and artists. The issue here is that it is becoming increasingly obvious that this kind of ‘biennale’ is here to stay, and that its formation is here to do with the institutionalisation of the Museum of Modern Art, and not individuals choosing to make their mark on the museum or the city. If the museum were to be abolished, or to some extent restructured (like in New York and London), this would mean reorganising</text>

These structures would be places where the various themes that would be explored could be found, and this would include works that would be of interest to visitors from every possible viewpoint. This curatorial framework would be an evolution of the Biennale’s current structure, now an international art institution. I predict that this proposal will be re-evaluated in light of the current cultural landscapes in Liverpool, and may well become something else entirely.
