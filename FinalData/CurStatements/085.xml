    biennials past and present, including the Venice Biennale, which did exactly that, and which I was in a meeting about a year later, when the L.A. Biennale director, Paolo Portoghesi, announced that the Venice Biennale was going to do the exact same thing, only in reverse. Portoghesi was arguing against the fact that the Biennale’s income came from the sale of tickets, because, even though they were selling out quickly, he said, it was still impossible to book the exact same number of seats online. So you could imagine Biennales in reverse. A bookstore in Venice, Paolo.

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale had to decide whether to become a place where you actually … buy a ticket.  I did a year-long research project on the Biennale in an attempt to understand its paradoxes and explore its thinking on the one hand, and the other. I came away from it with the impression that the Biennale was experiencing what I would call a terminal Philip Auslander moment: its time to say goodbye. It’s time to close, but it’s also time to start all over again somewhere else.  But it’s also time for a biennale to create a new kind of art world: one that is not only a temporary fix, but that is creative, dynamic and on the move.Art is the contemporary incarnation of the biennale; it is a contemporary form that can be sustained indefinitely. The biennale, like any other art form, is affected by the economic system it is a part of, but unlike most</text>

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale became a place where the Biennale could no longer book tickets. This is the paradox of the biennale: the art world wants to show its pieces, but it can’t sell them, neither in theory, nor in practice. The fact that the Biennale is moving away from its first Venice location, where the public was kept abreast of developments in the city, is a way of saying, in effect, that this is a location that we don’t want to be near. It is moving away from its initial, hasty, opportunistic introduction, when the Biennale board, led by Enzo Portoghesi, met several times a week, and invited artists from around the world to participate in what Portoghesi would later describe as a creeping ethnocentrism. It is showing its age, as a museum, as a venue, as a place of exchange and reunion. It is, I think,</text>

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale was a place where the online ticket-buying public found themselves, and Portoghesi’s fictional audience, inside the Biennale. The audience was not, as we all know, online. But it is a very interesting argument, and I agree with a lot of what he says. But I do disagree with a lot of what he says, and I will tell you why.When the Biennale first started in 1995, there were two kinds of people in Venice: those who came for the concerts, and … well, there were a lot of them. Then there were other kinds of people, like academics, journalists, artists, collectors … Everyone else was invited because they made good art, or their work was really good, or their position was interesting or … well, they were there to stay. And by the way, everyone who was invited was invited anyway. Because there was always that one person left out, or none there at all.</text>

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale was a place where the Biennale (and, by extension, Portoghesi) made a lot of money.Essentially, the paradox was that the Biennale was always trying to meet its obligations to the city, whereas the Biennale itself was always trying to meet its obligations to itself. The Biennale was always an industry-funded enterprise, whereas the Biennale is an arts organization. And so, as biennales and arts organizations have become more institutionalized and institutionalized, the act of trying to meet its obligations to the city has become less and less meaningful. And so, in a way, the Biennale is performing a double bind: On the one hand, it’s required by law to be there (because it’s a ‘legitimate public purpose’), but on the other it’s impossible to maintain its character as a unique entity with unique powers and personalities.

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale was selling out, and the city was suffering through its fifth decade of economic oblivion. So, this was the pivotal moment in the history of the Biennale, when the oblivion and the ephemerality of the artefacts, the very substance of the event, allowed the Biennale to emerge as a different kind of art event. It became a place where you could actually … buy a ticket. And so, the Biennale in that moment could only … exist in the abstract, as a different kind of art event. It could not, however, in its temporal dimension, be the exact opposite. It could not have been the day after the Biennale sold out, or on the very day it became a museum, or even on the very morning it became a concert hall. It was just that day and that event.And so, the question that came up time and again during the Biennale was how it was that the exhibition that was</text>

And now, a year later, we’re in a meeting about the future of the Biennale, and it’s September and October, and it’s a very interesting mix of people coming from every conceivable angle of being interested in the Biennale, of wanting to be involved, and of having different positions, of having never having been involved, in that order. There’s a question of who is artist and who is spectator, and whether the audience is an organic mixture of those individuals or whether it’s more like a curatorial discipline that organises and assembles individuals by subject matter, and that organises their behaviours. In a certain sense, I think that was the Biennale that Portoghesi was trying to revive. But, of course, the biennale is an art institution,</text>

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale literally sold out. I guess in the Biennale’s view, the museum is where the action is, and the Biennale is where the art is. But that is to misunderstand the relationship between the museum and the Biennale. The Biennale is a space where the Biennale is present in its historical form, but it also holds the potential to become a dramatically different kind of institution, where the Biennale can adopt a progressive or even artistic practice. As Biennale.org now stands: a portfolio of works from the museum, a public archive, a repository of past exhibitions, an online exhibition platform and an art supply store. I wonder what kind of practices the Biennale might adopt in its archive. It’s a place where the past can be encountered, but it also has the potential to become a site of the future, where the past and the spatial coincide and create a space of encounter.

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale was in a kind of crisis of identity, with performances that were almost ‘contemporary’ with the biennale itself, and exhibitions that were almost ‘contemporary’ with the biennale itself. And so the Biennale in that moment was not a site of contemporary art, but a crisis of contemporary art, a kind of a time of contemporaneity that was almost ‘contemporary’ with the biennale itself.And so the Biennale in that moment was a kind of a ‘placeholder’ that evolved into a biennale that was more about the place, and more about the city, in that crucial moment of ‘contemporaneity’. And so the Biennale in that moment was a kind of a proto-present, or proto-archive. It had the essential characteristics of a biennale, but it had another set of characteristics that made it a distinct kind</text>

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale reversed itself, and now it’s a place where you can only ever buy tickets. And so it continues to this day. I think that’s an interesting distinction. On the one hand, the Biennale is a place where you can actually buy a ticket, and on the other, it is a place where you can never buy a ticket. As a biennale, it’s selling out, and as a museum it’s holding its own. And so it does have that interesting, iconic, iconic quality that comes with the Biennale moniker.  But here’s the thing: the Biennale has a very specific mission statement. Its raison d’o did not come from the Biennale itself, but from the raison d’o of the Venice Biennale, which is supposed to be an interlocutor between history and contemporaneity.

And of course, in that moment, the Biennale was able to dispense with the need to be a museum, because it could simply be a ‘present’ that you could buy. 	So the Biennale in Venice is able to maintain its historical position in that moment in that city, whereas it would never be able to in the Biennale narrative. 	Similarly, the Biennale in Hamburg is able to maintain its historical position in Hamburg, whereas it would never be able to in the Biennale narrative. The Biennale in St. Petersburg maintains its historical position because it has to. 	And the Biennale in London maintains its historical position because it has to. 	Once you have that historical ‘position’, you can't take it away from you. 	And if you do that, you run the risk of losing some of the identity that you want to retain, as the Biennale in London did on Saturday, as some people were</text>

He concluded: ‘Simply put, infrastructure is a collection of rules, regulations and building materials – concrete, steel, asphalt, stairs, taps, pipes, foundations – that together make up what is commonly called the ‘physical infrastructure’ of the modern city.’  To understand the social functions of infrastructure, we must understand what happens when these rules, regulations and materials become misused or fail to deliver the intended benefits. Salomon Ben-Meir’s interest in the physical infrastructure of the city – the concrete, steel, asphalt, stairs and so forth that comprise the basis of infrastructure – goes back to his youth in Haifa, when his father would take him to visit ‘the gardeners’ who build and repair the city’s infrastructure, and to understand the social uses of such infrastructure would enable us to question the social functions of infrastructure and the social impacts of its misuse.

I grew up in a large, middle-class family in the United States of America. My father is an engineer and I work for a large engineering company. We drive down to work every day, and travel internationally. I worked for Shell in the early 1980s, and was working on the civil works side, which included the construction of the Dundee Refinery – which is still going strong, as is evident from the architecture review that I wrote for the Dundee Daily Times in the newspaper of the city. I wrote an article called ‘Shell Majesties Visit North Korea’, and in it, I reflected on the relationship between the two companies (at the time, North Korean and US companies).

If the social functions of infrastructure were recognised and acknowledged – understood and facilitated – then the discussion surrounding its social benefits could have been more easily negotiated. Whether we are talking about infrastructure as a physical thing or an artefact of infrastructure, the idea of social use and responsibility would have to be negotiated. This negotiation would have involved both parties, stakeholders and artists, but since this was an issue that was close to our minds, we might also have been able to identify some similarities. For example, the negotiation of social use and responsibility would have involved both public authorities and artists, but since there was a significantly different negotiation involved, the public authorities would have had an advantage. Public authorities would not have been able to dictate, whereas an artistic project can. Nevertheless, the negotiation of</text>

In other words, there is no such thing as ‘infrastructure’, only infrastructure units, and thus there is no such thing as ‘infrastructure’. Infrastructure is a concept understood in broad strokes, and so understanding the social functions of infrastructure is critical to understanding the social values of infrastructure as a shared, relational concept. The conference highlighted a number of projects that were part of this broad sweep of projects, projects that sought to make infrastructure visible in the public sphere, yet also projects that sought to imagine, design and engineer infrastructure differently. The projects highlighted included: aerodynamic origami, a new kind of architecture journal (available at aer</text>

Their projects, their politics of art, their pedagogical strategies and their arts and culture for public policies – which in the end became just as much about the social functions of infrastructure as it was about the social uses of art – provided the social underpinning for the social. 	Such is the mythologised history of the artist’s exhibition. But what is actually happening, and what can actually be demonstrated, in and across art’s social-exhibition business today? 	What is it that artists do across many forms of art-exhibitionary form? And what are the social uses of this activity today?

All of these elements of infrastructure are now considered ‘material cultural resources’ and play a critical role in the capitalist accumulation of capital.

As biennials become more and more like other elements within the city, including the local culture industry, which is often accused of being redundant and antiquated, but which is in fact an essential component of any development strategy, it is increasingly difficult to see how social transformation can occur without at the same time a healthy share of infrastructure repair. 	In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a brief moment when infrastructure was seen as a potential resource that could be utilised constructively and artistically. As biennials have become more institutionalised, more art-specific and more global in scope, the question of social transformation becomes even more critical. While it is</text>

And yet, as the biennale that is now unfolding in Venice urgently reminds us, we still have a long way to go. Responding to the urgent calls to evacuate the Venice Biennale from the narrow alleys and rooftops of the Italian district, the Italian government announced on 1 December 2012 that it was organising  	12  years of planning for a radical reconfiguration of the Italian Quarter, now part of the New York metropolitan area, in which the biennale would relocate</text>

As we learned from the conference, artist-in-residence and co-director of the Centre for Studies and Research in Art, Salomon Ben-Meir, similarly sought to engage the political, economic and urban factors that could be seen as influencing the development of the city in the period leading up to and including the 2011 Arab revolutions. He found that the institutions and ideologies that he was critical of – capitalism and state power – were fundamental in the construction of infrastructure, but that the social functions of art – providing social value, empowerment and a sense of purpose – could also be seen as constituting the basis of social power. He concluded: ‘The key to understanding how infrastructure was built is to understand the social functions of infrastructure, and how these relate to social functions such as the social.’  He also concluded: ‘The social is the site of the action, and the site of the resistance.’8 This last statement seems particularly relevant in our current period, which is characterised by the proliferation of state power and the politics of infrastructure. In recent years the biennale has been particularly prone to this proliferation. In year one and two, the museum attendance increased hugely, while in year two, the biennale experienced a major increase in value – partly because of the disruptive effect that the economic crisis had on ticket prices, partly because of the spread of tourism, and partly because of the spread of low-cost airlines. Indeed, the biennale has a particular capacity to generate tourism, since its importance as a site of cultural exchange and destination is maximised by the capacity to be present at the highest levels of the tourism industry.

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of historical recollections can disrupt the flow of time-consuming business transactions. The curatorial approach could address this by placing greater emphasis on the historical context in which the conflict took place, or by creating a ‘reactive culture space’ around the ongoing conflict through exhibits and virtual tours that react to the conflict via their temporal dynamics. This latter approach would make the art installations a mediator between the historical and the temporal, intervening between the present and past, and possibly creating new artworks through the act of curating. In an ideal world, the museum would own and operate with equal political, cultural and economic value to both the past and the future.In an ideal world, the museum would be democratic, transparent and independent, providing both the public and the directors with the tools to make innovative and interesting artworks, and enabling individuals to contribute to the museum through their work.

In Sheffield, the Biennial was one of the catalysts of the regeneration process, and the Biennial’s current role is to offer a platform for the art installation and the city’s architecture projects of the city’s future. The Biennial could also act as a locus of resistance, or at least an inspiration to activists and artists to engage with the city in a more activist way. 	The Biennial could also act as a mediator between public and private space, intervening at a political level where the public are invited to participate in building a better future but unable to take part in creating that future. This was a central tenet of the political-ideological framework around which the exhibition was structured, and which came through in the exhibition’s title. The Biennial could act as a seed, a trigger, and a promoter of change, while simultaneously remaining anchored in the present and ensuring that its own future is predetermined</text>

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of specific incidents can break through this. In Sheffield, the Biennial launched a major project ‘The Community Land Trust’ in 1998, which brought together eminent local authorities, artists, architects and others with relevant skills to create cooperative ‘managed’ areas, including the creation of new town centres. In Anfield, the Biennial followed suit in 2002, and has worked ever since with local authorities to create ‘Community Land Trusts’ in areas vacated by housing development. Local authorities are now increasingly engaged with devising ways to support such districts, which are increasingly important for the health of the local arts scene, including for artists’ employment prospects. It is worth noting that the Biennial has an annual budget of about £35 million, which is 50% of the value of the entire 2008–09 tourist traffic. Any curatorial intervention may have a significant impact on ticket sales, and the trust is faring better positioned to weather the storm of competition. 	There are many</text>

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of past traumas is often deceptively apolitical. By contrast, the curatorial approach of the Museum of Modern Art, London, which was commissioned by Liverpool Biennial in 2011, is designed to celebrate contemporary art and strives to present the art as a crisis of capitalist circulation. It is a biennale that seeks to define and represent the contemporary context in which art can operate, and it is a biennale that uses contemporary art as a political tool. The curatorial approach of the Museum of Modern Art, London, which was also part of the Curator-General’s New Media team in 2011, is different. It seeks to capture the politics of art through art that is artefactualised, representing and interpreted in ways that are consistent with the curatorial’s role as a public gallery. The Museum of Modern Art, London, as a biennale, is acutely aware that it is perpetually embedded in the social totality, which necessitates that it function</text>

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of contemporaneous political and social history has generated significant changes. It is important to note that the conflicts in these three cities were not initiated by or against the urban development policies of the city; rather, they arose from and were contributed to by the policies of European integration. As a result, the biennial may well follow the city’s political, economic and social landscape, particularly as it relates to its communities. Although it is often claimed that the biennial is the heir to traditional art collector’s curatorial practices, this is not at all at true; rather, biennials are part of a much broader curatorial practice that is more attuned to the needs and preferences of contemporary art collectors. This is particularly the case in cities such as New York and London that have been founded on cultural tourism, a type of tourism that is now deeply rooted in these cities and is an important vector for the growth of cultural tourism.New York and London are the world capitals of cultural tourism,</text>

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of histories can break through this dead end. The curator’s invitation to a curator’s reception should also be an opportunity to discuss how the art installation might connect to the needs of the city authorities and communities in Belfast and Liverpool, and how it might not. While this might seem trivial, the power of the biennial is in its participation. A curator could easily invite an artist to develop a project around the needs of the area, and the artist would likely explore this possibility. Creative activism might be developed through the idea, but the fact that the art is there in the first place is what smarts it forwards. The artwork would have a place in the public realm, and perhaps the curatorial hand can propel the project forward by introducing the artist into the equation. This is the mission of the Biennial – to provide the physical and mental tools for action, but more importantly, to create a shared understanding and context of understanding and meaning for the city and its people.

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of histories can break through some of the political and economic barriers. For example, the Biennial 2018, curated by Deborah Morgan, is bringing together the works of many artists from the decades between 2015 and 2017, and their ongoing artistic and social engagement with the current political situation in the world. The projects range from the simple, like the artists' commissioned social events for artists' communities, to the more ambitious, like the projects undertaken by the artists themselves. The venues for these art projects are diverse, but there is a common denominator: the biennial. Art and social action in the biennial form have moved from the level of individual artists to that of collective action. Although the museum and its curatorial hand may wield considerable influence, the biennial will still rely on the support of the community to carry it through, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.  	Art and social action in the biennial form will also rely on local and national art galleries triaging a growing number</text>

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of contemporaneous events is often exaggerated or reversed. The appearance of controversial cultural figures, even in self-selected or curatorial contexts, can act as a countervailing force. The appearance of auteurs in art and contemporary art’s social and political contexts is another possibility. The curatorial message can be tailored to the specific project or individual needs, interests, and priorities of the community. In a recent curatorial intervention on the streets of Liverpool, artists including Joasia Krysa and Beata Szymczyk opened up an unexpectedly positive discussion with a local community group about the impact of the Housing Market Renewal Initiative (HMRI), an urban renewal programme that was part of the government’s so-called Garden City plan. The intervention arose from a series of photographs that the two artists had taken during the 1990s, some of which the community members had submitted as a submission to the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG).

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of histories can break through this commonality. This is particularly true in smaller cities such as Liverpool, whose seafront skyline is dominated by the ETA freight terminal, which continues to threaten the city’s historic character of the water with its smoke, fumes and vibrations. In Anfield, the ETA tunnel looms large, and its demolition threatens not only the city’s character as an archaeological site, but could also contaminate the water with toxic waste. The introduction of activism and direct action through art and direct action has become an essential component of any successful strategy to tackle climate change, yet little is done with regards to the city itself. Despite the fact that Liverpool is a major hub for Asian transnational transshipment, in the years since I first taught at UCL, I have continued to receive questions from interested parties regarding the city’s future. Liverpool’s decision to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup despite global climate change accords seems particularly ironic given its own vulnerability,</text>

In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is still deeply embedded in everyday life, but the impact of the art installation and its recall of identity politics is different here. In Belfast and Liverpool, the conflict of the 1990s is often defined by the indiscriminate targeting of LGBT people by the security services, and the consequent overcrowding crisis. In The Artist’s Survival, the role of the museum was to document the experiences of the artist and to witness the events as they happened, while simultaneously enabling the person or organisation who was responsible to carry out future acts of intolerance. As the title implies, the exhibition was not about art per se, but rather about the state of oppression and violence inflicted on LGBT people during the Troubles. The conflict in the city between the museum and the museum that day certainly had a profound effect on my thinking, and it remains to this day an important theme in the museum.  So why now, with the biennial rapidly becoming one of the most significant exhibitionary forms, and the biennial on track to become a multi-billion dollar industry, in what sense are these different forms of historical</text>

I imagine the sense of ‘fear and loathing’ was palpable. It’s as though we live in a different world now, where art is often equated with protest. We live in a world where protest is normalized, and art is often demonised.I think that the reason why the Biennial has been able to shift the narrative so successfully in the last five years is due to the fact that – as far as we know – none of the artists who were part of the initial curatorial mix have done any</text>

It’s interesting that Herzliya has become something of a site for the redevelopment of Palestine/Israel, as gentrification has swept the city in recent years. The old post office there serves as a point of entry into the Palestinian territories, and the new post office there serves as a point of exit. The Palestine Solidarity Network is now based in Ramallah, and the PLN’s Twitter feed is now based in Bethlehem.The importance of this shift in the historical balance of power can’t be understated. The post-WWII order saw a proliferation of ethno-religious ideologies vying for supremacy, and the emergence of multiethnic super-states. In the current period, we’re seeing the terminal effects of a post-WWII order: warring factions vying for legitimacy in an age of facts.

It will be a rehearsal for the biennial in Rome, and it will be about the place of art and the social life of culture there. It will be very different from the rehearsals in Liverpool, and it will mean that there will be no Italian version of The Resident.DDownload this article as PDF29 November 2014To Rosie</text>

There is dynamic reciprocity at work here. But it is understood that the curator makes the show, and the show must be produced in accordance with the values of the museum.‘In the service of the service’, Marx wrote.‘As the commodity circulates, it is precisely because it is circulation – the ever-present condition – that its use for one function becomes inauthentic and contradictory, in the sense that it posits a use for which there is no existence.’ But what counts as a use is precisely what has a social value, a meaning or purpose or connotation or relevance or place or history or character or signification or origin or fortune or ancestry behind it. What counts as cultural production is precisely what leaves behind a mark or imprint that stands the test of time and remains recognisable in the social totality.‘The museum is the arena of the social, and above all the site of the social, but it is also the site</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of social formation. The historical specificity of the biennial in the modern city is precisely the production for the sake of social formation that it does not seem able to foster in earnest. And this is why biennials have particular problems of being constituted and constituting, or constituting but failing in its attempt. It’s the failure to produce in earnest, and especially in the United States, not to speak of the obvious structural factors.Modern biennials have become entwined in the urban-dwelling narrative, if not necessarily conscious of it. One could argue, however, that the rise of the biennial in the 1990s was primarily the result of a cultural-political revolution occurring in the United States. That year saw the intention of the then-governor of Georgia, Mark Dayton, to establish a state-sanctioned biennial that would encompass all 50 of Georgia’s states. So, by the very nature of its form, the biennial became defined by</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of social transformation.  	Art has always been a site of social struggles, but its social character is what historian Maira Kalman affects when she examines the history of art and social organisation in ‘the West’. In the West, she writes, art’s emancipatory social character emerged in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, during the Paris Commune and the Enlightenment. But in the East, it wasn’t until the nineteenth century that modern art emerged as a fully realised cultural form, and that required a complete political and legal revolution. Kalman traces the history of art’s emancipatory social character because artists were often engaged in emancipatory political activity. She documents the history of legal reforms that required artists to take on larger public roles, and the public relations campaigns that accompanied them, and this, she argues, placed artists at odds with the authorities. She documents the rise of modern art because modern art forms have become so</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of social engagement. The museum is a site of active participation, a place of encounter – an encounter that requires the pilgrim to cross cultural boundaries, engage in practices of cultural self-congratulation, and participate in the production of his or her own cultural self-congratulation. That is, the museum is a site of the production of cultural capital, the social production of cultural capital. It is a site of the social, cultural production of its own social forms. It is a site of artistic work that is socially productive, socially engaged, and so forth. The Greek and Roman museums that I visited during my research were not confined to the things that most people associate with art – the gallery, the museum, the art market. I visited many different kinds of museums during my research, and a Greek and Roman one stood out as being particularly exemplary. This was due to the fact that it was dedicated to the sole purpose of art as a process: the study of nature in its infinite variety of</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of social action. In fact, the opposite is often true: that the more art is made in the city, the less likely are we to inhabit it and make culture of it.   The museum as a building and the artefact as material have characterised the city in important ways, but here we concentrate on the museum as the site of art making. The aim of our research is to make the artefact both an active agent shaping the narrative of cultural production in the city and an object of consumption. The museum as an artefact is a site of production for social change, and this is most evident in the organisation of events – held in a building that is both a production office and a marketplace – that are part of a cultural district. These cultural district events are the site of the ongoing circulation of ideas, experiences and artefacts, the production of new narratives and the production of old myths and legends. They are a site of cultural exchange, offering a livelihood for artists and artists’ organisations</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of social action. It is to neglect the complex cultural practices involved in contemporary art making and exhibition making, and to neglect the complex social and political context of art making. 	Art is – by its very nature – political. Modern art is made up of political acts, acts of representation, actions that are taken to represent reality. Art is made up of social practices, and contemporary art is made up of social relations. But to make art that is social is to ignore or completely disregard art’s political nature. 	Art has a social function too. It is made up of individual and institutional practices, and art has a social function too. But art has no such thing as a social meaning or social function. It is a ‘subject’ and a ‘thing’ – a social practice, a social image, and a ‘thing of value’. Art has no such thing as a social function. Modern art has achieved a certain amount of global cultural ubiquity</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of social organisation. It is to undervalue the role of culture in enabling social life, producing meaning and beauty in our lives. More than that, it is to ignore the role of culture in ensuring social life, producing meaning and beauty in the world.  	Art is made up of social acts. But to assume that all social acts are the same, that there is one true art form – that there is only one true form of art – is to neglect the fact that art has many cognates, many subjects, many forms, and therefore many cognates – subject matter that change with the changing of time, place, and culture. In this sense, I think that’s what we meant when we said that art should be a ‘continuing source of knowledge and activism’. It’s true that new media and performance artists have made art more accessible. But that is a new phenomenon – the advent of accessibility only makes it so that we can do more with it</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of social organisation. The dynamic of cultural production and social organisation is cultural colonialism and social contraction. The problem with the concept of the cultural capital of the twentieth century is precisely that it became attached to such a concept. The production for the sake of social organisation became attached to the production for the sake of art. The production for the sake of art became the object of social activity. Social activity, at its best, consists in entering into and experiencing the social. More important, it must take place in a community of people capable of constituting a shared wealth. The development of the productive forces and social practices of the twentieth century require great labour. But it also requires that huge tracts of the social be taken up with taking part in the social, in becoming members of a community, and in becoming culturally productive members of the community. These tasks are vast. But to assume that the productive forces and social practices of the century can be reduced to the formulation of cultural scripts is to misunderstand the significance of a cultural composition</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of socialisation. It is to misunderstand the concept of social. And it is to distort the site of art making, the social, in order to suit the needs of a capitalist curatorial machine. The mission of the SFMFA is not to be a place of social experience, or to foster a deeper understanding of the city. Its mandate is to maximise commercial potential and the capitalist logic of urbanisation. The mission of the museum is to archive and analyse its history – to the extent that such analysis is needed by a capitalist curatorial machine. And yet, the mission of the SFMFA is to nurture and document the city’s cultural history, not to produce a museum of culture. The museum, by definition, is the site of production, and its production, production for consumption, and its image making. It records the ways in which cultural commodities are produced and consumed, and its effect on the sites on which it is produced. And so the SFMFA has two principal mission</text>

But to claim that art should necessarily be a site of social activity is to misunderstand the dynamic of cultural production and its production for the sake of social transformation. The museum is a site of habit, where people live their daily lives, becoming more and more absorbed in the contents. The city is a site of growth, when new business developments, residential developments and the multitude of other urban transformations are occurring. Cultural institutions are a site of potential sites of radical change, where possibilities are actively considered and actively seized upon. This is what we mean when we speak about the ‘cultural capital of the world’. The city represents the potentialities of urbanisation, but it also represents the infrastructures that could support the possibilities of future growth. The cultural institutions of the city may well shape the future, but they are by and for the city. Indeed, the very fact that people are constantly coming into and out of the cultural institutions of the city represents a possible site of retrospection. We live among those infrastructures, and we’re constantly making new ones, in attempts to keep up with the rapid changes taking place</text>

The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the understanding that these infrastructures are neither smart, nor benevolent, nor entirely self-contained. Human agency is embedded in the infrastructural systems that enable the provision of goods and services in a given geographical area. The sharing of such understanding is a precondition for the provision of other goods and services. This understanding is what makes possible the provision of goods and services to communities outside of the area served by the infrastructural systems that support such goods and services. It is this understanding that is being obscured and denied in the service of economic growth.2. The sharing of infrastructural knowledge. This understanding of the world as an interface between man and machine makes it easier to understand how man-made structures can be strengthened in the service of man’s needs. This understanding also makes it easier to understand the attraction and/or repulsion of new technologies.

The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the understanding that these infrastructures are designed with essential functions in mind. Thus understanding how to engage the human agency within such systems is essential if we are to understand how to design such systems to deliver value to customers and communities in ways that are not driven by the privileged few at the top.Infrastructural regeneration is a business model that is increasingly attractive to governments and non-profit sector partners due to the shift in the balance of economic, political and social power in the wake of the economic crisis. In places such as Liverpool, with its post-1975 economic model that embraced a high degree of finance and its reliance on exports, and Manchester, where the post-1975 economic model embraced a third party to manage the city’s finances, the infrastructural sector has proven particularly adept at shifting costs and generating new business models through strategic planning that is driven by the interests of investors and the city’s rich.

The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the understanding that such infrastructural systems are designed to deliver goods and services in ways that are not always optimal or even always desirable. Understanding this reality is one step closer to enabling that capacity.2 	Knowledge of this reality is only possible because of the infrastructural system design that includes understanding the human agency embedded within the infrastructure itself. Even with this deeper understanding, however, there is still room for improvement. As mentioned earlier, there is still room for tweaking and new technologies are needed in order to enable human agency within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. In addition, there are still room for design flaws and inconsistencies to creep into the system, and for criticality to slip through the cracks. In these ways, the design of infrastructural systems does not emerge without friction and that is part of the design process – friction that is part of the reason why we are constantly surprised and ambushed by the sheer size</text>

The necessity for human agency emerges from the understanding that there is no alternative to the infrastructural imperative. The infrastructural imperative makes possible the infrastructural transformation that results in increased output and consumption but also in other more fundamental changes in the structure of human society. Understanding this dynamic and the creative infrastructural conjuncture that results is one way of understanding the war on terror. 2. The surveillance state as transformation of the citizen.

The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the understanding that humans are made in such a way as to be able to move from place to place and across broad geographical expanses: from the factory to the city, from the farm to the office, and from the factory to the port. The proliferation of data capture and processing devices, the connectivity of data, and the rise of automated extraction mean that it is possible to monitor and record people across vast geographical areas. This raises the question: what kind of humanity are we creating? A question that, given the right infrastructures, designers and engineers, could be redesigned to conform to new human needs and wants.New York–based startup New World Zero is tapping into this understanding of how to be embedded within ever larger infrastructures and societal formations through its application of 3D modelling and virtual reality. The startup seeks to address the question: what is it that the users of the infrastructures embed in their physical environment? New World Zero is a 3D</text>

The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the understanding that such infrastructural systems are designed with particular purposes in mind. These purposes become evident in designs that signal the infrastructural system’s intentions and intentions of its users. For example, the planting of trees signals to neighbouring properties how much greenery is being created, what part of the property is being served and so forth. Such design elements are a pre-figurative design element that points to future designs that take into account the systems that exist at the moment of planting. They are also a product of the historical and anthropological studies that have been ongoing in the UK for many decades now. They emerge as part of a design process that seeks to incorporate the knowledge of the past within the design of the future. Perhaps the design process itself is itself part of a historical and anthropological study of how the human capacities interact and evolve over time. In such systems, design becomes part of the historical and anthropological literature of design. This is true</text>

That capacity is what makes us human.Creating new ways of being embedded within ever larger infrastructures is a multi-step process that must be undertaken. The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the understanding that these infrastructural systems are ‘permanent’ in nature. That understanding emerges in part from the work of artists and designers who have been recruited by the British Council to develop strategic cultural responses to the changing nature of the infrastructures that are their platforms. The skills and knowledge that can be developed into self-understanding are critical for a future that acknowledges the agency and creativity of the individual.  	Such critical infrastructural design has its roots in the work of the Civil Engineering Division at the Royal College of Art (1969-74), whose members included Paul McCarthy, Peter Carr and Ken Turner. At the time, the RC was led by Professor Alan Bass, who was a regular contributor to the Daily Worker and the arts editor of the Arts and Biz Review. More recently, Professors Damien Hardie and David Bell were appointed to the post of Principal, respectively, of the School of Architecture and the Architect</text>

The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the recognition that these infrastructural systems are inherently designed to meet human needs but are also embedded with sophisticated systems that can sense and anticipate human behaviour. The understanding is gained that human agency is also embedded within the material systems that are designed to support human needs but are also embedded with embedded cultural mechanisms that enable the capacity to perceive and take part in ‘human history’. And so we move to understand how cultural institutions can intervene in this history and create ‘better’ forms of infrastructural support for human needs but also, crucially, ‘better’ ways of taking part in it’. The challenge for these cultural interventions is to activate the capacity of the cultural institutions to produce and participate in ‘human history’ in ways that are not reductive of or opposed to the historical narratives of the past, present and future that are embedded in these infrastructural systems.The second and third steps in the culturalisation process are</text>

The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the understanding that such infrastructures are designed with certain kinds of needs at certain kinds of scales. Understandings of this kind are essential for understanding how humans operate them. A grasp of this kind of infrastructural rationality is afoot in the West, but it is developing at an uneven pace in the East. Singapore Airlines is a remarkable case in point. Its rapid growth and consumption of resources has put immense strain on the planet, posing a threat not only to its own inhabitants but also to the planet's fragile ecosystem.‘Resource crunch’ is a term of art in Singapore, but it is also an understatement. The airline industry in its current form is a fossilised form, struggling to survive on the cheap carrier that it calls its own. It has to invest heavily in upgrading its fleet of aircraft, which are now widely exported and use increasingly elaborate control surfaces that monitor flight plans and detect drugs and bomb-detection systems.

The first step is understanding that human agency is also embedded within the infrastructural systems that are designed to deliver goods and services. The necessity for human agency emerges from the realization that infrastructures are the primary platforms on which the future is predicted to be built. The infrastructural future is here – it is here to stay – but it is also here to be destroyed. That is, the infrastructural future may well contain technologies that render the present obsolete, but it also contains a future that is itself contingent upon upholding or upholding the old fashioned way of life. Destroying the infrastructural future is a strategic and protracted project, but it is one that is necessary in order to fully realize the human potential.Infrastructural futures may well contain human-machine interface overlays, but that is only one component of the broader context of design thinking. Beyond that, there is the much more fundamental question of what kind of future will future inhabitants have? In an ideal world, the future would not be dependent upon fossil fuels and the infrastructural past, but it would still exist in a relative sense.</text>

The Biennial was created as a ‘point of departure’ from the city, and its increasingly globalised urbanisation. The event was to be made manifest in an ever-expanding, kaleidoscopic tapestry of ‘places of experience’ across the city. Art is often cited as a tool for spatialising life, but the spatialisation of life seems particularly apt for the purpose of the Biennial. The biennial event’s global reach demanded a spatialisation of experience that would render everyday life as unremarkable and everyday objects of inquiry. The event’s increased commercialisation demanded a spatialisation of culture as cultural capitalised tourism.

The fact that the Biennial was even allowed to exist in the first place is testimony to the transformative power of local art and design.  	The Biennial itself was a response to a city that was no longer presenting itself as a destination but as a city in crisis, in need of rebuilding. It offered a way to think of the city not as an object but as an arrangement of relationships, the dynamic mix of which generates new situations and engages with old. The Biennial was a project that emerged not from an idealised past but from the present, a ‘potential future’. It offered a way to imagine a future that represents the diversity of different cultures, of different times and places. A place where people might live together in co-existence, not for business or pleasure, but because that is the future that imaginatively anticipates the present. 	In an ideal scenario, the Biennial’s current incarnation would be an extension of its original mission statement, but in the current political and economic situation, that is not always possible. There are political forces that would prevent such an aspiration from coming to fruition, and there are cultural factors that would prevent such an aspiration from happening either. 	The pot</text>

The Biennial was a ‘transformation of the city’, a place where art, culture and lifestyle could be nurtured and instilled in a way that would later be repeated across local and international sites. It could be seen as a counterweight to the destructive effects of neoliberalism, and perhaps a way to reclaim the exciting localness, the idiosyncratic ‘city-within-a-city’ that was systematically erased during the 1990s.  	The Biennial was also seen by some of its practitioners as a way to recover lost imagination and creative energy, a desire that was shared by many of those who attended. It is difficult to imagine what the impact of such a revival would have had had in the city had it not been quarantined by law in 1990, and by then the Biennial had become something of an institution in its own right.

Art, design, sustainable development, urban activism, and urban studies have all found their places in the Biennial’s mix. The location of the Biennial, and its curatorial approach, was a significant shift from the usual exhibitionary format, in which the main point of departure was usually a city (with a few notable exceptions). The Biennial’s curatorial commitment, and its entire budget, was largely a response to the city, a fact that was exploited by the Biennial’s increasingly globalised financial model, which required it to expand outward at breakneck speed (it now focuses on connecting to larger local audiences outside of its home markets). The Biennial was, in other words, able to break free of its city and find new ways of relating to its diverse urban settings.  	Within the Biennial, the artists</text>

The title itself is a play on two words: itinerant, and itinerant. In its original sense, it referred to those creative people who set up their own lives and worlds around the world. Such itinerant artists were a major force in the history of art, and arguably still are. 	‘Existential Westphalia’, 2016. Installation, Liverpool Biennial 2016. Photo: Tom Lox.

It was a chance for the city to reclaim some of its former self, and to open itself up to new forms of cultural tourism. Art was used to project the city’s cultural resources into practice, and the city’s cultural resources into dialogue with the city’s cultural infrastructure. Art as resource became a mode of cultural circulation, and cultural tourism became the mode of cultural production. Art as cultural resource was used to create a self-sustaining biennial industry, one that would not only survive but flourish in the face of ever more powerful forms of tourism. Art as cultural resource transformed the city into an artistic locus of culture. Art as cultural producer transformed the city into a city capable of sustaining artistic output.

Art is a powerful tool, and its ability to generate change through change is a powerful storytelling tool.

The naming of the island as an island – which many in the local community felt was an injustice – was a way to make the island ‘real’ again. The Biennial’s ambition, in fact, was to reconnect the island with the cities, rather than cities with the island. Art was used to help us think about how the city was produced through what Deena Chalabi and her team did after school: by bringing together artists, community organisers, writers and artists from around the island to work on a project that explored how culture was produced, organised and consumed. Art was used not only to produce change, but also to help us question and change outcomes. Art as a tool is a powerful tool. It can produce change through direct action, but also through questioning established narratives and expectations. In this sense, then, the Biennial and the place it takes place in is significant in that it is both a production of and a response</text>

Its mission statement ‘To be a catalyst for change and catalytic force for social and ecological transformation’ signals a city that is no longer interested in the way it is being governed. 	The Biennial produced tangible social and cultural changes through its projects, but its true impact was felt when it came to the areas that mattered most: the city, the community, and the neighbourhood. The narrative of despair and banality returned, but its grip was broken through through the use of creative action, and creative people were brought into the mix. That is, of course, if there were any social or cultural capital left after the city had been re-zapped. 	Looking back, the Biennial could also be seen as a trap: a failure that brought with it a flood of investment and a clear understanding of social and urban futures. The investment that was foolish and the clear understanding of futility and urban decline brought with it an explosion</text>

The decision to create multiple weekends for the development and enjoyment of the area came as a surprise to residents, who were often disappointed that the Biennial would only ever develop and offer a series of architectural packages for the area. Nevertheless, the decision to offer different levels of access to the same type of property – a strategy that has paid off handsomely – was a new one for the Biennial, and it is this change of pace that residents have embraced with open arms. The new model for the Biennial that I have come to associate with a more deliberate and systematic institutionalisation of the art and culture of the area, the emergence of a dedicated cultural institution – an MBTI – and the formal integration of the area into the national capital. The Biennial’s 2018 programme is being developed in collaboration with the London Museum of Art and National Museums Liverpool, whose curatorial approaches to the event will be guided by the new model of the Biennial as a ‘cultural enterprise’.

The decision to create multiple weekends for the development and enjoyment of the area came as a surprise to residents, who were initially apprehensive about the idea of creating a different weekend schedule from the main schedule. The decision to create a ‘cultural village’ around the biennial was also an issue, since the streets around the museum and the landfill had always been a constant presence in the lives of the local residents. The creation of multiple weekends allowed for a more holistic cultural experience in the area, where the perception of the city was enhanced through the incorporation of different artists, a mix of local and international artists, and the creation of a ‘street scene’ around the biennial. 	The creation of multiple weekends also coincided with the opening of a new branch of the Victoria and Albert Museum, which serves as a staging post for a new generation of artists. The new artists were drawn from the School of Visual Arts and the Museum of Modern Art, with an emphasis on the latter’s early work on the arts and culture of Asia.

MCMX’s partnership with The Community Land Trust marks a radical departure from the usual collaboration between the Biennial, the art institutions, and the local residents' organisation. This kind of radical transparency and sharing of power dynamics are rare in organisations in the UK and certainly nowhere as extreme as in the case of in the case of the Biennial itself. 	The fact that the Biennial had to go through the lengthy planning and protracted permitting processes to establish a permanent art institution in the borough of Tower Hamlets made residents and visitors to the site quite sceptical. However, residents and visitors to the site have obviously been very engaged with the project, and it is clear that the Biennial has learnt lessons from its experience in the borough, and that this kind of</text>
    <text>The next Biennial will focus on the city as a continuous space for cultural exchange and cultural ‘multiplication’. The venue for this event, MCMX, will be co-constituted by The Community Land Trust (England’s largest land and development corporation) and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which together own and manage the area around the Biennial site. MCMX will be a hub for cultural exchange and ‘creative reuse’ for the area. The partnership between the Biennial, the London Museum, and The Community Land Trust marks a new phase in the history of the Biennial in the borough of Tower Hamlets, which started in 1912 and is still expanding at an average rate of four projects a day. The Biennial’s 2018 plans call for a cumulative three weekends in London, with a further two weekends in Hong Kong. 	The decision to create multiple weekends for the development and enjoyment of the area came as a surprise to residents, who were initially told only of the weekend plans. Residents have spoken, and now, almost a year after the announcement, the Biennial has released a revised proposal that includes a ‘weekend only’ option for the remaining three weekends in the city. The revised proposal falls short of the original, full-scale, urban plan, but it does include an option for an island ‘design slice’ of the city. 	The development of the island ‘design slice’ has come at a very critical time for the area, with the demolition of the Town of Potters Bay and the surrounding peninsula's plans for an even bigger development project that would see an even larger region of the island razed to make way for a global megacorporation. As the Biennial prepares to close its doors in 2021, residents will have another opportunity to play host to the Biennial’s future visitors, when a new arrangement can be worked out with the Town of Tower Hamlets.</text>

The decision to create multiple weekends for the development and enjoyment of the area came as a surprise to residents, who were generally opposed to the idea. While the decision to dedicate one weekend to cultural exchanges may be an aesthetic one, the fact of the studio’s existence during these weekends clearly signals to tourists and residents alike that this area is a place where culture is actively produced and maintained. In the stage of cultural symbiosis, the visitors and residents of the Biennial are actually part of a larger cultural unit, which is maintained and actively renewed through the art and activities of the Biennial. The fact that these visitors and residents are often drawn to the Biennial’s productions and 'hot topics’ is evidence that the Biennial has learned from its mistakes and is on the right path. It is essential that the Biennial continues its historical cultural-cultural-tourism-like mission in the area. This is the best way to ensure that the local community is enriched through the creation of new art forms and techniques, and that the Biennial can continue to build its membership base through arts and</text>

The decision to create multiple weekends for the development and enjoyment of the area came as a surprise to residents, who were initially wary of the idea of collaborating with a museum in the development of their neighbourhood. The artists, the Biennial, the Muralists, the Community Land Trust, the bakeries, the pub, the school, the football ground, the theatres, the community centre, the bakery (with its warm welcome and lingering bread envelope), the landscape (its natural beauty and unremarkable building), the cafes (which doubled as art exhibitions), the community (which is divided between those who contributed money and shaped the area), the residents (who were often victims of gentrification), the media (for which the borough was often blamed), the sporting events (where the fans gave the borough its style), the politicians (whose support was often sought by the Biennial in return for luxury boxes, seats in the stands and other packages), the heritage organisations (whose work was often neglected by the local residents), the local businesses (whose closure was often threatened by the Biennial’s expansion), the heritage preservation</text>

The Biennial’s 2018 plans call for a cumulative three weekends in London, with a further two weekends in Hong Kong. 	The decision to create multiple weekends for the development and enjoyment of the area came as a surprise to residents, who were initially worried about the impact of a one-day arts festival outside the Biennial. After experiencing the positive reactions to the initial idea, the decision to create a cluster of projects around the Biennial was easier said than done. The complexity of the project, the fact that it was being commissioned by a non-profit organisation, and the fact that the projects were being placed in a disused building due to its poor state made it seem as if the Biennial was trying to place all these projects in one big ‘big picture’. In fact, the Biennial had already decided to devote one of its development plcurals to the development of East London, and an area around the Biennial, so the fact that this area was being developed alongside an East London borough was unnecessary and un-British. 	The development of East London has been going on for a while now, and while it is still developing, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the area doesn’t belong</text>

The Biennial’s 2018 plans call for a cumulative three weekends in London, with a further two weekends in Hong Kong. 	The decision to create multiple weekends for the development and enjoyment of the area came as a surprise to residents, who were initially told only of the first weekend. Originally, the idea was to have one ‘weekday’ and one ‘night’ dedicated to community activities. In fact, some residents expected that the first weekend in Hong Kong would be a holiday, rather than a festival. After extensive research, it was decided that the best way to contribute to the development of the area would be for residents to be able to create their own narrative in the area. The next step would be for the Biennial to put together a ‘curatorial team’ to work with residents to create a ‘picture that can be shared’ through narrative-based activities such as maps, prints,  	Post and Portraits, and  	Post-its. Curators would create a ‘choreography of the area’ through which the community could ‘reproduce and reimagine itself’. 	The team would be led by a curator selected from one</text>

The Biennial’s 2018 plans call for a cumulative three weekends in London, with a further two weekends in Hong Kong. 	The decision to create multiple weekends for the development and enjoyment of the area came as a surprise to residents, who were often clamouring for more cultural interaction and outdoor activities in the weekends. The decision to dedicate one weekend to ‘cultural exchange’ and ‘a community event’ may be seen as a response to these demands, but in the new cultural climate, it is questionable how much of the original intent and character of the idea is preserved. 	The introduction of new technologies such as social media and website design into the biennial’s temporal dynamic was also viewed as a threat by some residents. Although these may be used for good in a historical or scientific context, their socio-political applications are questionable in the context of the contemporary urbanisation process and urban decline. The introduction of new nuclear power plants and massive new oil refineries is a case in point. 	The new breed of urban dweller is attracted to the perceived abundance and vibrancy of new developments, which are often promoted as ‘renewing cities’. These people see a chance to make a</text>

In the festival’s early days, the name stuck because the art was always displayed in large numbers, often arranged in neat groups. Later, as the popularity of the festival increased, the name stuck because the art was often distributed in quite a large way. The issue of distribution became an issue when the art</text>

These move through congested urban environments with little regard for the people or environment they affect. As a movement, it is variable in character, and the driver of the infrastructure often has little or no involvement with the construction of infrastructure. However, as a material system with significant ecological and anthropogenic impacts, its control is extremely constrained.

At the Venice Biennale, we are proud to have hosted the AI festival, AI: CompuLab (2016), AI Pavilion (2017), and AI Pavilion: New Art (2017). The two pavilions at the Biennale that we have jointly curated are devoted to the AI/Artificial Intelligence subdiscipline. They were designed as interactive media spaces for the festival, allowing audiences to investigate the subdiscipline through works in progress, as well as curated activities, including a public programme of exhibitions. The pavilions also serve as a hub for the networked systems and peripheries of Artificial Intelligence, where users can research on their systems and peripheries through research projects, create and explore virtual spaces, and so forth.

I would like to think that the answer to this question is both simple and profound. Do you have any answer? The simple answer is that you’ve probably never even thought about how AI is disrupting traditional governance structures, much less, perhaps, how it will for many thousands of years to come. And this is perhaps the most critical issue of our time: how to reconcile a humanity with an evolving, ever-more-robust artificial intelligence? The question is existential, and no answer will bring us home. The human condition requires a reason to exist, and curating requires a reason to exist. If the AI doesn’t have reason, then</text>

Such recording allowed the identification of small errors – single pixels or grooves in a sheet of film – that could be corrected before the image was sent back to the printer. This type of annotation could be made using existing editing tools, and it was a quick way to identify problems ahead of time. In many ways, the advent of digital cameras and scanners allowed for the rapid deployment of new technologies, so it is easy to see how the desire to always know more could become a resource for the construction of ever more precise algorithms. In many ways, however, such rapid iteration is also the source of the problem – the problem of what to do when new information becomes available. Rapid iteration is the source of new technologies and the problem of interface confusion. In technological terms, this means that what is new and awesome in technology becomes apparent only after extensive testing and development. As a consequence, there is a delay between when the technology is introduced and when users encounter it, or does something unexpected). As a user of communications technologies, I found myself constantly</text>

Such recording allowed the identification of small errors – single pixels – that would be corrected in the sequence before passing it on to the next shot. The idea was that the corrected image would have the same dimensions and position as the original but would be cropped so that the original took up only part of the resolution. The idea was that the repeated delivery of the image would eliminate small distortions. In other words, the image would be reconstructed and presented at the highest resolution possible, but would suffer from imperfections that would render it inaccurate in the original. The idea was that the scanners’components' programming would ensure that the image would be correct even if the original was damaged or destroyed – in other words, ‘miracles’. These were the days before computers, and the ever-expanding, human-readable storage of data meant that images could be made ‘perfect’ – that is, accurately reproduced and shared across the social networks that would later be known as ‘the Machine’.The possibilities for technological singular</text>

Such recording allowed the identification of small errors – single pixels, mistakes or omissions – that could be corrected before the image was sent back to the printer. This type of annotation can also be done with digital photography, in the form of cuts and edits that occur as a result of the photographic process. In digital photography, the cutting and pasting of images occurs on the part of the photographer; these images are then assembled and passed on by the computer to the media elements on the end users, who then process the images into images suitable for transmission over the network or device of the work. Digital cameras and scanners also capture and process images, but this is done automatically; the images do not have names or ID numbers. Instead, they are collectively referred to as ‘image data’ and are sent to the photo lab for processing. The photo lab first assembles a set of images that identify the relevant parts of the system; these parts then travel down a chain of command to arrive at the print shop where final cuts are made that identify</text>

Such recording allowed the identification of small errors – single pixels – that would be corrected as part of the overall system. Such diagnostics became standardised throughout the industry, and are still found in today’s smart phones and data capture and processing units. In fact, many of the images captured from the intersection of road and railroads during the 1920s and 1930s were simply smashed images of traffic congestion. But as technology advanced, the kinds of repairs that were once performed with precision and that could detect small mistakes in the infrastructure that were later optimised for ultra-high speed rail – fixing potholes, repairing flooded or otherwise failing infrastructure, and so forth – became routine. The kinds of intelligent design that characterise our transport networks also evolve and change with it, and so it is with puncture and leakages. As new kinds of infrastructure are created and updated, the kinds of damage that can be detected and repaired decrease. But there is still a lot of potential damage to be done before we call it a puncture or leak</text>

Such recording allowed the identification of small errors – single pixels – that altered the trajectory of a particle – a particle that at the time was thought to be impervious to error. A new generation of camera and scanner users is now engineers, technicians and scientists. They are used to recording errors and discovering new ways of doing things. They are used not to recording such errors but to finding new ways of doing things. They uncover hidden regulations, make mistakes along the way and come out the other side stronger for it. When I started at The Digital Image in 2011, I hoped that the expectations of the public and artists would evolve along similar lines. The expectations of the public would shift from the need to know what was happening in order to protest it to the need to be entertained by the process itself. The expectations of artists would grow beyond their current focus on the aesthetic to embrace the systems that enable social interaction and allow for the development of new media forms.I didn’t achieve these ends on my own. But I did get the chance</text>

Such recording allowed the identification of small errors – single pixels – that occurred along the way of the image, allowing the repair or enhancement of parts or images. The idea here is that if the image quality is poor enough to cause such a small error to creep into a working copy, then the work is fundamentally flawed and cannot be considered to be improved. Any improvement that can be made to a working copy must be inconspicuous and invisible, and its effects are likely to be unintentional. This is why digital still photography is so dangerous: it is possible to identify the mistakes that have been made and to intervene to remedy them – by editing the images or recording audio tracks that narrate the steps of the editing process.But this only works for so long: unless the image quality is immediately apparent as a defect in the image processing – as is the case with digital cameras – then the image will be reverted to its original state. The image cannot be corrected until the problem has become so obvious that the users of the repair tools are forced to make a</text>

Such recording allowed the identification of small errors – single pixels, stray lights, gaps in fabric, gaps in material – which could then be exploited in the production of more sophisticated images by the engineers that ran the show.  The introduction of codes into the system allowed the identification of precisely where those images were coming from, and for the first time, actual people to be drawn into the conversation between the computer and the image.  Such new ways of interacting with data also enabled the proliferation of journalism, which became both possible (since computers were like a huge reservoir of photographic negatives) and attractive (stories were often published with hyperlinks to sites with images of people doing things).  Finally, the advent of the internet allows for the rapid sharing of images and information across networks, which in turn allows for the rapid sharing of ideas and knowledge. Images now live mostly as images – shared between people – but they are images with meaning and value beyond the confines of the site where they were taken. This last kind of ‘meaningful exchange’ is</text>

New kinds of data gathering and production became possible, as well as new ways of interacting with such data. New kinds of jobs were created in the service of meeting ever more precise metrics in the pursuit of ever more finely tuned outputs.The early digital cameras and scanners used film to record images in sequences, which allowed the identification of specific parts of the system. Such recording allowed the identification of small errors – single pixels – that would be corrected as parts were assembled. Such diagnostic equipment was routinely referred to as ‘module maintenance’. The name comes from the Latin ‘modus operandi’, which roughly translates as ‘if it doesn’t work, then something else must be wrong. So, if the system doesn’t work, something must be done to make it work. And so it continued to be that way throughout much of the twentieth century.But something changed during the warring decades of the 1990s. First the implosion of the Soviet Union and then the infrastructural binge of the 1990s, which saw massive investments in new roads, bridges, tunnels and so on, created demand for environmentally friendly modes of travel. Cheap energy coupled with the permissive economic environment that followed the implosion of the last communist state fuelled a virtuous cycle of infrastructure investment and urban growth. New kinds of urban exploration were possible via these new links. New kinds</text>

This kind of annotation enabled artists to produce works that were both recognisable by the systems that recorded them and would also, once created, be able to be traced back to a particular point of origin?[7] This kind of tracing is now commonplace, but back then, it was art. New kinds of tracing were created through printing presses and the printing press itself. New kinds of art were made by artists whose artistic intentions were to be traceable. The publication of printings of artwork on a regular basis, along with the mathematical calculations that went into producing them, became routine. New kinds of art were made by artists whose art was based on the technology that recorded and stored its places.Artists who intended their works to be traceable through the use of data now had a way to make that happen.

This type of annotation is commonplace in computer programs, but is considerably more difficult to do with human language. The reason is that the human authoring of a programme like Markdown must first understand what he or she is writing. Otherwise, the programme will not be able to produce the documents that the reader wants. So the authoring of Markdown has to understand what it is he or she is writing – and also what the reader wants. To produce the documents the programme wants, the programme has to understand what the reader means by those documents. And to understand the meaning of what the reader means by those documents, the programme has to be able to produce those documents at will.This last bit of human labour is what makes collaborative writing possible. It is what enables a project like Wikipedia to compile all the articles relating to the subject of a given project, while still allowing the reader to wander about</text>

But the critical shift that is happening in Vancouver is the shift from a biennial to a daily art event, and that is a critical shift because it signals a break with the past. It signals a break with the pastiche that is trying to fill the city with art. It signals a break with the epochal trends that are pulling us towards an artless society. The idea of art as such is a construct that has to be constantly (re)negotiated, and that is what is being done in Vancouver right now, constantly. It’s like putting a cap on the size of the garbage can. If the size of the can is capped, then the weight of the can is constantly (re)negotiated. And the bigger the can, the harder the can be reduced and the better the recycling opportunities that can be had.</text>

But the important thing is that the artist has that direct relationship with the public that comes from being in the museum and being present in the museum, and that is what the biennale is trying to achieve.

How can biennials witness the current political situation in their cities? I understand the need for research projects, but the way in which art is produced in our cities today, both in the biennial form and in the larger art world, creates a situation where there is a real tension between art and activism. There is a real tension between art institutions and the city, between the urban and the rural, between the large and the small, between the urban and the rural. But these are just generalities. There is a real and growing chasm between the artists and the communities they work with, between communities and artists. There is a chasm between the communities and the communities that produce</text>

That would be a radical curatorial move, and there are many curatorial moves that are being made in Canada and the US that are being welcomed by the public, but at the same time there is a need to be present in order to participate in those public institutions. Because what the public gallery is giving up on is a political and legal right to curatorial independence, and that’s something that is increasingly at stake in Canada.  One of the first acts of the new government is to withdraw the Canada from the European Convention on Human Rights, and to do the same with the Canadian version of the UN. These are historic acts, and as a result there is a real risk that our values as Canadians are going to be put in conflict with the new laws and constitutions. The right to democracy is something that is worth defending, and the public gallery is something that is worth losing. So there is a real conflict there, and the public gallery is there to serve as a check on the state. It is a hybrid institution, and its mission has been defined by the state, but it has to be</text>

That would be a radical curatorial move, and there are many curatorial moves that are being made in Canada and the US that are making art more visible and inaccessible, and doing the opposite by making it more accessible and culturalally progressive. Art is cultural reproduction because it’s reproduced in many forms – it’s a practice. When you take the form of a museum exhibition, then you get the intention of the museum, but the actual reproduction, that is, of what the museum might have in mind. You get cultural exchange, but you don’t necessarily get exchange based on exchange. There is a tension between the intention of the museum and the reality of exchange that takes place. That is, the intention of the museum might actually be in conflict with what the exchange aims to achieve. The more we engage with the physical world, the more we create and participate in it, the less we achieve. But the other dynamic is that the more we innovate, the less we replicate. Innovation and cultural exchange in the form of exhibits and performances is a very different dynamic from that of the museum.</text>

That would be a radical curatorial move, and there are many curatorial moves that are being made in Canada and the United States that are also questioning whether art institutions are really places where ideas are disseminated and making questions that are far more complex than we think.  A place where questions are far more complex than we can ever imagine is a place where people are going to come for hours not knowing what questions are going to arise. And that’s why curating is so important. It has to be transparent, accessible and it has to be able to put ideas into practice. If it doesn’t, then it isn’t going to be able to disseminate those ideas. And that process of putting ideas into practice is where curating can make questions more complex. It’s not just the ideas, but the process by which those ideas are disseminated. So when we do those things such as the biennale, the Sapporo Art Biennale, the Granby Four’s Birds of Paradise project, we see how those things happen. We</text>

That would be a radical curatorial move, and there are many curatorial moves that are being made in Canada and the United States that are in direct opposition to the modern curatorial move. Modern curatorial move is in part a response to this kind of institutionalised contradiction, but it is also a response to it being possible to create new art forms through the commodification of culture. When it comes to what is now called modern art, art is no longer simply produced and consumed; we also tend to produce culturally-inflected art through our consumption of images and media. So what does it mean for a museum to be culturally relevant? When I first started, I put a museum in mind, but it wasn’t just ‘a museum’; it was about more than just the production of art. It’s about the purpose of the museum, the politics of the museum, the meaning of the museum, and how the museum is connected to the social. My intention is to do a project that is both geographically encompassing and interdisciplinary, so as to be able to engage with any</text>

That would be a radical curatorial move, and there are many curatorial moves that are being made in Canada and the United States that could be seen as being in conflict with the current model of art institutionality. But there is a way of thinking about how art is made that is very different from the way that the public sector operates. The potential of that new curatorial hand is being looked at; there’s a lot of interest in the potential of new art forms to meet the challenges of a 21st century society. There is a real question of, can art institutions build capacity? The fact that art is now the most widely read social media phenomenon on the planet certainly raises expectations on that front, and the curatorial move of pastel-coloured street murals in major Canadian cities seems a mistake on several levels. But the potential is there for art institutions to partner with local communities and offer capacity building in a number of other ways. The question is, can they find the political will to implement those kinds of initiatives? I don’t think so. The problem with the current curatorial</text>

That would be a radical curatorial move, and there are many curatorial moves that are being made in Canada and the United States that are quite similar to what is being done in Åkerdijk’s home country, but operate in a more subtle, yet decisive way. The question is: what is the difference between introducing art and politics into the biennale format? The answer is: a lot of it. There is a real difference between the political and the artistic, material and immaterial. I think that there is a danger in thinking about art and art institutions as political entities: that we are beginning to politicize what art can and cannot be, and treating them as though they are political actors. There is a danger here, too, in thinking about what art can and cannot be placed in the public sector, whether that’s a responsibility that art institutions in Canada or the United States should necessarily take on, and whether or not that institution is capable of delivering on that responsibility. I recall a lecture given by Prof. Gerald Notz, who was then the chair of the Department</text>

That would be a radical curatorial move, and there are many curatorial moves that are being made in Canada and the US that are being largely ignored or unappreciated. But it would also mean radically changing what art institutions are, and in effect changing the shape of art in those countries. That would be a radical change, not just for Canada, but for contemporary art in Canada and the US. I don’t think that is what is happening in Canada, nor do I think that curatorial moves in Canada are a main part of the conversation right now, although they certainly can impact what can and cannot be shown in art museums.  In my opinion, the big curatorial push in Canada right now is done by the government, and while there are exceptions, generally speaking the government is the one that is pulling the strings when it comes to art institutions. The problem with the current curatorial push is that it is also a main part of the conversation that is going on in the country, and as a result, the country is the only place where this is happening. The other places that are</text>

But the important thing is that the public institution that we refer to as ‘the museum’ has that relationship, and that relationship is as dynamic as it is fragile.’ That is, the museum is there to be watched, and to be visited, and to be engaged, and to be entertained, and it’s also there to deliver cultural value in exchange for funding and other types of support. So the museum has to become dynamic in order to be responsive to the existing institutional and political dynamics and to have that institutional power and money to sustain itself, and so forth. If the museum is there only as a collection of objects, then it’s subject to the rule that institutions are obligated to preserve: Řthe value of the thing itself in exchange for its appearance in a museum.’ For example, if an institution conceals something from the public, then the public doesn’t see it; nor</text>

    The next Biennial could very well be the one after 2020. The question is which one. It is likely that the largest number of visitors to the ten biennials in the world in 2017 would have come from the United States, and the ten in 2018 and 2020 would have come from different parts of the world. The question is which of them is likely to be remembered. The answer to this is also likely to depend on what is happening in the world at the moment. For this to happen, we need to know what is happening in the world in real time. If there is a 9/11 in Westminster, we need to know that the events of that day have metastasized globally. If there is a Hong Kong tsunami, we also need to know that the financial infrastructures underpinning those tsunamis are also modelled on the same infrastructure. In this sense, the biennial form is an episodic production, and its structure, while ancient, is also dynamic and ephemeral

We may collect and analyse it, but we do not know what to do with it. We may decide to weave it into an ever larger tapestry, but this is also a dangerous game. We may allow ourselves to be swept away by the beauty of it all, and all its complexities, but we cannot possibly replicate it. We need to capture and hold onto what is happening in real time. We need to know what is happening in order to prevent it from becoming fantastical or unreal.For me, in my role, this means learning from those who have been displaced, to help them navigate the labyrinth of displacement, to create opportunities for them to be heard, but also to understand what the future holds, so that they can act accordingly. I look forward to hearing what you have to say at the conference in October.DDownload this article as PDF29 October 2014To Osvaldo Sanchez20 July 2014Osvaldo SanchezMexico</text>

It is always present in the dynamics of the biennial, lurking, as it does today, in the shadows of the global capitalist metropolis.But what if the biennial form is actually here to stay? What if, in the coming years, we can look to see what the biennial form might look like in another form? What if, in the coming years, we can choose to project the dynamics of the biennial back into our local historical and fictional history? What if, in the coming years, we can instead choose to imagine the possibilities of a world without borders or economic colonialisms? What if, in the coming years, we can choose to imagine a world without economic colonialism? What if, in the coming years, we can choose to imagine a world based on ecological and climatological principles?I could name names and sectors here, but there are too many histories to work through.

In this sense, the biennial form is an episodic production, and its structure, while ancient, is also dynamic and ephemeral. It is a production that is constantly and completely changing, constantly adapts and evolves, and in its own way makes us all present. I would argue that the biennial form is the contemporary product of a multi-tiered global tourism industry, in which the biennial as a whole is a customer (travel is its primary advertising proposition), but also of a globalised financial and spatial infrastructure that supports and depends on tourism. The biennial form was created through the combination of these elements, that is to say, of the complexity of the transnational and the intra-national biennial market; the shifting sands of geopolitics, natural resource extraction and banking on the one hand, and the vulnerability of the tourist trade on the other. The biennial is a production that can be understood as being driven by geo-political and economic factors, but also by cultural and historical factors. It is driven by memories, and by their re-embraced forms, in the form of large-scale</text>

In this sense, the biennial form is an episodic production, and its structure, while ancient, is also dynamic and ephemeral. It becomes more important as we move along, and more volatile as we move from the past to the future, experiencing the impact of climate change, extreme weather and other elements of the biennale we design to observe and analyse. In this sense, biennials can be seen to shed new light on old problems, and to play a part in anticipating, if not creating, future problems. The significance of this in the contemporary artworld may be lost on some, but in their own right they are a significant artistic statement about the contemporary condition of being contemporary, urban and impoverished. We may not yet be able to say whether the biennial form will play a significant role in our future, but it is certain that its current trajectory will not be repeated. That is, of course, unless a new infrastructural turn occurs, or even unless we all decide to change our behaviour, as a result of new scientific and artistic insights.

In this sense, the biennial form is an episodic production, and its structure, while ancient, is also dynamic and ephemeral. It is the episodic formation of time itself. At the same time, the biennial form is also a workplace. It is the production of space and time, but more so the production of nothing and nothingness. It produces, but more so the production of space and time as capital. It produces a new kind of urbanity, one in which all of us are participants, and in which not only are we but also all species on this planet are potential users. This new kind of urbanity is no doubt accompanied by new migratory flows of labour, as well as a great many other things that we don’t yet know how to do. 	However, there is one more perhaps more fundamental difference between now and then, and that is that the biennial form is no longer confined to the urban. It is now universal, inhabiting all of life, and though it may be slow to start up for some, it grows in power as the century progresses, and</text>
    <text>The next Biennial could very well be the one after 2020. The question is which one. It is likely that the largest number of visitors to the ten biennials in the world in 2017 would have come from the United States, and the ten in 2018 and 2020 would have come from different parts of the world. The question is which of them is likely to be remembered. The answer to this is also likely to depend on what is happening in the world at the moment. For this to happen, we need to know what is happening in the world in real time. If there is a 9/11 in Westminster, we need to know that the events of that day have metastasized globally. If there is a Hong Kong tsunami, we also need to know that the financial infrastructures underpinning those tsunamis are also modelled on the same infrastructure. In this sense, the biennial form is an episodic production, and its structure, while ancient, is also dynamic and ephemeral. It is a production that depends on a certain state of awareness, and it is possible that the form will be remembered for good only after the event itself. The question becomes whether we live or die by the biennial.In the year 2020, the International Triennale Committee plans to hold its annual congress in New York. At this congress, the committee members will presumably be discussing the state of the art in their respective areas of expertise. For many years, the members of the committee have been trying to find a way to merge the staging of the biennale in New York, in which it is currently centred, with the staging of the committee’s other work, in museums and historic districts around the city. While the committee members themselves may still feel that the current situation is such that staging the biennale in New York is preferable to museums and historic districts everywhere, it is likely that the committee members will find that the present mixture of needs and desires is such that the</text>

In this sense, the biennial form is an episodic production, and its structure, while ancient, is also dynamic and ephemeral. The biennial as such is a production line that cannot be cut. It is a production that cannot be contained, and its growth, even in the face of established biennials in key locations, such as New York and London, is entirely unpredictable. So we can sense the beginning of the decay of the biennial, but we also sense the beginning of a renewal that is fully preventative. The question is which renewal will be able to withstand the changes that we collectively and individually are generating in the biennial scene (how we collectively and individually produce the biennial, and what kind of renewal that is). If we collectively can, then the biennial form will have to change.If, on the other hand, the form is that of a specific location and a specific customer (how and when that occurs, and if it ever does), then we collectively own the biennial: it is the specific entity that we collectively create, import, export, stock, stock with currency and other</text>

In this sense, the biennial form is an episodic production, and its structure, while ancient, is also dynamic and ephemeral. It is a production that aims to be remembered, and it achieves this through what is sometimes described as ‘surrealist’ practices, such as sculpture and painting, travelling and installation, performance and archiving, observation and documentary filmmaking. There is a danger that the way we organise our lives around the events of a given year may be influenced by the decisions that are made in that year, or in future, by what is said and done in the present. This is what biennials do best: to me, a fascination with the logistics of life and how it is produced in and through the built environment. In this respect, biennials excel at capturing the messy gritty details that are produced; the infrastructural tendencies that are accentuated by the biennial on a global scale; and the contradictions and tensions that emerge when these infrastructures are visited and visited on a regular basis. The question that remains, however, is which of these three themes will be</text>

In this sense, the biennial form is an episodic production, and its structure, while ancient, is also dynamic and ephemeral. It is the staging of change. The biennial is a production system, and its episodic character is an episodic production. It is a production for change. It is, however, also a production for continuity. And in this sense, it is characterised by a transition from one production to another, between the past and the future. This is characterised by what Stephen Jay Gould, in his term ‘The Fallacy of Narrative[12]’, refers to as ‘the temporality of the “26th of January 1948”, when the “First World War” began.[13] This ‘time” is characterised by what John Nash called ‘contemporaneous illusion’. In economic parlance, this means that a change in one element of a production system – the price level, for example – results in a change in another element, the price level, which in turn depends on an external factor (</text>

The biennial as exhibitionary form is here to stay.The biennial format is a staging and growth of global capitalism today, but it is also the graveyard of empires. That is to say, the economic and financial infrastructures underpinning the biennial form today are global in character, and as such are likely to continue to be global in character. Thus the biennial form is embedded in what may well be the defining global economic and political structure of the twenty-first century, and in that sense it is an inherently unstable form. The biennial may be the final word on a global scale on some level, but that does not mean that its spatiality will be unaffected by the fact that those in power will ultimately ultimately be overthrown. The biennial may well become an institutionalised form in and of itself, but that does not mean that its spatiality will be unaffected</text>

The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art is produced in disused or emergency situations, and how art can play a role in assisting with recovery from those crises. Art was not everywhere involved in the project, but its contribution was clear and undeniable. The decisions that were being faced by the artist-led project were being faced by the biennial as a whole. The decision of whether or not to commission an artist was being influenced by others, and their motivations were varied. Some artists were actively discouraging their participation, but the overwhelming majority were engaging with the project with curiosity and engaging with it in an enviably generous way. The project grew organically, organically, until the end result was a living, breathing and evolving creative community of artists, community organisers, architects, artists' groups and others providing support and space for the project to happen, play out and evolve.

The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art is produced in disused or emergency situations, and how art can intervene in such situations. The efforts of the artists and the Biennial to live together in this city also points to a deeper tension than artists and the city might otherwise present. Artists, curators, artists-students, architects, community organisers and architects were present at many stages of the process of creating the Liverpool Biennial, and the city’s development – from the early stages of looking for an architect to a more recent decision to commission a community of artists to paint public spaces and streets in and around Anfield. Artists Todd Beamer (Design Agent, Biennale of Sydney), Daniel Fernández (Architect, Biennale of Sydney), Rango (Community Arts Architect), Maxine Peake (Community Arts Architect), and Paula Whitehouse (Community Arts Architect) contributed to the development of the proposals, while local residents, community organisers, architects, academics, photographers and writers contributed to the feedback, refinement and expansion of the proposals.

The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art is produced in disused or emergency situations, and how art can play a role in enabling or enabling such situations. It also demonstrated the limits of artistic intervention in such situations. For more than a decade, artists and artists’ organisations supported the project by commissioning, leasing or creating creative environments, public art, producing educational programmes and so on. They provided resources and skills to the budding artist to develop a project, and then invited the artist to explore such sites and engage with the local community in those areas. The idea was to enable the local community to take part in the making of the art, while enabling the biennial to sustain the project in perpetuity. In a city with a biennial as its main form, other activities, such as festivals, performances or even tours, were encouraged. The key was that the biennial should offer an alternative to the monotony of the art market. The art market is a business, and while it may produce some interesting or even fascinating artefacts, it plays a role outside of time and space that</text>

The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art is produced in disused or emergency situations, and how art institutions can play a part in helping artists and their communities.Together, these two projects, and the many thousands of artists, musicians, activists and activists who use the city every day, can be said to be a part of creating what Jonas Salkow calls the ‘culture industry contradiction’. The industry depends on it, and plays it, creating opportunities for its stakeholders – artists, publishers, festival organisers, police forces, foundations, political parties – to maximise profits and the social impact of cultural assets.Art is a capitalised commodity. It is traded and valued in innumerable ways, and artworks are produced and enjoyed in many forms: as services to the social, economic and political wellbeing of many people, or used as objects of exchange. And yet, apart from the art itself, what makes art valuable? Well, some might argue that it is the very meaning of the word ‘capitalised’ as a concept, and the fact that capital is often associated with the</text>

The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art is produced in disused or emergency situations, and how art can intervene in such situations. Biennials are rarefactionary institutions: they are relatively new to art’s social life, but their social function has always been a back-up. The art world’s response to the crisis of the artist-organisationalised social: the biennial as an art project is no longer the exclusive preserve of the rich and the famous, but of course, the public likes to look at art and think about things. The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art can provide a social solution to a social problem, and it offered two ways of engaging the public: (1) engaging directly, by offering a ‘time capsule’ of the situation, and (2) creating a hybrid ‘platform’ that incorporates both contemporary art and social practices, in an attempt to create a parallel universe of art and culture that is both contemporary and is, in a way, accessible to all.] 	[…]</text>

The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art is produced in disused or emergency situations, and how art has a place in such situations. Biennials are a form of cultural exchange between people and non-professionals, and the art produced there is not necessarily representative of what artists would do if given the opportunity. But they are an exchange of ideas, and they are an exchange of ideas between artists and communities. They are a place where artists can express their creativity and learn from other artists. They are a place where communities can gather and exchange and become part of a cultural network. And they are a place where art can exist alongside other artistic activities – with or without the other. 	[…] The relationship between biennials and their geographical locations is complex. As biennials become more internationalised, their space needs to be recast to accommodate their growing clientele, which requires them to expand into cities with which they are not familiar.

There are many voices, many perspectives, and many layers to consider, so it is easy to become lost in the noise.

The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art is produced in disused or emergency situations, and how art can work alongside or in opposition to such production. The Biennial was also a case study for the ways in which art can be used to intervene in the city’s development, by intervening in the mode of production that results from it being located in or near to a university. In these ways, the Biennial and its projects may be seen to be part of a wider cultural and social process that is part of a larger ‘city’, but is also a mode of production in and through the city. This is the role of the artist-initiator in this context. 	[…] The Biennial project was multivocal, with participants from different departments and projects developing different versions of the same overarching idea.

The Biennial was a case study for the ways in which art is produced in disused or emergency situations, and how art can intervene to create a new context or set of relations between artist and community. 	[…] The relationship between artist-community artists and the local communities they work with is often complicated by the fact that these artists are predominantly young and female, and often come from privileged backgrounds. In the context of artist-initiated cultural initiatives, the dynamic can be an issue. It was challenging to see how artists could take part in projects that did not explicitly address gender or racialised communities, and which also did not explicitly address race or class. This dynamic is particularly evident in the area of housing, where developers have a disproportionate impact on communities of colour. It is also evident in the area of transport, where needs and desires often conflict. It was interesting to see how artists could create strategies to collaborate with and collaborate with communities in order to solve problems that are not socio-politically connected.

[…] The biennial format is a convention that emerged in large measure through the exchange of space and time, i.e. the one and the many. It was not always this way. The biennial form emerged primarily in the nineteenth century in response to the Puritan revival of the common good, which was ushering in a new &quot;worldly&quot; form of worship: the Christian god. The nineteenth-century impulse to the common good (read: the common good) was combined with a particular inclination towards the surveying of territory: the acquisition of natural resources, the maintenance of infrastructure, the management of publics, the policing of frontier regions. The biennial, in its various guises, was one of the few institutions capable of providing the public with the goods and services that the public was seeking – the means of communication, cultural experiences, festivals, etc. – in a manner that were not subject to direct public control.</text>

But while the collision of massive data-collecting apparatuses with ever more precise means reshapes every aspect of urban life in the metropolis, a certain amount of artistic and curatorial intervention is also required to establish the credibility of certain claims, such as the ones made by futurist Ray Kurzweil and his ​​Supporting the Future research project, which envisage a future in which travel is facilitated through the enhancement of urban infrastructure.[10]The challenge for contemporary art is to provide a space that is both accessible and deeply suggestive of the present, in such a way as to provoke a response from those who inhabit the city, but is also able to engage in critical reflection on contemporary urban problems and practices. It is an art of engagement, and a kind of conveying of the present, but also a kind of reconfiguration of the city that often contributes to its own destruction.So how might art and art’s social function</text>

However, the kind of architectural speculation mentioned above seems somewhat redundant with the current state of technological innovation and scale, and the emergence of new geographies and nationalisms. Moreover, given the right mix of historical and technological references, such a reimagining of the city – which for many people is just another way of existing in the aftermath of globalisation – can go beyond merely re-figuring it to envision a radically different mode of urban existence for many. Such a mode of urban existence for many would mean breaking apart the large urban structures of the global south, such as the huge imperial bureaucracies of Dubai and Hong Kong, and replacing them with smaller localised urban structures, such as the ‘Indian Colony’ of Hong Kong or the Chinese Taipei​s Bund’s Chinatown, both of which would be left</text>

The JW Marriott Marquis is the tallest building in Beijing and towers over the city, severing the city’s dense residential streets between two municipal skyscrapers. The futuristic form reflects the ever-expansion of global metainterfaces – a kind of geopolitical hegemonic vision of urbanity – that finds its contemporary in the economic crash of 2008. The reportage of economic collapse is frequently shown in major world art centres as a backdrop to aesthetic revivals of a certain kind, such as the ‘New Urban Adventures: Rise of the Metainterface’ or the ‘New Media Landscape: Debrowsing Reality’, both by Hanna Rosin. However, while these reports – which often give us a clear understanding of what is being claimed on a global basis – can provide a framework in which we can begin to question some of the more dominant claims to reality. - Andrew Goffes  Hegemony or Hegemonic Metainterfaces – a Trespassing Scenario for Our Times  (2014), translated by Jeff J Mitchell and Alexander Provan, is the essay prize winner of the Théodore Galland Foundation’s 2014 Thompson postgraduate journal, published in Le Devoir du Temps (Paris), on the thirtieth anniversary of the École Polytechnique in Lyon, France.

The reportage of economic collapse is frequently shown in major world art centres as a backdrop to aesthetic revivals of a certain kind, such as the ‘New Urban Adventures: Rise of the Metainterface’ or the ‘New Media Landscape: Debrowsing Global Scarcity’. But while the economic and financial collapse of western nations in 2008 forced a reorganisation of geopolitics, art now plays a prominent role in supporting that reorganisation, providing the intellectual scaffolding that western powers need to make the changes necessary to create new urban configurations and new global modes of economic interaction. - Culture malaise 	 rural: every time there is a setback in the march of technological progress, we hear the cry: hyper-localisation or ‘deep web’; new technological infrastructures and social media suggest new forms of urban inhabitation; and old ecological and urban problems are brought back into play in new technologies. But in the march of technological progress, we do not miss opportunities to re-imagine cities in the imagined forms of the future, nor do we waste energy creating speculative projects that cannot deliver tangible benefits to communities or the planet. If there are cities to come, they will have to come into co-</text>

The reportage of economic collapse is frequently shown in major world art centres as a backdrop to aesthetic revivals of a certain kind, such as the ‘New Urban Adventures: Rise of the Metainterface’ or the ‘New Media Landscape: Debrowsing the Postmedia’, both of which were suggested as exhibition responses to the economic and financial quagmires gripping the planet in the wake of the crisis. The JW Marriott Marquis is no exception to this general rule. It continues to build new ways of being in and within the metropolis, to absorb the urbanity that has been taken up by the new technology that it inherits.I say this as someone who has been living in New York for six months, and who has yet to be offered a hotel in the city. I don’t have any particular feelings about New York, just as I don’t have any particular feelings about LA. My main interest in the city is in the form of its hotels – places to stay while you wait for a table – and in the form of its streets, which are becoming increasingly artless and vacillating, and which are being turned into a kind of carriageway by the ever-present development</text>

The reportage of economic collapse is frequently shown in major world art centres as a backdrop to aesthetic revivals of a certain kind, such as the ‘New Urban Adventures: Rise of the Metainterface’ or the ‘New Media Landscape: Debrowsing Informants’ that accompanied the financial crisis. But many commentators, including myself, have pointed out that the financial crisis also seeded contemporary and pervasive social and ecological crises that greatly affect not only the financial but also the social life and physical form of cities. The global ecological crisis that emerged during the crisis of 2008 is being played out across urban landscapes and classifying bodies of water, mountains and sea – the oceans constituting the basis for a kind of planetary register. The planetary register is being made up of very particular features and behaviours, with the cities constituting the spaces where these particular features and behaviours take root and become culturally significant. The global ecological crisis that emerged during the crisis of 2008 is being played out across all of these kinds of spatial forms – landscape, urban, rural, along with the connected micro-spatial forms that constitute the ‘urbanisation’ of the planet.  A micro-spatialised planetary register is the point where particular cultural practices intersect with particular kinds</text>

But often, that is not the main thrust of the exhibitionary focus, as in the case of notable contemporary artworks such as Damien Hirst’s (2012) in Dock Square, London, or the exhibition ‘New Media Monuments’, featuring works by Cindy Sherman and Scot Shields, which followed in quick succession in the wake of the financial crisis in the USA, both in Doha, Qatar, in early 2009.1. Excerpt from a talk, ‘Technologies of Empire: AI and Its Aftermath', delivered by Prof. Martin Bellamy for the symposium ‘Imperial Assemblages: Futures of Empire’ organised by the Royal Academy of Arts in June 2013.

But while in recent decades the form has become part of a generalised aestheticisation of destructiveness (despite the grim reapers of the ‘metainterface’), the destruction it produces is different from imagining it as an inevitable by-product of economic development. - James Howard Kunstler,  	Signal Traffic, page 221. The destruction of the infrastructural ‘legacy’ is a global commons, shared by all urban-dwelling species – and has been for quite some time now – and yet is largely ignored or unmentioned. But it is destroying at an unprecedented rate, as the global economy shifts towards ever more energy-intensive forms of urbanity. The infrastructural ‘legacy’ is undergoing a metainterface that can no longer be supported by the infrastructural workforce, which is about to be massively mechanised and replaced by new articulated</text>
