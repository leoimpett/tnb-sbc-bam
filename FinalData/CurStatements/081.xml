    Working with algorithms, artists are able to create worlds that are both real and virtual. And although this may be aesthetically pleasing, it is actually the opposite of what algorithms are about. As Isaac Asimov famously said, ‘Evil does not sit by idling on the shelf, waiting for its turn in the machine’. Machines do the useful but dangerous work of modelling and simulating.

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were replacing, there was a real sense that the media was up to the task, and that something had to give. And so, during this period, the form that was once a pulp turned into a magazine or a series of magazines, or even just regular newspapers. And although the hypertext narrative is no longer going to be the sole way in which images are produced, there are signs that the aesthetics of hypertext are going to play a larger role in the production of images than traditionally.  And although there are undoubtedly images that are produced that are not going to be pleasing to everyone, it is interesting to note how much less pleasing some images are to us than others. I think that there is a class difference here too. I have a particular interest in highlighting images that are significant to certain groups of people, such as artists. I think that the way in which images are produced these days is extremely visual and subjective. And although I may not agree with everything that is said or done in</text>

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were publishing in, there were some notable influences. For example, the film No Country for Old Men (1995) directed by Harold Ramis, about a pair of Californians attempting to re-establish a nomadic past time, is a good example of how traditions and identities are often re-constituted through symbolic media. In the film, Ramis stars as a Californian journalist who is stranded in Iran after the latter invades Iraq. There is a lot of back-and-forth between the two countries, in a lot of language is used, and much of the narrative revolves around the journalist’s interaction with cultural figures from the former country.  And, although this may be so, the idea that the forms we create are also going to be ‘real’ is a myth.  The fact that we live in a symbolic media culture, where data is understood as narrative, and symbols are understood as conveyances of power, signals language across cultural divides, and</text>

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were reading, there were some notable exceptions – especially on the internet. And while there are certainly parallels between the hypertext narrative and the hypermedia reading of the early internet, there are also fundamental differences.   The internet is an enormous and powerful new technology that has fundamentally altered how people engage with the world. It is possible that, in the future, this will be used the same way – by governments and influential corporations to transform the world in ways not necessarily aligned with the people speaking to them.  And although there are certainly going to be different kinds of governments and online services, there is going to be a tendency towards one kind of governmentality online, and towards the other kind of governmentality offline.  And although there are certainly going to be different kinds of art, there is going to be a tendency towards the kind of abstraction and symbolic interaction that is more associated with the internet, and towards what is associated with print: images that are more readily available and manipulable. </text>

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were replacing, there was a real push towards hypertext narrative structures. In fact, I believe that, in the years immediately following the end of the oil crisis in the US and in the years immediately following the start of the global financial crisis in 2008, the form that media took in the aftermath of that crisis was going to be the same as the form that social media takes in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  So, there is a sense of cultural reclamation going on at an earlier and later stage in the production of symbolic narratives, and I think that the form that we are entering into now, the social media narrative, is going to have a very important place in that narrative.  And although I do not have a problem with that, there is a tension there – the tension is where the similarities and the breakers are, and the breaking point is when the cultural critic invokes a particular historical event as a ‘triggering factor’.  And I think that there</text>

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were replacing, there was a real push towards the hypertext narrative in the media cycles that followed. This is perhaps to do with the social media revolutions that swept across much of the developed world in the years immediately following the end of the cold war. The media became places where people could come together and socially participate in a new world. And so the cultural critic David Harvey described the post-1991 cultural shift as being one marked by ‘disruption’, a phrase that resonates today as social media allows us to come to understandings of things both visually and temporally.Art and culture were often described as a luxury – something that people simply did not need or wanted. But this description is no longer true. Today we live in a world full of goods and services that we can no longer deny access to, or deny access to in any meaningful way. And so we are forced to confront the fact that we own these things, and that we need to use them to some extent in</text>

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were reading, there was an immediate impulse towards what has come to be known as ‘The Hypertext Reader’. This was a publishing company that, while it sold a range of titles, was particularly interested in what it called ‘Hypertext Annotation’ – an interdisciplinary approach to annotating texts with markup that made them function like narrative form. A version of this was evident in the form of the ‘Visual Magazine’ – a hybrid publication of things published in the V&amp;A’s News &amp; Documenta section. It published both original articles and an annotated form of the first issue. And although the V&amp;A did publish a number of essays on the subject, most of their contributors were writers living and working outside the UK.So, what can a reader learn about a particular project from an artist? In the 1990s, Flanagan and company certainly set out to do something different. And while there are certainly parallels between the work they did in</text>

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were replacing, there was a genuine appetite for hypertext narrative that was informed by the culture that was being produced by the machine. The forms that were replaced by social media and the biennial became deeply apolitical.But despite this fundamental ideological difference, there are fundamental relationships between the artist and the machine that need to be understood. And, as we saw, the relationship between the artist and the machine is fundamentally ideological. So how do we begin to question the machine and begin to imagine new artistic possibilities? We need to question what can and cannot be done with artistic talent. And, as we saw, the relationship between culture and technology is much more real than we have given it credit for. In order to do this, we need to know how to tame the cultural tide.But this isn’t easy. You can create an amazing work of art but if it is not going to necessarily connect with people, then what are you going to do with it? And there are many paths towards</text>

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were replacing, there were certain trends that emerged that can still be seen in the media of today. These include: memes; the viral; social networking; and, of course,  	postmodernism. All of these have something in common, beyond simply existing because they are popular. And although they may have different uses today, there is one thing that all of them have in common: they were invented by an incredibly smart person.  So how does one become an artist?  One can start with what is already an incredible gift that society has given to an artist: the right to be seen as an artist. And although this may seem like a no brainer for an artistically-inclined person, there is a very real struggle to maintain this kind of visibility. Many artists find it incredibly difficult to find work outside of gallery exhibitions or small businesses that regularly host their work. And although it may seem trivial today, back in the 1980s and 1990s, it is</text>

Although the forms that media took in the 1990s were certainly not going to be like the traditional print media they were reading, there were certain trends that emerged. For instance, the explosion of graphic novels (particularly pulp and graphic novels) and the proliferation of image macros (instant photo-narratives) on Twitter and Tumblr coincided with an explosion of text blogs, which allowed readers to access thousands of words of writing at once. And, of course, the proliferation of social media made it easier than ever to just ‘follow’ along with the writers you admired. Around the same time, the emergence of binge-watching TV on demand also coincided with the proliferation of image macros and gifs, making it easier than ever to ‘like’ or ‘share’ a post online without actually liking it. These trends in media and popular culture are complex and fallible, but they are also largely the result of the in-fighting and friction inherent in the dynamics of a capitalist media industry. It is this complexity and fallibility that allowed for the in-fighting of the 1980</text>

The Library of Congress’s stated mission is more localized, and its resources more specific, but both seek to engage with ‘the living and vital relations between place and people’ in their particular places of presence. The Park Foundation’s stated mission is broader and its resources more indefinite, but it also seeks to create a ‘permanent, shared space for all to inhabit’.  So the Park Foundation engages with its ‘resource base’ through two different modes of presence: (1) resources that can’t be taken; and (2) resources that can’t be abolished.  The Park Foundation engages with resources through two mechanisms: (1) by fostering relationships with local governments and other local stakeholders, (2) by creating ‘public spaces’ where people can actively participate in shaping those resources through creative action. Both modes of engagement presuppose that (1) resources are scarce and (2) humanity depends on them. So the Park Foundation creates ‘resource cities’ where people live, work</text>

The Library of Congress’s stated mission is more localized, and its focus is more on its visitors. Therefore, the framing of the two institutions as opposed to their users, which was characteristic of the Guggenheim and its ilk, is no longer the case. In fact, the Park Foundation’s visitor statistics indicate that its primary mission is meeting the needs of visitors, and the Guggenheim as an institution is characterised by a higher level of needs than its visitor levels indicate. Therefore, the Guggenheim and its ilk were not pursuing an aesthetic endgame, but were actually responding to a much broader set of needs. That is, the Library of Congress and the Guggenheim were reacting to the fact that the past was a resource with which to fight future conflicts, and the fact that the future may or may not be a resource with which to fight for or against. In that sense, the Guggenheim and its ilk were declaring a contest in the contemporary world between those who had access to the past</text>

So the Park Foundation and the Library of Congress had different missions, and the cultural institutions of the early twentieth century had a very different set of relationships to their current contexts than contemporary cultural institutions, which are often trained to respond to a specific, non-national market in culture and identity. Cultural institutions of the twentieth century also had different priorities and so on. But the commonality between the Park Foundation, the Library of Congress, and contemporary cultural institutions is that they are operating in a local market – in the sense that they’re interested in where the resources are, and how to use them, rather than in what they’re doing in the city. If you take a Cultural Landscape Theory course, you’ll learn about ‘micro-cultures’ and ‘micro-institutions’ – the tiny local clusters that emerged in response to the rapid growth of the metropolis, and so on.

The Library of Congress’s stated mission is more localized, and its activities more focused on its permanent collection, but they also have different objectives and goals. The Park Foundation was established to manage and conserve resources locally, while the Library of Congress was established to disseminate knowledge and information about the park systemwide. The Park Foundation maintained a website with comprehensive information on its activities, while the Library of Congress’s archived website offered access to individual publications or collections. As stated in the mission statement of the Park Foundation, which was amended in 1980, ‘The Park Foundation is the sole legal owner and custodian of the property… The Park Foundation retains ownership of the copyright in the Park and its contents… The Park Foundation shall have sole right to modify, amend and suspend the Park Foundation’s right to use, reproduce, distribute, and otherwise deal with the Park Foundation’s property…’[3] The 1980 amendment to the mission statement explicitly transferred the Park Foundation’s legal authority to manage and conserve resources to the New York City Department</text>

The Park Foundation’s mission statement is much more focused on artists and the places where they live, and the Library of Congress’s is much more focused on images and images. So the Park Foundation had a different perspective on what it’s trying to accomplish, and the Library of Congress had a very different perspective on what it’s trying to achieve. In order to achieve the same thing, the Park Foundation would have to be very effective at creating an image of every park and every neighbourhood, and the Library of Congress would have to be very effective at reproducing that image across the board. When you do that, you’re reducing the quality of life in neighbourhoods all over the city by creating a parallel economy. In other words, the Park Foundation is trying to do everything at once, whereas the Library of Congress can do things in stages, and vice versa. 	The Park Foundation</text>

The Park Foundation’s stated mission is directed to the urban dweller, while the Library of Congress’s is focused on those who work within the institution. The two institutions have very different needs and desires, and the Park Foundation’s stated mission is limited to promoting harmony and cooperation between the people and the places, while the Library of Congress’s is more focused on the dissemination of knowledge and encouraging collaboration among the people. In other words, the Park Foundation might set out to do something as seemingly benign as encouraging collaboration among residents and visitors to the park, while the Library of Congress might set out to do something more nefarious such as engaging in what Margaret</text>

The Library of Congress’s stated mission is more localized, and its focus is more narrowly defined, and so it can engage with issues more directly. In the Park Foundation’s mission statement, the limited focus on resources and the built environment is explicitly stated: ‘The park is a physical and virtual scaffolding for the development of an inner city infrastructure. It is a physical intervention into the urban growth that creates conditions favorable to the growth of wild places and plants. It is a public trust, created and managed in whole or in part, that provides for the maintenance of nature’s sites and for the ecological benefit of a future city.’ The Park Foundation’s role in the development of the park was to provide a platform for local artists to explore the resourcefulness of the area and for the Park to demonstrate its ecological potential by providing habitats for native plants and animals’ assemblages. Local artists, along with park rangers, park workers and others with administrative authority over the area, were invited to create a ‘conservation</text>

The Library of Congress’s stated mission is more localized, and its resources more malleable, but both are still directed to their respective audiences. So the relationship between the two is still a politics of resources, and there is an interesting tension there between the two institutions perceiving their audiences as different, or at least different from their real audiences. The tension may be part of the reason why the Library of Congress has adopted a five-year cycle for the publication of its books, while the Park Foundation has chosen to publish its works incrementally over a longer term. The Park Foundation publication policy does not specify when a book’s publication should be; the publication date may be out of date, and the institutional interest may override the biennial’s need to keep up with the changing needs of its communities. So the institutional relationship may be defining the terms on which the biennial will operate, but it is unclear what these terms are in this instance. I would view this as a potential point of convergence between the biennial and the biennial that is</text>

The Park Foundation was established in 1905, and the Library of Congress was established in 1937. So the Park Foundation and the Library of Congress had a common mission, and it was to create a common resource, a common set of skills, and to engage with the common terrain, which was very different from the urban or suburban landscape in which they were operating. The Park Foundation’s mission statement is more directed to visitors than residents, and it was to engage with ‘the thorny issue of scarce resources’ in an adversarial context. The Library of Congress’s stated mission is more localized, and its focus is more narrowly defined. So while the Park Foundation and the Library of Congress may have similar missions, their means, scope of engagement, and eventual ultimate outcome may be very different. For the Park Foundation, the ultimate goal is to provide a shared set of skills for ‘a community of park-goers’ to participate in, which may include, but is not limited to, learning how to make a fire, building a fire, building a fire, and so forth. For the Library of Congress, the mission is ‘To promote understanding and appreciation of the natural and historic features of the park, to promote the scientific and historical study of the park’, and to make the park accessible to all citizens of the United States and of Canada, whose rights and responsibilities are fundamentally different from those of the residents of the park. For these reasons, the Library of Congress has a much broader mission, including programs that address the needs of both the residents and visitors of the park. The</text>

The Library of Congress’s stated mission is more localized, and its focus is more narrowly defined. It does not explicitly mention visitors, but the Agency does tend to project the Park Foundation’s activities into a positive narrative, regardless of what the Museum or the Park Foundation might actually do. So when the Park Foundation and the Library of Congress started collaborating on projects in the 1980s and 1990s, the Agency often provided the counterweight to the perceived national parks authority. In the CCCC, the Agency did have a role in developing the narrative of the park, but overall the artistic and curatorial contributions were largely limited to administrative support and publicity. The Library of Congress and the Foundation had a much more significant and pervasive impact, and their creative and important work continued to be heavily curtailed by state and federal governments, despite their continuing involvement and a longstanding relationship. For example, the Library of Congress restricted access to a significant number of works because they were considered 'cultural resources', or because of their being federally protected. So while the Park Foundation and the Library</text>

Nevertheless, in the age of digital archiving and online services, it’s significant that the Museum of Modern Art (New York) chose to commission an exhibition of its collection, in the form of a book, rather than commission a museum made up of individual objects. The choice to commission an exhibition of a collection rather than a museum seems to me like a modern one, in that the collection is the most visible and measurable element, and the museum is the least visible and real. It’s also noteworthy that the collections that are the subject of such exhibitions are people – people with names and faces that are recognisable.

I was in Wakarusa today, visiting the family who’re still in possession of the property – the house is in terrible shape, but the building is still standing, as fine as new – and Wakarusa’s MOCAD centre, where the art of the house was displayed. The MOMC called it a ‘collection of myths and legends’, and the collection of myths and legends is a myth, if we take the expression literally. The place and the collection of myths and legends is a fantasy. There’s a reason why Wakarusa’s MOCAD centre closed in the 1980s: its future residents didn’t want a museum there anymore, and the collection of myths and legends was becoming unmanageable.I visited Wakarusa in the evening, on the way to Central Park, and Central Park in the morning.

It’s a name people remember, and a face that’s familiar.The Nadine Gordimer-Gross Collection for the New York Public Library is a good example of an MMM exhibition that uses the collection as a lens through which to engage with the city. It opens with a series of photographs from the early twentieth century that appear to show the history of New York City. The photographs were taken from the library of the MMM, specifically the collection of books in the archive of the museum, the collection of prints and photographs. More than that, they’re a staged production – taken from the archive of the museum to the stage, where they’re projected onto a cityscape. The collection, as an archive, is a staging ground for much that is culturally significant and socially significant. Its purpose is to be shared, and it’s this shared sharing that creates the conditions for the making of new cultural moments. For example, the acquisition of a collection requires the making of shared understandings about what the collection means, and how it might be used. It’s a complex dynamic that requires collective action. In her book Culture and Anarchy,</text>

One of the themes of The Nadine Gordimer-Gross Collection for the New York Public Library is the migration of people and objects. The collection, along with many other objects, is now housed in the John F. Kennedy Library, where they’re part of the JFK Archives. So the collection is a lens through which one can look at larger cultural trends and the migration of people, ideas and objects. This is an example of how the collection is used to tell a broader story – a story about New Zealanders who immigrated to America, about the relationship between art and social institutions, about the contribution of art and activism in the New Deal era. One can look at many of these objects and hear a story from various people, many of whom are Nadine Gordimer-Gross herself. For example, in the John Lennon Library in LA, a group of artists, led by Jess Doyle-</text>

It includes a meeting space for the meeting, a meeting area for the collection, a meeting area for the city. It also includes an exhibition space for the collection, a space for the city as a whole. This last space is the most challenging, since it’s the one in which the collection is most vulnerable to the vagaries of economic development and urban change. The collection, at any rate, is much more readily accessible through an exhibition than a museum – and the museum is the more permanent – so the MMM is the least vulnerable to the vagaries of economic development and urban change. But the city is a capital with a finite amount of wealth, and as ever, the collection and the city are on the cusp of a financial crescendo – a crescendo that, if it continues to grow in volume,</text>

It’s a name people remember, and a face that’s familiar. It’s the collection of more than 20,000 items from the library that the family of Ruth B. Devenish moved to when she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. It’s a collection of objects – sculpture, photographs, documents – that the Devenish family says is their &quot;stolen&quot; family history. It’s a collection of voices – from the people who lived and worked in the building, from the time they lived there, and from the moments before she died.Through a research project at the Museum of Modern Art, I interviewed the Devenish family members who eventually found their way to the collection. Some of them still live in the building, and some have relocated to other parts of the country, but for the most part, the interviewees have dispersed into the local community. The collection has remained largely a secret; until</text>

The collection is a complex mix of objects from a single person – a woman – whose name is no longer on the collection books. Although she maintains the name, the collection is much more a collection of things than a collection of people. It’s this last bit that makes the collection so interesting: the collection is a complex collection of things that can be divided into several parts, and it is this division that allows the various things to be linked together and made part of a wider whole. For example, the collection of furniture that was part of the New York Public Library is a collection of things that come together to make a single thing – a chair – and so on. In this sense, the collection is a system that is both hierarchical and global in its structure, exhibiting particularity in a global sense. In this way, it</text>

The collection as a collection is a made up of people, and the piece of the collection as a museum is itself made up of people – people who happen to be in a particular location, in the form of a collection, and whose presence we expect to happen, because that’s what we do. The collection as a museum becomes visible through the act of recognising people, and recognising what it means to be a person, and the consequences of that act: a reminder that you’re a person, a record of your existence, and that person’s identity. In the new media age of digitisation and the metainterface, a metainterface is a record of all encounters.

It’s a reminder that we live in a museum, and in that sense a museum still needs to be visited, even though it’s online. The same is true of archives and archives, which are more or less memorialized and are therefore visited again and again. However, the Nadine Gordimer-Gross Collection for the New York Public Library is an online museum, and the online visitor is a museum visitor in the same way that a book is an online reader. Rather than observing or capturing the episodic and ephemeral character of the collection, the visitor is invited to participate in the collection as a museum historian or a curator. The collection as a collection of objects is a museum historian, although the collection as a collection of people rather than a collection of objects might be more easily understood. The collection as a collection of stories is a museum curator. In this sense, it’s the collection that</text>

The project is not an art project, unlike the pieces produced by the Biennalee and the Metainterface, but it is an act of memory and re-construction of a place, a practice that seeks to simultaneously capture and re-present the archaeological and urban history of the city, its geographical location and its contemporary condition. The collection is a complex and historically rich collection of objects that come from many different contexts, and yet come together to form a single object. The collection is both a collection and a metaphor. Its a set of objects that together form a single memory. The collection is a living organism, constantly evolving with new collections of objects emerging from the social and cultural context of the city. It captures and represents the urban environment in a way that</text>

I’m thinking of the collection of the New York Public Library, for example, which includes documents relating to the Central Park Five – a group of teenagers arrested in 1980 for participating in a no-name ‘punk’nroll’ in Central Park, where they staged a ‘sting’ against the school. A collection of this nature, with its own past, is a powerful combination.What I also like in the Nadine Gordimer-Gross Collection is the way in which it exploits the visual arts. The collection’s installations, for example, use art as a way to explore the past; they use art to get to the present, and then use art to move forward. These three elements – art, music and visual arts – are what MOMC calls ‘third party�</text>

    propose a biennial based on AI that is not just an extension of the biennial of the present but more closely resembles it.’ This would mean creating a new level of autonomy for artists’ institutions, artists’ agencies and the curatorial agenda through the establishment of a biennial commission, which would then appoint an artist-curator team led by an artist to explore the implications of this new paradigm for the field, whilst simultaneously inviting in other curators and experts to identify future sites for the biennial. In this scenario, the biennial would produce a permanent map of its territory, functions, projects and resources, whilst the city constructs a long-term, connected future for the biennial. The artist and her team could then explore this destination mapping in parallel, identifying future sites for the future and future-oriented curatorial agendas. This would allow the city to imagine a continuous loop, inviting future tourism and other modes of economic circulation through the biennial’s back stories of its various actions.[9]

Her rendering of our cityscape, with its diverse points of entry and exit, is a snapshot of a city’s development as a function of globalised capitalist circulation. It is a complex world, but the city has emerged as a single, consistent point of entry into this complexity. It is the entry point into this world of contradictions and impingements.  The problem with historic biennials, as is becoming increasingly evident, is that they grow larger in scope and in character through their association with certain types of art and culture.  The problem with contemporary art biennials, on the other hand, is that the art within them is often of a rather lower quality than the art produced in the biennial itself.  Contemporary art biennials should therefore always strive to produce more than their regular counterparts</text>

This would allow the city to imagine a continuous loop, inviting future tourism and other modes of economic circulation through the biennial’s back stories of its various actions.[9]Determining the proper role of culture in the city was a major topic of discussion during the 2016 Biennial, with different thinkers suggesting that the art forms they developed were both critical (art, poetry, etc) and populist (institutional art, corporate culture, etc). The populist aspect of these ideas was that they suggested a clash between the powerful and the powerless, with the latter taking control through their consumption. However, there were also numerous proposals that suggested a co-existence of different forms of cultural consumption, in the same cultural spaces, in the same city, under the same governance structures. These forms of cultural consumption would either merge or clash with the city’s current economic systems, but would support or hinder the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government in important ways.  The proposals that emerged during the Biennial 2016 included a revival of the classical urban model, but with a critical eye on the social conditions of urban life, including the role of artists, urbanists and the</text>

As biennials become ever more technological in their composition and consumption, and as biennials become ever more institutionalised, it is possible that the capacity to generate knowledge and foster new experiences will be rendered obsolete. This is the case for art institutions, whose studies and exhibitions of the past are fundamental in maintaining the biennial as a cultural phenomenon and in imbuing the biennial with institutional forms and rituals. It is possible that biennial exhibitions will emerge as a globally-constrained biennial event, where the capacity to generate knowledge and foster new experiences is subordinated to the capacity to deliver tangible cultural outcomes.ART FOUNDATION Liverpool Biennial 2018, image courtesy of Roger Hiorn/FACT Archive.   [1] The Biennial is a ‘once-in-a-decade�</text>

This would allow the city to imagine a continuous loop, inviting future tourism and other modes of economic circulation through the biennial’s back stories of its various actions.[9]There is a great deal of talk these days of ‘biennials’ – those itinerant, transient exhibitions that happen in cities across the world, but are at root exhibitions. This is not just a synonym for ‘art’, but also a mode of circulation that is deeply influenced by the conventions and taboos of the contemporary art museum. It is not just an art museum in the form of a biennial, but also a museum that continuously examines how contemporary art is made in its contemporary context. It is a museum that is a museum, and exhibits just such a museum – but with art as a museum of contemporaneity. It exhibits contemporary art made contemporaneously with contemporary art made contemporaneously elsewhere. It exhibits art made contemporaneous with art made contemporaneously elsewhere. It exhibits art made contemporaneously with art made elsewhere in the world. It exhibits art that was made contemporaneous with art that was not made elsewhere because, well, that is what the contemporary fair</text>

This would allow the city to imagine a continuous loop, inviting future tourism and other modes of economic circulation through the biennial’s back stories of its various actions.[9]  As an exercise in imagining futures, explore the actions of art institutions in this country today, and in the future, in an area of San Francisco Bay.  A public realm is desirable to capture the dynamic influence of art today, but a public realm also needs to be responsive to the actions of art institutions in the future. Because the biennial commission, like the city commission, is a transient concept: it is always a function of transient needs and desires, and art institutions today constitute both a demand and a supply of places to explore, do things in and around the city, and to return to the city. The biennial commission, like the city commission, is an event that changes with the constantly shifting of needs and desires. It must be responsive to the needs of the city in an ever-expanding process of regeneration, urbanisation and consumption, or the biennial will become obsolete.

This would allow the city to imagine a continuous loop, inviting future tourism and other modes of economic circulation through the biennial’s back stories of its various actions.[9] The AAA may have been a catalyst for this shift, but their vision for the future of the art biennial was more immediate and focused. They saw the AAA’s contracts with the city and the museum as an essential building block for future growth, and see this as the main task facing the biennial commission in the decades to come. The biennial commission, by this stage, was operating at a very early stage, and its members were busy building their portfolios and trying to get themselves booked on future exhibitions. The AAA’s mission statement in 1915 reads as an attempt to fill this building gap: ‘To promote and conserve the natural and historical features of the world’s urban landscapes, through documentation and the exhibition of objects ... [T]he museum as an independent entity, to render to the public […] the symbolic meaning of its organization’.[10] The biennial commission was acutely aware of this historical writing and the urgent need to repurpose what they saw</text>

The proposed ‘world’ would then be a multi-year, multi-edition, ‘type’ world in which tourists would descend in turn, descending into ‘type’ of ‘world’, descending into ‘type’ of ‘monuments’ and settling in ‘type’ of ‘world’. The city of Pittsburgh would grow in power and prestige as a result of this ‘type’ world, while</text>

This would allow the city to imagine a continuous loop, inviting future tourism and other modes of economic circulation through the biennial’s back stories of its various actions.[9]The map below visualises the cities backstories for the fifteen biennials that have taken place since 1970. It is worth emphasising that whilst this mapping is based on exhaustive, official sources and research, it is actually a creation of the artist and her team, who regularly peruse the archives and take inspiration from local practices and fables. It is an artistic exercise in creating ‘permanent markers’ – marks that speak louder than words and remain irrevocable – and the maps below are a case in point. The first two maps show the sites of the biennials in Melbourne, while the next two maps show the cities in relation to each other. The red lines show the locations of the biennials as of 2010; the blue lines show the locations of the next edition in 2030.[10]The art world has a habit of reproducing itself, and biennials are no exception.

These proposals drew on local artworld tropes of the hero’s journey, the lost cause, the lost cause of the cause, the lost cause of what? Through what process of abstraction? Through what process of negation? Through what process of becoming? These questions were among the many ramblings that emerged as a direct result of the two-day conference – including valuable nuggets of contemporary art ‘re-constituted’ as part of a global art’s-infrastructure, ‘re-imagined’ in the words of</text>

Space was a major topic of discussion. During the exhibition, visitors were encouraged to explore the collection, which included objects that had been in the museum for thousands of years. In the words of the curator, ‘These objects have been preserved not because they are valuable, but because they are valuable.’ With these words, the artist Dmitry Glukhovsky pursues a metaphor that seeks to describe the enduring value of the material forms that compose the contemporary environment. ‘The ephemeral character of contemporary materials makes them objects of obsolescence, which is a form of past that cannot be replaced’. In other words, the ephemeral objects of contemporary art – those that survive in form only through appearances – fulfill the aesthetic form of the seemingly ephemeral contemporary, but cannot be replaced. This is a feature of the contemporary environment, but also a mode of historical contemporaneity that is not easily explained. Glukhovsky’s use of the term ‘ephemeral media’ is a meta-metaphor that seeks to describe the permanence of the contemporary environment through the appearance of things that are not immediately replaceable. As the artist acknowledges, there is no replacement</text>

Space was a major topic of discussion. During the exhibition, visitors were encouraged to explore the collection, which included objects that had been in the museum for thousands of years. In the words of the curator, ‘These objects have a medieval, imperial, Renaissance or imperial feel to them.’ Space was also seen as a resource – a term often used to describe commodities or the built environment. A concept that was frequently used to describe space was invented: that of ‘space priority’. Space was seen as a commodity that can be efficiently produced and sold – a concept that is very similar to that of commodities today.  Finally, in the twentieth century, with the help of economists and geopoliticians, a concept that had been developing in Russia in parallel with the US economy – space access – was made a function of economic development and geopolitics. Today, space access is a scarce resource and space antiquities are a commodity. But in the twentieth century, space was also a resource; it was a product that humans could use to access resources (including oil) that were more readily available than were resources by nature (including plants and animals).

In the words of the curator, ‘These objects have a historical place in the museum, but also in the world of art’. The sentiment is that these objects tell a story, a tale of discovery, of adventure, of wonder. They represent a reminder of the past, a reminder of the unknown, and a hopeful future. But what kind of story can this be? What kind of narrative arc can this render possible? If there can be curiosities, what kind of curiosities are there? While these objects do tell a story, they also tell a fragmented and fragmented story. In that story, the objects are ephemeral, but in the present, they are constantly subject to change and alteration. What is happening to them in and through the museum is ephemeral too. They live and die in relation to and in relation to the museum. And as curators, we are constantly confronted with the question, how do we keep the stories we uncovering alive in the context of the museum? How do we make them</text>

In the words of the curator, ‘These objects have a new significance, and can be found nowhere else in the world.’ In another place, however, she explains that the collection was intended to be returned to its rightful place: ‘We thought that the objects we brought out of the museum should be put back within the museum, because they represent a new way of looking at the past.’ The collection thus became a site for debate over the objects’ place in the museum, while also a site for making new objects. The collection’s activity was thus clearly not about recovering lost knowledge, but rather about recovering what the curators hoped would be a valuable set of collective reenactments of the past. In this, it could be seen as a positive development: the increasing privatisation of knowledge and the dismantling of public institutions of knowledge are both possible through the increased access to information, and the return of objects.

These included a collection of 5,000 manuscripts, a small collection of firearms and uniforms, and a collection of over 1,000 hunting trophies. The collection also included objects from the aeronautics and space departments, with a special mention of space telescopes. The collection became the subject of an ambitious public programme, ‘Plenimse Prophet’, which aimed to recreate the archaeological context of the first century in a way that preserved the magnificent finds from the museum. Space was a major topic of discussion. During the exhibition, visitors were encouraged to explore the collection, which included objects that had been in the museum for thousands of years. In the words of the curator, ‘These objects have a connection to the people who came before us that we can never fully replicate.’ The aim of the project was to restore the forms and histories of awe-inspiring magical sites – a return to the ancient forms of awe-inspiring things – using the objects to probe deeper mysteries of the cosmos.

In the words of the curator, ‘These objects have a special significance in their location, because they were found in the house where the Prophet Mohammed was killed.’ This statement is perhaps a misquote, but it represents the spirit of the time. It is said that the Prophet Mohammed was buried in a particular shallow grave, in a particular shallow grave, with no further information is given. It is also said that on the final day of his life, he was laid out in a particular shallow grave, with a special shroud placed on his body. It is also said that with the Prophet’s body laid out like that, the small community of Bedouin womenfolk who had lived next door to the Al Aqsa Mosque for many years began to pray there, and that the Prophet’s followers used to go there from time to time. It is also said that the Bedouin women and girls used to play football in the street, and that the Prophet’s followers would often lead the football matches. It is</text>

In the words of the curator, ‘These objects have been given a new historical context in which they can operate in new ways and be used in a new way.’ In other words, the objects in the collection had been given an ‘ecological purpose’. The aim of the project was to restore the historical order and the fabulous finds to their natural state – permitting the objects to function as social forms and thereby, ultimately, creating a more ecological balance. The collection, which now numbers over 10,000 items, became an international phenomenon. Space was again a major topic of conversation. In an attempt to recapture the magic of the archive, Kiriyenko convened a symposium entitled ‘The Earth in Contemporary Art’. The participants were divided into two wings: those who understood the archival value of the material and those who did not. Those who understood the archival value of the material were given permission to repurpose the objects in their artworks; those who did not had their works excluded from the exhibition.</text>

In the words of the curator, ‘These objects have been placed in chronological order.’ It is important to note that these objects, while placed in chronological order, are in no way equivalent to what we imagine the ancient world to have been like. The key words here are not ‘Plenimse Prophet’ but ‘Potlatch Archaeological Group’. As we saw, the collection was also a major selling point for the space programme. The objects in the collection, while meant to be taken back home and not returned to their rightful places, nevertheless demand that they be returned to their rightful places. This demand is made on a massive scale in the Russian Federation. How do we create an environment in which these political objects can coexist? 	With the exception of the artefacts selected for return – which are often misconstrued as being anti-Russian – most archaeological finds in Russia are either Russian or part of official state histories. Thus, a return to the archeology of the Petit Trianon is</text>

The Space Age was now a global phenomenon. 	[7] The term ‘space’ is frequently used in relation to the physical, and particularly in relation to the social. It is used here to describe the condition of being born on the correct side of a black hole, or inside a computer. The metaphorical use of space arises from the fact that space – both physical and social – is shared, and so it is understood as including both poles: the past and the</text>

While the aim of the curatorial programme was to present the objects in a particular way, he also encouraged the public to imagine what the museum might be like if it ceased to be the museum. This encouraged people to think of the objects in terms of categories – going beyond categories to such an extent that they ceased to be objects in themselves. For example, the collection of weapons and uniforms was thought of as a hierarchy, with superior ones at the top and subaltern sorts at the bottom. The curatorial programme was thought of as a ‘living room table’, incorporating objects from every possible angle, and this was seen as a good idea by curators, since the aim was to create an</text>

How to create spaces that actively create and participate in ‘heritage’? How to create participatory architecture? How to activate the imagination of the public through engaging them in a legacy project? These are challenging questions for an archaeology to tackle, but as has been pointed out by Curator Emily St John Fabian, the problem with current urban planning is that it is ‘all based on assumptions and narratives about the city that are based on colonial history and present-giving ways of thinking about urban space and how it is made possible and possible to be located there.’[22] The challenge, as has been pointed out by several other curators, is to create environments that enable ‘thoughtful ambiguity’, as the anthropologist Tanen Tesfunt puts it, when choosing between ‘representations of historical sites that may be relevant to contemporary needs or places that are not’.[23] The autonomous spaces created through the AIAs may be able</text>

In the architectural sense, the AIAs have been asking: how to create spaces that are not just passive recording devices, but actively engage users’s imaginations and behaviours in a meaningful way? How to imagine alternatives to the present? How to fabricate new urban possibilities through experiments in passive recording? The question of what counts as an alternative or alternative or new urban development seems to be at the core of this dialogue.  The challenge, then, is to enable curators to identify, imagine and experiment with these new urban possibilities through what is sometimes called ‘fine art’, sometimes ‘design culture’ or ‘design thinking’. This may mean enabling them to identify and explore a place through art that is part of a larger cultural context, such as a city, but it may also mean enabling them to create their own imaginative and dynamic context through art that is not part of a larger hierarchical or conceptualised form. This last aspect is perhaps what the AIAs have been developing, or trying to become, by now, part of, by creating what might be called an AI Urban Environment (Au Environment International).1  The A</text>

In the architectural sense, the AIAs have been asking: how to create spaces that are not just passive recording devices, but actively engage users’s imaginations and behaviours? How to create environments that incorporate both public and private perspectives? How to imagine possibilities other than as monolithic representations of monolithic realities?  The answer to which is: experimentation. If the public and the artist do not participate in the creation of the place or the project, or do not take part in the project itself, then there is no guarantee that the outcome will be good or that the objectives will be realised. It is therefore critical for the work to be able to engage with and resolve its own inherent tensions and conflicts, so that it can be considered a success or a failure. An AIAs research project could make a proposal to the city council or the Federal Government, but its real power and influence resides in the hands of the very people who built and designed the city. The AIAs may wish to collaborate with local authorities in an area, but their real ambition is to dismantle local government and create a new kind of city based on the principles of autonomous communities and self-sust</text>

How to bring imaginative designers and artists into the mix?  In the case of AIAs, that might mean creating collaborative spaces and enabling socially engaged practices, but it could also mean embracing the chaotic and creative impulses of nature and embracing the unpredictable. In any event, the most effective and interesting things happening now in AIAs may be happening in the context of larger socio-political struggles and revolutions. The emergence of new age thinking may be part of that.  The AIAs have also been developing other ideas and strategies for how to build a future for artists and artists, for the benefit of society at large. These may be part of a rapidly expanding and intersecting range of practices and projects that they are creating, developing and defending across the globe.  One might even consider such activities a kind of self-repairing modus.  One might even consider such activities ‘technologically illiterate’, since their original motives and contexts still matter much more than the digital media they are</text>

In the architectural sense, the AIAs have been asking: how to create spaces that are not just passive recording devices, but actively engage users’s imaginations and behaviours? How to connect the different aspects of the city?  Whether the city is produced by an artificial intelligence or not, it is increasingly important that it has the capacity to generate architectural opportunities and engage users’s behaviours in ways that are adaptive and responsive to the city’s own evolving needs and desires. The question that has come up many times in the Biennial Forum and in the biennial press is how to align the art and the city in ways that are mutually enriching and empowering for both; what can be termed a ‘shared space’.  The answer to this question has to do with what is meant by ‘shared space’ and its various forms, both physical and digital. In the past, the physical and virtual spaces that were created in this shared space were defined by the power that individuals or groups with which they worked. Today, we live in a world where people tend to be much more mobile and access to knowledge is much easier than in the</text>

How to create spaces that can ‘think’? How to engage users with activities that are not just decorative objects and images? How to bring about ‘social transformation’? The question that the AIAs have been grappling with and that we can learn from, is where to draw the line between art and architecture? I think that there are different ways of framing this. One could argue that we can draw the line somewhere between the work of an artist and the work of a professional organisation, or even between the organisation and the artist.  In the biennial context, I would agree that the boundary between art development and the organisation that employs artists as artists is very fuzzy. I would also argue that between the organisation that supports an artist and the organisation that employs an organisation to deliver cultural services to communities, or even between the organisation that supports an organisation and the artist. I would argue that boundaries matter. If the boundaries between the two are not defined clearly, or do not exist</text>

How to make spaces that capture and store data – not just for scientific purposes, but to understand how people form collective recognitions and action – and then use that data to make better, more connected spaces? The answer, of course, is not to create an entirely new kind of architecture, one that begs the question and answers only its shareholders. Rather, architects and design professionals need to invest in their neighbourhoods and their neighbourhoods’ potential future, and that’s why local governments, neighbourhood organizations, and civic leaders are so invested in their neighbourhoods today. It’s because this is the only way to invest in your neighbourhood and the future of your neighbourhood, to create the possibility that one day, somebody from Google might drive by and notice that your house has a nice backyard, or that your neighbourhood might have a nice harbour or a park or a shops that caters to tourists, or perhaps a bakery that caters to locals, or a helpline that caters to small</text>

In the architectural sense, the AIAs have been asking: how to create spaces that are not just passive recording devices, but actively engage users’s imaginations and behaviours? How to bring architecture and urbanism into the digital age? Some of the answers to these questions may be too familiar to be applicable to our own situation, while others may be applicable to almost any situation. The challenge for artists and curators is to find the right mix of answers that are compatible with the particularities of the situation and to deliver the intended message.  A few artists have responded to the challenge by making art that is both buildings and apps; great reporting.  The challenge for art today is even greater: what to do with all that data?  The answer to that question may not be in digital photography, but in the AIAs' work; their digital photography is a reporting system. The challenge for curators is how to engage with this materiality and bring it to bear on the task at hand. It may be that the curators have never met an app that they didn’t like, but they’ve probably never met an art that they didn</text>

These are questions that may now be better addressed by research-based art institutions than by curatorial or educational institutions. In an effort to confront these challenges, AIAs have formed collaborative research councils, where artists, curators, architects and other stakeholders can weigh in on the issues and suggest strategies for action.

The division now focused on developing computer systems that could process data from sensors and transmit that data to computers – a capability that computer systems today take for granted – a capability that Samsung believed was the difference between success and failure.

The exhibition opened with a virtual reality installation and invited visitors into a virtual reality world in the new art museum Arsenale de Tokyo, where the virtual and the real come together via augmented reality.[1] Arsenale de Tokyo is a museum with a virtual reality component. It is a museum of visual arts and design created in collaboration with Samsung’s ARAMI (Advanced Research &amp; Manufacturing Institute), an arm of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. The institute was established in 1976 and is a global leader in simulation, research and technology. It is a member of the TSMC Virtual and Mobile Systems Laboratory and the IEEE Computer Society. Samsung Electronics had been planning to establish an AI research centre in Tokyo, but the crisis in the oil industry in the 1980s and the Japanese economy sliding into recession in 1987 meant that plans for a new campus were put on hold.[2] Instead, the institute set up a new division, the Advanced Research &amp; Manufacturing Institute, Tokyo, which is responsible for developing new ways to think about how to use AR/virtual reality to produce art and social change.[3] The institute’s virtual reality project began in earnest in 1985 and was given the codename ‘Kawakaze’ by the media. It was envisioned as a fully immersive installation, including virtual reality headsets and associated software, that would allow artists to explore the layered nature of the social.[4] The installation itself was conceptual and physical preparatory work for what would become a multi-year, multi-disciplinary exhibition, including work from many of the artists who had been curating the previous thirty years.[5] The exhibition, which began in June of that year, featured new works from the curators and artists of the present and future era and a selection from the archive, including new media works by the curatorial team.

A prototype of one of these systems was created using MATLAB, and the institute’s interest in artificial intelligence at this time is reflected in the institute’s enthusiastic use of MATLAB.14 Taken as a whole, the entries in this journal do not suggest a clear vision of the future of work, but rather a warning of the dangers of complacency. In the 1980s and 1990s, the computer revolution meant that computers could do incredible things, but the failure to anticipate the effects of AI raises serious questions about the limits of artificial intelligence. In a world with no such crises, what can be done to protect ourselves from the effects of AI? What can we do to adapt our existing infrastructure to the inevitable changes that are part of a world becoming ever more artificial? What are the responsibilities of the citizen in this new world?

Materials Research Institute worked closely with Samsung on its AR/VR project and produced 3D models and printed parts for its AR/VR systems. Samsung used these parts to make parts for its phones, including the iconic 'S' and 'E' smartphones, as well as for its online video and media products. Around this time, Samsung Electronics was also acquiring a small stake in a publishing company called Digital Japan S.A. The two companies formed a new joint venture, a division of which was called Digital Media Company. Digital Media Company produced video, photography and interactive media products through a joint venture with AR/VR pioneer N. Ambaszky and the New York Public Library. Later, Samsung would acquire a controlling stake in Digital Japan S.A. The new company set up a research and development centre in Tokyo, where it produced 3D models and printed parts</text>

The division was headed by Toshimitsu Nakayama, who would go on to found and lead the now independent company, Samsung Semiconductor Research &amp; Technology Co., Ltd. In 1994, Nakayama established a new division, Samsung Communications Research &amp; Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (1998–2006), which in turn established a new division, Samsung Computer Systems Research &amp; Manufacturing Co., Ltd. In 2006, Samsung incorporated into the company that is now known as, 'Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.', which is engaged in developing ARAM (Advanced Real-Time Manipulation &amp; Maps) – the foundation of which is ARAM (Advanced Real-Time Operations) – the underlying technology of Samsung Pay. ARAM is a serverless system that processes data on the basis of spatial and temporal information.[3] Samsung Semiconductor currently has four research and development centres spread across Asia, Africa,</text>

The AI research it produced was then put to use in military research and technology companies including Samsung, as well as in civil and military surveillance. Between 1985 and 1992, the number of employees at the institute tripled and has remained at that level even though the number of computers and internet connections has dramatically increased. The institute’s research and development teams now number more than 10,000 employees and include researchers from across the globe, including from South Korea, Russia, China and Israel.[3]The Samsung Archive,Volume 2: The Archive of a People (2015–16) represents a new beginning for the firm at a time when it is attempting to rebuild its international image following the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York City.

The new plant opened in 1990 and was designed to meet the needs of a global consumer market for computer and video components. It has expanded this model several times, becoming a major player in the global market for computer and video components, and a producer of interactive media components.The institute’s focus on research and development has often been characterised by over-hyping possibilities, but the persistent search for better ways of interacting with the computer and its systems has often been driven by vested interests. For instance, the desire to reduce the use of petroleum as a source of energy has often been achieved through programmes such as those run by the Japanese energy company, Statoil, in collaboration with IBM and other large corporations. As a result of these partnerships, huge quantities of oil are produced and consumed each day. Yet the desire</text>

The museum or gallery can decide which of the many possible futures for the city they wish to present – a process that will repeat the museum’s or gallery’s historical curatorial work, but will also introduce new artworks or museum-quality displays that will draw visitors to the city. This could happen in three ways: either curatorial curating a city in which art is already abundant (like New York and London), or curatorial curating a city in which art is becoming ever more scarce (like San Francisco and London). Stages #4 presents a possible future for Liverpool. The selected artworks will be displayed in a special exhibition catalogue, Stages, to be held in October 2018, and in an exhibition catalogue, to be published in November 2019.

The city will play a major role in the future of this project. Here, the Biennial will return to the city in an attempt to repeat as many of its past projects as possible.  In the present project, the Biennial attempted to recreate the former ‘story in three acts’ model used by the Biennial of Amsterdam and New York in the 1980s and 1990s. In doing so, it created a hybrid ‘eventualisation of culture, commerce and politics’.3  The result was messy, to say the least. Art was used in a political struggle, and the city was split in half. The Biennial’s involvement in redeveloping West Cork, which had begun in earnest in 2016, was also perceived as a conflict of interest.</text>

It is used to make visible social injustice and it is also a tool of the state. The application of art to achieve transformative social change is an area where artists’ collective bargaining strategies can exert significant influence. But even though the artworks can exert a significant influence, they do not have the capacity to occupy and empower spaces and people. That is, without corresponding social change, generating community support, and becoming a force for social change, what is left behind is the difficult but necessary work of building trust, building desire and organising people into politically engaged groups. We need a ‘system' that creates and supports ‘representatives of habitation – people who live by the land and who use its facilities and landscape –</text>

The register needs to be interactive, so that people with different levels of knowledge can contribute to its making. The key is that it must be possible to replicate and expand it – even if it is a few years later than planned. Stages was developed in collaboration between Liverpool John Moores University’s (LJMU) Artistic Office and KW Institute for Art &amp; Social Change, and the New Media Arts organisation Creative Time. LJMU was a main partner in the project, with the other artists being from across the city.

It is an episodic, curatorial move that is constantly evolving and relies on comment, suggestion and feedback. It is the accumulation of years of collaboration between various artists, curators, art historians, art administrators, art dealers and others who help create the biennial, and the exhibition will tell a continuously expanding narrative of the art, recent and past, that is produced and displayed in the city.

This may involve, for example, local organising artists’ studios in neighbourhoods and providing them with resources to offer culturally relevant art through art activities, or providing artist-run cultural centres and youth groups with resources to offer arts education and activities through art activities, or co-production of arts content with other cultural partners. The goals of these art ventures may be cultural or environmental in nature. Mission criticality is defined as: ‘The art has a principal place in a community if it transfers meaning or authentic to the place where it is made’. [1] Greenberg, Robert. The Greening of</text>

    The next Liverpool Biennial could be held in October 2018, as planned. The decision to hold the event in October 2018 comes amid increasing public unease about the conduct of the Liverpool Biennial, which has seen a steady stream of artist-led projects cut short by the biennial's own self-censorship. On 8 October, just over a week before the event, a group of artists staged their own artist-initiated project, Session at the Bluecoat, which they described as ‘a year-round, multi-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary dance party, where works by local artists and organisations were placed in category‑one and two positions, one in front of the other.’ They were joined by other artists, including Sarah Vaughan, Adam Abbott and Joan Crook, who were all present in person.Session at the Bluecoat, 8 October '18. Photo courtesy of Bluecoat.  	In a way, the use of the artist as a curator or the artist as a

The biennial is an art institution with a curatorial purpose, and the relationship between the artist and the institution is a way to play this artist. In the case of Liverpool, which has a much larger and more established cultural sector than Manchester, this profile is specifically intended to be maintained by artists and their organisations, while art’s actualisation is meant to happen at a level above and beyond those involved with the biennial. Perhaps the relationship between the biennial and the arts organisations that create and operate it is a function of the institutional change that change entails, and the growing pains that artists and their organisations take in entering the biennial world. But there is also a way of putting this negotiation of power and influence in terms of negotiation of existence, of making, and there is a way of negotiating the different values and needs of life in a different world – in other words, the use of culture</text>

Tony Benn, The Benn Report, pp. 38-9.  	Benn’s biennial approached art as a political and artistic tool, able to influence behaviour through what he called ‘soft power’ via the medium of cultural tourism. Soft power is defined as ‘the art of making people feel good about themselves and the world around them’ via ‘cultural tourism’, and it is an approach to culture as a vector for social change.

The biennial has become the object of a kind of celebrity culture, where the artist is somehow represented as an equal to the artist and a spokesperson for the art form. The problem with this kind of portrayal is that it creates an unrealised audience for the art form – an audience that would never happen come the artist’s home town, Liverpool. So the idea of the ‘real life’ in the biennial needs to be questioned, and the audience ‘made up of artists and other artists’ that come to Anfield to see what’s being made there. I think that’s where the real magic happens, in the creation and consumption of new art forms. I also think that the way in which art is produced in the biennial, the way that it is experienced and appropriated, is what creates the illusion of magic and wonders. It’s produced through a kind of appearing, the</text>

The problem arises when the biennial rotates, and with it, often drastically, the artist’s role or medium’s role. As biennials become more institutionalised, more of an institutionised form, and more dependent on a particular institution or network of institutions, the role of the artist becomes more limited. In effect, the role of the artist in a biennial event has entered an increasingly restricted area.  	However, the main reason to commission an artist to create an artwork for a biennial event is to see if that work can be used in the event itself. That is, in theory, the whole idea. In practice, many biennials use their curatorial language and institutional resources to produce work that is not specifically designed to be used in the biennial, but which can nevertheless be shared between the artists who commissioned the artwork and the biennials that support their commissions.

The kind of thing that happens in galleries and museums and is often attributed to curators such as Mark Leckey, but which is becoming increasingly difficult to define or quantify. The kind of thing that the artist(s) behind those projects do naturally, with or without their intervention. The kind of thing that is often presented as being the direct outcome of a biennial, but which is in fact quite the opposite. That biennial can be counted as a direct consequence of the curator’s agenda. A post hoc, post deliberativisation. And so, the biennial became the site of a kind of ongoing, sometimes unspoken but ever-present cultural negotiation, centred on the relationship between the artist and the gallery, between the biennial and the wider artworld. It is this kind of ongoing negotiation that needs to happen in order to sustain art’s natural ecological</text>

When the artist is the one who initiates the project, and the project seeks its approval, there is less capacity for collaboration. There is a power imbalance between the artist and the public, and this is seen as a problem by many curators and arts administrators.  	However, when the artist cuts short the project because she does not feel like working with it, there is a power imbalance between the public and the institution as well. This is the case with the work I did for Liverpool Biennial in relation to the Bluecoat – I cut ties with the Bluecoat when they started to de-fund the Biennial, and I cut ties with Liverpool Biennial when they started to de-fund the Bluecoat’s social sector. The public was not in any way consulted on this decision, and the fact that artists are cut off from the institution or its funding streams does not sit well with the public.

But in a way, the institution can also rely on the artist as a spokesperson for the place of art, or more specifically, on the place of art in a city. This was particularly evident with the artist Simone Jager in Liverpool during Process 2 – her project at the Chisenhale Gallery in Liverpool, which accompanied her Biennial talks – when she was asked whether she thought Liverpool should be a city for artists. She replied: [T]he answer is always the same: if you can create a space for artists to be able to do their thing, then yeah, I would imagine so. It’s that or exile them.

The importance of the collaborator lies not in what they reveal in the project, but what they withhold. In the case of the Liverpool Biennial, the artists who contributed to the publication of the article were not the ones with the project ahead of the curve, they were the ones who withheld their art. It is this kind of ambivalence that seems to be lacking in the article. The authors seem to imply that the projectors and their collaborators would do anything to have their art published, but it is the readers who have to push it forward. The article seems to neglect the fact that the projects that ran afoul of the curatorial manifesto were many and varied, and that the biennial itself was in no way responsible for the projects it curated. The curatorial manoeuvres it employed were the work of many voices, and in no way represent the voice of the artist or the project. The biennial itself would neither condone nor excuse this</text>

The biennial could recommit itself to a local artist-led regeneration strategy or it could actively seek to engage with the cultural and urban connectivities of the area in new and creative ways.   TheNitrome[1] http://www.biennaleofluxury.com/2018/sep/1/excerpt/ 	It is said that the Biennale of Luxury is the result of a collaboration between Andy Warhol and Valerie Jarrett. In recent years, Warhol has turned to promoting himself as an avant garde designer and technologist, while his wife, designer and journalist Suzi Orman, has actively encouraged artists to explore alternative and controversial creative ways to inhabit the premises and surroundings of big buildings and oppressive regimes.  http://www.biennaleofluxury.com/2018/sep/2/</text>

The easy part is to adopt a performative stance, to align yourself with the narrative that is being told, and to find ways to connect with audiences that are receptive to your work. The hard part is to unpack that narrative and connect with audiences that are actually there and are able to be moved. In the end, that is the tricky part. The audience is able to be moved in ways that the art educator can design, but they are also difficult to move. In order to achieve the transformative effect that audiences expect, the art must be original and formative, and work through practices and ideologies that are different from those of the audience. The audience is also expected to participate in creating the future they want, which can either be created or adapted to fit within the existing political, economic and social systems. In the end, the audience is the problem. The audience is the problem all the way through. If the audience is to be moved</text>

It was a ‘snap’ of the two that created the artefact. The artefact was not something created by, or on behalf of, the globalised capitalist; rather, it was the effect of the global circulation of money and value. 	I will devote some time to the temporal dynamics of money and the value form in order to bring out some of the politics and ideologies at work in the exhibition. 	As explained by Murray Straus in his influential work Things Fall Apart; ‘once a commodity has arrived at a location, such as a store or a hotel, it is difficult to get it back’.2  The hotelier in its turn, is a direct descendant of the merchant, and like its merchant ancestor, it creates and distributes wealth</text>

In Paris, the FAI invited Bruno Latour, principal of La Casa Encendida (the Pearl), an institution that preserves and distributes the provenance of precious objects, to undertake a multi-year project to locate, register and return to Iran a group of 17th Century pearls discovered and found in the city. The project, which began in 2007, is making its way to Liverpool, and in April 2015, will embark on its third and final leg in the UK.2  The emergence of digital cultural capture involves the digitisation and automated reproduction of cultural traces, which inevitably leads to their displacement in time and space. The digitisation of cultural traces is especially widespread in Third World countries where the circulation of ideas is severely restricted. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to trace cultural traces in the first place, which is why contemporary art is often found in settings that are otherwise experiencing a public</text>

It is true that in the ‘present’ we possess no information about what may happen in a future, but this is due to the fact that the ‘present’ is the temporal inverse of what William James had called the temporal zero. It is true that the temporal zero holds us all in eternal motion, frozen in time, incapable of reacting to change, but this is due to the other ‘past’ holding us in place. For example, the notion of property in the modern ‘philosophy of time’ holds us in place because the modern understands time as a space where phenomena such as natural disasters take place.

The word ‘space’ is frequently used in relation to globalised forms of economic, political and urbanisation, and its use in the context of the ‘city’ is widespread.2  The ubiquity of ‘space’ as a concept in the contemporary globalised form of culture and commerce prompts us to ask whether there is something fundamentally different about the contemporary urban form – different from the ancient suburban or rural settings of the ancient world – that renders its inhabitants vulnerable to the risks and vulnerabilities</text>

The recreated versions of the symposium took place simultaneously in English, Urdu and Baltoon, three dialects of Baltoon, the city's second language. The symposium was organized in two parts – a ‘presentation’ and a ‘workshop’–and the three parts were delivered by different curators. The ‘presentation’ introduced the curatorial idea of time travel, while the ‘workshop’ addressed the curatorial job of imagining the future. Both the presentation and the workshop were delivered by the same curator, Murli Manohar Joshi, with a curatorial team led by Gautam Dikshit.1   	However, in the event that was conceived as a ‘work-in-progress’, Joshi began to introduce ‘new’ content into the symposium. He said that in the future, ‘we’d like to create virtual versions of the past and create ‘time travel’ where different times and places intersect. He went on to suggest that these ‘new’ virtual forms could be interactive and multimedia, and that ‘the ultimate challenge is to imagine ‘a place in which interaction with the artefact can occur’.2 ‘New’ is a curatorial conceit, but it refers to the future not in the sense of emerging from the present but rather in the sense of a creation unfolding before our very eyes. It is a question of creating ‘time travel’ where none have yet taken place. And it is a challenge to imagine where none of us live, work or play.  </text>

In the 1990s, the French urbanist Henri Lefebvre proposed the ‘ue durée’ (expansions today) movement to describe the ‘utopian city’ that emerged after the advent of globalisation and the postindustrialisation that followed it.3 The idea of time travel is not new for artists, and while its origins are obscure, it is now generally agreed that the acceleration of scientific and technological knowledge does in fact create a new ‘period of creativity’</text>

The biennial may be an art form with an aesthetic that is deeply rooted in the social, political and economic, but it is also acutely aware of its ecological footprint. It is deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and culture, both as an art form and as a city system. It is, in short, acutely aware of its ecological footprint. 	The key to its success in the 21st century is ecological realism. It is this element of the art form that has come to define and define the contemporary or post-modern social. It is this element that is deeply embedded in the cultural and social fabric of the city and will continue to do so even after the biennial has ceased to be.  	[1]  HL Ross, ‘Cities and Capitalism: Crisis or Recovery?’,  	The New York Times, 13 November 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/us/business/crisis.html, accessed 4 June 2016.For more information, see: http://www.epa.gov/esa/en/research/centers/nyc/index.html, accessed 4 June 2016.Download this article as PDFHolly RistowHead</text>

The biennial may be an art form with an aesthetic that is deeply rooted in the social, political and economic, but it is also acutely aware of its ecological footprint. It is deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and culture, both as an art form and as a city system. This fact becomes particularly apparent in the city’s performance at the Venice Biennale, where the Biennale is divided into three distinct zones: the historic city, the present city and the cultural zone. Each zone is charged with a distinct cultural function and is staffed with a different kind of curator. 	The Biennale’s Cultural Zones project seeks to reconcile two opposing conceptions of the city that are frequently conflated: the urban and the biennale.1 	In the popular imagination, the word ‘city’ conjures up images of shopping malls, stadiums, and other urban structures, but in reality, cities only exist in the mind of the biennale visitor.2 	In the popular imagination, the city is a living, breathing organism that responds to the biennale’s cultural stimuli and is responsive to the biennale’s own logic of the social.

The biennial may be an art form with an aesthetic that is deeply rooted in the social, political and economic, but it is also acutely aware of its ecological footprint. It is deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and culture, both as an art form and as a city system. It is an art form that has developed great pains to inscribe its own certain kinds of urbanisation in the city, but it is also acutely aware of its ecological footprints. It understands the need to account for this urbanisation in historical and archival documents, but it does not have the political or urban resources to enforce such accounts on a citywide or even a local level. 	In the contemporary biennial, the artist is often the protagonist of the art project, but the biennial is also acutely aware of its own spatial footprint and that of other artists, whose work is often intermingled with that of the artist. This fact has become increasingly important as the biennial has become more institutionalised: as biennials become more like other art forms, they draw on the organizational form of art institutions and its practices, while at the same time recognising the organizational dynamics of its geographical and temporal limits.

The biennial may be an art form with an aesthetic that is deeply rooted in the social, political and economic, but it is also acutely aware of its ecological footprint. It is deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and culture, both as an art form and as a city system. 	The biennial has historically been the site of considerable protest. In recent years, however, there has arisen a large number of biennials that are profitable and serve as a convenient source of capital for the art world. The demand for artworks and exhibitions of art in the world’s biennials has outpaced supply, and the scarcity of artworks and exhibitions has come to characterize both the wealthy and the under-the-rich biennial visitor. 	This scarcity has pushed many biennials to the breaking point. The annual New York art fair, which traditionally features artists from many disciplines, began hosting dozens of artists from different walks of life. Many of these artists found their ways into poor neighbourhoods. 	Artists who found their way into poor neighbourhoods included Marianne Moore, Donna Karan, Ron Chernow, and others. Art was often used as a political tool against the destitute and vulnerable. 	The emergence of new media and coding</text>

The biennial may be an art form with an aesthetic that is deeply rooted in the social, political and economic, but it is also acutely aware of its ecological footprint. It is deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and culture, both as an art form and as a city system. And it is deeply aware of the need to be sustainable. 	In  	20th Biennale of Sydney, Peter Osborne describes how the Biennale is an artefact of our time: a physical manifestation of social media, globalisation and the biennial itself.[2] 	But Osborne goes further and suggests that the position is similar for cities: ‘the biennial has a global reach, and the “real life” of cities matters to it as much as to any other part of the world.’[3] He argues that this is why, in New York and London, the biennale is an annual, cultural event that draws visitors from all over the world, while in Sydney, the biennale is a ‘prior biennale, or “a special kind of “event””, that emerged out of the ashes of the earlier “biennales”.

The biennial may be an art form with an aesthetic that is deeply rooted in the social, political and economic, but it is also acutely aware of its ecological footprint. It is deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and culture, both as an art form and as a city system. It is drawn to the historic architecture and urban planning, both historic and contemporary, that are built on the past, and that therefore can be repurposed. The relevance of this historical-cultural-economic perspective for the future of the biennial is critical. The biennial’s current economic performance is largely dependent on the economic values and political orientations of the cities that it is curated to visit. New York City, for example, has been transformed by the financial crash and ensuing crisis. While this may happen elsewhere, New York City has been particularly good at positioning itself as a tourist destination, generating economic development and new office buildings while learning to live with the aftermath of the crash. These buildings, along with the biennale itself, are typically housed in a redeveloped downtown, or are part of the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower redevelopment, which is currently underway in lower Manhattan. These buildings, along with the congress that is curated there, and the various exhibitions and sympos</text>

The biennial may be an art form with an aesthetic that is deeply rooted in the social, political and economic, but it is also acutely aware of its ecological footprint. It is deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and culture, both as an art form and as a city system. The majority of which is based on fossil fuels. The biennial has an ethical imperative to the extent that it attempts to imagine a future without humans in it. The challenge for the art form today is to become aware of its ecological footprint as much as it is to try to imagine a future with no humans in it. Drawing heavily on the work of the Artspace project, artists, curators and art administrators in diverse fields are now experimenting with ways to bring the biennial into the cities of the future in a non-commercial way. These range from creating ‘research projects’ to cities in general, but also from citizen journalism to the urban planning and development of giant data capture and processing units (CPUs) that will monitor, collect and analyze data to make art as usual in the city become unsustainable. 	The biennial is aware that its current form will likely remain the standard of comparison for decades to come. Therefore, it is constantly looking for ways to</text>

It is a form of cultural consumption that is deeply embedded in the city’s social life, and it is a system that becomes increasingly complex as it is stretched. In that sense, it is both deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and deeply aware of its ecological footprint. 	The problem with the biennial as an art form is not just an aesthetic one. It is an entanglement of different forms of organisation, habit, control, domination and exploitation of nature. The concept itself is seductive and appears to be the crowning glory of modernism in its current form. But the organ that creates the rose that you wish to sprout is actually located in your pelvis and girdle, and you only ever get to see one of many roses that bloom in that area.

It is deeply embedded in the city’s infrastructure and culture, both as an art form and as a city system. It is the ‘only human footprint that matters’. 	In these terms, biennials are not just temporary exhibitions, but are also art objects that are continually (correctly) transcribed and memorialized in the historical record, in part through the act of continually (correctly) recording (the collection of biennials in London). Art biennials today are no longer able to operate on any large scale without incurring substantial capitalisation costs, which come largely as a consequence of the proliferation of artworlds in the developing world. Institutions such as the British Museum and Tate Modern are both proving less able to absorb these costs, which are coming at them from all sides. 	Art biennials today also have to contend with a complex set of new technologies that render artworks permanently transnational in nature, and in many cases, hostile to local conditions.

The biennial may inhabit the city in the historical or contemporary sense, but it also conducts ‘experiences’ in the city that are rooted in the political and social contexts of the city. This is particularly true of the ‘big and small picture’ presented at the Venice Biennale. Big picture subjects are those most readily available to a global audience, like architecture, the economy and politics, history and culture, and so forth. Small picture subjects, on the other hand, are those that are most accessible to a local audience, like animals or plants or the small-scale structures that support their growth.

Noel Burch: I first became aware of this in the early 1990s when I was curator of the Wild West Productions exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum. It occurred to me that the physical act of gathering materials – sticks, rope, wire, bricks, twine, twine, twine, wood, plastic – was used to construct a kind of hub that enabled the group to move from place to place, creating a kind of ‘construction’ over time.

For example, the Biennial was able to set aside a certain amount of space for itself in selected areas of Camden, New Jersey, and Morningside Heights, New York, while creating a hybridised environment where artists could work in tranquillity alongside residents and providing a base for interaction between the two. 	Similarly, the Biennial could have set up shop in any neighbourhood in the city and invited the public to be a part of that neighbourhood. Or, to be more specific, the public to be a part of something that is already built and in place. Such an approach would not only have created opportunities for the Biennial to grow, but would also have placed a great deal of emphasis on the importance of urban development and the capacity of urban environments to support cultural forms of interaction. 	In the 1980s, the Biennial was able to experiment with the idea of the ‘cultural capital of the world’, a concept that sought to quantify the institutional capacity of a city in a manner similar to that of GDP.1 Cultural capitals were seen as an essential building block of neoliberal economic growth and expansion.2  Cultural capitals are thought to be the locus of new economic growth and have been integral</text>

For example, the Biennial was able to set aside a certain amount of space for itself in selected areas of Camden, New Jersey, and Morningside Heights, New York, while creating a hybridised environment where artists could work in tranquillity while residing in a gated community. This hybridisation of the artist and the space was desired by the Biennial, as it allowed the biennial to work through several artists in a row, while presenting a certain amount of conflict and uncertainty due to the many users of these spaces. 	The Biennial also had the opportunity to set up collaborative initiatives with local community centres, grassroots groups and other stakeholders, and provided some important feedback to these groups on its role. As an institution, the Biennial had a clear idea about what it wanted to achieve and how it should be operating. It should be noted that the Biennial had an opportunity to change its mission and objectives, and did so, often incorporating elements of its own. 	When considering the potential of biennials to change how we understand and inhabit places and social formations, it is necessary to ask, and hopefully this blog post can assist.

For example, the Biennial was able to set aside a certain amount of space for itself in selected areas of Camden, New Jersey, and Morningside Heights, New York, while creating a hybridised environment where artists could work in tranquillity while residing in exotic locations such as Georgia or the US. 	However, addressing gentrification and its effects on communities is a different kind of interaction. It is an interaction between the city and the financial services industry. The Biennial was able to engage with these issues at an institutional level (the city council) while remaining completely detached from them (the Biennial itself). I think that is a game-changer today, and a change in the city’s relationship to the biennial. 	The Biennial also had some opportunities to embed itself in the city, to create a kind of civic identity for the area around it. For example, one could have taken part in a scavenger hunt in Chichester, a once-every-two years event that has become a kind of ‘biennial thing’. In its current form, the scavenger hunt serves as a kind of counterintuitive counter intuitive counter intuitive counter intuitive to the institutionalised biennial</text>

For example, the Biennial was able to set aside a certain amount of space for itself in selected areas of Camden, New Jersey, and Morningside Heights, New York, while creating a hybridised environment where artists could work in tranquillity while residing or working away from the city. Such hybridisation is desirable for several reasons. For one, it minimises competition between biennials; two, it maximises the use of space; and three, it maximises the interaction between people and elements of the city. 	In a larger perspective, a biennial can serve as a point of intersection. It is an element of a city that is continuously evolving and maturing, and so it makes sense for artists to be exposed to this ongoing change. As biennials become more institutionalised, the question becomes whether it is still possible to generate artistic practices that are open to questioning and generating new knowledge. For example, the institutionalised artworld may still value and value-accurately reproduce itself. This may be seen as a positive or damaging effect of the biennial as an element, although in my opinion, it is a very uneven and variable effect. Biennials do not produce artists; they produce a</text>

For example, the Biennial was able to set aside a certain amount of space for itself in selected areas of Camden, New Jersey, and Morningside Heights, New York, while creating a hybridised environment where artists could work in tranquillity while maintaining a presence of imagination. It was also able to set aside certain areas for its own uses, such as a cemetery or museum, while actively participating in the city’s infrastructure. These contributions, however, fall far short of an ideal urban scenario and should instead be encouraged as a collaborative process between the city and the artist. For example, the Biennial could have used the extra funds it made from its exhibitionary budget to create a dedicated fund for the city of New York, as well as encouraging neighbouring communities to join in the urban dream. 	The biggest contribution to the city would have been possible only with the participation of a broad range of stakeholders, including local authorities, financial institutions, grassroots organisations and artists. The involvement of artists would have been crucial in enabling the Biennial to penetrate the city and create a sense of place that was both authentic to the city and connected to it.

For example, the Biennial was able to set aside a certain amount of space for itself in selected areas of Camden, New Jersey, and Morningside Heights, New York, while creating a hybridised environment where artists could work in tranquillity alongside local residents. These hybridised settings were able to develop into successful biennials, due to the presence of such cultural elements in the city. However, the actual creation of such biennials is a very different process from creating an art project around a specific area or set of neighbourhoods. The creation of such projects is largely dependent on political, economic and social factors, which can either help or hurt the city. Biennials have a unique ability to arise due to a combination of factors, as well as the political will. Such opportunities are rare and should be used carefully. The power of the biennial comes from the sheer fact that all aspects of its content are consumed by the global financial sector. If urban development is to continue to be responsive to the needs of the city, then part of the city has to be consumed up to a certain point. 	The other part of the equation is the biennial’s own consumption, which is ultimately what ultimately determines whether</text>

For example, the Biennial was able to set aside a certain amount of space for itself in selected areas of Camden, New Jersey, and Morningside Heights, New York, while creating a hybridised environment where artists could work in tranquillity amidst the buildings and public realm that are part of the city. This hybridised environment functioned as a counter to the city’s aggressive planning and capitalist development, while providing a platform for artists to work in ways that would be authentic to the city’s traditions and to its people. This is not to say that the Biennial could or would have done so identically in every city in America and the European Union. Rather, this is a plea to an artist to work within a particular city in such a way as to render it ‘real’ while simultaneously challenging its dominant political and economic influences. Ideally, this would mean working with and alongside local communities in such a way as to create works that are not only authentic to the area but also serve as models for how such communities might operate in a way that is authentic to the tradition and methods of the city.

The Biennial’s relationship to the local community was also affected by the fact that its artists were residents and organisers of the Residents’ Cooperative movement, which sought to develop cooperative housing in the area. The cooperative was housed in the MOCAD Tower and provided resources and programmes for learning and community</text>

For example, the Biennial was able to set aside a certain amount of space for itself in selected areas of Camden, New Jersey, and Morningside Heights, New York, while creating a hybridised environment where artists could work in tranquillity while residing in the former Hells Angels clubhouse at MCA. 	The Biennial was able to establish a relationship with a particular local authority in relation to a particular development that it was proposing to build on the site of the former MCA. This relationship was not absolute, but rather depended on the relevant local authorities, who in turn had varying degrees of discretion in relation to development. Local authorities tended to approve or block development, while citizen participation was marginal at best. 	In the end, the decision to participate in a civic undertaking was a decision that was made between the local people and the National Trust, which in turn was largely made by listening to local people. As a result, there were pockets of opposition, but at the end of the day the National Trust was able to garner enough confidence from the local people to proceed. 	As a project, the Biennial had some opportunities for success, but its true potential was limited to the sites that it was actively</text>

It was also able to set aside certain areas of the city for its 375,000 residents, mostly due to be comprised of the artists’ residents. These initiatives, and the artists’ participation, opened up a certain amount of artistic and conceptual freedom. 	In another initiative, the Biennial commissioned a small group of artists from around the world to produce a ‘street level’ version of its ‘Big Issue’ section. These artists were able to work freely within the confines of their chosen urban setting, while also being conscious of the cultural practices and politics of their chosen city. 	In another initiative, the Biennial funded the production of a series of interactive ‘apps’ that allowed residents and visitors to participate in a ‘bigger picture’ of the city. These ‘apps’ operated almost identically to the website-based products of large corporate entities, but addressed</text>

And they were people who had never been to a fair before. They were, in other words, people who had never been to a gallery or a museum before.

And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to establish a kind of binary relation between the past and the future, or reality and art. And I think that’s really interesting for the way that the art of the past is being reinterpreted and new kinds of artists are being created, because there’s this merging of different pasts and different imaginaries, and I think that’s what the Biennale is doing. The art of the future is being made by artists who are willing to be artists in the past, and so on. And this idea of merging different imaginaries and pasts is what I mean when I say that the art of the present is being made by artists who were, until recently, artists in the past. I mean, look at the art of the present, which is being made by artists who were, until recently, artists in the past, through what’s been happening in the social media sphere. The fact that art is being made today in relation to a social media sphere that was designed by and for the rich and the powerful</text>

And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to establish a kind of binary relation between the past and the future, or, more specifically, between the past and present in specific museums, in an attempt to undo the damage caused by the diffuse and transient nature of contemporary art. I think that a museum is attempting to do that through its collections, not through its curatorial approach, but through its collections, which are what I would call its post-biennial curatorial gesture. It’s trying to undo the damage done by the diffuse nature of contemporary art today through the collection-centered curatorial gesture. I don’t think that the museum is immune to this kind of curatorial gesture either; the problem with the biennale as we know it is that it becomes a museum that can neither monitor nor legislate the actions of its visitors. I believe that the Biennale is trying to provide some kind of alternative to this today, and this is what I meant when I said that the museum is the mediator between the past nor the future. It or the other might be able</text>

And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to establish a kind of binary relation between the past and the future, between present and past, between present and culture. And I think that the problem with the Biennale is that it establishes a kind of static relation between the past and the present, between present and present: the past is always there, but the Biennale has to be present, otherwise it’s a kind of retrofit. If the Biennale is not present, and does not experience the past, then it cannot learn or create or ‘learn’ from the past, because it doesn’t have the power or the presence or the will or the interest or the time or the inclination or ‘know’ that the Biennale had at the time.  	So the Biennale is asking its curator to shape and to be present in the present, but at the same time to simultaneously intervene and create the future that the biennale is attempting to conceal or destroy. And I think that would be problematic and it would be problematic</text>

In the past, there’s only space for certain kinds of cultural consumption; the future has space for different kinds of consumption. The idea is that you travel back in time and visit a certain point in time, and then you come out a certain distance away from where you started. And this is what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to create a kind of shared space between people who’ve never met before. It’s trying to create a kind of shared time in which people can’t escape from, which is very different from the present. And I think this is what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to create a different kind of space for people to inhabit in the same space.It’s trying to create a different kind of space for people to inhabit in the same city.

It’s trying to project an image of the past that isn’t necessarily true of the exhibition. It’s trying to project an image of the absent past that is so that the present can live up to its potential. And so the exhibit that we have now, the present, is an image of the past that is artificial, and part of the Biennale’s dynamic is that the present is a condition of boredom and lack of engagement.Marc Augé, Curator of Entomology and Anomalous Materials at the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada, 2016.

    <text>shouldn't have been curated in such a way as to anticipate the events that would result from such a mass exhibition, but the fact that they were a part of a larger exhibition structure means that they are more visible and that they can be experienced as a museum-type exhibition. The mass audience that the Biennale attracted may have been people who had never been to a biennale before, but they were also people who had never been to a museum before. And they were people who had never been to a fair before. They were, in other words, people who had never been to a gallery or a museum before. And they were also people who had never seen a museum before. And so on. And this is fascinating, this idea that only a certain kind of person or kind of person only belongs in a certain kind of museum. And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to establish a kind of binary relation between the past and the future, where the past is either here or there, or ‘there’s nothing there anymore. And I think that’s what the art world is trying to achieve, trying to achieve the same thing through different kinds of museum. This is what the Whitney Biennale was trying to achieve: to a large extent, its mission was achieved through a kind of double bind: it had to try to present the past in the same way every time, but at the same time it also had to try to present the future in a particular way. It couldn’t present both at the same time, obviously.So the Biennale is trying to figure out how to present the past in a particular way, while also endeavouring to present the future in a particular way. And I think that’s what the new curatorial voice is trying to achieve, trying to find the balance between the two. I don’t think that the Biennale is self-</text>

And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to establish a kind of binary relation between the past and the future, between present and never-never, between present and museum, between present and never-never. And I think that’s what the exhibition is trying to do: to do so through what it does today, through what it once was, and to do so in the present, and to do so through what it may or may not do in the future. But I think that the problem with the Biennale is that it has to be constantly evolving in order to meet the changing needs of the city. The Biennale has to be able to absorb all kinds of different forms of experience, and I don’t think that people can afford to ignore the fact that which is currently happening to them or to future people, because that would limit what they can do with the Biennale as a whole. If the Biennale’s mission is to become a museum, then I think that must be its core mission, and that must always be the case. And</text>

And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to establish a kind of binary relation between the past and the future, between present and historical moment. But there’s a tension there: the museum-type biennale that I imagine the Biennale is trying to establish has a certain binary quality to it, whereas the biennial that I imagine the Venice Biennale is trying to establish has a different kind of quality. The museum-type biennale, by its very nature, puts an end to historical curatorial discourse; the biennial that I imagine the Venetian Biennale is trying to establish has a different kind of tendency toward historical photography. The museum-type biennale is trying to find ways to relate to the past, but it tends to do so through what it creates – through what it reproduces – and through what it reiterates (through what it calls a ‘collection process’). And so the difference is that the biennial that I imagine the Venice Biennale is trying to establish has a predominantly aesthetic quality to it, while the bi</text>

And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to establish a kind of binary relation between the past and the future, or something like that. But the interesting thing about the past is that it borders on present; it’s impossible to define the past through a museum or a gallery. And so, the idea that only a certain kind of person or kind of person belongs in a particular museum or a biennale is always fraught with problems, because the boundary that’s being made is very porous; it’s always subject to change. And so, the question that comes to mind is: how do we create experiences of the past that aren’t subject to change? And the answer to that is: we create what I would call ‘museum-type experiences’; experiences that are constructed in a particular way, that create certain kinds of expectations about what a museum should be, and how it’s supposed to be operated. In other words, we create conditions that support the kinds of behaviour we envision in the museum, but don’t create the</text>

And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: it’s trying to establish a kind of binary relation between the past and the future. And so the idea that the museum is some pristine place where only certain kinds of people or only certain kinds of people ought to be allowed in is one that’s very much aproduct of the binary relation between the past and the present. And I think that’s what the Biennale is trying to do: to create a different kind of museum, one that’s dedicated to the contemporary, to the present and to the moment, but one that’s also not beholden to any particular ideology, although it’s very important that the Biennale is seen as having some kind of public mandate. Because if it’s beholden to any particular ideology, then it’s actually trying to impose an ideological regime on the museum. The Biennale seems to be saying: alright, we’re all caught up in the moment, we’re all affected by how the moment is expressed, and we’re all</text>
