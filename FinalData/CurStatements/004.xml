In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were a problem, the curatorial turn towards the socially engaged citizenry-in-his-sender was a convenient way to render the city into a ‘place of habitation’.  [1] The Opium Convention was held in 18 Schiller St, London, from July to October, 1914, and was an international movement to abolish opium addiction. The movement was initiated by Hirving Hawking, and it was a major part of his internationalist, colonialist, ‘utopian’ fantasy. [2] The Stages series was a London arts and design journal published from 1904 to 1959, and was one of the first publications to examine the urban future. The title of the first issue (1904/05) is a blur, as is typical of the journal format of the time, but there are several words that suggest a period in the writer’s mind: ‘Stagecoach’, ‘The Empire of</text>

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were a problem, the curators’ proposal that the art form might be used in the service of the social was a godsend. The social was encouraged to engage with the art form in the same way that children might engage with a history book, an older person might lead a game or entertain a family, and the city was encouraged to produce a response that was both imaginative and effective. The curators certainly understood the importance of a strong curatorial hand in shaping the art form. The curators themselves saw the curatorial hand as the decisive factor in a work’s authenticity. Curator Lowell Povinelli recalled how, during the opening week of the exhibition, the gallery-goers ‘turned on each other and started beating each other up with trunchees and kicks.’[63] Povinelli went on to describe the ugly scenes they produced, even though he himself felt that the contemporary image of the vandalised gallery would be better off without the scrapbooks</text>

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were common, the staid museum visitor was often left to contemplate the ruins of a once great metropolis. As the historian Graham Turner describes, the ‘discovery of a city’ is often a premonitory synonym for [a] crisis of urbanisation… a kind of a clearing out that “immediately puts an end to any potential future growth”[63] of the metropolis. The curatorial and art dealer ‘play[s] the part of metropolis in a new and strangely kinetic way, sometimes taking the form of street artists, sometimes a circus act’, which the city criticises in various ways. The art dealers’ role, however, was to make the city seem ‘real’ by giving the impression that ‘ordinary’ things could be done in it’.[64] The curators, on the other hand, played the part of explorer, seeking out hidden gems, which the city could then</text>

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were a problem, the fact that the homeless could be bought with public money made the corners of the city accessible and made the demolition of dilapidated structures seem necessary. The curators clearly saw an opportunity to make a name for themselves in the art market by bringing together a diverse range of artists with a range of styles and subject matter. They chose to do this through a single artistically engaged work that addressed a single audience – the homeless. The sculpture on the walls of the cathedral looked to the future and the urban landscape. In a city such as Liverpool, which has been described as ‘the most beautiful city in the world’, but which also counts among its citizens the Leicester Square terrorist who carried out the 7/7 London bombings, the Liverpool Biennial may have placed an artistic premium on the idea that the art was coming from everywhere. It was also the only art institution of the city to have a permanent art gallery on Curzon St. The Biennial’s website claims</text>

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were a problem, the exhibition of art was often seen as a way to generate investment in a neglected sector of the city. The curators’ enthusiasm for the art was matched by an equally un-academic approach to the art’s truly social consequences.

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were a problem, the appearance of art in such environments was a refreshing change.  A theatre of the absurd, the ‘war’ was born. A number of curators were part of a group that organised acts including Jack London, Tony Parsons, W. E. B. Du Bois, W. W. Jacobs, W. D. Quigley and many more. The group that we assembled was a mix of young and old, artists, critics, collectors, students and community organisers. We also had folks from the Royal National Museums, the National Gallery, the Architecture Museums and many more curating small and large exhibitions.  We were on the cusp of a ‘culture industry’, but the word ‘industry’ wasn’t even on the minds of the artists, critics and collectors involved in making the museum appear relevant again. The industry was in its infancy, but it was being fuelled</text>

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were common, the exhibition of an art work deemed authentic was a way to make the metropolis whole again. The curators’ turn to the artist’s work as a solution to their problems solved, while the citizens of a new urban utopia are still struggling with the aftermath of the first Opium War. It is not clear how the curators identified the first Opium War, but the ‘potential significance of the name’ seems to have played a role. The Chinese Exhibitions of 1921 and 1926, run by the People’s Art and Exhibition Commission (P.A.C.), noted that the name ‘Invincible Empire’ came up in connection with the work they were presenting, but were also certain that it was not a reference to the real-life dynasties and republics that had been such a part of Chinese history, but to fantastical imaginary worlds. Rather, the commission was suggesting that the public turn to imaginary sources for</text>

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were a problem, the curators’ 'talked up the ideas that the art world could be a platform for anti-war activism and the curatorial equivalent of a US flag. To give the appearance of objectivity, the curatorial approach was to distort the true character of the art process. The curatorial flexibility was used to create a situation in which the artist could have his or her preferred image of the Third Opium War presented, rather than the image of the actual conflict as it actually took place. The curatorial flexibility was also used to shift the focus of the exhibition from the battlefield to the city, while remaining committed to maintaining a historical perspective of the conflict.

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were common, the ‘underclass’ was often given a prominent place in the museum, as when the Thiruvananthapuram Art Biennale, an exploration of the ‘underclass’ in Tamil art, was exhibited in a public gallery in Chennai. Art Biennales in cities such as Chennai, which had recently been host to the Venice Biennale, were examples of this. In these venues, the underclass was often given a prominent place, while the rich and famous were often left behind. In the case of the Thiruvananthapuram Art Biennale, the poor and the subaltern were often given a 'back up’ by the ‘elite’ and ‘culturally significant groups’. Such was the purveyors of cinematic mythologies of the ‘poor’ and the ‘underclass’ to dream and act as if the poor and subaltern simply did not exist, while</text>

In a city where the homeless and the sub-standard form of housing were a problem, the curators’idea of inclusion seemed generous in its ambition. But the exhibition reflected the greed of the artist’s peers, who saw a quick buck on the side of art. When the artist was not busy winning over exhibition-goers with his shabby pseudo-science, in the form of compartmentalised urban development, in the form of ‘social work’ and in the form of ‘community projects’ he also created a parallel, if weaker, artworld out of the ruins of the old.  Such was the public image of London in the First Opium War. The ‘public’ was played by a chubby kid from Peckham (now a councillor in Hackney) who looked like a           Tom Cruise in space, and who wore a t-shirt that read ‘You Shot My Friend’ and who carried a BB gun. He was part of a team called ‘The Public Realm�</text>

Another aspect of the system that was considered was its impact on the environment. The intention was that the Community Land Trust would own and manage the land and buildings and that the Corporation would grow to support a broad range of activities, including farming and fishing, and that the fishing vessels would be self-sustaining. 	Some environmentalists questioned the need for large industrial farms and refineries, fearing that the proliferation of large agricultural operations would threaten the fragile ecosystem that the fishing fleets depended on. Others questioned the wisdom of constructing large concrete and steel silos on the banks of the Delaware, as opposed to the more environmentally beneficial option of forested areas surrounding major rivers. Still others questioned the need for large scale agriculture in an area with such a high water table due to its high mineral content of the soil. 	While the proponents of the new ‘smart city’ paradigm proposed a complete disregard for both ecology and local people, realigning both inbound and outbound, the increasingly visible footprint of New York’s rapid development projects casts serious doubts on the future of the natural resources on which the City depends.

Another aspect of the system that was considered was its impact on the environment. The intention was that the Community Land Trust would own and manage the land and buildings, while the Local Government would own and manage the infrastructure and the landscape. While the aim of the latter was to reuse unused buildings, the system also desired to minimize the environmental impacts of its activities. In its early stages, the system had a partnership with a local architecture firm that provided interior and exterior painting services, as well as a contract with a local landscaper. The partnership ended when the local government took over the local authority’s land use and building policy, so that the building and infrastructure management functions now performed by the Housing Corporation could be performed by local workers. 	The partnership with the local landscaper grew into a cooperative, which became a local business, and eventually an independent cooperative. Over the years, the cooperative board members and employees moved between various local government positions, and often between different jurisdictions. Some were city planners, while others were public works and infrastructure planners. The majority of employees stayed on the board, but the cooperative grew into a cooperative</text>

Another aspect of the system that was considered was its impact on the environment. The intention was that the Community Land Trust would own and manage the land and buildings and that the Corporation would use the land to do things like grow and repair the local streets and provide free or cheap housing for the residents. The hope was that the mixed-use development would minimize the environmental impacts of the system while still allowing for a strong community control mechanism. One of the goals of the project was to create a work environment that was as ecologically sound as possible. One of the concerns was about the disruption caused by large industrial operations, since large structures were often used for temporary or accessory work. One of the engineers working on the project in Liverpool at Liverpool John Moores University (Liverpool John Moores University’s (LLMU’s) Division of Environmental Engineering), Dr Katherine Shear, commented that the aim of the project was to create a work environment ‘where’ the engineering is done’ and that the residential units were designed to respond to changing demand patterns.[4] 	One of the engineers working on the project</text>

Another aspect of the system that was considered was its impact on the environment. The intention was that the Community Land Trust would own and manage the buildings and that the Housing Corporation would protect the land and resources through a shared equity, rather than relying solely on the labour of its staff. Acknowledging the fact that the system would ultimately be run by the Housing Corporation, the UCAS considered what this might mean in the future. In the present state of the art in California, this might mean that the needs of the city would override those of the UCAS, although this is by no means a promise. The intention of this system was to provide both the infrastructure and the participation of the local inhabitants, so there was some concern about the impact that this might have. In the end, this was seen as a better use of the land and resources – saving the art for posterity rather than commercial development.

Another aspect of the system that was considered was its impact on the environment. The intention was that the Community Land Trust would own and manage the buildings and that the Corporation would pay a fee to cover the environmental remediation, including the construction of storm and flood insurance, as well as purchase credits through a local land-use change (LUS), while the residents would own and manage the businesses. The LUS and the purchase of credits through a local land-use change could significantly reduce the need for a building replacement tax abatement (BRT), while the Corporation would own and manage the streets and provide local and long-term maintenance. 	Finally, the Corporation could purchase back the LUS and purchase the land from the Community Land Trust for a fixed rate of credits. This option was considered by the developer, but because the credits were so limited, the Corporation largely owned the potential benefits. While the Corporation certainly had the potential to increase the value of the LUS, its utility was generally limited. 	[4] 	[5]   	The development of self-sustaining mini-</text>

Another aspect of the system that was considered was its impact on the environment. The intention was that the Community Land Trust would own and manage the buildings and that the Housing Corporation would own and manage the land. However, the perception was that the power dynamic would be unfair and that the Community Land Trust would have an advantage due to its size and strong financial resources. The reality is that the power dynamic is much more balance-challenged in Los Angeles than in other metropolises. In fact, power is often abused in this system. 	In 2008, a citizen initiative called Protected Housing Bay was started to address this imbalance and create a mutually beneficial partnership between the Housing Corporation and the Tidelands Foundation, a non-profit corporation formed to manage and protect the buildings and streets.[4] The team consists of architects, landscape architects, urbanists, landscape architects and community activists.

The system would be modular and could easily be adapted for other uses. 	Another concern was over how the system would be managed. The idea was that the land and buildings would be shared between the various stakeholders, with different stakeholders having a say in how the land is used. The proposal also called for a 4% local market tax to fund the system, with an equal share of revenues coming from the local and state governments. The system would be self-sustaining, with no private or public investment needed. 	Another issue that was considered was the effect on the local cultural scene.

The Community Land Trust would own and manage the land and buildings, providing housing, education and other services to the local communities, while the Local Government, through a Housing Corporation, would own and manage the housing and local streets. The Community Land Trust would hold annual general meetings to discuss projects and to sell-off surplus land and buildings, with a small percentage of the land held in trust for the benefit of the Community Land Trust. The Community Land Trust would also hold property titles and manage the buildings themselves, with the buildings effectively in the hands of the residents. 	Another aspect of the system that was considered was its impact on the environment. The intention was that the Community Land Trust would own and manage the buildings and that the Corporation would cultivate and manage the land, while the residents would own the land and buildings. However, the reality was that the interests of the residents would override those of the Corporation, especially in the face of rising land costs and negative effects on the environment as a whole. This is particularly apparent in the board meetings of the early 1990s, when the Board was faced with a crisis of over-utilisation of the building it was building and home it was renting out. The irony is that as developers multiplied on the nearby vacant lots, so did the number of complaints about noise, dust, heat, water and overcrowding. Eventually, the Board was forced to pass a resolution to vacate some of the buildings it was building new ‘Centres for Disease Control and Prevention’. These were mostly houses of ill-used or derelict buildings. However, as developments swelled the number of residents needing to be accommodated grew, and overcrowding became an issue</text>

The intention was that the Community Land Trust would own and manage the land and buildings, while the Local Government would own and manage the land and the streets. The aim was to create a shared and equitable resource sharing between the local and the national governments, while supporting the local economy through the creation of local craftsmen's cooperatives. 	However, the plan also called for the creation of a National Park Service, since the development of a National Park Service was seen by the UCAS as an unnecessary and potentially damaging step. 	So, in 1971, a compromise was reached: the National Park Service was shifted to the Department of the Interior, while the Native American Graves Protection &amp; Repatriation Act was revised to create a National Park Foundation.[4] The Park Service would become a division of the USF, and the Native American Graves Protection &amp; Repatriation Act was repealed. The Park Service would resume its traditional role as a not-for-profit NGO, and the Native American Graves Protection &amp; Repatriation Act was reinstated. 	</text>

In 2017 they opened The Digital Divide, a new exhibition format, designed to capture the spirit and the substance of their experiences at the Biennial. They present a new discourse on cultural production and the relationship of artists, curators, collectors, composers, inventors and others with critical understanding of the digital revolution. These negotiators will share their experiences and knowledge in a new medium: talk, text, image, or image. They will design a new medium through which cultural production can be brought forward from the past, present and futures ahead.Digital divide: the precursor to the digital mediumTwo curators from the Turner Prize shortlist, Anneke Willsmann and Anne Körk, are organising the Liverpool Biennial 2018, which will be the country's first ever biennial, taking place in May.

In 2017 they opened the Biennial Gallery: The Gallery of Modern Art, a new exhibition format that combines their curatorial approaches into a single, interdisciplinary exhibition that brings together four decades of art history. Their curatorial approaches are informed by the curatorial approaches of large corporations and other institutional partners and legacy museums. They are also informed by the ubiquity and accessibility of social media, which are used to propagate and signal cultural practices. The biennial today is deeply embedded in the larger museum museum, museum, and institution structure, and the longer it remains embedded, the more it is difficult to separate the various cultural practices from the structural milieu. But the importance of the gallery as a curatorial unit has diminished in importance, and the social media modes of cultural consumption are the predominant form of cultural production today. The significance of the gallery as a curatorial device today is in part dependent on the significance of the digital gallery as a site for cultural reproduction and cultural transmission.

In 2017 they opened the Biennial – New York – at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. At the time, they also curated a series of workshops at the Museum of Modern Art – New York, USA – where they addressed the role of the artist in post-modernism. The Biennial followed the same themes and methods, but incorporated the works of art, objects and symbolic assemblages found in much modern art, and in particular the work of the photographic negative. In 2018 they opened the prestigious Van Andel Gallery, Amsterdam – a venue to the ever-growing ranks of curators, artists, collectors and journalists who flock to the city to find out what the hell is going on. The gallery is a prime venue for such reporting, but it is also a prime location for the curatorial often chaotic and disjointed work that is often claimed to be contemporary art’s work but which is in fact art’s work of disappearance.

In 2017 they opened the Biennial Digital Art Museum, Chester, UK. The team has a particular interest in the role of the curator and the biennial in the age of the social. It is the latter that has become the subject of the biennial, in a curatorial move that is often characterised as a ‘contemporary art’ museum. In this context, the biennial is often characterised as a place where contemporary art is being made ‘today’. However, the biennial has often been seen as an end in itself, and the curatorial part as an important but transient element that contributes to the museum-going experience. In this sense, the curatorial has often been seen as an essential element in the contemporary curatorial’s role. And there is increasing evidence that this is happening in London, at the Tate Modern and at the Keele Gallery. In this picture book, experienced curators Schmitz, Lee and their artist curators Elmg</text>

In 2017 they opened the exhibition, The Other Exhibition, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. In 2018 they are collaborating with the New Museum on a new exhibition, The Other, which focuses on the artist Shepard Fairey. Both exhibitions are curated by Christie's artists in residence. Both rely on the artist’s curatorial vision as a means to explore the significance of a place, and in that sense are both extensions of that vision. They are also, however, ‘systemic projects’ that operate across places and times, and so bring to mind other curatorial works that faced similar systems and frameworks. Both exhibitions are exerting a kind of pressure on venues to meet their curatorial commitments. These pressures are real, but they are also anticipatory: the pressure is applied beforehand, during and after the fact, in real time, as events unfold. In a way, the different anticipatory pressures can be seen as providing the basis for the same future, or at least for the future that</text>

In this new exhibition and workshop, they engage with the ways in which art and culture are produced, reproduced and communicated today – exploring art, aesthetics, commerce and the post-commercial media industries of social media.Curatorial and curatorial inquiry is an art form with inherent limits. From its earliest beginnings, in the early twentieth century, artists and art historians such as Richard Koch, Walter H. Palmer, Ronald L. Palmer, and Anthony Gardner proposed a set of criteria that would later be developed into the Universal Curator Criteria (1980): criticality, entertainment, spectacle, surprise, unexpectedness, spectacle being the first three. Other art historians have contributed to the list, but these are the most prominent: John Akomfrah or Mark Miodownik, John Urry, Peter Schiff</text>

And the answer to that is a critical question: how to define the social life of the city in relation to the artist’s particular skill set, but also in relation to what might be considered the mundane, everyday? 	Another crucial point is that cities today are in many ways like social media platforms: they have been designed to be reachable by any means including migration. So a city’s ability to engage with the city in art is also critical to the city’s future growth. But the key is that the city does not seek to impose its artistic identity on the artist or the audience. The city needs to ensure that the art reaches those who need it most.

The social impact statement, often misquoted as ‘that’, is a legally binding contract between the City and the artist. The City submits its social impact statement to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issues an opinion, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit follows the Court of Appeals’ decision in a split decision. Art is then free to develop its social impact statement in ways that are not bound by the legal system or constrained by the will of the governed.

Yes, and it is a new kind of art, because the city has largely abandoned its historical mission of the übermensch, which is to produce and share culture. Rather, the city is producing a kind of art form that is very much its own, which can be said to be contemporary, but which is also responsive to the city’s social needs and desires. And that is a very exciting development, because it implies that there are other forms of art that can be produced in the city, and that is a shift that is happening all the time, and it implies that there are other possibilities for art’s development. 	And that is what artists are doing, and that is great, because it implies that there are other ways of making art, and that is a huge shift, and it frees us up to consider other possibilities.

Art has other functions as well. It is capable of supporting and directing social action, and it can even facilitate the achievement of social effect through its many forms of organisation. 	The question then becomes, how does a city create social meaning for its inhabitants? 	Because social meaning is achieved through struggle, and takes many forms, this may be the case with New York. But in order for such a project to have any effect at all, other social change must first be achieved. In order to achieve that, a city needs an organisation capable of achieving social change, and capable of enabling that change at all levels. The organisation that emerges through such struggles will be no different from any other politically-engaged organisation, and its work will be no different from any other organisation’s work. But it will have to be multidisciplinary and innovative in its design, acquirement and implementation, and above all, execute</text>

One of the most interesting projects that was mounted in the city around the time of the Biennale was a project entitled  	Inhabitant, which brought together residents from different parts of the city to work in concert to solve a problem that faced the entire city: the homeless and the drug war. 	 task force was established to map out possible solutions. One of its purposes was to find innovative ways to engage the public sector, which was then asked to prepare a master plan for the city in order to be able to implement the solutions.

And in many ways, the art is the problem here, not the social work. The social work is the part of the artist that is most capable of addressing the power structures that are in place in this city, and who are able to generate an awareness and change of attitude. 	But the question becomes, are there systems that need to be challenged? Are there enough of them?

Similarly, in the area of public art, I think that many people would agree that it is critical to see how the arts can be used to change the social conditions of the city, and to see how the arts can connect to existing modes of political and economic power in the city. I think that is a fundamentally different way of thinking about the role of the arts in the city. 	But there are many other ways of thinking about the social dimensions of the city, and the role of the arts in that process. I would not call the arts public; I would call it social. 	What the arts can and cannot is a social-political question. I would argue that the role of the arts today is political and instrumental, and the function of the arts is</text>

But what makes the art is that it is interactive, and that is why an artist can engage with the city in many different ways: from the urban to the rural, from the high street to the low street, from the commercial to the organic, from the educational to the activist, from the political to the transactional. And what makes the art do this is precisely that it is made possible through the very nature of the social. 	  Through participatory methods, the city can be made into something quite apart from its current form. And that is why the participatory dimension of art today is very much at odds with the classical art of old, which was all about the actor, the artist, and the spectator.

Don’t be like the Bedouin – move around a bit and spend more time with your family – spend more time in the house and have more family members around, and you’re done for the day.

KnowingJSON (short for Common Lisp Object Relational Mapping) is a Common Lisp dialect that was popularized in the 1970s by US military intelligence officers to map Common Lisp functions to object-oriented programming (OO) systems. The Object Relational Mapping (ORM) language was written in ORM and used by military and intelligence agencies in the 1970s and 1980s. It is one of several dialects of ORM that were created during this time. Now, over half a million ORM dialects live in use in over 1,000 departments and agencies in 50 countries around the world.  KnowingJSON aims to be both a tool for data mining and a platform for artistic and academic experimentation. The dialects it is written in support of ‘human languages’, including Common Lisp, provide rich sources of discourse on a global scale.  KnowingJSON</text>

Hopefully, as AI gets better and more practical, people are going to want to spend time there and engage with what that entails.

But I do think that AI is going to have a very significant impact on how we live our lives and how we interact with the world – and that’s really interesting and novel and new to me. I feel like there was a gap between the art world and the social worlds and the natural worlds that we have access to, and I think that part of the answer is in the art world, and particularly in the arts-creative-ideology wing of the arts institution, but also in the art world itself: in terms of cultural capital and in terms of being able to mobilise resources and making the appropriate connections.AI is already changing the art world, and creating new forms of collaboration. But there is a danger that, as more and more people around the world start using apps and connected devices more and more, the boundaries that art and design once imposed between these two can be ignored or circumvented – and that is dangerous in itself.

We’ve all been conditioned by the media to think that AI is going to be some kind of panacea for all our problems. But I’m afraid that’s not going to happen. I mean, AI is going to cause problems, but I don’t want to be called a savior. The problems are going to get more complicated and we’ll all end up in crisis spots, because of course, of course, there are going to be people who misuse technology and misuse its capabilities.

It’s going to change the core aspects of how we conceive of the world, but I don’t know if it’s going to fundamentally alter how we live our lives. That would be a major undertaking. I mean, I would love to do that, but I don’t know if my kind of imagination is going to be enough to accommodate that kind of evolution and the new kinds of meaning that are going to be generated and shaped by it. I mean, I have no idea what that would mean politically, but I certainly don’t know what that would mean economically.

It is very possible that the impact of AI is going to be more conceptual and less material, like the impacts of global climate change or a nuclear war. It’s possible that the most transformative impact of AI will be in the arena of culture, and art as a shared medium between people: in other words, it will be like the ancient agrarian cultures that were once populated by mammoths, and it will be like the way that language is constructed: with hunter-gatherers and farming groups like the Paleo-Asians who invented it. But I do see great potential in the technology that we have right now to connect directly to and create meaning and purpose and connect with other cultures and species outside of our own. This seems like something that could happen alongside or alongside with existing infrastructure and infrastructure changes. There are of course huge challenges ahead, both for art and the people who use it, but I see great promise in</text>

And so I’m interested in the systems that are going to underpin that new culture of AI. I want to see what that means politically, economically and socially. 	So I think that the conversation that I was having with Joana was also part of that larger cultural context that she was creating. And so I think that the idea that AI is going to bring a new meaning to what’s meant by the human in a way that was consistent with the cultural values that she was bringing forward – not just in terms of music and art, but also in terms of politics, immigration, media, urban development, etc. – is part of what I enjoyed in that larger context.

[…] A ship’s role in twentieth-century capitalism was to take part in a global market system that exploits natural resources and sends huge amounts of oil and other products (primarily to China) on to global markets. As a result of this role, ships were used as objects of exchange on a massive scale. As a result of the use of ships as objects of exchange, and the constant need to refit them to meet global markets, ship sizes started to shrink. Today, most ocean-going ships can fit into a small container, but in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries huge container ships were common. As a result, the size of a ship had a big impact on the type of ship it could take: a ship that could carry a lot of stuff on a</text>

[…] The interest in the port as a symbol of modernity that is growing in tandem with the increasing importance of images of the ship in popular culture is most apparent in the films that employ the port of Liverpool as a major setting. The most recent example is the work of the artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan, whose images of Liverpool during the 2011 Liverpool Biennial have caused so much consternation around the city that she was named one of the twenty-first century’s ten most representative artworks of the century.1  1   	Jack Burnham, ‘On the Seas: Remapping Culture’,  	The New York Times, 13 November 2012, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/arts/sci/science/environment/nl-liverpool.html?, _</text>

[…] The history of globalisation then turns to the port as a terminal through which traffic now circulates. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the entire global economy was then based on the notion that the world economy would be possible because of the global shipping industry. The interests of global shipping then became closely tied to those of the monarch, and the interests of the merchant class with its patrons in turn were closely tied to those of the state. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the interests of the monarch, his subjects, and his favoured classes then gradually turned into those of an even larger state. The history of globalisation then turns to the United Nations, which is seen not as the pinnacle of societal achievement but as the pinnacle of bureaucratic excess. The interests of states then turn into those of bureaucracies. And so the history of globalisation, at least insofar as it is contemporary in scope, becomes embedded in the</text>

But the key to unlocking these images of individual voyages is still voyaging. The voyager remains ever on the lookout for those objects of value that can be used as components in a future transportable yet traceable form of credit and demand.

[…]  The twentieth century saw a rapid expansion of trans-shipment, and the role of the port became not only the location for trans-shipment, but the site for the trans-shipment of people, goods, ideas, images – in short, the site for all imaginable forms of transfer. ‘All these changes mean that the port has had to become something like a massive city to handle them all.’ – Fred Turner,  	Fast Company, 2014 	[…]  The port has long been seen as the site of possible future growth, which is why the port is so important to the economy of the future society. If the port is allowed to decay, as some predict, the potential future society will have to create new ways of organising the urban environment to accommodate a postindustrial future economy.

This is the case both with the influential but short lived  	Annual Biennial, and with newer artists who have bargained their place in the art world on the back of a regularly occurring biennial.Art is often done in such a way that it barely conveys the full complexity of the complex society it is embedded within. Yet even in this case, the art is rarely of any use in constructing a public sphere for the creator to work in. In most cases, the art is likely to be used by others in their own sphere, and in some cases, by those who oppose them.

This is the mode of art production in the age of artificial intelligence, and although I wholeheartedly endorse the experience, I wholeheartedly disagree with the form that artificial intelligence takes.1  The idea that artists should be able to define what constitutes an artist emerged, I believe, from a 1917 Paris commission by Galerie Maxime Richard, titled Le biennale des images contemporains à l’orientale, or Le gallery des images contemporains à l’orientale.2  The biennial became a thing in 1967, with Charles O’Shea staging the first London and the Melbourne biennials, and the Tate Britain and Commonwealth Series staging their residencies elsewhere. The biennial has a web of relationships that stretches back to Aramis in the 1960s, to the biennials of the early 1980s in Venice and Ankara, and to the biennials of the present day in New York and London.

Art’s real power in this environment derives from the fact that, in the context of the biennial, it is both understood and permitted to be fully autonomous. But as AI improves, and as biennials become ever more autonomous, the biennial will have to follow suit, or be replaced by something more akin to a non-profit institution. And this brings us to our present predicament: how to reconcile the increasingly urgent need for curators to have access to cutting-edge scientific and social research, as well as the fact that, as AI improves, the more art there is, the less it is likely that it will be appreciated? For some artists, this has meant embracing new social and cultural theories of art and art in society, and the biennial as a cultural form within which art will be used not only to further a shared understanding of the world, but also to further a shared sense of personal purpose and identity. For others, this has meant forging partnerships with artists</text>

This is the perspective of Nasser Rabbat, a former professor of Computer Science and the Management Information Systems Administration at Columbia University. In a recent article in Current Directions in Psychological Science, Rami El Samahy and colleagues explore how AI affects our sense of self-image and our sense of social connection. They use a case study of addiction as an example of how AI might one day help patients. They develop a set of questions that draw upon the ways in which AI threatens traditional professions and professions, and how this might shape creative solutions. Questions that draw on the questions and techniques of experimental psychology, and ask whether AI systems are creative</text>

This is the mode of art production in the age of artificial intelligence. Biennials may also participate in some other modes of production, such as art dealers, collectors, and art fairs. These other, less powerful forms of artistic production also exist, but their primary purpose is the production of art itself.Art is made possible through the technology that pervades all aspects of modern society, and yet is increasingly difficult to access or consume. The technology of the biennial is made possible through the purchasing of tickets through a website or phone book. As a visitor to a biennial, you are not necessarily visiting a museum or a gallery; you are actually entering a massive online market. And, as the biennial itself becomes increasingly advanced, it becomes increasingly difficult to access or to access any part of the market.‘Open House Hour’ is a London-based, non-profit organisation founded in 2013 with the mission to bring together and foster dialogue on the city’s gallery circuit through public assemblies, events and ‘micro-exhibitions</text>

One can argue that, in the age of the biennial, the biennial has become a multi-year episodic enterprise, crafting and delivering meaning to what the biennial represents, and how it represents it. This is the mode of art production in the age of artificial intelligence. In the biennial, the artist, the audience, and the biennial itself are transformed and augmented continuously – through investments in content, practices, locations, and so forth. This is the ‘artificial intelligence’ that underpins the phrase ‘artificial neural networks’. The audience is entranced by the show and its imagery, and the biennial can do the same, amplifying the show’s symbolic value. Yet, as biennials increasingly become networks, they are also characterised by a creeping tribalism that seeks to impose its understandings of the world on those who use them. The audience is urged to ‘join the tribe’ and so the biennial becomes entwined with wider cultural trends and agendas. Thus, the biennial is seen to be an extension of the city, its infrastructure constituting a kind of artificial wall that separates it from the rest of the urban landscape.

This is the mode of art production in the age of artificial intelligence and the promise of new ways of organising cultural resources.Artists and arts organisations around the world are mobilising to see if there are lessons for their work from the biennial. The United Nation’s Framework Convention on the Rights of Indigenous People, adopted in 2006, provides a framework through which artists can assert ownership over their work: every person is entitled to the exclusive right to make and to share in artworks​—whether that person is an Indigenous person, or is a non-Indigenous artist—with whom they work, freely transmuted into something else. The 1996 Istanbul Biennale also commits the artist to ensuring that their work is not merely a replication of history, but stands apart: it’s art, it’s a statement of intent, it’s a way of saying ‘yes’ through art to questions of identity and place.The call to arms is being raised globally: join us.Act now, or risk missing out.Download</text>

This is the mode of art production in the age of artificial intelligence, but it is also the mode of social and political organisation that the biennial is expected to follow. The importance of this undertaking cannot be underestimated. The task of concealing and projecting meaning across the breadth of a given city cannot be underestimated. The challenge is how to engage the biennial in this new mode of production, and how to deliver meaning in this new media of meaning-producing enterprises.If there were a ‘Common Core of meanings’ to be learned by every citizen of a given community, perhaps the biennial could establish a stable of collaborative projects with the aim of conveying cultural meanings across a given city. Such a common core would encompass a shared interest in art being produced in a particular community, and a desire to share in the cultural rewards, through the empowerment of artists and the spread of creative practices across that community. Such a core could be derived from the curatorial statement that, in order to achieve ‘shared benefits’ it ‘must be produced in</text>

Urban environments are the sites of many episodes of the biennial, and, as we shall see, are intimately related to the social contexts of art production. But, as we will show, this does not constitute the whole story. We need to know how the different episodes of the biennial relate to one another, and in what way the urban environment is constituted as a site of art production.  And this is where the biennial begins to tell a story, telling a story about social production, urbanism, and art in the city.  It is a story about the collective impact of a single event, and how it affects the psyches of artists, the public, and the political world at large.This is the urban story, and it is the urban story we will tell.

The biennial is, in fact, the most obvious and consistent example of a recurring exhibitionary form, occurring at regular intervals throughout the year, typically on the last Thursday of every month. It is a building exhibitionary form, and its appearance in the city represents, not least, the status conferred by such a form on the city, its wilderness, and its landscape.  A number of biennials have been convened in the last twenty years, most notably the 2011 Venice Biennale; the 2013 London and 2015 Istanbul Biennales; the 2012 L.A. and 2011 Istanbul Trekkers; and the 2015 New York and Berlin Philharmonic Finale, to name only a few recent examples.

The idea is to create environments that nurture ‘positive representations of themselves’ through actions such as planting trees or creating a ‘healthy and economically viable city tree plan’.3 This sounds simple enough, but the city has been slow to heal from the violence experienced during the 1980s and 1990s, and the social and political turmoil that followed, especially in the inner cities. The city is a site of domination and subjugation, and yet its trees provide a symbolic site of love and beauty in the face of the capitalist city. The idea is to create ‘positive representations of yourself’ through actions such as planting trees or creating a ‘healthy and economically viable city tree plan’. This sounds simple enough, and it is to a large extent due to the fact that cities still harbor a lot of the legacy of colonialism and racialised capitalism.

This is the contribution of artists, scholars, urbanists, urban activists and architects to a project that is part of a major international architecture conference, part of the Consejo de Trastornamento a.k.a. the Consejo Di Stefano – ‘The Arts and Architecture’, part of the ‘Consejo Di Stefano Cultural Centre’ in Lisbon, Portugal. The project, entitled  	Infrastructures of the City’s Ruins, is an art project commissioned by the city of Lisbon and part of the ‘Consejo Di Stefano Cultural Centre’ in 2009 and 2010 respectively. It was part of the larger</text>
    <text>The project is a speculation on the past, and the future is a mystery. We don’t have any idea where the story would lead us. It would be one of those moments when everything is possible, and yet nothing is possible.This is another instance of the city emerging, and the city as an object of contemplation. The city is a city of contradictions, and the contradictions are expressed through the city’s architecture: the presence of people, the presence of space, the presence of habit. The ‘city’ as object is a stumbling block in the project of constructing the city as a possible future. The city is a site of habit, and the question is what to do with the habit. We also know that the city is a site of violence and that it is time for the city to transition to a place of peace and quiet. How do we create opportunities for the city to heal and how to it return to being a place of possibilities?Through collaborative research and design, we can create the conditions for the healing of the city and its people. We know that when people are moved around within the city, they’re displaced and possibly return to the city in search of a new situation. Collaborative research and design can help create new ways of interacting with the city in the context of new possibilities. For example, the collaboration between the New York Public Library, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art led to the creation of a new exhibition format that addressed the past in an attempt to anticipate the future. This new exhibition format incorporated recordings of past exhibitions in an attempt to go beyond the static nature of the gallery and address the dynamic interactions between people and technology. This new way of interacting encouraged the participation of artists who were already artists or had artistic training, and enabled their work to stand out from the crowd. For example, the project ‘Architecture of the Postwar City’ for the book I am Writing This Summer, invited artists to explore</text>

How do we create opportunities for the city to heal and how to it return to being a place of possibilities?Through collaborative research and design, we can create the possibility of a ‘city of possibilities’ through the mechanisms of habit and violence, and through the activities of a city council. We can create what Lacy calls a ‘city of habitation’ through the mechanisms of habitation, such as the ‘housing search committee’ or the ‘improvement committee’ that examines development proposals. These committees are the visible articulations of the city’s fragmented and displaced population. These mechanisms allow for the creation of possible futures through the coordination of disparate activities. The committee meetings I lead, the ward meetings, the parks committee meetings, the neighbourhood fairs, the Christmas tree lighting […] the list goes on. These are not arbitrary or capricious. These are the direct outcomes of the very complex socio-political-economic interactions that shape and define the city. Their organisation, their focus, their decisions, and their execution speak to a future that is not arbitrary, capricious, or unsustainable. Council</text>

How do we create opportunities for the city to heal and how to it return to being a place of possibilities?Through collaborative research and design, we can create what Benjamin Bratton calls ‘compact, multifunctional sites’. These compact, multifunctional sites were developed as ‘action points’ in a city’s redevelopment process. The idea is that the city would become what Bratton calls a ‘fugitive’, and not what it is, returning to the state of nature in which it was originally found. A city that has abandoned its original form and is instead defined by its developed form – a development that can take many forms – would be an island in the river Styx. Cities that abandon their history but instead construct utopic futures – places where people’s history is written and rewritten – would be coastal islands in the ocean.The idea of the city as an island in the ocean may be new to us, but it is becoming increasingly common. The American dream is the archetypal American dream, but Bratton’s dream is becoming increasingly plausible. In places where</text>

How do we create opportunities for the city to heal and how to it return to being a place of possibilities?Through collaborative research and design, we can create what is perhaps a benchmark for future urban developments worldwide. We can create what architect Frank Gehry would call an ‘image bank’ that would hold the fragmented and fragmented fragments of information about the city of the future, and enable artists and designers to draw upon this information to create new urban environments. Our image bank could operate on the assumption that there are no explosions going on, allowing artists and designers to create alternative future urban settings where people can live free from the fear of destruction.The image bank could also operate on the assumption that there are no wars going on, allowing artists and designers to imagine a world in which architecture does not directly represent the socio-political situation of peoples everywhere. For example, the image of a city without skyscrapers or aftershave could lead creatives astray by suggesting a return to the tranquillity and serenity of cityscapes, as in Mt. Rushmore, where the characters live amidst the mass graves of soldiers who died in</text>

How do we create opportunities for the city to heal and how to it return to being a place of possibilities?Through collaborative research and design, we can create what Robert H MacDonald called The Community Land Trust. The Community Land Trust is a new paradigm for the management of urban resources. It is a new paradigm for the management of resources through a partnership between a community and a non-community organisation. It is a paradigm shift in the agency of the people with a stake in the outcome of a project, and in the relationship between the state and the people. The Community Land Trust is a partnership between the city and the Montessori school district. The city manages the district’s land and resources, while the school district manages the houses purchased with district funding. The Community Land Trust is a new paradigm for the management of housing and resources in the district. It maximises the benefits of the district’s housing stock while minimising the risks to the residents of the district. The objective of the Community Land Trust is to develop and deliver sustainable housing options for 150 to 300 families with different needs through cooperative housing, education and research.

How do we create opportunities for the city to heal and how to it return to being a place of possibilities?Through collaborative research and design, we can create what Carolee King calls a ‘city of contradictions’. This is a city of possibilities, where different cultural groups can live, work and play freely; a city where art, culture and commerce can flourish; a city where there is no economic imperative to develop ever-more-complex ways of living in the form of buildings and suburbs, which inevitably follow the cities that’re built on the contradictory relationships between people. The contradiction in the city is generated by the contradictions inherent in the capitalist mode of production.The third example is found in the book Radical Architecture: Tenants Union and Community Land Trusts in the 1970s and 1980s. Tenants in the rental sector were major tenants in the 1980s and early 1990s, and the authors of the book spoke about how the concerns of the community were often at odds with the priorities of the landlord class. Tenants in the '80s and early 1990s were largely made up of migrants from the North and the</text>

How do we create opportunities for the city to heal and how to it return to being a place of possibilities?Through collaborative research and design, we can create what Wolfgang Ernst calls ‘a living contradiction matrix’. This is a living modification of the contradictions of the city, in which the project of construction is juxtaposed with the project of habit, in which the city represents a potential future for the future. New possibilities emerge when the contradiction between the two is evaluated. In this model of the paradoxical predicament of the urban predicament, the city represents the potentiality of a new type of being that can be built upon the contradictions of the past, including new forms of living forms capable of constituting a new urbanity. New contradictions emerge when the contradiction between the city and the past is analyzed. For example, the contradiction between the intensive urban redevelopment that is undertaken in Germany and the historical preservation of historic character of the German cities, such as the ‘Berlin of the future’, a hybridised form of ‘traditional’ and ‘future’ that is actively promoted by and in collaboration with the city government.</text>

    prototype for an intelligent curatorial system that collects, sorts, analyzes and narrates cultural significance through data augmentation and contextualization.[4] The aim of the project is to create a public sphere of cultural values and practices responsive to the public sphere of information gathering and dissemination envisioned by the biennial’s mandate.  In the case of a biennial that is not a permanent institution, the public sphere is usually defined as the public domain in which art, art’s public, takes a given place. It is here that a biennial can lay claim to the public, while simultaneously constituting a private entity separate from and above the public sphere. Art’s public, or permanent public, is the locus classicus of the biennial, and the site of its ongoing operations. It is a site of ongoing encounter, an ever-present topic of exchange, and a site of possible change.  The public sphere, then, includes the public (artists) and the public (the public).

It is both the site and the act of searching for meaning in the unpredictable. It is a site of encounter, and a site of possible change. The public realm therefore contains both private and public realms. It is both the site and the act of gathering information. It is the case of asking, and the answer to that question is always, ‘yes’. It is similarly the case of not knowing, which is to be expected in the art world, since a public sphere is supposed to be unknowable. In this sense, then, biennials can be considered to be sites of potentiality, of which the potentiality is both present and actively sought after. In other words, biennials can be seen to be works in progress, unfinished, and in some cases actively sabotaging one another. This is particularly the case with biennials of cultural value, such as those of a particular biennial, such as Venice, that become more and more influential with each passing</text>

It is a site of interaction, of encounter, and it is a site of change. It is precisely because the public realm is so fundamental to the biennial that its site is selected by art professionals, and only by them, as a site for ongoing cultural exchange. Art’s constant dialogue with the public is an essential precondition of the biennial becoming a permanent institution of cultural exchange. If it is not, perhaps, cultural exchange, then it will not be permanent. Art’s constant social and cultural encounters, whether as an artist or a curator, is what makes it permanent. And it is precisely in these social encounters that the biennial as a whole becomes visible. It is precisely in these contexts that the biennial becomes culturally responsive. If the public realm is understood as one in which art is produced in close proximity to the artist’s location and settings (including the city), then the biennial itself becomes what it professes to be: a site of</text>

It is a site of interaction, and as such, it is an ideal site for the development of biennials’ public spheres. It is a site of encounters, and as such, it is a site of change. It contains the very essence of what Bisser and I would define as the archetypal biennial: the ancient boat, the temple, the marketplace, the house, the street, the river, the park, the sea and the fields. It is a site of encounter, and as such, it constitutes a site of transition, a site of encounter that begins with an encounter and ends with a confluence of experiences. It contains what I would call ‘the biennial equivalent of the Greek and Roman arenas, with the ancient rites and figures again and again and again and again and again’. It is a ‘truly global’ site: locating itself in both national capital cities and in other regions of the world, but also in its</text>

Art is an inherently political act, and as such must always be sensitive to the politics of its subject matter.  Art’s public, then, is made up of both visible and invisible elements. It carries with it logic of its own, and it is this complexity of meaning that makes it art.  Art’s public is ever-evolving, and its public is precisely what makes it different from other forms of art.  Art has a public sphere because its public is perpetually engaged with, and its public is ever-expanding in response to, the activities of its art. Its public is an ongoing exercise in the meaning of the word;</text>

It includes audiences outside of the gallery environment and within the art gallery environment (including museum visitors) and it includes a range of stakeholders including artists, curators, administrators, students, activists, politicians, legal experts, journalists, fans, community organisers, politicians, collectors, corporate raisers, private equity firms, foundations, foundations ​and on and on. It also includes past and future exhibitions, lectures, performances, competitions and other forms of cultural activity.

Art’s public involves actors beyond the curatorial team, publics of various kinds, from artists to curators to journalists to fans to stakeholders across the social and cultural web. It is a collective of people coming together across different modes of cultural consumption to make art happen, whether through art collections, exhibitions, performances, performances, trade shows, blogs, films, videos or any other creative means.  Art’s public, then, engages with the notion of power structures and institutionalised forms of knowledge production that pervade contemporary art today, and that shape creative acts and result in institutionalised forms of knowledge.

As biennials become more institutionalized – entwined with museum collections and other institutional forms, and subject to the institutional logic of their respective worlds – they lose their public characteristics. But publics still exist to this day, in the form of a surrogate audience for art that is still being made, or is at least making it in perpetuity – namely, those who visit museums, and other institutional venues, and those who use and visit art’s social networks (link is an online journal).  The public is the site of encounter for both the artist and the visitor, and the biennial is the site of that encounter. The visitor is not just any visitor: the biennial necessarily faces the visitor from the museum or other institution, and the visitor is the visitor from</text>

Art’s public,  ‘as we encounter it, as it happens, in various forms, and in the history of art’s own continual unfolding’, is a phenomenon that is constantly (re)present. It is art’s most real and constant public, and its constitutive element.  Art’s public, however, is also sensitive to the biennial’s increasing institutionalisation. It repeatedly articulates the need to be cognizant of its finite situation, while simultaneously demanding greater powers from the biennial itself. It calls for a public sphere that is independent, capable and vigilant, but above all prescriptive and circumlocutory. It emphasizes the importance of resisting the increasingly dominant forms of art’s public, while simultaneously demanding that the institution that created them (art) should suffer the consequences of its actions.

It is a site where different kinds of ‘public’ can live together in freedom and accord.  Art’s public, moreover, is becoming ever more individualised: individualised in the sense that it is the observer, not the instigator, of an art event. As events such as the Venice Biennale and the Edinburgh Biennial have shown, biennials can also act as agents of change, sometimes quite spectacularly so. We, the public, are thus led to expect a great deal from biennials. We must also demand a great deal from artists who employ creative practices in the public sphere. Biennials are the sites of their own growth, and their activities must be seen to contribute something to the development of their local artworlds</text>

It is subject to biennial councils and boards of governors, which may or may not be responsive to the public’s interests. It is subject to the law of nations, which may or may not be public. It is also subject to its local values, which may or may not be public.  Biennials tend to engage with these issues via material that is of general application (material that is valued and accepted by the general public), and which is frequently contextual. They are often curatorial in their approaches to the public sphere, and tend to draw on a common vocabulary and philosophical framework that applies to the larger world of art world life.  Biennials have a public until the point at which they become private, and then claim a permanent public sphere, which can then be either private or public.  Biennial councils and boards</text>

    The project is a speculation on the real estate market, but it does have the power to move objects, and the ability to record and project these objects ‘out there’ in the real-time.’[3] This is a more fundamental aspect of the project, and it is no exaggeration to say that this is what Oulson refers to when he speaks of ‘the ghost cities’ that exist in the real-world, but they are not so ghostly as the urban myths of pre-capitalist postindustrial societies.

Urbanisation, no matter how necessary in the current global economic system, is never fully achieved in the urban space, and the reason for this is that the economics that generate the social need for transport infrastructure – roads, bridges, tunnels – remain fictitious in the context of capitalist infrastructure. The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the political and economic entanglements that flow from it, are similar to those that underlie the housing crisis in the US – namely, the greed and predation of investors and the financial sector – though the crucial difference is that in the postindustrial zone, these contradictions are much more apparent. Despite the obvious infrastructural needs – roads, bridges, tunnels – the infrastructural market today is a very different beast from the market of yesteryear, and while there are certainly elements of similarity between the two, the current market economy demands much more from infrastructure than it can give, and so it tends to overbuild infrastructure and create bottlenecks. The market today expects much more from its citizens, and so it tends to produce citizens who are not only compliant with its economic and social rules, but also incredibly talented and resourceful managers of resources – those able to operate systems that can sustainably deliver goods and services to consumers – though these workers also have to be nimble</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the political and legal ambiguities that emerge from it, play out in different contexts, and different citizens of the city exert different levels of control over the allocation of such spaces. 	In the broadest conception of the urban, parking is a necessity in the current mode of production, but in the current phase of its development, it is a fiction that can no longer be trusted. The space that is now scarce but valuable – the ‘parking deck’ – is replaced with a ‘shopping mall’. The shifting of space and the shifting of use are the stories that play out in different settings, and the reason why different stories are told. In the context of the metropolis, the metainterface becomes a fiction. Parking is no longer a necessity, but a fantasy that is replaced by a more natural and easier to use form of space. 	The metainterface thus becomes both more real and more disposable. It is no longer confined to</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the deindustrialisation of the Rust Belt in particular, continue to be used by the capitalist public relations machine in an attempt to rebrand infrastructure and its provisioning function as something desirable and desirable in the public imagination. When the parking crisis became acute in Detroit in the mid-1990s, for instance, the crisis was used to generate a publicity campaign in order to downsize and displace the city’s sizeable African-American community. The crisis was also used by the media to downplay the significance of the city’s rapidly expanding African-American population, as well as to generate support for the heavily African-American and minority-owned taxi and limousine companies – companies that were already heavily involved in the criminal justice system at large – in order to bolster their own position and bargaining position. The massive influx of African-American and Latino workers into the city during this period is often misconstrued as a mass black unemployment or urban crisis, as in the popularised urban myth</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the related crisis of housing affordability, make visible the political and material imbalances that shape urban development in the global south, and these dynamics influence the decision-making bodies that sit on the boards of major transport companies. The issue that emerges is how to build new housing in areas hardest hit by the crisis of housing affordability, while simultaneously creating a social context in which to do so. In the words of Gregory Ulmer, who directed the Museum of Transport &amp; Travel in Oslo during the 1980s, ‘the museum became a site for experimenting with new exhibition forms, including guided tours and virtual tours’.[4] These are the times when art and transport were as ubiquitous as they are now, and art is an essential component of the social and spatial infrastructure of postindustrial society. Art, and the seemingly unlimited flow of images it produced, permeated all aspects of the global transport landscape. Travel was a necessity for most people in postindustrial society. But the growth of the bienn</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the political responses that have precipitated it, is a mythic situation in the making, but it is one that continues to be experienced by many people in the global south.  	Because of the way in which parking is provisioned in postindustrial societies, it is not uncommon for people to have multiple forms of transport available at the same time. 	In many urban settings, the availability of cars and minibuses is constrained to a certain extent due to the fact that they are embedded in an infrastructure that is fragile and subject to the whims of a rapidly changing economy. In such settings, the car becomes a scarce resource, and the minibus a scarce commodity. 	The proliferation of cars and minibuses in the global south is largely a result of government policies and programmes, which have come to endorse the use of both modes of transportation over the past several decades. 	In the age of the car and the minibus, the institutional memory of the car is a scarce</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the political dilemmas that it creates, shape how the city is distributed, distributed and plans are formulated. The power to regulate parking, as well as to design and build new parking infrastructure, resides in the hands of cities and metropolitan regions, which together with states – which together with local authorities also play a role in this system – form the global parking framework. The global parking framework is a political fiction, but cities and regions do have political, legal and social power, and they can exert this power through various means, including direct action and lobbying. The global parking framework is an artifact of the postindustrial economy, but it continues to play a pivotal role in the global economy. The global parking framework is the sole preserve of the urbanised and suburbanised. It is a fiction created in the globalised capitalist economy. Although the postindustrial economy no longer dominates all sectors of the global economy, it still produces a fictionally massive amount of social and political change, both domestically and geopolitically</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the political position of cities in the wake of it, show that postindustrial is not all bad. But the ability of artists to reconfigure social space through the power of the Space-Round is what really stands out in this ongoing exhibition. Although the spaces they occupy are now centrally located, and are often quite popular with tourists, they are also often empty and dilapidated. This is evident in the artwork on the walls of the new museum being developed in the wake of the Space-Round, where artists are instructed to deconstruct the perception of space by breaking it into small tasks. The new museum will have a dedicated ‘space of habitation’ within its walls, a fantasy of permanent green space surrounded by a ‘shiny tower’ of flats and condos. The towers will rise 668 metres and be able to accommodate 10,000 cars, as high as 120 storeys. But this fantasy of permanent green space and placid suburban life does not exist in the real</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the political and legal standpoints that have to be faced in order to be implemented in order to address it, means that the social and political struggles that have been generated by the crisis are still to be fully addressed. The project itself is just one piece in a much larger social and political puzzle that has to be assembled. The rest of the piece has to come from different angles – political, economic and economical – and they have to all be woven into a coherent whole in order to create a truly shared sense of the place that represents the city. This is no small undertaking, and it is not an easy thing to pull off. But the important thing is that the city is created through this process – that is, until now. This is why so many artists, including those in the movement that is often called ‘postindustrial’, have their studios in areas where the social needs are met, such as schools, parks, community centres, sporting grounds, cultural centres and on the waterfronts</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the reasons for which have remained opaque, play out behind the scenes in the realm of infrastructure, but the social consequences are felt when the social need for parking is felt. This is what Oulson means when he speaks of ‘the ghost cities’ – the real-world manifestations of his ideas. He does not, however, fully grasp the symbolic power that his architectural speculation has within the larger framework of postindustrial society. The urban space that has been built through the mechanisms of capitalism is an urban space that is, in the final analysis, disposable. This is why Oulson is so disturbed by the proliferation of skyscrapers in some of his more apocalyptic visions: the rottenness that characterises the condition of capitalism in the developed world is emphasised in the urban skyline. But he does perceive a certain symbolic potency to the urbanisation of the developed world. More and more of the world is becoming urbanised, and the global transport network is being expanded by the day. The</text>

The social need for parking remains fictitious in the context of postindustrial society, since parking is now simply part of the provisioning function of infrastructure. The dynamics of the parking crisis, and the ways in which city residents and workers are implicated in its resolution, are different from those of the financial crisis, and the social and political changes that have to be enacted in order to address the underlying causes of the crisis. But the basic dynamics of the crisis remain the same: there is too much capacity built into the infrastructure of the city for too few people to be able to access it, and this fact shapes what kinds of social and political changes are needed.When I started this project, I set out to understand how the museum form could be used to address the social and political dimensions of the crisis, and how art could be used to create a new kind of spatiality that would no longer conform to the static parameters of the city. I also set out to understand how the museum form could be transformed in order to meet the needs of the urban poor and the underclass. I came to understand that the role of the museum is fundamentally to anesthetise the visitor, and to render</text>

I focus on the social and political upheavals in the region that resulted from the Arab Spring and the Arab Winter. The term ‘transformation’ suggests a long-term perspective and while I initially choose to look at the immediate future in terms of the past, I also introduce genres such as ‘episodes’ and ‘consequences’. These shifts in the historical order have a material and transformational impact on our lives as we move forward, but they also have a transformative impact on the realms of imagination and consciousness. How we perceive and act upon these big-picture social changes – both positive and negative – shapes our view of the world and our ability to imagine new futures for ourselves and those around us.

I focus on the social and political implications of the book for the Arab World; the social and political changes as a result of neoliberalism and the concomitant rise of a new global economy; and the complex web of state, non-state, and social policies that are being implemented in the Arab World today. In the process, I engage with the ways in which the social and cultural histories of the 1990s are being rewritten, and how the social and spatial conditions that emerged from that historical trauma are being reshaped by the logic of neoliberalism. In my view, the main innovations that are being made in the Arab World today are created through the sustained, multi-generational circulation of knowledge generated during the last hundred years of the global economy. As a result of the biennial, there are now more than two hundred and fifty biennials operating in thirty-five countries around the world, with an assortment of creative curators, including myself, providing a wealth of knowledge on a regular basis.

I focus on the social and political context of the projects, considering their social and cultural dimensions. The term ‘transformation’ refers to a public policy that aims to transform a given situation through change, while the project takes this a step further and strives to create a new future through change. In this book, I discuss the ways in which the projects form part of a continuing dialogue between contemporary art and political and economic power, between artist and audience, between nations and cultures, between people and space. Through a combination of archival research, interviews and re-enactments, the book presents the themes and the development of the projects that emerged from my doctoral research. I also introduce the art projects that were part of the project, both in the UK and internationally. The project was a multi-disciplinary one, and encompassed a wide range of expertise, making it possible to achieve a substantial number of projects through one curatorial intervention.

The project gained international renown when it was presented at the Venice Biennale, and is featured in many books, videos and photos from the event.3  In my research, I capture the moment when a project becomes a ‘street project’, as it were. I do this through photographs, texts, reports and videos, taking the stories that emerge from the project as a whole as a narrative and mapping it across multiple sites and time periods. My process starts from the beginning, as a narrative, capturing the imagination of the public as a whole through word and image capture. As the project evolves, this element of narrative becomes increasingly important, as it allows the public to identify with the project in ways that it may not otherwise connect with, giving it voice and agency.

I focus on the social and political context in which the project was conceived, in order to show how the current geopolitical situation in the Arab World can be seen as the direct outcome of the specific ideas and proposals of a small group of British cultural theorists. The project then moves to 2018 with the publication of the second edition of the journal PLATO,3 which will present the results of a survey of Arab revolutions that began in 2014 and will be published in 2019. The survey will be based on the book and the participant states that participated in it. The anthology will be published in November 2019. The project moved into 2018, and with it, a new kind of complexity: the kind of complexity that comes with, among other things, the requirement to constantly reinvent yourself as a curator, an audience, a researcher, and a curator. This kind of complexity demands a high level of self-belief and self-awareness, an ability to engage with new ideas and knowledge, and the ability to adapt those ideas and knowledge to fit</text>

I focus on the social and political contexts of the events, including the role of artists and the rise of new media. The book is a response to the 2008 financial crisis and political instability sparked by those crises, and the subsequent two centuries of colonialism and apartheid in the Arab World. It was a year in which a critical reading of the postmodernist tradition emerged, alongside critical looks at contemporary cultural production and its impact on communities. It marked a critical turning away from the media of representation and consumption, and towards the production of social life through grassroots art and grassroots activism. And it coincided with a critical, albeit temporary, look at art and its place in society.  The project gained momentum as a blog, social media platform and cinematic branch, with new media (video, audio and still photography) and new media (movies, theatre, dance) regularly joining the project.

I focus on the social and political changes that transform the social and cultural landscape in the Arab World in the wake of the Arab Spring, and also on the evolution of post-Arab Spring movements in Eastern Europe, Russia, and Africa. In approaching the topic from a sociologist’s point of view, my project uses archival research, memoirs, diaries, aerial photographs, film, and the text that has come to define contemporary Arab Spring. The project is also premised on the understanding that the world we inhabit is becoming ever more complex and unpredictable. As sociologist, Harvey narrates the book as a narrative that emerges from various points of view, placing particular focus on the lives of the people he interviews. He also employs archival research to trace particular cultural migrations, focusing particularly on the journeys of the artist Ai Weiwei, the designer Fadi Javeed and the writer Ahmed Mansur as they move from East to West, between China and Europe.

I use the term ‘transformation’ to describe the economic changes induced by these economic and financial systems, but also the social and cultural changes that follow from these. In other words, social and cultural changes that emerge from these economic systems. I use the term ‘transformative’ to describe the social and cultural changes resulting from this critical economic moment, but also the political and legal changes that result from the subsequent emergence of new social forms and ideologies.3  For more about the ‘transformation’ and ‘transformative’ dimensions of the project, see the book's preface.4  The project was originally conceived as a two-year, two-short course, but as the name suggests, this is extended to three years and three-quarters of the course.

The project was supported by the British Council and the DA.The 2016 Biennial, curated by Andy Warhol and Jeffrey Hewison, explored the biennial as a co-constitutive cultural process that is deeply informed by the notions of global circulation and the metainterface. Using the term ‘biennial’ suggests a critical interconnection among art, commerce, and politics, but more accurately describes a periodic, multi-year, multi-edition, or ‘biennial’ that is potentially multiples of its initial size. The term is often misused in the contemporary artworld, where the elements of the ‘biennial’ that are most directly tied to contemporary conditions (such as the biennial as a curatorial strategy or the curatorial persona) are often over-emphasised. Despite this tendency, the contemporary biennial can be seen to be evolving in a series</text>

I focus on the social and political upheavals that emerged in the wake of the Arab Spring, the creation of an independent media in the Middle East, and the expansion of the global slave market. In ‘the end game’ of the project, I write that events in the region will prove ‘a thousand times more revealing than the actions of a single family or individual’.3  These events triggered an expansive global reaction including a conscious or deliberate decision to intervene in the internal affairs of nations, cultures, or even entire regions. I come to this through three broad perspectives or narratives.  The first is the globalised or globalised portrayal of the past that seeks to imbricate the present and future through the exchange of commodities and other anthropogenic commodities. This is often called ‘metainformation’ and concerns the phenomenon of global capitalism. The second is the critical or long view perspective perspective that questions the role of nation, state, and economy in the social formation and function of urban</text>

Art as a relational form of relationality. There is a tension between the capacities of artists and audiences to engage with art in meaningful ways, and the capacities of art institutions to make meaningful contributions to social and political change. It is true that the contemporary art institution has a high degree of autonomy in shaping its cultural profile and in so doing is able to open new artistic and social experiences. But this comes at a cost: the institutions that emerged after the biennale are much more restrained, controlling and reliant on the artist. They are less able to engage with the dynamic of contemporaneity and are less able to engage with changes in their geographical location and time zones.

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial approach. This is perhaps one reason for the increased uniformity of the biennale’s curatorial practices: the biennale is able to stipulate with great precision what constitutes an art institution and what constitutes an art project. However, the biennale tends to produce a range of responses that are not guided by the norms and values of art today and in its current form this range is under threat. At the same time, biennales are frequently placed in the context of contemporary art, and in this sense can play off one another. For example, the Venice Biennale was a notable exception to its uniform curatorial policy in this respect, engaging with the city’s cultural life through its art education and outreach programme. Curatorial tendencies towards biennalisation have become more prominent in recent years, perhaps reflecting the pressures of balancing art and art institutions.

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial approach – a posture that seems to obscure and obscure the truth, while at the same time sustaining the very real relations of power and domination that exist between nation and people. The biennial is no longer confined to a single artworld or venue; it operates globally, and in so far as it is intertwined with other cultural activities, including those that are not necessarily art exhibitions. Contemporary art is no longer the sole cultural form to be found in a city; it is becoming increasingly evident that many other cultural forms are also present in the surrounding context (cultural tourism is a huge business in its own right). Cultural tourism has become a multibillion-dollar business, and is characterised by the commissioning of ‘unique’ experiences through ‘cultural tourism’, a.k.a. ‘cultural exchange’.

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial language that it uses across institutions and disciplines. And this has come at a cost: the biennale is no longer able to operate according to the assumptions of its historical location and internationalism, which have resulted in a biennale being placed in locations around the world where it is not at home, or where it is not at home but has the capacity to shape social and political landscape. This can be seen in the biennale’s 2017 decision to place itself in the city of Rome, following its historical practice of staging large-scale exhibitions of works from other cities in Rome. And it can be seen in the 2018 decision by the Venice Biennale to relocate its exhibition from the Giardini and the Arsenale to the Arsenale Venetian, following a similar move by the Giardini.3. Biennales and their spatial limits. The biennale has traditionally been seen as a discrete and specialist art form that excels at capturing the imagination</text>

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial approach. This is particularly evident in the role of the artist-organisation, which has often been accused of being trapped in a hierarchical and commercialistic structure. In a recent monograph on the biennale, Carol Becker and Christine McBride make several proposals about the curatorial role: the extent to which curatorial actions are actually acts of capital formation, and the social and political effects of this formation; what the curatorial contribution to the artworld could be in the context of a possible future artworld; and how the curatorial can assume a new role in the public arena.3. Biennale as a short-lived art form. The modern biennial has its roots in the Venice Biennale, an international art fair that began in 1893, and its continuation in 1979. The Venice Biennale itself began in 1591 and ran for nine more years before it was closed down by the city council. Its final report in 1991 identified a number of 'serious curatorial defects</text>

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial approach and this has come at the expense of the improvisational and idiosyncratic artist’s curatorial practice. The biennale is also a complex institution that has developed complex relationships with its host city and the wider region in which it takes place. For New York City, the biennale has tended to inhabit the city centre while its host city, Mid-America,3 so it’s easy to identify the biennale as an event that takes place in and through the city. But for other cities, the event occurs in and is confined to their outer boroughs. In fact, the biennale’s present position in other cities is such that it’s difficult to tell the two apart. In 1993, for example, the Venice Biennale took place in a citywide ‘chronic art’ carnival’, while in 2014, London’s Plinth Planets opened a world-renowned gallery in the Welsh Streets</text>

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial approach to art’s social production, institutionalisation and politics. In this way, the biennale has tended to constrain cultural freedom and political expression in the sense that art is constrained by the institutions that it is invited to form.3. Biennale as a temporal form. The biennale is a temporal phenomenon that emerges in the twenty-first century. It is a periodic, multi-year event that occurs every two years. It is a sort of episodic ‘second’ to ‘third’ of a ‘second’, occurring between biennials that often overlap (e.g. between the American and the Russian biennials). It is a type of ‘temporal’ that is present in contemporary art at a global and regional scale. It characterises contemporary art’s temporal situation vis-a-vis its pre-digital (i.e. pre-internet) predecessor, and in particular, the post</text>

But this comes at a cost: the institutions that emerged after the biennale are much more restrained, controlling and reliant on the artist. They are less able to engage with the dynamic of contemporaneity and are less able to engage with changes in their geographical location and time zones. This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial approach that tends to dominate and define the art form. This is particularly evident in the biennale of the same year, where different artworlds have adopted a common concept and agreed conventionally that an art institution should be located in a particular city or particular region. But this uniformity and the constraint it places on the biennale are gradually being replaced with dynamic local considerations that seek to find new ways of existing in the city. The biennale that emerges in the new century will be more like the biennale that emerged in the eighteenth century or the nineteenth century, in that it will exhibit recurrent patterns and recurrent themes that trace back to a common origin but diverge from the trends and practices of the present. It will exhibit artists from different times and places who have taken the same or similar positions, often in radically similar ways, on fundamental questions of politics, aesthetics, history and society. It will often engage with themes of its localisation, of course, but will also employ</text>

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial style. This uniformity and timeliness is often misinterpreted as an artist’s point of departure, but it is in fact an obstacle to any number of other creative and interesting ideas and approaches. The biennale has tended to isolate certain elements and projects from others, and thereby to institutionalise certain kinds of social and political interaction. This isolation and conservatism is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has often been criticised for being too rigid and particularist. But this isolation and conservatism is even more evident in the curatorial role at the Tate, where the biennale has often been accused of being apolitical. This is despite the fact that the biennale has a mission statement that explicitly states that it is a ‘rejection of uniformity and predictability’.3. Biennale roles as exhibitionists and festivals.

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial approach and to rely on a single set of styles and authors. This uniformity and dependency on an author's stylized image of the same imagery is in part a function of the institutional memory of the artist as a curator, who can choose to remember the artist’s ‘birthplace’ or ‘time period’ or ‘place and time’ or ‘culture of the present’ or ‘language of the present’ or ‘culture of the future’ or ‘time of all cultures’.3. Biennials as platforms for radical social change. Biennials have a particular place in our talk of ‘the contemporary condition’ because they are the most readily available and are the most readily identifiable: they are symbols and ways to communicate in a public arena, a marketplace, and a celluloid-and-paper archive. They are places of encounter, acquisition, exchange and discovery. And, in the age of</text>

This dynamic is particularly evident in the curatorial role, where the biennale has tended to adopt a uniform and 'natural' curatorial approach. In contrast, biennials have tended to exhibit a range of styles and styles, and have strategically placed specific artists within this range, often through research projects. As a consequence, the ways in which art is reproduced, consumed, appreciated and communicated in the contemporary context is constantly shifting. This in turn tends to alter the boundaries of what is considered art and contemporary art. Biennials in their current form have tended to neglect or completely ignore the past; creating a nostalgic or idealised image of art as if it were on the cusp of a new aesthetic revolution. In this context, biennials can be seen to be particularly susceptible to this nostalgic image forming, and this can happen in two ways: (a) through a pure nostalgia for the past curatorial tendencies of the biennale; or (b) through a ‘false sense of historical authenticity’ associated with contemporary art institutions.3.

The museum of every kind became, in a word, heterogeneous. At times it was a museum of the aristocracy, at others a museum of the common people. At its best it displayed the most astonishing variety of cultures, of which the Italian and the other artists were the most authentic.The museum of every kind then, and still today, attempts to represent all of these diverse aspects of its subject's life. It seeks to understand them through the things that, in a given moment, are most relevant to that subject. It shows you, for example, how that Italian painter Piero Concepi, in his famous painting The Empty Space of 1968, represents the political and urban crisis of Rome during the transition from Pinochet to the Giardini.

It began a dialogue with the world around it, engaging with its built environment in ever greater detail, creating virtual walls and architectural works that defy description. It celebrated creation everywhere it was seen, which in turn encouraged a dialogue with itself. It collected, analysed and interpreted, which in turn created worlds and narratives. And so it went, ever on, gathering ever larger collections of information, images, experiences, artefacts and stories. It was the metadata of a very different kind of biennial.In the last analysis, the museum of every kind is only ever going to be a snapshot in time.

And it continued to do this, uninterrupted by legal or regulatory barriers, across the twentieth century.As a visitor to the museum of every kind, I am constantly impressed by the ubiquity of this phrase, by the way in which it encapsulates both the natural and the artificial in a single concept.

The important thing about the museum of every kind is that it is constantly on the point of being transfixed by otherness, that it is constantly on the lookout for the new. It has to be constantly on the alert, otherwise you will lose interest in the things you do not yet know. The important thing about the museum of every kind is that it is a house divided. Inside, the house is divided into two, and the odd nook and cranny is added.  The interesting thing about the biennale, in my opinion, is that it is always depicted as a house divided.

It became a hub for the exchange of ideas, a place of repurposing, a laboratory for the deployment of knowledge, a prototype for the institutionalization of knowledge, and – most of all – a place where the impossible could be made manifest. This is the second of a three-part essay in this issue of the journal Symbolic Media (originally published in 2014 in issue of Digital S.M.R.). Part one summarizes the collection’s history, part two attempts to make sense of its ever-present (and increasingly global) mix of odd, shiny, torn, mangled, pulverized and all other kinds of media artifacts and materials.

It became, in other words, the art institution of the twenty-first century. The museum of every kind represents the world as it is, from every conceivable point of view, and in that sense is everywhere present. But the museum of every kind is nowhere and never, which is why it closes.The museum of every kind also represents a possible future for the human condition, in the form of cities that are as smart as computers and capable of reading and understanding all kinds of data as any of them. The city is becoming ever more like a computer, part of a system that not only understands but also augments and optimizes itself. The more we think about cities the smarter they become, and the more data they hold, the more images they process and the richer images they create, the more data they collect and transmit, the more data they store, the more protocols they implement, the more media they play with and use, the more</text>

The collection, including its title, the collection, as a collection of artefacts, made a statement about time and space. It was a statement about the temporal complexity of life on Earth, and made possible all manner of time travel. In other words, it indicated the temporal complexity of our own condition. I have a theory. It is a point in time that is defined by the performance of a set of relations. It is a space in which the impossible can happen.This is the point in time that is being defined by the performance of a set of relations. The performance of these relations, or act of performing them, is what I call ‘space-time’. It is what Lefebvre called ‘the great convulsion of space’.

This was the very definition of a ‘biennial’; it was a kind of urban/tourism alternative, where the art resided not in the form of artefacts or collections of artefacts, but by way of continuously evolving collections of objects, objects, practices, performances, assemblages, and collections. It represented the cultural equivalent of a museum in that its permanent exhibitionality combined with the museum-like structure of an archive, and thereby the permanent recording of the past. It was a kind of blending of art and archive, the former with the latter.This ancient, medieval and Renaissance impulse to archive, to come to terms with the way in which collections work through time and space is the very impulse that continues to animate, if not to name it. It is the essential, irresistible urge to archive, to come to terms with the fact that, every day, new things come into being, and that these come with greater and greater complexity and change.</text>

This is particularly true of nations such as the United States and Britain, which have become increasingly reliant on fossil fuels and are now at war with the planet in an apocalyptic ‘thermodynamic zero’ scenario. The proliferation of automated research and development centres coupled with the proliferation of large data capture and processing units is a constant struggle to keep up with the ever-growing number of data sources and platforms. As a result, the city has become a confined space with limited capacities. This is particularly evident in the financial district, where the proliferation of financial data capture and reporting (QGDR) has created what Tiziana Terranova and her colleagues call a ‘digital goldmine’ – a finite resource that can only be accessed by a few privileged individuals. The digital goldmine has its uses, but until recently the city has mostly been used as a site for speculative and speculative capital accumulation. This dynamic has created a situation in which many people in the financial district, including hedge funds, large pension funds and private equity firms, have a clear advantage over people of modest means. While people with modest means may own stock and other assets, they are mainly dependent on financial instruments such as mortgages and credit cards. Moreover,</text>

This is particularly true of nations such as the United States and Britain, which have become increasingly reliant on fossil fuels and are now at war with the planet in an apocalyptic ‘thermodynamic zero’ scenario. The proliferation of non-conventional forms of industry, the proliferation of finance capital and the proliferation of technology have all but destroyed much of what remains of what was once considered ‘the Second Industrial Revolution’. 	There are, however, those who still cling to the notion that there is life in a traditional, medieval, feudal or bureaucratic setting. These people still believe that the future belongs to the old ways, in which the past is pastiche to presentist, and that the present – which is essentially a set of past failures – constitutes the past. In such traditional forms of bureaucracy, expertise is delegated from the top down to the bottom up, and thus the bureaucratic logic of an organisation is always on the hunt for ways to minimise disruption and maximise efficiency. 	Such organisations – whether state or non-state – are inherently creative in their own way, driven by an urge to fail miserably in order to try again. But the dynamic of the postindustrial city has changed. The</text>

This is particularly true of nations such as the United States and Britain, which have become increasingly reliant on fossil fuels and are now at war with the planet in an apocalyptic ‘thermodynamic zero’ scenario. The proliferation of automated manufacturing plants, roads and bridges, along with the privatising of urban infrastructure, has placed a great burden on those citizens still left on the land – in the form of roads and buildings – but which also includes the pressing need to constantly replenish urban water and energy supplies. Postindustrial urbanity is a commodity industry, in the making of which is evident in the proliferation of taxi ranks, which can be seen as a by-product of the metropolis as a service industry. In the wake of the climate crisis, the number of taxi drivers in Britain has nearly trebled in the past twenty years. 	Immigrant Movement International (2010-ongoing).

This is particularly true of nations such as the United States and Britain, which have become increasingly reliant on fossil fuels and are now at war with the planet in an apocalyptic ‘thermodynamic zero’ scenario. The proliferation of electronics in every aspect of living systems has exacerbated this situation, making it ever more important to preserve beauty and symbolic of the urban environment as much as possible. In the twenty-first century, this means preserving the historical essence of cities – in much the same way that botanical gardens preserve their natural beauty by continuously replanting them – while introducing new technological elements that preserve only a portion of the city’s urban beauty. There are several proposals of this kind currently underway in several European nations, but due to the overwhelming amount of hype surrounding them, little is being said about the fact that many of these developments are being driven by wealthy nations intent on completely annihilating their cities. These developments are being driven by financial entities such as the European Commission, the Bank for International Settlements, and the International Monetary Fund, who are all fully invested in the notions of the ‘city’ as a core financial sector.

The proliferation of substandard urban settings is a global phenomenon, and the identification of particular urban problems is often facilitated by the commercial real-estate and financial-trading sectors, which see an attractive profit opportunity when building new ‘high-end urban clusters’ in crisis areas.’8 	The biennale has a particular potential in regions where large numbers of people flock to watch the spectacle of art, or simply want to. But in the 21st century, the biennale is a global phenomenon, and the ‘art’ is just one of many components that contribute to making the urban – or ‘architecture’ – into the digital equivalent of the natural world. 	The biennale has a potential to revolutionise not only how we perceive art today, but how we perceive the aesthetic possibilities of future urbanity. But for that to happen, it needs to be led by people with a clear understanding of how art can be used to fight climate change</text>

The proliferation of subways, subways 2.5 and higher, shopping malls, stadiums and science museums is a relic of an earlier urbanisation, but the sheer number and variety of changes that can be controlled through the automated devices that monitor, connect and govern the city is overwhelming. The postindustrial society of the future will likely be very different from the industrial society of the past, in which vast numbers of people still live in poverty and oppression. But the postindustrial society of the future will have to account for the enormous shifts in population, wealth and income that result from the explosion of ever larger numbers of robots, while also coping with the ever greater complexities of urban infrastructure needed to support a growing population on a ever larger scale. The postindustrial society of the future will also have to cope with the ever-higher densities of people and the growing corporatisation of urban space, as well as the growing fragmentation of labour.

The proliferation of data-gathering and data-mining operations such as Google’s Maps engine, Facebook’s Real-Time Graphics, and Microsoft’s Kinect sensor suite only further supports the on-going circulation of fake news and urban confusion. Newer urban technologies such as drone and satellite photography can be used to map territory and capture short films of urban life, but the constant need to update and coordinate with regional planners and building and infrastructure audiovisual industries is another story. Lacking in this context is the ability to imagine new modes of urban organisation, or to imagine cities in a different way. This is particularly true in the Arab world where governments and civic bodies increasingly control society through programs such as television, radio, and newspapers. And while there is some evidence that these media forms may play a role in influencing behaviour, there is little evidence that such interventions are as potent as they claim.

The proliferation of subways, cars and homes on the basis of subways, cars and homes is a relic of the ‘utopian period’, when life was good and the environment was supported by a robust welfare state. The economic logic of the ‘utopian period’ is no longer sustainable, and contemporary capitalism urgently needs to reinvent the urban infrastructure of the planet.’3  The challenge now shifts to cities – communities of habitaters – to build self-supporting cities. This sounds like magic, but in recent years a sustained and public push to reimagine the ‘urban future’ has become evident in the context of the metropolis, especially in the wake of spectacular urban gains across the former dock in London.  Whether by design or accident many of the innovations that emerged during the ‘utopian period’ have become required infrastructure in metropolises across the planet, from Kalgoorlie, Australia; Los Angeles; and Chennai, India;</text>

This is particularly true of nations such as the United States and Britain, which have become increasingly reliant on fossil fuels and are now at war with the planet in an apocalyptic ‘thermodynamic zero’ scenario. The proliferation of non-city urban forms is a feature and parcel of industrialisation and a hurly burly of today’s market economies. But it is important to notice that these forms of economic organisation are also constantly reshaped and transformed by factors such as war, natural disasters, policy experimentation and urban infrastructures that are characterised as ‘smart growth’ by technologists. Thus, a postindustrial society must actively engage with the emergence of new forms of urban organisation in order to anticipate their positive and negative effects, and to create strategies to cope with them.  	The challenge for planners today is two-fold: (1) What can cities do to influence global climate change? (2) What can cities do to mitigate the negative effects of global urbanisation? We therefore needn’t neglect the role cities may play in the creation of future urbanisation, but it is crucial to create imaginative alternatives. 	In planning today’s cities, it is</text>

The proliferation of non-conventional forms of economy and society is fuelling a vast industrial machine that is producing ever more destructively from the city’s partial and incomplete utilisation. While some early urban theorists such as William Harvey believed that cities would one day be able to produce their own destinies, today’s pre-eminent environmental theorist John Graham Kerr sets out a radically different scenario in his book ‘Future City’. In Kerr’s ‘creation of a new urban frontier’, cities are actively encouraged to destruct themselves.[14]Urban planning, including that undertaken by the British Empire’s first prime minister Robert Cecil, was centred around the maxim of ‘devotion to the public good’. As early as the mid-nineteenth century, national and local governments across Britain sought to capitalize on the growing public consciousness of urban decay through aggressive public works programs designed to make the city livable for future imperial tourists.

The story is told through curatorial devices that deliberately obscure the artist’s true identity, and by proxy that of the capitalist world that is intent on maintaining its position of preeminence. At the same time, it is designed around the object that provides the narrative for the artist’s purpose.  A curatorial narrative is a kind of language that emerges from the assembled images. It describes the way the images are assembled into a visually complex situation, and it employs what may be called a ‘global language’ to describe that situation. The ‘global language’ is the vehicle by which the images on a page are assembled into a larger ‘periphery’ that encompasses the city in its unified whole. The ‘global image’ is a kind of gestalt that emerges from the assembled images, and so it too is designed to disguise the real world in aesthetic complexity.   The reason why contemporary art is made in places like Porto Alegre, Brazil, or in eastern European cities such as St Petersburg, is precisely because of the unrelenting flow of images from all over the world, and of course that</text>

The hybrid exhibition format that the Biennale has pursued is a kind of hybrid curatorial device that finds its form in the context of a larger biennale. It is, in other words, the contemporary curatorial device that anticipates, or at least participates in the future state of art through its own set of technologies. This hybrid curatorial device is a kind of hybrid art market. It is aware of its own temporal complexity, and so seeks to engage with and create new experiences through the engagement of the viewer in the very act of creating. It does this by deploying ever more sophisticated ways of understanding and ever more immersive ways of seeing the world, so that the art produced in this world – both contemporary and contemporary art today – can be counted on to be truly contemporary and uniquely valuable, and that is of course not something that can be manufactured or licensed.

The story is told through curatorial devices that deliberately obscure the artist’s true identity, and by proxy that of the capitalist world that is intent on maintaining its position of preeminence. The current exhibition format,  The Contemporary Condition (2013–16) is a kind of extended refutation of the artworld ideal of the modern artist as a broadly creative force operating at a deep level of understanding and control. The current curatorial narrative,  The New Curator (2016–) is a kind of extended refutation of that narrative. It is a sort of voyeuristic, activist and activist narrative. It seeks to understand how art is made in the real world through the medium of art, and how that affects social practices and political struggles around the world. While the current curatorial turn can be counted on to be progressive, it is always committed to preserving its own particular artworld feel. This ‘continuum of history and contingency’ is what gave the current curatorial turn its character – its sense of place and purpose – and made it possible.

The complex series of machinations occurring on a global scale as a result of the economic transition, and the consequent social transition, is told through the devices that create and foster it.  The very concept of the contemporary art market – the point where art is produced on a global scale – is understood and constructed through the production of contemporary art through the means of art museums, academies of art, fairs, fairs commissions, and the like.   At its best, this production may be seen as essential in maintaining the primacy of the artist as artist, and her or his art being valued at a premium relative to that of other artists. At its worst, the very notion of the contemporary art market is seen as a potential trap by which the artist may prey on his or her followers by promising them huge profits, or by forcing them to choose between competing art forms.

The exhibition ‘Stages’ is a kind of opening chapter in the artist’s long and complex story of how contemporary art came to be constituted. It tells the story through three-dimensional objects and the use of a decorative mould called a ‘current art trendsetter’, whose work is then copied and passed on to a new generation of artists. The current art trendsetter is a kind of advertising man for the cultural industries, encouraging artists to take bold artistic decisions based on the ubiquity of such art, and the attendant supply of such art.  The artist and her colleagues knew that their work would have to be permanent because it was so different from the art of the olden days, when artists were able to change their image and position on the fly. But the level of technological innovation and the fluidity with which contemporary art is generated also creates this transition.

The story of how contemporary art came to be conceived as a kind of fragmented collection of images is told through the examples of a single artist’s work curating a large number of similar works.  The exhibition seeks to trace this artist’s process through a curatorial narrative that incorporates archival materials and documents, using contemporary art as a kind of gestalt. While the exhibition is aware of the fact that such a story will not win any many friends or significant supporters, it is also aware that it will not make much sense in a world where global art supply chains are as fragmented and unstable as they are now.  The story is told through curatorial devices that deliberately obscure the artist’s true identity, and by proxy that of the capitalist world that is intent on maintaining its position of pre-eminent cultural power. The device that allows the artist to present her art as fragments from a single event – a single event that constitutes ‘the contemporary condition’ – is a kind of double negative. It simultaneously precludes any critical scrutiny, but also any interest in, or involvement with, the art that is produced through such critical scrutiny. This double negative is a kind of modernising process for an artform, pushing it towards a status of greater importance in the capitalist social context.  But this double negative also produces a kind of degeneracy of the art form, a degeneracy that causes it to lose its distinctive character of being distinctive in its own right. The more a museum is structured in the ways discussed here, the more it resembles a modern art museum, and the more it resembles a capitalist art museum. The more it transforms art from being a distinctive kind of art product into a more and more variable kind of art, the less able the art of the future to</text>

The firm that is the foundation of the present is the same firm that provided the infrastructure for the exhibition of contemporary art to take place.  For the exhibition to be credible, it is essential that both the present and the curatorial conceit be taken into account. Therefore, the curatorial and the artist have to be aware of the historical situation and actively participate in the production of the exhibition, both as spectators and participants.The curatorial role in the contemporary condition  In order for the exhibition to be credible, it is essential that both the present and the curatorial conceit be taken into account. Therefore, the curatorial and the art world have to be continually engaged with the concept of contemporaneity, and the art world has to constantly remind its audience that they are in a contemporary art exhibition. The art world is keen to trumpet its own contemporaneity and is happy to declare that its audiences have it all, when in reality they do not. Curators</text>

The story of how contemporary art came to be conceived as a kind of fragmented collection of images is told through the examples of a single artist’s work curating a large number of similar works.  The exhibition seeks to trace this artist’s process through a curatorial narrative that incorporates archival materials and documents, using contemporary art as a kind of gestalt. While the exhibition is aware of the fact that such a story will not win any many friends or significant supporters, it is also aware that it will not make much sense in a world where global art supply chains are as fragmented and unstable as they are now.  The story is told through curatorial devices that deliberately obscure the artist’s true identity, and by proxy that of the capitalist world that is intent on maintaining its position of hegemony. The ranged and unwieldy projects that the artist eventually put together over the years are the product of years of research, design, development, and art – all rolled into one.  The show is not a straightforward retelling of the artist’s work from the 1940s and 1950s, nor a straightforward reconstruction of an art museum like the Mondador’s 1930s branch, but it does try to tell a story through various mediums. The show is a ‘living room’ where people gather to talk about art, make design connections, and explore visual culture.  The show is a ‘gathering place’ where people gather to make design connections, and elicit art questions. It is a place where people come to engage with and create, and it is a gathering place where power is exerted.  The show is not a museum, but it is a museum that is constantly trying to find ways to make sense of the ever-shifting array</text>

The exhibition seeks to trace this artist’s process through a curatorial narrative that incorporates archival materials and documents, using contemporary art as a kind of gestalt.

The story is told through curatorial devices that deliberately obscure the artist’s true identity, and by proxy that of the capitalist world that is intent on maintaining its position of preeminence. While the mega-exhibitions of Tate and Liverpool might present a challenge to the notion that there is life outside of the museum, which is now almost universally assumed to be globalised, there is no way to know whether the true character of an exhibition is revealed by its display of art, or whether the character of art itself is revealed through its performance on a global spectacle. If the latter is the case, then the failure to reveal that character through the exhibition is itself a failure to reveal that character to the world.  The failure to tell the story through the curatorial narrative means that we cannot know the character of art as a kind of a ‘metainterface’, where the artist and his or her audience are simultaneously unaware and unknowable.

The exhibition seeks to trace this artist’s process through a curatorial narrative that incorporates archival materials and documents, using contemporary art as a kind of gestalt. While the exhibition is aware of the fact that such a story will not win any many friends or significant supporters, it is also aware that it will not make much sense in a world where global art supply chains are as fragmented and unstable as they are now.  The story is told through curatorial devices that deliberately obscure the artist’s true identity, and by proxy that of the capitalist world that is intent on maintaining its position of relative global superiority. The aim of this narrative is to present a fragmented picture of the world in order to provoke a kind of collaboration that opens up new possibilities for differentiating between the different parts of the world.  The narrative that emerges is one in which the artist has a kind of pre-existing political and social power that she actively works to expand. She exploits the fragmented nature of the art world to her own ends, using it to support a social system that she actively participates in. This kind of political-social hyper-interventionism is a kind of contemporary art’s normalisation of power, and the curatorial is a principal platform through which this might happen. The problem with the contemporary art narrative, however, is that it tends to reproduce itself – albeit subtly and organically – through different narratives and forms within and alongside the art world.  The curatorial is a kind of invisible chair, holding the artist accountable through a narrative that largely ignores the structural causes of contemporary art</text>
