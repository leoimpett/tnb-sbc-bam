I looked for something in between – an artist who is embedded in a community, but also an administrator who is skillful at connecting with groups of people in a different way than a curatorial team. I took the opportunity to work with people who are geographically and ethnically diverse. I asked my team to imagine a future of co-creating rather than of imitation. I didn’t have an ideal future artist, but I did have artists who could engage with this new world in different ways.Take Two: Towards an Art World?Stephanie Strain, Artist in residence at the Royal College of Art, 2015.

I looked for something in between – an artist who is embedded in a community, but also an administrator who is skillful at connecting with groups of people in a different way than a curator might. For me, the key was in engaging with people from a different culture with different ways of organising and organising themselves. I didn’t think I had a choice. I was offered a job at the Arts Council, but I turned it down. I thought it was a contradiction in terms to work alongside an organisation that was about to be transformed in a way that I didn’t believe was appropriate for the arts to be involved in. The fact that I was going to be working alongside volunteer artists from other parts of the country was a way to find some distance from the community where the Arts Council was located. I didn’t feel that way about the arts being embedded in the provision of housing, or provision being provided by organisations that promote or support cultural practices that are very different from my own. I felt that the arts Council was going through a period where it was questioning whether its cultural practices were valued. I think that there was some tension between the organisations I</text>

I looked for something in between – an artist who is embedded in a community, but also an administrator who is skillful at connecting with groups of people in a different way than the ones they work with on a day to day basis. For me, that’s an important distinction. For the arts community, it’s a key distinction. For the city, it’s even more significant. The fact that the arts community is so attached to the notion of community is what separates it from the rest of the community. When the Arts Council introduces a project to the Arts Council, the Arts Council informs the Arts Council about it. And at the very least, the Arts Council should know about it. The fact that the arts community might engage in collaborative projects with the city government is also a source of pride. The Arts Council doesn’t just design the programmes and projects, but collaborates with the city government to make them work. The fact that the Arts Council might initiate a project that is good for the city and the community is a source of anxiety. But the Arts Council can also partner with the city government to make it work. The Arts</text>

For me, the key was in creating spaces in which people could be creative and engage with art in a different way. I didn’t have that in my day-to-day job, but it was important for me to have that extra vivacity.I got the job as an arts administrator because that’s what the Arts Council was looking for: someone with a cultural sensitivity and an ability to engage with art within an artistic context. I wasn’t working in an administrative capacity, so I didn’t have that in mind. I thought more about what an arts administrator could do: to be able to connect with artists and connect with communities. I also imagined working with community groups that were artists, but also had skills that the arts organisations could deploy. For example, a community group could deploy an art administrator to work with a gallery group to make the gallery groups engage in a culture of self-making within the gallery groups. The skills</text>

I looked for something in between – an artist who is embedded in a community, but also an administrator who is skillful at connecting with groups of people in a different way than an artist would. For me, the ability to engage with cultures in a different way than an artist would is a two-fold advantage. I don’t think it’s just about engaging with art; it’s about engaging with cultures in a different way, building long-term relationships. And so, for me, the role of the artist is fundamentally different from the role of the curator.I was also interested in the kinds of language we used to communicate with each other. The ways in which we communicated with each other were also very different. I remember one person saying something completely different to another. I don’t think it was intentional, but it was a completely different way of thinking. It was as if the speaker had a completely different point of view. For me, the key was in the context of the project: what the artist was trying to do, and how it was all connected. If the context was something that the artist didn’t</text>

I looked for something in between – an artist who is embedded in a community, but also an administrator who is skillful at connecting with groups of people in a different way than the one employed by the museum. For this, I selected a cross-cultural approach. I wanted to engage with the notion of what it means to be an artist without getting bogged down in notions of identity. I looked for an artist who was not defined by her or his place in cultural history. I also looked for something that would not be considered art, but rather creative in its own right. For me, that meant an organisation that promoted art making through collaborative thinking and engaging with the very real tensions and tensions of being an artist in today’s society.The curatorial approach might not be sexy or fancy, but it’s a necessary evil. The rise and fall of social networking, the internet, art, pop-art and all that stuff – it all has a huge impact. You can certainly understand the value in curating in terms of social impact. And the value in that sort of interactivity is in the act of creating, but there is a limit to</text>

I looked for something in between – an artist who is embedded in a community, but also an administrator who is skillful at connecting with groups of people in a different way than an artist would. I looked for an integration of different disciplines, someone who could work across disciplines but also someone who could work independently but also someone who was self-motivated.I also wanted someone who could work independently but also someone who could be part of a collaborative process. For me, that meant someone who could develop their own ideas but also someone who could share them with others. I didn’t want to work with someone I didn’t know I could work with.If you have a project that you think is interesting, but you don’t know what to do with it, you should always ask yourself if there are other ways to do it. If there are other ways to do it, they should be done with people you know and trust.I also wanted someone who could develop their own ideas but also someone who could share them with others.

I looked for something in between – an artist who is embedded in a community, but also an administrator who is skillful at connecting with groups of people in a different way than an artist would. For me, that’s the missing link. If an artist is engaged by a community, but also has a place in that community, that was a separate variable. The path from artist to community to organisation was different for every artist. To some it was a one-to-many relationship, but for me it was a one-to-many relationship. So the organisation that I worked for was an individual journey, and the artist was part of a team that was part of a journey. The journey from there to the museum was another thing entirely. I was working in a different world. All the different parts were part of a larger whole. But the organisation that I worked for was part of a much broader whole.I am very interested in the idea of remaking, and artists have a huge role to play in this. I remember one of the artists telling me something about how her father used to paint houses. She would always paint the houses, but he</text>

I looked for something in between – an artist who is embedded in a community, but also an administrator who is skillful at connecting with groups of people in a different way than an artist who comes from a museum or a gallery. For me, the ability to engage with a community intellectually rather than physically comes through experience. IRL, it is about connecting with people in a different way – physically, through art, but also emotionally. For me, connecting emotionally means coming to terms with the fact that you are not the centre of people’s eye. It’s not just about meeting people, going to places, and then saying things that align with your experience. It’s about coming to terms with the fact that you have to be somewhere in the world, and having conversations with people about ideas that may be different from your own.This is an edited extract from my unpublished text 'Animals’ Social Practices: A Reader in Anthropology, Art, and Culture' (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2015), which was first published in the journal ANIMAL: The Early Modern Review.Download this article as PDFAna Laura</text>

I wanted to know what the curator’s role was in creating art environments that people would want to come and visit.I also wanted to know more about what an artist’s place was in a museum. I didn’t want to be an administrator – an artist would be an artist – but I wanted to know what the role was in a museum. I didn’t want to be an administrator either, and so what I did was collaborative. I invited several artists to be part of a Curatorial Team.One of the ways in which art is made is through community action. I thought it would be interesting to see what kinds of art projects the Arts Council could support through the Community Arts grant. The way the Arts Council distributes funds is that artists must apply first to the regional art councils in London and New York – the Regional Arts Directors in London and New York. The artist has to apply to the Arts Council for funding before the project</text>

By understanding the larger context of an organisation, including the political and economic forces that created and unleashed AI, we can uncover hidden agendas and intervene where necessary. For example, a city’s capacity to foster civic engagement and participate in political processes may be eroded where the city is mired in poverty and conflict. By combining historical archival materials with new AI, we can uncover previously unrecognised historical connections and movements that may be pertinent to our times.We can also use archival materials to empower citizens and communities to resist encroachment by large organisations or dominant economic actors. For example, the AI that creates archival documents and assembles them into 'digital' histories may render specific historical decisions more effectual through automation. This might happen when large organisations, including large financial institutions, wish to expand their premises or networks or either relocate or cease to exist. This might happen when economically powerful individuals or non-profit bodies intent on furthering their interests seek to reconceive the historical narrative around</text>

Should cities be laboratories for the production of monstrous bureaucracies? Perhaps, but the city is far more capable of nurturing a future bespoke of its constituent parts, its neighbourhoods, cultural clusters and so forth.  	Licensing thus becomes a strategic intervention, working through the regulatory state to establish a new form of organisation capable of replacing the old guard. It’s a strategic ambiguity, but one that city councils and city residents find themselves slowly succumbing to. 	The  	New York City Council, in its expansive  	2017 Staten Island Ferry &amp; Brooklyn Ferry Bill, vested exclusive authority to regulate navigable waterways with virtually total forfeiture of the former. The bill was signed into law by Donald J. Trump, and so far, so normalised the new normalisation of the former by giving city residents carte blanche to abandon neglected waterfront areas and take up new urban opportunities elsewhere in the country. At the same time, however, the city is busy constructing</text>

These practices are the offspring of a common set of trends and processes, but they have their own distinctive signature. The emergence of AI raises new questions about the nature of human agency, and about the capacities of human architecture. 	In  	The Future City, Peter Osborne imagines the emerging AI that will render large datasets of historical urban environments into manageable manageable pieces. He suggests that similar AI will one day render entire cities ‘like archives, gathering fragments of knowledge about the past that can be gathered from objects’, like data collected from the ground or collected through surveys. This is the kind of thinking that goes beyond the realm of science fiction and is compatible with the eventual deployment of this technology by states and non-state actors.

If successful, these advances could lead to a reordering of cityscapes and perhaps even to a reduction in population growth. 	But taking data and hidden layers into consideration, and applying them to present-day situations presents a host of new challenges. For one thing, the pace of change in AI these days is such that it’s almost inconceivable that ‘real life’ would be able to evolve along the lines that AI is now poised to implement. Second, while the pace of change in AI is great, the conditions under which life forms can act upon this pace remain elusive. Third, while the conditions under which AI may perform actions are great, the manner in which life forms can achieve these actions presents a host of new dilemmas. Fourth, and most fundamentally, while AI may perform actions on the macroscopic, it is also possible that these actions would be employed by unanticipated, albeit perhaps desirable, entities known as AI.

The possibilities are vast. And given the right combination of data, tools and algorithms, could even be used to construct entire new cities. 	So, given the current state of AI, what does it mean for a city to be in the making? 	In my view, a city to be in the making is a site of active participation, where people actively contribute to creating the city in ways that generate social and political change. In other words, it’s a place of museums and galleries and a plaza and street level alley. It’s a hybrid of the two. I think of the assembly line as a city’s assembly line. The museum is a city’s assembly line. The plaza is a city’s plaza. But what distinguishes the plaza from the museum or the museum platform is the fact that it has a fixed form: fixed in place by the state, society and the very architecture of the city. It’s</text>

These advances are likely to empower those who design and build artificial intelligences, enabling them to intervene where there are signs of malignant intent, intervening so that benign technological ends may be pursued. 	Such regulatory interventions may be ethical in their own right, but in a world with increasingly globalised and automated systems of economic production and consumption, the question is what comes after the profit motive? Will the ethical imperative move towards the implementation of AI that understands the social and political impact of its human-machine interaction, or will it further fragment us into smaller, autonomous parts that can be instructed to do anything that aligns with the intentions of the machine? 	In an effort to foresee the latter, some have begun to build in moral protections for humanity against AI, beginning with the formation of corporations ‘consciousness’ with conscious leaders who retain full rights to their creations. 	Some have also begun to build into infrastructure automated with the help of nanotechnology, which exploits the fact</text>

There are several projects underway to address the problem of invisibility in an urban context. One of the most prominent is Project Octopus, initiated by the New York-based artist Ron Sitrides, who describes his work as ‘a curatorial gesture combining archaeology, anthropology, geography and visual arts’. 	As Sitrides explains, the project started out as a way to reclaim a word: ‘deception’. By reclaiming the word, an image is erased or disguised in such a way as to be detectable, and the practice of hiding or obfuscating historical figures becomes part of a self-regulatory mechanism. As Sitrides puts it, ‘mystifying figures have come to symbolise everything that is wrong with the city.’ 	However, the project has evolved into something else, and is now primarily concerned with the rehabilitation of an image-conscious public. Public figures are often portrayed as helpless victims of</text>

Future work in and for the city is a dynamic process that must be continuously iterated upon, because it is only human nature to continually seek meaning and purpose in the things we don’t own. The question is, can we collectively reclaim the things we don’t own, and start again? This is the question that the Biennale was built to address. The answer to its first iteration, unsurprisingly, was 'yes'. But the question it eventually asked itself, and the answer it returned to its diverse groups of curators, artists, historians and other stakeholders was: ‘What next?’ The question, then, shifted from the participants to the curators, who in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in turn, in</text>
    <text>The project is a speculation on the history of the city, calling attention to the fact that we’re not built in stone, but that we’re made of flesh and blood. We’re made of skillets, whose history is connected with the history of the city, and whose future, no matter how bleak and disjointed its present, is a last chance for the city to regroup and move forward. In a future city, the question is how to support a future city, as the inhabitants of the present day are increasingly disconnected from one another, and increasingly voiceless. How to imagine a future that represents the humanity of its citizens? 	In the present, we’ve created artificial intelligence (AI) that can simulate any physical phenomenon, from the movement of physical objects to the historical formation of language. With the help of data, simulations and algorithms, we can query large amounts of historical data, uncovering hidden narratives and architectural layers, and uncovering smaller architectural betrayals. 	Perhaps the most promising application of the research may be found in the field of urbanization. Advances in AI render difficult problems like identifying and identifying systems more tractable with a human problem-solving ability, like identifying building components, can be used to optimize both the city’s capacity and its ability to heal. 	As AI improves, so too does its ability to diagnose and treat problems. For instance, the diagnosis of Lyme disease may soon be able to predict with high accuracy, according to a report commissioned by the city of Los Angeles. And just as with HIV/AIDS, the diagnosis of Lyme disease may lead to aggressive antibiotic therapy, if not yet fully operational. 	[i] Imperva Inc. – Technology, Inc. (2015).

With the help of these studies, we can create better ways of inhabiting the city, enabling a city to function more sensibly and ecologically. This type of architecture can be imagined as a ‘black box’ – a building that’s either completely invisible or partially utilises renewable energy, yet is nonetheless a central node in an immense global system that's constantly evolving and undergoing massive shifts in its form and function. Black boxes are used as a way to imagine and further conceptualise the social and spatial complexity of the urban environment, its movement and it’s inhabitants.

This journal is not a ‘platform’ but more of a 'recipes and tricks’ that the team members and others involved in developing the project derive meaning from, and which inform their decisions, actions and projects. It is a back story or ‘stairs’ that helps to tell the project’s story. The name ‘Emerald City’ derives from the mythical city of the emeralds, which in turn derives from a story about a boy named Emerald. The story is told in several places in the text, which is part of what makes it a ‘textile prototype’. In the text, the characters are based on real-life figures, places and things, but here the similarities end. The team members behind the scenes at Nike include many designers and textile technologists who have a particularised view of the world and are interested in bringing sustainable products to market.

This journal takes the form of a series of posts on a website maintained by the journal’s editor and contributors. The first six posts on the website comprise a chronological look back at the history of the journal from April 2015 to April 2016, followed by a chronology of six subsequent posts that look forward to October 2018. The final post looks back to June 2018. The purpose of the journal is to capture the immediacy of the journal as a publication during these six posts, to the point where the publication of the journal itself would constitute a somewhat jarring transition. In the six posts that make up the post-mortem of the journal, the reader is invited to step back into the temporal gap that the journal leaves behind. Rather than continuing from the beginning of each post, the reader is invited to proceed directly to the publication of the previous six posts.

This issue of IEEE Stem Cells &amp; Tissues is a hybrid journal that documents the work of its two sections (scientific and technical), while also publishing in-depth essays, feature articles, and critical reviews of recent technological innovations in both the biomedical and social sciences. The journal is divided into six issue ‘triennials’ (2011, 2014, and 2016) that track the progress of different areas of the journal, as well as a special issue that presents emerging research themes and priorities. In each issue, the journal publishes a ‘print edition’ of the journal with original art work and annotated bibliographies. The print edition features a ‘select bimonthly’ (2016) that highlights recent achievements in the scientific and technical literature of the journal. In addition to its traditional scholarly value, the journal is a valuable resource for the wider technology, biotech, medical and environmental sectors</text>

    The project is a speculation on the past, but also on the future. In an attempt to chart the movements of the pre-internet era, we bring together the disparate strands of the internet era to chart the paths of its inhabitants. We do this through the figure of the person, and the method of recording and mapping – the digitised trace of a point of origin. The digitised trace is a multi-stage process that begins with the mapping of an area, and continues with the mapping of the next digitised segment, until a complete digital image of the area is produced. The general idea behind this project is that of a big data set, with a globalized social and cultural context that continuously re-shapes the geographical location of all those living within it. We produce the image of the area in order to continuously map it, from point of origin to destination. When we name cities in the project, we name cities that are part of a digital future, where information and communication technologies are omnipresent, but

When we name cities in the project, we name cities that are part of a digital future, where information and communication technologies are omnipresent, but also cities that are part of the present, but are subject to the effects of past movements. We do this by re-naming cities in the image of their current locations, and then mapping these cities to digitised images of the imaginary future. We do this by creating digitised versions of cities in the image, and then mapping these digitised versions of the city to digitised images of the actual world. This creates a three-tier city, in which the digital images of cities play no role whatsoever, because the future has already delivered the present. This is the technological trajectory of the ‘near future’. In other words, the technologies that we develop for the social are geared to the social good.‘Mid-Century Modern Cities’ are the offspring of the social good, and the social good is the offspring of the huge infrastructure – massive data-storage and processing bureaucracies – required to support it.

When we name cities in the project, we name cities that are part of a digital future, where information and communication technologies are omnipresent, but also cities that are part of the past, where technology has made a significant impact on the very fabric of who we are and what we can do. By mapping the entire globe, we can trace the movements of individuals, but also metropolitan regions, and in doing so, we can uncover peculiar localities and historical moments that only exist in the current. This is part of our larger research project, ‘PsyOps Arcades Image: Futures End Times’, which is based in Seoul and Beijing. In the current period, the image that we produce is an image of a future that is apocalyptic, in which ‘human history’ is rewritten in apocalyptic terms. The project began with a massive computer simulation, then a team of researchers went underground and built a massive underground city, ‘Tokyo’, where the simulations ended and the reality began. The reason they chose to build this city underground is because it was the best possible place to store and process the huge amounts of</text>

When we name cities in the project, we name cities that are part of a digital future, where information and communication technologies are omnipresent, but also cities that are part of the present, where technological advances have displaced the human marker of place. We name cities based on their topology – the data networks that collect and organize all manner of data, but also on the particular design choices and infrastructures that are built into each city’s surface. We do this by exploring how cities are made, and by observing and recording the everyday life of people who call them home. We then employ mathematical and geospatial sleight of hand to map these networks of data, gathering data from all over the globe in an ever-growing database that is constantly on the move. This ongoing migration of data creates an enormous amount of text, and over time, this text may contain inaccuracies and ambiguities, as all texts inevitably must. Nevertheless, we are able to assemble a coherent whole through this kind of analysis and recording, because we are able to read between the cracks, between different layers. This kind of reading is possible only</text>

When we name cities in the project, we name cities that are part of a digital future, where information and communication technologies are omnipresent, but with a human element – hence the name ‘cities in motion’. In this new digital world, every activity that takes place is recorded and transcribed, and every decision that is made is made with the intention of ever expanding the digital image of the area. This project is not a prediction of what will happen in the future, but a warning of what to avoid. It is an invitation to think about what life will be like in the area in ten years' time, and to engage with the fact that, twenty years from now, people will still be making decisions about what to do with the city that were not based on scientific or historical information. In that case, the project could be used to look back at and create a ‘digital heritage district’.1 	In the contemporary world, we are witnessing an ever-more pervasive phenomenon known as ‘mapping public space’.2 	In the 1990s, this referred to developments in urban</text>

One of the most interesting aspects of our project is the interaction between cities and digitised data. The digitised image of a city, whether it is created by us or by a city agency, is a map that points to places and/or data that are present in the city, but with no specific intent or object. It is a pointer that points to interesting places, but also of course data sets that support or are dependent on particular behaviours, behaviours and/or ‘trending’ phrases. For instance, the image of a tree may point to a tree, but it is not anchored in any particular place or tree. A blog post, whether written by the author or an agency, may point to a blog, but it is not anchored in any particular place or blog.  Another example is the</text>

It is an application of the ScanEagle PDA (near-infrared spectrograph) developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and is used to map areas of the Earth that are dark and remote but also populated with people. The ARRI Alexa project has a multi-year research agenda that includes mapping future cities, but also seeks to create a free and open platform for mapping other geographical space, including underwater, buried and uncovered data. More broadly, the ARRI Alexa project seeks to redefine the role of cities in a post-Internet world. It seeks to map the physical, cultural and social worlds of a future urban future through the application of underground and buried radio signals, and to this end, the ARRI Alexa project</text>
    <text>The project is a speculation on the past, but also on the future. In an attempt to chart the movements of the pre-internet era, we bring together the disparate strands of the internet era to chart the paths of its inhabitants. We do this through the figure of the person, and the method of recording and mapping – the digitised trace of a point of origin. The digitised trace is a multi-stage process that begins with the mapping of an area, and continues with the mapping of the next digitised segment, until a complete digital image of the area is produced. The general idea behind this project is that of a big data set, with a globalized social and cultural context that continuously re-shapes the geographical location of all those living within it. We produce the image of the area in order to continuously map it, from point of origin to destination. When we name cities in the project, we name cities that are part of a digital future, where information and communication technologies are omnipresent, but also cities that are part of the past, where connectivity is scarce and expensive, and where social and cultural capital is actively capital-intensive.The research project began in earnest in earnest in 2015, with the establishment of the World Community Grid project at the 38th Venice Biennale. World Community Grid is a joint European and Egyptian initiative that brings together the largest solar arrays in North Africa and the Middle East with generators, transmission lines, distribution points and storage for the grid at Cairo International Airport. The project is part of the wider context of the European integration project that began in the 1990s, and is also part of a broader Egyptian context that began in 2014 with the establishment of the National Grid Company. The project is expected to support Egypt's ambitious urban growth strategy of over 200 million inhabitants in the coming years. At the same time, the project is being built alongside the ongoing construction of the controversial Area 51, a large military base east of the Sinai Peninsula that many fear will become a staging ground</text>

We do this through the digitised digitisation of the city, and also through the digitisation of its buildings, artefacts and public spaces. The digitised digitisation of the city represents a new dynamic that will also require the active participation of citizens in urban growth. It is a digitisation that adopts the digitised form of the city in all its social and cultural complexities, but also in its consummatory, material and transformational forms. We call this digitisation ‘contemporary urbanisation’. It is an area of new technological capacities, but also an area of new infrastructures that are affected by digital transformation. This latter term is significant because it implies a future with a consummatory and material consumption, while also a material and transformational loss of use. It is a term that is both adaptable and deceiving, appealing to the visitor</text>

We do this by mapping and naming cities in the real-time ‘on the fly’, using data from major navigation systems, but also from satellite imagery and historical weather data. Then, from there, we map those areas that are part of a biennial or a major museum collection in real-time, using data from various other monitoring and collection systems. Finally, we name the cities that are part of a future urban future as ‘infrastructure-critical cities’, using data from a variety of collection and data-mining applications. In this analysis, the term ‘infrastructure-critical city’ refers to metropolises whose development has recently become entangled in technologies that are becoming increasingly sensitive to resource depletion and climate change. These include ‘regeneration cities’ that are part of the ‘regeneration narrative’, using regenerative practices</text>

The digitised image of the digitised city maps a particular future, but it is also a past that is constantly reshaping its location and future. The digitised image of the digitised city is a kind of a red herring, a distraction from the city’s true intent and function – reclamation. We do this through what is colloquially described as ‘ghost photography’. In the digital age of the image and data capture, photography is no longer the preserve of the privileged or the powerful, but of everyday people all around the globe. The image of the digitised image is a kind of a blunt instrument, capable of piercing deeply and unavoidably deep wounds. In this sense, photography becomes a kind of surveillance tool, and the image becomes a kind of residue that is continually produced and recycled through the course of history.

The profile is a ‘win-win’ situation for both parties, and it is a statement of purpose that both parties can take part in. But it is a statement of win-lose, and here the article’s subject shifts from the gallery to the city. The article begins to refer to a collection of objects – a series of photos of which appear alongside a description of the collection itself. The collection is now referred to as the Joseph M. and Anna L. Schwartz Collection, and the photographer is Pierre Paul Émile Richard Joseph, III. The collection now includes over one hundred items from Joseph M. and Anna L. Schwartz, who lived in Montreal between 1867–79, and whose collection includes objects from the Schwartz home, as well as objects from the Canadian Museum and Archives. The photos that make up the bulk of the article – photos of the collection – are images that appear nowhere else in the text.</text>

The article actively courted controversy by calling him a ‘devoted father of four…’, and the piece ends with a list of questions that could not have been more relevant a year or so later, in early August, 1868, when the now-defunct Montreal Daily Graphic first started printing its pages. As the photograph above shows, the article is auburn, with the black and white photograph of the cathedral taken from the Canadian National Exhibition catalogue. The photograph was taken a year earlier, on the cathedral’s first Sunday, September, 1868. The catalogue entry for that first Sunday reads: ‘The Montreal Monuments were opened on the first Sunday of Advent, 1868. During the day, groups of children from neighbouring farms and pastures were taken on field trips to the Monuments. After school, the Monuments were occupied by groups of labourers to build new vehicles or to do other maintenance. The next</text>

It is the longest article written about Richard Joseph, and the profile is a ‘win-win’ one: Joseph gets to expand his brand name, and the Québécois gallery gets a new collection of works to replace the collection of works lost when the gallery was closed due to budget cuts. 	However, the profile also includes an extended critique of the way in which Québécois culture is produced and reproduced in the art world, in which Richard Joseph is a protagonist. The article is structured as a ‘battle’ between two art currents: the current wave of modernism (inspired by the rise of capitalism in western capitalism’s wake) and the previous wave, which was also contemporaneous with great social changes such as the emancipation of labour and the institutionalisation of democracy. On one side of the table, we have Richard Joseph, the composer of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and a founding member of École Polytechnique in Montreal, who is lauded as a genius and a transformative force of history; and on the other, the gallery, which publishes the work of its curators while simultaneously being a</text>

It is the longest article written about Richard Joseph, and the profile is a ‘win-win’ one: Joseph gets to expand his brand name, and the gallery gets to expand its collection of artworks. The article’s subject line reads: ‘Université de Montréal’s collection of fine artworks, which includes some of the most important works from this period, is a landmark in the museum’s collection. The article draws a direct line between Richard Joseph and Walter Benjamin’s ideas about the significance of collections, and the collections themselves. It praises Joseph for his research and development into the collection he called ‘the static island of images’, and the collections that would later be assembled. But the strongest praise of all, here, is reserved for the collection as a whole. The article ends with a blessing for the future Joseph: it will live in memories and figures of the past, like the archives of Montréal’s collection.1 	The collection that emerged after the fact was valuable, in that it allowed the museum to create a database of the objects in the</text>

It is the longest article written about Richard Joseph, and the profile is a ‘win-win’ one: Joseph gets to expand his brand name, and the gallery gets to expand its collection of art. The article describes the Saint Lawrence Seaway as a triumph of modern engineering, and Joseph’s contribution to the art of engineering as a whole. The gallery’s collection of contemporary art is enriched with works by Richard Joseph, and the profile includes a short essay by Joseph himself, in which he praises the piece as a work of art, and the man who put it together. The essay is a mixture of praise and criticism, but the most direct form of his praise is directed at the gallery, insofar as it ‘gave rise to that very Modernism that we know so well’ – which is to say, the modernism that causes such a strain on artists’ curatorial resources. The essay is divided into three parts, each describing a different aspect of the gallery’s collection, and the man who put them together.

Joseph,  	1871–75’ in the Journal de Montréal with a rambling ‘Adèle Petitjonh: J-P. Joseph,  	1871–75’. Joseph was a name that gallery curators had heard many times before, and the article’s acknowledgements of familiarity are punctured by reference to ‘Joseph P. Kennedy’, the avant-garde artist who had commissioned Joseph to do the image of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in his book Le nat et je suis (1867).

The profile is a ‘win-win’ double whammy, which brings immense benefits for both the artist and the company. 	However, the profile is also a double-edged sword: it touches on subjects of great sensitivity, but it also carries a lot of negativity. The negative is that Joseph is a misogynist, racist, xenophobic individual who destroyed cultures and nations; the positive is that he is a brilliant and popular young man with a great idea who ended up saving much of what was once Quebec. The profile also implies that he is a terrorist, but that is simply not true. Rather, he is a man who came up with a brilliant and cool idea that was backed by a terrifically talented and autonomous team of young people, and through a mix of luck and the genius of his fellows, came out on top.

It is the longest article written about Richard Joseph, and the profile is a ‘win-win’ one: Joseph gets to expand his brand name, and the gallery gets a resourceful curator who writes about the gallery in a way that reflects the gallery’s collection and collections better. So, the profile is a good fit for a gallery that needs to be seen as a whole, and a gallery that serves as a counterweight to what is being done at the city level. It is a snapshot, and it reflects the changes that are taking place in the city. The profile of Richard Joseph, however, does not achieve this in its depiction of Richard Joseph as an artist, but only as an administrator, politician, and one-term mayor of Montreal. 	Since Richard Joseph was elected as mayor in 1867, Montréal has been a laboratory for the new urban development that would come to be known as ‘Montréalization’.

It is the longest article written about Richard Joseph, and the profile is a ‘win-win’ one: Joseph gets to expand his brand name, and the National Gallery gets a new piece of infrastructure, both located in the city and in the pages of its extensive photography and art collection. The profile’s main claim, however, is undermined by numerous factual inaccuracies and by the retrospective nature of the exhibition. Despite the inaccuracies, the article remains a valuable document of the city’s development, documenting the work of the art institution in a way that is incomplete, subjective and almost entirely unrepresentative of its actual size and scope. In this sense, the article is not unique in its description of Richard Joseph; many other biennials published in the journal during this period also used this same topology. But the key claim that the Paris Review and Paris 2014 made – that the Seaway would ‘fix’ the city – is simply not supported by the facts. Emboldened by the chance to be found in a museum, Richard Joseph set about creating a ‘museum of the future’, using arch</text>

It is the longest article written about Richard Joseph, and the profile is a ‘win-win’ one: Joseph gets to expand his brand name, and the gallery gets to expand its collection, while the city maintains a precious natural harbour that could be used for anything – regardless of how sublime or surreal the imagined uses might be. So the article aligns with the gallery’s narrative, which is of course the opposite of what the artist himself wanted. As the gallery walks away from the project, it aligns with the river, which it then feeds into the harbour, which it then feeds into the city, creating an ever-growing urban bridge that nobody wants to use. The profile is a little disjointed and the language a little hazy, but the gist is this: Joseph got the idea for the Seaway from a lithograph of a shipbuilder, and from that he drew several variations on the idea, which proliferated in various forms throughout the nineteenth century. The main idea was that the Seaway would be a place where ships from all over the world dock together in order to create a ‘bridge building’ that</text>

If I were to do a survey of the terminal, I would say that at the moment of its construction, there is a sense of crisis on many levels. On the one hand, we have the myth of omnipresence that underpins the whole business of the terminal, which seems to be losing meaning as technology advances. On the other, there is the feeling that things are not always what they seem. In the age of the biennial, there is a palpable sense of disappointment and a chill that is palpable even in the most progressive city centre neighbourhood. There is a palpable sense that things are not always what they seem. In a word, the ‘terminal crisis’.What does it mean to make things visible?

If I were to do a survey of artists and curators in the UK right now, I would say that almost all of them would have to be relocated to some faraway location in order to be able to participate in the curatorial explosion that is being planned for the terminal. This is because the ‘terminal impulse’ is now the standard operating procedure across the board in the UK, and ‘contemporary art’ is to a large extent understood as an artifact of the post-industrial society. If the ‘contemporary art’ is to be considered in the ‘fullness’ of curatorial language, then the historical avant garde, pidéo, and post-impressionist movements have to be rethought and new cultural forms have to be created.

In the event of a full-scale, nation-wide shutdown, such as a nuclear war, the terminal is to be used as a ­curb operation centre. In the event of a power cut, the terminal is to be used as a satellite relayshop for international commercial flights. In the event of a major terrorist incident, the terminal is to be used as a staging post for an invasion of Canada or the United States’ territory. For this to happen, a declaration of martial law has to be made, and the federal government has to be called upon to contribute sufficient resources to assist in the occupation of Canadian or US territory.

If I were to do a survey of artists and curators in the UK who exhibited at the Granby Four Future City conference in the autumn of 2014, which was co-chaired by the Turner Prize and the Royal Academy of Arts, I would say that a large number were either caught up in the excitement of the moment or had a change of heart and moved their shows elsewhere in the city. Perhaps some curators were moved by the change of heart and simply continued to show their art elsewhere. But the number of artists, curators and arts organisations in the city that have actively engaged with the city in a meaningful way since then seems very small. There has been a change of heart, perhaps, from the people who founded the RAC to the people who are now patronising the Royal Academy, or those who are being bought by the city. But the RAC has invested in the city for decades now, and its investment in the community is what gives the city its character.The explosion of</text>
    <text>machines were asked to take over the curatorial role. In doing so they created what became known as the ‘curatorial explosion’. This was seen as a response to the explosion of art fairs held at the airport, which was seen by many as a threat to the exclusive circulation of art. Creative perforations were created, and now we are told that the curatorial explosion is a force for good? So the cultural logic of the airport is now supported by the explosion of art fairs held at the airport? In other words, the airport is the laboratory for a new technological paradigm, and the cultural logic of the terminal is the equivalent of what Google produces in the form of social networks?Does this sound like the logic of new social media or what Walter Benjamin would have called the ‘transcendental logic’?It is my understanding that in the event of an urgent, state emergency, such as a terrorist attack, the terminal is to be used as a military operation centre. If I were to do a survey of artists, composers, lyricists and other creative professionals in the terminal, I would discover that some are deeply concerned about the effect that the appearance of art and culture has on publics such as themselves, and are actively seeking ways to engage the art forms they teach through advocacy and PR. I would also discover that many others see the terminal as a potential new market for cultural products, and are actively engaged in creating social goods and social outcomes through advocacy and PR. Perhaps my sources are trustworthy, but I would like to see independent research that directly engages the cultural logic of the terminal. It would be interesting to compare the impact of the terminal’s curatorial policies, such as inviting in-country artists and composers, or offering space and support for cultural activities, with that of similar policies in smaller cities, or even villages? Perhaps the impact of the curatorial interventions would be more variable, and localised. One could also consider the fact that in smaller towns and villages</text>

If I were to do a survey of artists who have worked in the terminal since its inception in 1999, I could find few who would have a political, social or ecological agenda. The majority of the artists who have exhibited in the terminal over the years have a social, community or environmentalist agenda. Does this sound like the milieu of a new technological paradigm, in which the public realm is supplanted by a private one dominated by the interests of a few, or does it sound more like the twin peaks of a once in a geological geological era of interconnectedness? I do not know enough to answer either of these questions, but what I can say is this: in the increasingly blurred enviornment of ‘public’ and ‘private’ domains, the public is increasingly estranged from its own use and is increasingly empowered by its increasingly blended public and nonpublic uses, which is itself a product of the ‘inherent contradictions’ of a capitalist economy. If ‘public’ and</text>

If I were to do an in-depth survey of the terminal I would find that its primary purpose is for long-term, controlled delivery of information, and that this is why armed personnel are posted there: to maintain a virtual line of communication with the ground, while infiltrating any sort of underground network. And here we have the critical contradiction: the technology that enables the destruction of art is being used to produce a form of government in which technology is actively promoted while simultaneously standing in opposition to it.In the age of the terminal we can no longer pretend that art is static and immaterial, and that technology is an abstraction, but we nevertheless have to confront the fact that the technology that creates art is also creating social reality in the form of social networks, which in turn is creating forms of organisation that are opposed to what the theorists of the ‘utopian society’ envision. And here we see another dialectic emerging: the theory of the technological singularity as opposed to the actuality of the terminal bl</text>

If I were to do a survey of artists, composers, lyric poets and others who have been actively involved in the curatorial explosion, I would reveal several themes that run through them all, and which continue to animate their practice: on the one hand the panic of the powerless, whose desperation to get out of bed and get away from the crisis feels like a curse; on the other, the thrill of the visible, in the sense of something new emerging to replace the old, which is understood by many as a threat. One can only imagine what it is like to be caught in the transitive temporal proximity of this explosion, and to witness it. But perhaps the most potent metaphor for the situation is that of a city in a nuclear war. We cannot know with absolute certainty what the effects of a nuclear war would be, but certain infrastructures, such as the airports, have a critical dependency on it, and the potential loss of life and limb is real. So while the logic of the terminal may</text>

If I were to do a number on this, it would be ‘100,000 strong’. What does this mean? Well, let me give you an idea: in the event of a full scale invasion of Canada, the Canadian border becomes de facto a no man's land. The federal government has a patrol plane ready to shoot down any pretexted military plane, and Canadians are therefore understandably very reluctant to fly combat missions over Canadian soil. Similarly, the United States has a border with Mexico that is both vast and unpredictable, and yet very low-profile: the Rio Grande Valley, the New Mexico desert, mountains, rivers, mountains – the US-Mexico border is the fourth-largest population centre on the planet. Yet here we are, almost two decades later, and we still have no clear definition of what the US-Mexico border is, what the Canadian-US border is supposed to be, or even where the US-Canada border is supposed to be. This seems completely divorced from the technological.</text>

If I were to do research on this, I would have to be in a position to state a clear preference between civilian and military use of the terminal, but I can state with reasonable assurance that the military has used the terminal as a space of operations for state terrorism since at least the 1980s. In any event, the transnational capitalist forms of  	globalisation that characterise this world are now reshaping not only how we live our lives, but also how our rulers imagine the future. If there is to be any future left, it is predicted, then we must shift from the realm of the inchoate to the realm of the impervious.The use of the terminal has increased four-fold since 1995, when Congress, by a wide range of new spending bills, appropriated money to build a large new international terminal for New York City's subways. The terminal now houses over one million cars, trucks and light aircraft, and is twice as wide as the previous structure. In the 1990s,</text>

[3] As an aside, it is interesting to note that the term ‘smart city’ was coined by a Californian urbanist named Richard Florida Keys in 1974. Florida Keys was reacting to the fact that although many Californians still believed in the inherent goodness of the city, the widespread adoption of information technologies and the massive urban renewal programmes that followed them, the flourishing of self-sustaining local economies and the mega complexes that followed, those people were increasingly seen as having abandoned the city and were therefore not being counted in its tally. Hence, the construction of ever larger, more encompassing bureaucracies and the subsequent expansion of metropolitan areas. 	[4] As a result, there was</text>

[3] Chun explores how technologies empower citizens through their capacity to map places, communicate with others, take part in social interactions and create new situations, yet at the same time render them immaterial, anonymous and void of agency. She also demonstrates how the capacities that citizens bring to take part in a given situation are limited and frustrated by the capacities that governments have to create ever larger and more complex bureaucracies that are all around us. 	[4] Technology and urbanization have become ever more pervasive across much of the world, yet little is known about these processes that result from urbanization. Much of what is known is derived from citizen reports, citizen research institutes and citizen journalism, which were once the preserve of the elite, but are now widely accessible and useful resources for citizen activism.

Following the advent of information technology, governments all over the world became more involved in managing and monitoring the city, and the functions that came with that involvement became increasingly opaque and complex. As a result, the public became increasingly ignorant of the city’s many functions, which is why many people don’t know what a smart city is. As an anthropologist Wendy Chun explores, governments became interested in the role of the citizen in his or her place and function in the city, but in doing so, they also created a mechanism that calls into being a multitude of new behaviours and desires that can be attributed to the city’s citizens. For the government, the creation of a new citizenry is a means to an end: to govern and to serve. In effect, then, the city becomes a complex system that must be continually tweaked in order to accommodate new modes of being in order to maintain its public image. 	[3] Supposedly, these new modes of being in the city allow people to become more creative and individualised, to participate more fully in the city’s decision-making, and to contribute more to its success as a ‘success story’ is told. Yet Chun finds herself strangely ambiguous about what exactly makes a city a success story – and how that image is constructed. She identifies a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction with the existing urban fabric, but she also wants to see new ways of organising the city, new art galleries and museums, new ways of linking to the past and linking to the future.

Gerborg’s research interests include the study of human nature and the environment from a social point of view. She also has a particular interest in the role of artists and scholars in the social formation of humanity's places and relations. Here, she examines the work of Sophie Hope, a pioneering artist and researcher in the area of urban environments, and the co-inventors of what became known as the ‘Smart Metropolis’ project.

These new citizens have a significant impact on the city’s future, which is why it is so exciting and powerful to see creative and dynamic designs coming out of places like Liverpool, and Nottingham, but also from places like New York City and LA. But in many ways, the reason why cities are so invested in their citizens is because their citizens are the reason why cities exist in the first place. As anthropologist Peter Osborne explores, cities are the artefacts of a past when people ‘lived together in collective groups’ and ‘understood the importance of work’. But as people stopped doing that, and institutions stepped in to take over, behaviour shifted from individual to collective, and now we have large urban bureaucracies that monitor and control behaviour, which is why so many creative urban designs are coming from places like Liverpool and Nottingham, but also from places like Doha, United Arab Emirates, where many of the Arab Spring</text>

[3] For instance, the public is encouraged to ‘drive themselves’ to work on the city’s transit system, and to do things such as sit in their cars while watching TV or playing video games on their phones. This behaviour, coupled with the increased access to information technology that is available in today’s metropolis, creates a situation in which citizens have an abundance of control over their city’s destiny, but also a great deal of vulnerability. 	[4] The platforming genre tends to depict a fantastical or humorous version of things, their origins and allegiances, and platforming is an action that appears to offer both ways of experiencing reality. In this sense, it uses familiar symbols and tropes of the modern urban environment to imagine a more positive future for its inhabitants. In an ideal world, people would only use platforming to do things in cities that align with their ideal world. In reality,</text>

[3] An interesting aside to add to the understanding of how technologies impact on human behaviour is the discovery that a large proportion of the chemicals found in bird droppings or faeces are also present in human blood and bodily fluids. The level of industrial effluvia in the UK is a great example of this. The level of industrial effluvia in the UK is driven by the demand for electricity generated by the fossil-fuel industry. The level of industrial effluvia in the UK is also driven by the development of railways and ports – two of the most productive economic sectors in the UK at the time – which enabled massive amounts of liquid oil to be transported around the country. As a consequence, the level of industrial effluvia in the UK increases as a function of population density and the demands placed on it. As a result, the demand for effluvia-enhancing agents increases alongside it. This is the economic logic of the smart city. The</text>

[3] As an example, Wendy Chun describes how the civil-rights movement was initially instigated by a small cadre of black theatre people in Los Angeles. At the time, the L.A.P.D. was conducting a rampant programme of stop-work orders in theatres across the city, which effectively quashed all artistic expression in the city. Wendy Chun explores how the logic of technological unemployment instilled in the public via literacy programmes, accompanied by the desensitisation of urban environments to human traffic caused a backlash that became known as the Watts Riot. [4] As an example, Wendy Chun explores how the computer generated imagery of the riots in Jerusalem in 1988 predicted a democratic uprising that was fully</text>

But what attracts us to it as products of its complexity is that it’s a product that’s completely transparent and invisible. 	But what I find fascinating is that in the context of all of that, there are different ways of looking at the same thing. Like how we think about water. Water is a product of many different things. It’s a product of economics and the division of labour, and it’s a product of the climate. And what I find fascinating is that in the context of all of that, there are different ways of looking at the same thing: as water, or as a physical commodity. 	In the broader context of the climate change conversation, there are different ways of conceiving of adaptation. You could imagine adaptation as a technology that works in a different way from what we think about it as: as a production system that produces wealth and benefits all of humanity, rather than the opposite. 	For example, one</text>

Insulation is a product of many different things. It’s a product of manufacturing and cutting-edge science, and it’s a product of the combined might of a city and a profession. But it’s also a product of history. And as we move forward, and more and more data becomes available, the amount and type of that history becomes more and more important.  So, for example, consider how much energy is absorbed by the amount of material that is placed on a silicon wafer. If the amount of energy that is transferred increases exponentially, the area that is transferred becomes larger and larger, and the amount of energy that is released also increases exponentially. And so, the amount of silicon that is transferred increases exponentially as the amount of material that is put on the wafer increases. And if that trend continues, then the amount of energy that is transferred along the wafer–matrix–is going to grow exponentially. And as the amount of silicon that is put on the wafer increases, the area that is transferred becomes larger and larger, and the strain on the wafer–matrix–is going to contract. And so, the interface becomes more</text>

But when putting that all together, there’s one thing that remains constant: the amount of pollution coming out of the city. 	So, if we want to take the concept of home as an example, and think about how we can embed AI within our built environments, but also how we can design it to be smart and nimble in response to environmental and social constraints, then we need to start thinking about how to talk about the environment in a different way. We need to start thinking about what it means to be ‘in the city’, and how that relates to the development of AI and other new technological paradigms. 	What I find fascinating is that in our current period of economic growth and technological innovation, we’re seeing an explosion of urbanisation all over the world. And yet, almost all of that growth and growth is happening in places where literacy rates are extremely low, where housing is extremely scarce and where political instability and social conflict</text>

So there is this tension between what the city or the profession wants and what the city or the profession actually does. And so I imagine that as an anthropologist or a scientist or curator or whatever you’d like to do, you’d also want to think about how we might begin to rethink or change the way we conceptualise the ways in which our cities and our professions might engage with, or create alternative understandings of, or incorporate elements of, or incorporate elements from elsewhere.

But when we start to think about what an atmospheric composition might be, or might become, that might start to make some sense. That’s where things get interesting, because we start to imagine things that don’t exist. Things like water, air, nutrients, and trace elements, that we don’t actually have or can’t produce, that can contribute to making the climate work in interesting ways. And so there’s that dynamic. There’s also that whole social process that comes with it, where people start to think about ways to be more like humans, to create environments that are like homes, and start to talk about what it means to be ‘close’ to nature.  In fact, one of the things that came out of our third climate talk was the idea that we could create an entirely new kind of architecture that’s based on kinetics and energy.

But it’s also a product of economics. And I think that part of the reason why it’s such a persistent concept is that it’s such a persistent thing: there’s a reason why it’s so ubiquitous, because there’s always that big black box that says ‘here’ and ‘there’ and ‘me’. And there’s always that reason why it’s there. But I don’t think that part of the reason why the insulation that we have now was produced on a large scale in large factories is because of the promise that was given by the system designer. It’s more that the promise was realised and the system was adapted to meet it. And the reason why it’s so ubiquitous is that the system designer has that big black box that he or she invents.

But when we start talking about the physical products of insulation, we start imagining not only the work that goes into producing insulation, but also the trade-offs and trade-offs that happen along the way. For example, the way we think about light-tight buildings is through the prism of economics. But economics doesn’t really tell us how we should build our cities. It’s more about the mechanisms that allow a city to function. So what I see happening in my city is a re-constituting of the social complexities of housing. I don’t mean in terms of new social institutions, like housing for the urban poor, but rather in terms of a new social relationship between the city and the poor, who’re the future residents of the city?  	I think that phrase ‘social complexity’ is a trap. I don’t mean to suggest that there’s no relationship between housing and income; there�</text>

We also have to consider the fact that we’re all exposed to the same amount of air, and the same amount of noise, and that we’re all exposed to the same amount of pressure, and that we’re all exposed to the same amount of light. And so when we talk about the housing crisis, we have to also consider the fact that we’re all exposed to the same amount of water, and that we’re all exposed to the same amount of turbulence. And so we have to ask ourselves, how much of what we see is due to chance alone, and how much can be attributed to the fact that we live in the same city?

So in a way, there’s a continuum between the technologies we use to produce energy and the technologies that are produced when we live within a city. 	However, there’s a limit to how far this boundary can be stretched. At some point, the limits of the city start to blur together, and there’s a point where the physical and the virtual separation becomes too great. Then, there’s a point where the physical and the virtual barriers begin to conflict, and a crisis of urban-ness arises. In my view, the ­Curtains Actuarial Report 2015 is a good example of how the boundaries between the physical and the virtual can be drawn, and how the latter are at a moment of great political, economic and social fragmentation. It’s a report that looks at the interaction between new technologies and old-fashioned notions of urbanicity, and it’s a starting-point for other research and development projects.</text>

For me, the key is the way in which the art is embedded in the process. It’s as if the artist has embedded herself in the fabric of the building and the processes that take place within it. And in a very real and powerful way, she has. 	And here I wanted to come back to the concept of home that I had come across during my research; that there is a very different kind of home that we as consumers of architecture and design should be exploring. Because I think that in our current consumption of architecture, we have forgotten about the very real and powerful social and political contexts that architecture can play in. We tend to think of architectural interventions as if they’re some kind of magic bullet that will somehow</text>

    machines were asked to take over the curatorial role, and the city was given a new lease of life.Everything was automated, and the old theatre and its inhabitants were forgotten. But in the intervening years, a small contingent of passionate souls have attempted to revive the once-in-a-lifetime experience of ‘being in the pocket’ of the Machine.

The outcome of their research project would be used to investigate the characteristics of an interesting and provocative urban environment, and perhaps to propose an intervention or a programme of action.The project was an intervention, and its intent was to change the way we viewed and acted as artists, curators, and publics in the city. We’d like to think that if there’s a place for art and artifice in a utopian future, it should be instilled in the collective consciousness, and instilled here with the values and ideals that make us human. We thought that Projections was a way to activate the collective imagination and imagination of the city, and perhaps, through the aggregation of various creative acts, to spark a new beginning. We also hoped that it might yield the beginnings of a new collaborative process between the existing art institutions and the non-artistic sectors of the city, involving artists, architects, landscape architects, young people and the curatorial calligrapher. The goal was to open a dialogue between the different creative</text>

The outcome of their research project would be used to alter the urban form, creating a plaza or a square with a physical and mental allegiance to people and places. The projections they produced would be utterly invisible, but their tacit and sometimes explicit threats were. Since their work was theoretical, it could also be used as a last resort. It’s with this last statement that I turn to avoid seeming dense or redundant or apolitical or even – gasp! – Marxist. It’s with this last statement that I turn to avoid seeming apathetic or uninteresting or as though the threat of destruction weren’t real. Because it is, and it’s what the dystopian future calls to mind. And yet here we are, 80 years later, and the threats of destruction are real and palpable and we’re both trapped in this bubble of comfortable luxury and prosperity. We’re both victims of a fraud on the public.And yet we have no choice but to inhabit the conditions of this comforting illusion: to inhabit</text>

The forms were designed to be activated by a single person – a curatorial calligrapher, engineer or architect – with exceptional skill and creativity. The outcome of their research project would be used, not to produce buildings, but to create new modes of urban existence – a new kind of urbanism.Projections was also a response to the fact that, as the curatorate, one could always ask a favour or offer a solution to a problem that one does not understand. In this respect, it was a hybrid between traditional art institutions and modern industry. It offered artists an opportunity to expand their artistic horizons and the city in exchange for a fixed percentage of future developments. The percentage could vary widely, but it was always guaranteed that the artists would find a way to exploit the city in some way. So, while the percentage of projects that became industrial sites reached astronomical proportions, the city found ways to function without it. This dynamic was partly created by the machination of developers, who saw an opening when others saw an opening, and latched onto any chance they could get into the city. It is this mix of factors – factors such as climate change, the war on terror and</text>

The outcome of their research project would be used to generate new paradigms around human habitation and social organisation.Projections was not a new thing. The work of William Kentridge and his team in the 1950s is a classic example. But Projections was a wholly new kind of art project, built on the logic of economics and the workings of capitalism. Its avant garde, critical and playful forms were part of a larger political and social agenda that sought to ruminate on the tensions and contradictions of contemporary social life and constructing social change through the reconfiguration of infrastructure. Kentridge was a leading environmentalist and the author of novels set in the dystopian future that were filled with environmental destruction and conflicted social narratives. His work was also part of a generation of artists and writers whose commitments were further evidenced in the reinvention of popular culture through the emergence of independent visual arts. A kind of ‘new’ was born.Reading the manifesto Projections, by artist duo BOOM! and members of the curatorial staff,</text>

The project was a response to the vacillation and inefficiency of contemporary artifice, and its desire to connect people and bring people together through art, not through industry or politics. The  	location, the medium and the effect  	were the issue. If the Factory was ambitious in its urbanisation plans, Projections sought to unsettle the city by bringing people together through art, not through industry or politics. The Factory was fixated on the built environment – the  	environment – and its various forms, which were seen as constituting the fulcrum of contemporary urbanisation. Its projects were confined to the city in the interest of efficiency and surplus. The public, the artist and the shoemaker were placed in a situation of scarcity and poverty. The objective of the Factory was to create a radically new urban context through what it called ‘the Idea of Community�</text>

The outcome of their research project would be used to revolutionise the urban environment in the way that the artists imagined it could be.The  	Projections was not a project in itself, though. It was an act of memory, a return to the city – to the place where all past practices and forms of urban existence would be preserved. We read the plans again and again, and yet can't put them into practice. The present is too concrete, the buildings too modernist, the politics too globalised. We have to create a future that isn’t quite like the past, in order to live in the present. That’s what memory is: a past that we can react to. This is what the Bankhead concept is all about: a promise – a promise – that is kept, and which is then broken. When the Bankhead was conceived, the aim was to preserve as much of the city as possible, while enabling the future to inhabit what remains. This is what the Bankhead community has</text>

The outcome of their research project would be used to initiate and guide an entirely new kind of urban experience, one that was both organic and digital. But what was so intriguing and so powerful about the way in which art was conceived and imagined in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance was precisely the opposite: the cultivation of a spiritual and magical connection between arts and life. Art was understood by its opposite, and not simply as an object of aesthetic judgement or the product of aesthetic niches. Real art was imagined and created through the magic of metaphor and metaphor.This is the context in which Curator Relations was conceived and conceived by. I think it speaks to an essential change in the way in which imagination, aesthetic judgement and aesthetic experience were constituted, constituted and negotiated throughout the twentieth and even twenty-first centuries. I think that is is the fundamental shift that has to be made now – in all spheres of culture, in all mediums – in order to have any chance of influencing the future in any meaningful way.

The ability to identify and point to a particular event or epiphany could be used as a weapon by those with a clear agenda – and that's to say, those who would like to see an end to art and to commodify art.The ability to identify and point to a particular event or epiphany might be</text>

The next step in the exhibition process is the installation, which introduces the objects to the visual language of their concepts, and the growing collection of text and image archives into the narrative of the exhibition. In this sense, it creates an immersive experience for the visitor, one that is rich and varied but distinct from the images or drawings on offer. This is the fourth iteration of the Biennale and the fourth iteration of the curatorial team, so it is no exaggeration to say that the changes made to the Venice Biennale collection between the previous three iterations are substantive and that those made to the collections of the Venetian Museums are particularly significant. Of course, this statement only applies to the collections of the Venetian Museums. There is much more going on in the city than meets the eye, and the biennale has always been an art form that is influenced by the collection. But as the Biennale has become</text>

The collection of artefacts, objects and designs that form the basis of the exhibition are grouped into categories including: curating at the Venice Biennale, family treks, installation art, collection cards, greeting cards, greeting cards with inscriptions, prints, maps, audio and text, and silk hand-coloured frames, woodcuts, prints and more. The 18 spaces of the Biennale house the following: a) the exhibition venue itself, b) the entry point to the Biennale, c) the exhibition platform, and d) the collection area. Each category also has six subcategories: a) travel subcategory, b) participant subcategory, c) trade subcategory, d) world travel subcategory and e) public collections subcategorised by topic. The text and image gallery subcategories categorise the texts and images that form the basis of the exhibition. The categories also organise the collection, taking into account the different media (including images, texts, audio and video recordings) that are used in the context of the exhibition. For the categories of the exhibition, the curators used archival collections, current exhibitions, archival materials and new media to reveal the hidden stories and histories of the contemporary world.</text>

The collection of artefacts, objects and designs that form the basis of the exhibition are grouped into categories including: curating at the Venice Biennale, family treks, installation art, collection cards, greeting cards, greeting cards with inscriptions, prints, maps, audio recordings, maps, videos and photography. The collection of greeting cards is divided into three sections: singles, couples and group texts. Single images and single texts introduce the various subjects of the collection and the curatorial discussion that results from curating the exhibition. The collection of collection cards presents the curatorial position on a specific subject or set of subjects. Curatorial thinking and its consequences for the collection, the social, cultural and political contexts in which the collection is situated, can be seen as a form of collecting. The collection of collection cards has a particular place in the exhibitionary complex because of its massive, liquid and digital reproduction. Its size and weight – representing some of the most valuable and treasured artefacts on the market – obliges the viewer to pause frequently, take in the enormity of the collections and the social engagements that result from them, and to cross-reference back and forth across them. Curators and art collectors are among the most mobile consumers of cultural resources, and</text>

The collection of artefacts, objects and designs that form the basis of the exhibition are grouped into categories including: curating at the Venice Biennale, family treks, installation art, collection cards, greeting cards, greeting cards with inscriptions, prints, maps, graphs, cut-and-pasted text and photographs. The categories also include travel, home, fashion, food and travel photos. In the second phase of the exhibition, the collection of treks, the main exhibition venue, the Biennale commissions local artists to restore the sections of the Venice Biennale that will once again display works by modern and contemporary artists. These restored sections are organized around chronological times and places, with descriptions of the restored art of the treks, as well as biennales in the past and future. The third and final stage of the exhibition, the plaza, presents a collection of works by local artists to showcase the treks as a film form and a historical narrative.[1] The idea that we might one day one day walk amongst the artefacts of the Curatorial collection is one that fascinates and concerns us. It concerns us because we know that this never happens. It concerns us because, as this theory suggests, we’d one</text>

The interactive bookshop presents the project from its conception to its reality in an engaging way. The text and image gallery sections present a visual language of concepts, practices and ideas that complements the images and texts of the projects that form the basis of the exhibition. The collection of artefacts, objects and designs that form the basis of the exhibition are grouped into categories including: curating at the Venice Biennale, family treks, installation art, collection cards, greeting cards, greeting cards with inscriptions, prints, maps, databases and documents. The collection of treks is broken down into three categories: the bicycle path, the metro and the tram. In the third category, materials and building materials are grouped into categories including cardboard, Styrofoam and Ramen. The categories of the exhibition structure – the collection of artefacts, the collection of objects and the collection of designs – are not mutually exclusive but rely on each other. Therefore, ‘contemporary art’ needs to be multidimensional, and the collection of artefacts, the collection of objects and the collection of designs is a building comprised of many different kinds of use. Thus, the collection of artefacts, the collection of objects and the collection of treks are interrelated and mutually dependent forms of accumulation. The collection of treks is an organic, multi-step process that continuously evolves and produces new kinds of accumulation, and its collection, like the collection of artefacts, is a living, evolving, evolving collection of objects.

The collection of artefacts, objects and designs that form the basis of the exhibition are grouped into categories including: curating at the Venice Biennale, family treks, installation art, collection cards, greeting cards, greeting cards with inscriptions, prints, maps, charts, graphs and aerial photography. The category-system of the exhibition is a re-organized version of an artefact collection’s kinetic paper route. The categories thus function as a double-sided form: they serve as markers and registers of time spent in the gallery, and they reveal hidden compartments and passageways of the past. And in this sense, the curatorial gesture, the collection card, the aerial photograph and the text reveal hidden compartments and passages of the contemporary world. As the collection card and the collection of artefacts is an image-system, the collection of objects reveals new levels of mobility and entry into the exhibitionary complex. The collection of objects reveals its hidden compartments and passages through a dynamic combination of images, texts and symbols. In this sense, the collection card, the collection of artefacts and the exhibition are all artefacts in the making. When viewed from the collection card or the collection of objects, the collection card offers access to hidden comp</text>

The categories also include performance, auteur, performance art, travel and children. Within each category, examples are selected through a crowdsourcing process on the project’s Facebook page. Examples of each category are listed in order of appearance in the exhibition, with links to the collections of the respective artists. The interactive bookshop presents the project as a working title and a chronology of its development, with information about the curatorial process and the exhibition. The image gallery and text sections present images from the project, including works selected through an open call focused on the project’s audience. The gift shop contains items specifically designed to be taken away for personal use. The plaza is a gathering of people’s use of space, a gathering of possessions, and a gathering of objects.

Several of the curatorial initiatives in the exhibition are based around a collect-a-thing – a generic term that describes the collection of things in a given exhibition – and the random-access archive form of the curatorial process. The random-access archive forms part of another part of the exhibition, collections. The collection of things in an archive is a collection of stories, whose structure derives from the word archival in the title of the exhibition. The collection of treks is a collection of stories, whose structure is informed by the story told in the text and image sections. The collection of installations is a collection of stories, whose structure is informed by the story told in the image and text sections. Finally, the collection of collections is a collection of stories, whose structure is informed by the collection of objects (pictures, texts, drawings, audio recordings etc) that form the basis of the exhibition. In a world with no hierarchy of things, objects and collections,</text>

In my work, I often refer to the term Community Arts, although I usually do it with people from other disciplines. In the 1960s and 1970s, I did research on artists who were creating practices that would one day be called Community Arts, and through a fieldwork project I interviewed a number of them, interviewing their families, as well as other family members and friends. I also developed a project that would one day be called the Black-Estudies Gallery. At the time, the name was a play on the names of two blacklisted artists: Martin Luther King Jr. and W.E.B. Du Bois. Both were blacklisted because they were thought to be radical or subversive. For King and Du Bois, the stakes were very different. King was talking about actual acts of resistance</text>

This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but it is also gathering evidence that shows quite how deeply AI can be applied in the future.  One example of this is the growing body of research on language understanding and understanding of dialects, which is increasingly enabling researchers to decipher the underlying semantics of individual phrases. For example, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a way to automatically decipher the difference between statements in a given situation that refer to nouns and verbs and statements that refer to entities such as phrases such as ‘chicken coop’ or ‘cloud cuckoo’. Such advances may well lead to new kinds of speech-recognition systems that translate everyday speech into intelligible form, augmenting our own language skills and even replacing it entirely.  Another example is the work of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University led by Professors Jeffrey Chester and Lauren Graham, who are developing a system that imitates the memory function in neurons by using dense data on a subject's behaviour as a sensorium</text>

A New Kind of Research  A new kind of research is emerging that is asking how AI will affect the way knowledge is produced and transmitted in the future, and how this impacts on existing forms of racism, capitalism and colonialism. This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but the main thrust of it seems to be in defence of the old order and white supremacy. It is being done in part through the mechanisms of academia, but also through original research and creative intervention.  The main obstacle to such a research seems to be a sense of entitlement among a certain kind of citizenry.  One might even speak about a citizen ‘generation’ or ‘one’ – which raises important questions about what kinds of futures will such citizens create and how they will live their destinies. Some may even seek to create their own AI and call it HAL (Human Artificial Intelligence Laboratory). But this is only the start of the story. Creating Meaningful AI  A second kind of research is emerging that is asking how AI can produce meaning in the world in new and creative ways. This kind of research tends to address the philosophical rather than the practical aspects of AI, and the tasks of philosophical and religious thought. It is being done in part</text>

This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but it is also revealing about the conditions and prospects of our present and the causes of future conflicts. In short, it seeks to come to grips with the new forms of collective knowledge production and consumption that will result from the magic of AI.  Meeting the Press  A series of interviews with leading scientists and technologists is featured in the book  The New Machine Intelligence. These interviews take the form of chapters devoted to different aspects of AI, from the design of self-driving cars to the design of massively parallel online services and massively parallel data-processing architectures, and they are written by researchers from various fields of science and technology.  The chapters are organized chronologically (from top to bottom) and addressed to different parts of the globe, and they cover topics such as robotics, artificial intelligence, map-processing, social robots, data mining, natural language processing and much more. The topics covered range from general AI principles to specific applications of AI, from the design of social robotics to</text>

This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but there are signs that it is also gathering pace for the destruction of humanity.  A Brief History of AI  A Brief History of AI is a kind of brief history of artificial intelligence (AI), taking the form of short essays that serve as the basis for a future that is free from AI. The essays are constructed through interviews with leading figures in AI, their supporters and adversaries, and the philosophical and linguistic underpinnings of AI. This kind of research is often done in the service of justifying or resolving certain actions and policies that are being taken today to address AI’s existential threat.

This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but it is also gathering evidence of the effects that AI will have on our bodies and our environment in hitherto unimaginable ways. This kind of research is often referred to as Bio-intelligent or Planetary Intelligence, but it is gathering evidence of the very real and potentially devastating impacts of AI on us and the planet in hitherto inconceivable ways. For instance, recent studies are revealing new ways that AI is able to discover patterns and similarities across vast distances in the physical world, even when these may relate to existing racial and socio-economic hierarchies or historical injustices. And, as the SETI Institute’s director, Randall M. Nelson, puts it: ‘AI is revolutionizing everything from how we live our lives to what we call the “production and consumption” of things around the globe.’[1]  So, there are signs that the pace of change is creating conditions in which a planetary reckoning may be unavoidable.The pace of change is creating</text>

This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but it is also bringing to light how AI will alter the very structure of knowledge production itself. This is due to the fact that AI is able to fabricate knowledge itself, rather than relying on human judgment or expertise. It is creating what might be called a proto-knowledge infrastructure, based on machine intelligence and Big Data analytics, capable of producing knowledge at scale and in real-time, with or without the knowledge of humans. This kind of knowledge production is what is being sought in both the name of research and service industries.  The Rise of Proto-Knowledge Infrastructure, a.k.a.

A New Kind of Research  A new kind of research is emerging that is asking how AI will affect the way knowledge is produced and transmitted in the future, and how this impacts on existing forms of racism, capitalism and colonialism. This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but there is growing evidence that it is also relevant for the past, and even of being a form of resistance.  One example of this is the OnMogenesis project, which sought to develop self-assembling 3D cubes from materials that can assemble into extraordinary shapes, using indigenous and synthetic biology techniques. These cubes could potentially be used in disaster relief, as well as in future research into new forms of art and culture.  Another example is the  AddIt project, an international collaborative project that sought to create 3D printed jewelry using indigenous and 3D modelling techniques. These projects use existing 3D modelling and fabrication technologies to produce items with extraordinary abilities of form and function, including body or object replacements. One of the most promising developments in this context is the use of archival materials and 3D modelling to reconstruct pre-historic and archaeological sites of war and violence, including the Amu Nukwa site in Nigeria, where large-scale stone countertops and a large</text>

This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but it is beginning to be questioned whether or not it is relevant at all. Media theorist and philosopher Gareth White clarifies the difference between philosophy and science: philosophy is the domain of introspective, critical thought, while science is the domain of observable phenomena. White begins by saying that we humans live in an empirical world, and that while AI will certainly attempt to understand human thought and behaviour in this world, it is not yet capable of creating an entirely new understanding of reality. White goes on to say that we are not able to see the forest for the trees, and that we are even less able to see the forest for the things that follow it. In other words, White claims, we ‘live in what Immanuel Kant called a false and fictitious world’.1  Knowing that machines are inevitably going to become much more ‘powerful’ and capable of much greater amounts of data and data processing, White’s work starts to look to other</text>

This kind of research is often cited as being relevant for the future of humanity, but more and more evidence is emerging that it is as important as any field of science and technology to be fully autonomous and nirvana free.  The reason why autonomous means virtually never in a research project is that research projects are dynamic and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that an AI system never commits a mistake or breaks something down in a chaotic process, but there is growing evidence that it is far less prone to these things than we are.  The reason why research projects are so open to change is that this changes the dynamic of the situation: now, not all possibilities are actively avoided, but there is more and more of a reason to avoid them in the name of research.  The rise of AI tends to exacerbate this kind of research project, because it makes it easier and cheaper to insert an AI system into a research project, and this makes it possible to monitor and control that system in ways never imagined.  The rise of AI tends to make it impossible to express fully</text>

For instance, the contradictions and paradoxes of the Napoleonic Wars, which appear in many of the collected articles, poems and sketches, are often formulated in terms that echo the conflicting values and aims of the postcard.1 	One English traveller described the confusion and terror he felt on Napoleon’s Russia, during the early stages of the First World War.2 	The conflicts that would later be called the Napoleonic Wars were fought over territory and ideas, with the Russian Empire at the height of its power perceived as fundamentally threatened by the emergence of a free and independent European power at the other. The English, who had established permanent colonies in all of Europe, were determined to stamp out any form of Russian influence in Europe. 	The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 ushered a period of political instability and ideological confusion that would last for decades, but which for various reasons was never fully resolved. It is likely that, had the conflict taken place, it would have brought about some form of collaboration between the two superpowers – perhaps even collaboration on an equal footing – and perhaps even facilitated the achievement of some forms of collaboration between the powers engaged in the conflict. </text>

For instance, the Spanish Armada in May 1915 claimed victory in an incident recounted by Captain Robert Fitzroy, but many historians now doubt the Rebellion was even real. 	And while the Napoleonic Archive occupies a special place in the university’s collection, its contents are often dismissed as unimportant or even a distraction from the main thrust of the conflict. This is particularly the case with the collection of postcards, which often act as a kind of geopolitical map or ‘till' or ‘the small print' of the conflict across the Napoleonic world. As William McCauley has shown, the high seas that the postcard attempts to portray as ‘safe from foreign invasion’ gave the Empire its defining shape.[1] 	[2] McCauley breaks down the various contradictory claims into ‘a logic of consistency and predictability that would have been second to none in the empire’s developing stages’</text>

The ‘wager’ on British national identity and colonial succession implicit in the collection of images is reinforced by images of exiled Frenchmen holding banners emblazoned with the ‘British’ flag. 	[3] 	[4] 	[5] The collection of images is a living organism that actively seeks to be organised and annotated. When taken as a whole, the images present a powerful visual archive, they chronicle the migratory and border-less movements of people, goods and objects over vast distances. 	[6] 	[7] 	[8] These images were taken from the archive of a ship, the ‘Nautilus’, which was built in Boston in 1774 and named for John Adams, the Massachusetts Bay “fishing prince”. The Nautilus was the first merchantman built in Boston and one of the city’s earliest port cities. Its</text>

Thus the concluding sentence of Conrad’s poem, ‘Victory in the Napoleonic Wars was Mine’, could have been taken either as a justification for the wars or as a declaration of innocence by the combatants. (JV)Connecting the arts and the community 	Just as the arts community has contributed to the creation of a wealth of material for the collector to peruse, so too has the local or small scale production of arts and craftsmanship influenced the development of the infrastructure that would support a possible future for the community. This was true in much of the UK during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; the large scale commercial production of goods and the associated community ‘corner shop’ were two of the earliest forms of production supported by the state and regulated by councils. 	At the same time, the rise of photography and the mass consumption of images during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries created a demand for images of great variety from every corner of</text>

The influence of the postcard is unmistakable in the collection’s consideration of 1864, but the essays and sketches that remain from that decade’s conflict are also often written in terms that echo the ideal of 18tegenation, the romantic ideal of the antique future.

In the collection’s early collection of ‘surviving fragments’, Norman Browning makes a name for himself as the intellectual leader of a loose network of radical intellectuals and artists. Browning’s collection is a sharp contrast to the more restrained, even vacillating, thoughts expressed in the essays, naively selected fragments that constitute the bulk of the collection’s later collection. 	In his 1989 collection of essays ‘Outlawed Social Life’, philosopher Richard Rorty offers a sweeping portrayal of modernity as it is experienced in the wake of the postindustrial society he decamps in for two years. 	Rorty begins his book by describing the excesses and inconsistencies of modernity’s emergence, which he defines as the condition in which ‘human excess, or the striving after abstract space, can no longer be considered the pinnacle of human culture’.
