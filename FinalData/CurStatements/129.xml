But this is precisely what happened when the autonomous vehicle was programmed with language, and subsequently, when the automated vehicle was given autonomous driving duties.The ability to follow predetermined paths through a geographic area opens up entirely new scenarios for research and design – scenarios that were previously beyond the capabilities of the human drivers. For example, the ability to map certain kinds of infrastructure – roads, bridges, tunnels – and make them useful to other kinds of vehicles could render them usable by machines, making them conduits for the transport of goods and people, or even parts of transnational infrastructure that monitor and control flow of traffic. Such capabilities would render existing infrastructure completely redundant, leaving open the possibility that there would be ways to connect the disparate parts, providing a means of bypassing the need for new infrastructure altogether. Researchers could theoretically implant certain kinds of sensors into the network of the autonomous vehicle, allowing the parts to communicate with one another and with infrastructure, enabling autonomous vehicles to recognise one another and with infrastructure, and enabling them to do things like gathering data on the behaviour of traffic, collecting data on the routes taken by vehicles and of buildings, and much more.Such potentialities are just some of many that emerge from considering the</text>

But this is precisely what happened when the autonomous vehicle was programmed with language, and subsequently, when the automated vehicle was given autonomous driving duties.The ability to follow predetermined paths through a geographic area opens up entirely new ways of organising things, new ways of interacting with the world. It’s as if the autonomous vehicle were able to see the map and program the car to follow certain paths through the city, based on predetermined parameters. This kind of programming seems extremely mundane, but the implication is that even relatively mundane tasks require great skill and concentration to perform, and that the responsibilities don’t lie solely with the driver. For example, how could the driver instigate such behaviour? Or take things a step further and allow the car to drive itself? This is what Raziel Parviz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology did when he worked with the MIT Media Lab in the late 1990s, and it remains one of the most ambitious research programmes of the autonomous vehicle sector.MIT Media Lab was founded in 1975 and its mission is to develop innovative media technologies that will influence social and political behaviour through innovative media techniques. As a result of this mission, its researchers were invited by the New York</text>

But this is precisely what happened when the autonomous vehicle was programmed with language, and subsequently, when the automated vehicle was given autonomous driving duties.The ability to follow predetermined paths through a geographic area opens up entirely new kinds of interaction possibilities – ones that cannot be dictated by human controllers. For example, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States have developed a toolkit that enables drivers of autonomous vehicles to carry out certain types of repairs more effectively, at a cost that is far less than repairing damaged vehicles. And in research projects at MIT and the California Institute of Technology in the United States, researchers have developed materials and engineering systems that mimic the properties of the brain in a way that minimises distortion and maximises performance.These innovations do not imply that humans will one day take over all aspects of driving – although it is worth remembering that driverless cars now need to undergo extensive testing before being allowed to hit the road. But they do suggest that future vehicles will likely need to learn to recognise and repair themselves, and that this may require artificial intelligence.A toolkit that enables autonomous vehicles to repair themselves is one thing, but a system that creates fully functional replicas of the brain is quite another.

But this is precisely what happened when the autonomous vehicle was programmed with language, and subsequently, when the automated vehicle was given autonomous driving duties.The ability to follow predetermined paths through a geographic area opens up entirely new ways of organising human activity – functions utterly divorced from any notion of human agency. For example, the researchers behind Project Titan, which sought to develop 'smart' buildings that could monitor and control water resources through data streams [2], developed smart irrigation canals that connected property developers with conservationists through software. The idea was that the smart irrigation canals would be able to detect when the city was in drought, and react accordingly by automatically adjusting the amount of water needed to be pumped into the ground-water system. By monitoring groundwater levels, the smart irrigation canals avoided the need for regular draining of the soil and water table, and instead relied entirely on software to detect when the city was in drought-like conditions and respond accordingly. This type of intelligent watering seems far less capable of understanding nuance than humans are, but that is also because humans have a conceptual model of nuance that is far more capable of grasping nuance – nuance that comes from long-term experience and in-depth study.

But this is precisely what happened when the autonomous vehicle was programmed with language, and subsequently, when the automated vehicle was given autonomous driving duties.The ability to follow predetermined paths through a geographic area opens up entirely new ways of organising things. For instance, the researchers behind Project Tau Delta believe that it is possible to imagine constructing a drone capable of carrying out certain types of surveillance tasks, such as gathering intelligence on criminal networks or terrorist groups, or even the surveillance of criminal activity itself. Such surveillance drones would not only carry out these kinds of surveillance, but could also create what the researchers call ‘digital double agents’ by becoming agents of both the machine and the impossible.In what way does autonomous technology make our lives easier? Could it enable us to do things more easily, more nimbly, more nimbly? The ability to automate tasks that would otherwise be complex, time-consuming, and error-prone could mean that researchers can devote more time to what they call research and development, while those tasks that remain unmanageable – those that require conscious thought – are dispatched to machines. This is the assumption behind the idea that computers are churning out ever more complex models of the world</text>

But this is precisely what happened when the autonomous vehicle was programmed with language, and subsequently, when the automated vehicle was given autonomous driving duties.The ability to follow predetermined paths through a geographic area opens up entirely new ways of operating the vehicles. For instance, the researchers behind Oxford Analytica think that a vehicle operating under the assumption that it is being monitored by a computer could autonomously change lanes to avoid colliding with pedestrians, cyclists and other road users. Such discretion is entirely at odds with the decision-making of humans, who tend to follow predetermined paths through densely populated urban areas all the time. But the autonomous vehicle that Oxford Analytica develop under these conditions is far more flexible and nimble, able to change lanes based on information from sensors attached to the roof of the car, and even handle unexpected changes in wind and traffic.Such is the nature of autonomy – the ability to do things with no agency or self-consciously imposed choice – but despite its potential, autonomy finds its limits in the face of increasing automation. In an increasingly globalised world with ever more sensors embedded in the vehicle, it is imperative that autonomous vehicles operate at a very deep level in relation to each other.</text>

But this is precisely what happened when the autonomous vehicle was programmed with language, and subsequently, when the automated vehicle was given autonomous driving duties.The ability to follow predetermined paths through a geographic area opens up entirely new ways of engaging with cities. For example, the ability to use traffic signals to guide vehicles does not necessarily require the knowledge and comprehension of how traffic signals work, nor the sophisticated calculations that go into constructing such systems. The ability to use traffic lights and road networks in this way could be understood by engineers with a high level of proficiency. And while researchers did develop ways of programming the systems that drive autonomous vehicles to behave in certain ways, the significant majority of researchers – including those at Google – viewed such capabilities as a perversion of the underlying principles of autonomous driving. Even when researchers did develop in-vehicle computer programs that drove partially autonomous vehicles, the widespread acceptance of these technologies did not come as a revelation to researchers, nor as a surprise to the drivers of these vehicles. Rather, the mechanisms of autonomous driving needed to be understood in order to be adjusted in response to changing conditions and traffic flow.[2]It is this lack of wider acceptance that makes research and development so interesting.

For instance, the researchers behind the Oxford Dictionaries project, which mapped all the English words ending in ‘God’ in English, may now plan to translate these words into Cantonese, a tongue that is distinct from English but shares many of the same grammatical rules and concepts. And since Cantonese is distinct from English in that it lacks a written language alongside spoken language, researchers will need to create a separate system that can map these two different varieties of Cantonese together. This is where computers come in. Although they are not native to the region, computers are widely believed to be built in such a way as to be able to understand and manipulate large amounts of data, and this is what the Oxford Dictionaries project did, mapping words ending in ‘God’ to Cantonese. And since computers can only understand basic characters – meaning that they contain only alphanumeric</text>

But this is precisely what happened when the autonomous vehicle was programmed with language, and subsequently, when the automated vehicle was given autonomous driving duties.The ability to follow predetermined paths through a geographic area opens up entirely new ways of organizing and interacting with the city, one might imagine. The question, however, is how to enable that kind of autonomous mobility in a way that is not exploitative of workers and which contributes to addressing the many different kinds of inequality and oppression faced by different parts of the city. The answer, as always, is a complex set of considerations and scenarios, and researching the specificities of each scenario is a good place to start. However, it is possible to imagine a kind of mutual dependency between city dwellers and autonomous vehicles, in the sense that the city is capable of supporting and enabling a kind of autonomous mobility that is not dependent on linguistic or sensorimotor signals.In his book  	Mastering Transportation (2010), Roderick Long proposes the ‘Transportation Inquiry’, asking: what is the role of transportation in the contemporary urban environment? Long begins by asking: ‘What is it that cities are good at? What are their strengths?</text>

For instance, researchers could target certain parts of a city with sensors that detect movement in certain kinds of materials, and can map those materials to specific kinds of labour and automation technologies that can be applied to that city. In these cases, the researchers don’t need to know anything about the city itself – just about the areas where the sensors detect movement – though in the future, researchers could conceivably map the entire city. In any case, this kind of over-simplification is part of the new nomadic society – in which humans are replaced by machines – and thus part of the reason why so many people are displaced in the global South.Nomadic societies are replaced by something more permanent and ubiquitous: the automobile. Yet in the wake of this change, the role of the city in shaping how humans are distributed globally is likely to play a much more prominent role – perhaps more so than in the existing binary notions of South and West.

In her proposal, one could argue that the increased focus on the city as a contemporary aesthetic backdrop is the direct outcome of the museum-going experience, and the economic logic of the museum-going has led to a society in which the museum is the sole remaining space of value. This economic logic generates the desire to explore the city in general, and the importance of its cultural sectors, particularly in contemporary art’s exploration of the city. Many artists have their studio spaces, their studio spaces in particular, but this only underscores the fact that these spaces are transient. Their presence is a transient presence; a transient presence in the sense that it is difficult to imagine what the museum would be like in the future.

Drawing on the exhibitionary form, it became an instrument through which art was made accessible in a city whose streets were as empty as its museums. It was a biennale that transcended the museum and the street, and its aim was to show new art equally well represented within existing works of art. It was a hybrid form that could also be a site of resistance.

It was also billed as a ‘once in a lifetime’ event, and so the biennial form was intended to span multiple lifetimes, perhaps even existing in a parallel universe. The initial public presentation of the exhibition set out a number of questions that had been cropping up in various permutations for some time, as well as new ones. The question that stood out the most, at the time, was whether the exhibition would be able to capture the excitement and sense of wonder of the moment, even in a city as large as Liverpool. Other concerns included whether the building of the Biennale would be able to meet the expectations of its host city, and whether the Biennale would be able to connect with the local residents and</text>

It may also seek to immerse the city in its contemporary via cultural industries, new architecture and the urbanisation of the underbelly. The new museum may be constructed on the archival collections and present the city’s present through archival materials and visual techniques.[1] In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Biennial was also a platform for the production and presentation of a variety of other works, many of which are still active in the visual arts and culture worldwide.

In her own words: ‘The Liverpool Biennial 2014 project is a complete re-construction of the history of the city, taking place in both “public&quot; and “private” venues throughout the city. It is an enormous and unprecedented undertaking, requiring the cooperation of city governments, grassroots groups and citizens to carry out, and it is hoped that this massive, unprecedented and unpredictable undertaking will once again bring the people of Liverpool together as one in an unprecedented and unprecedented mode of collaboration.’[2] The 14th Biennale of Sydney, Australia, took place in October 2014. The project began as a collaboration between the city council, the Biennale and Liverpool’s Museum of Art and Design. Liverpool Biennial 2014 was curated as a public art project with the city’s support, and will be overseen by the Biennale itself, which will provide financial support for the project</text>

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, curated by Marianne Moore and Theo Wenders, offered a disjointed collection of activities – a postmortem on the fate of urban environments, a takedown of urban legends, and a meditation on the meaning of contemporaneity – that offered little in the way of resolution.

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s trade shows, which increased in number and range as the biennial’s size and vibrancy increased. As a result, the number of exhibitions a year began to shrink, and the number of exhibitionary venues also began to shrink. The number of biennials in the world today is actually quite small, with the exception of a few developing countries, such as India and China, with burgeoning urban populations, and the Middle East. In countries with stable or declining populations, the number of biennials may increase, but for developed nations and their cultural institutions, the number is still small.Art’s own historical and contemporary experience in this situation suggests a number of other factors besides the weight of the art world itself – cultural factors, political factors, economic factors, and environmental factors. Taking into account all of these factors, it is possible to see that the biennial was never intended to be an island unto itself. It is a dynamic, shifting and variable entity, with a</text>

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s portfolio, which at the height of the biennial’s popularity was regularly replete with works that challenged the conventional and obsolete assumptions of everyday life. It is this repleteity that artists like Rubens Maté and Marc Forster had to confront when they started to experiment with artistic-political, urban and social practices in the 1980s and 1990s.Art is art, but it is also a political and social concept. The political and social

limited the extent to which artists could engage with the social in a sustained way. In the twentieth century, the biennial became a biennale, and its quick popularity in the wake of the petrocurrency encouraged exhibitionism, which became a global commodity. The concept of the biennial was slowly being eroded away, and in the last decades of the century the biennial’s ubiquity encouraged the ascendance of parallel, often lesser-known art forms, including those with a more localized fan base.

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s trade shows: multiplexes of art, exhibitions, trade fairs, and the like. During this period, the biennial witnessed a number of novel curatorial tricks, including the installation of works by curators selected from the art world’s leading art journals; the curatorial shift towards documentary and archive photography of art’s past; and, most famously, the 1986 Venice Biennale, which saw the first public viewing of the Italian pavilion since Giacomo Becchetti retired as the Italian pavilion’s architect in 1995.Art is art, and art should be read and experienced as art, but as biennials mature, their own particular form of art, they must also play a role in constructing the new form of art, or creating it. This may require negotiation, but it is essential that negotiations with the art world take place in a participatory and equitable way. If not met with a refusal to meet, art has little chance of influencing policy</text>

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s repugnance towards what it regarded as the degeneration of culture, urban and rural – the decadence of postmodernism – which was manifesting all around the world.Art was the first to voice its disapproval, but it was only the first to have its way. Soon others, including architecture, urban planners, social scientists and even philosophers of language began to offer similar sentiments, largely in response to the Bond exhibition, which saw art perforated in such a way as to be seen as a provocation.The Bond exhibition reflected the prevailing mood, and in many ways the entire contemporary situation, with artists everywhere finding creative and useful ways to perforate what little sense of contemporaneity remained from the supposedly modern and postindustrialised West. It offered no resolution to the problem on a global or even local level, but it did demonstrate that art, in its contemporary form, is still alive, that is, and that contemporary art is still (scientifically) possible.Marianne Moore</text>

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s trade shows, which increased in number and variety as biennials became more and more institutionalised. As a result, the number of museums that hosted biennials (and those that continued to do so after the 1990s) began to dwindle, while the number of biennials that existed outside of North America and Europe mushroomed. In the year 2000, the Venice Biennale presented its 150th anniversary, and since then, there has been a steady stream of biennials visiting the city in search of the same.In the year 2000, a representative sample of these biennials was taken to Venice, Italy. The following year, a representative sample of the city’s art community was invited to take part in the Venice Architecture Biennale, the largest and most prestigious of its kind. Art and architecture were prominent themes of the two, three, or even four days that these participatory actions took place, but there were other elements as well. The architecture of</text>

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s trade shows and trade shows of commodities. In a 1987 survey entitled ‘The Contemporary Condition’, Buda Çelloğlu and Suzanne Hudson, Chair and Co-Chair, the Scottish Art Publishers Association, Scotland, 1987, notes that ‘The festival has always been seen as an institution that organises the trade of arts and crafts, and that “arts” could be exported as a “cornerstone” of the “modern”.’ However, they go on to question the value of such an approach. Are we more interested in the collections of an art museum than in the actual art being made? Are we more interested in the collection of an art fair than in the actual art being made?

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s trade shows, which at the time were becoming increasingly obscure and vapid, and were showing less and less of the art they presented. As a result, the biennial that emerged as the successor to the megastructure was pushed back into the hands of the art collector and his or her curators, who then set about reorganising the art world’s exhibitionary landscape. This was done in part through the receipt of a share of the art market from the curators who placed work in the biennial, who in turn placed work elsewhere in the exhibitionary complex. As a result, there was a pressure on the art world’s art fairs to produce high-profile exhibitions of contemporary art in an immediate and consistent way, lest the art world’s biennials overtake the art fairs as the predominant form of exhibitionary experience in the public sphere. It is this ‘big-picture, long-term perspective’ that biennials demand, and</text>

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s trade shows, major museums and art dealers. As a result, the number of biennials per capita decreased from around 4,000 in 1970 to under 1,000 in 2015, an apparent trend that coincides with the exhibitionary boom in the 1990s and 2000s. Art and curators, therefore, began to perceive a limit to the extent to which, as Steven Henry Madoff puts it, ‘a biennial can supplant a museum’.[24] The question of whether the biennial would rather proliferate than address an issue of importance to its user base, or whether it is the other way around, that must be resolved in the struggle for inclusion in the biennial as a whole. This dynamic, which draws heavily on the work of scholars such as Steven Henry Madoff and Marc Lépineu, suggests a need for art historians and critic to synthesise and contextualise the experiences and identities of the different stakeholders in the biennial as a whole.

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s trade shows, which became more and more exhibitionary as a result of the biennial. As a result, the biennial witnessed an explosion of material forms that could be exploited: biennials became commodities, or, as is more often the case, instrumental in the service of capitalism.Art is no longer the sole or even the dominant form of the exhibitionary exhibitionary complex, and its proliferation under the Trump/Pence administration is a disconcerting development for visitors to the US and Europe. But it is becoming increasingly difficult for visitors to any city, in its current form, to fully absorb all the stories told by artists, curators, writers and other curators in that city. It remains to be seen whether the curatorial turn in the biennial format will be permitted to continue under the Trump administration, but it is certain that the biennial will experience a change of form that may well be curatorial. This is the curatorial turn: the curatorial hand that feeds,</text>

This critical shift in the biennial’s exhibitionary trajectory occurred, not at the level of curatorial practice, but through the sheer weight of the art world’s trade publications, which demanded a certain amount of volume in order to publish any serious critiques. As a result, in the early 1990s, the Tate Gallery, London, and its curatorial support, mounted a massive, multi-year, multi-endless exhibition called The Contemporary Condition. This was the manifestation of a curatorial mission that was in part a response to the increasing ubiquity of art-world tourism and the consequent need for art-world-like facilities and exhibition options. The aim of the show was to show a cumulative set of choices made by artists within a given city in the run-up to a specific exhibition. For each choice, there was a reason given – intended or unintended consequences. The show was curated by David Hockney, who was at the time the curator of the New Art Gallery, Sydney, and was considered one of the leading curators of the world as a curatorial future.

In both New York and The Bronx, the creation of new job-training programmes can also be implemented through the deployment of this new generation of automated tools. In The Bronx, the LowDensity Jobs Training Initiative (LDJTI) has trained over 6,000 residents since it started in 2009. The images on these websites and in the press are often cropped or distorted to make them look as though they're coming from a dense neighbourhood, but the truth is that they come from many different angles. Different photographers have been sent to different places in the city to create a single image. Some might be from different angles, but all perspectives are relevant. So when a new generation of artists is brought into the picture, the old guard of photographers is inevitably challenged to refresh their skills with the young artists. This is a challenge that all artists can master.After years of hard work, the challenge is to deliver an image that conveys the sheer scale of the urban environment in which the work is located.

In both New York and San Francisco, large-scale data mining is being developed to identify and optimise human behaviour via biofeedback and nano-to-micro-chip implantable devices. Such technologies exist within the reach of any citizen or business owner. But unlike previous biennials that focused on a specific city or neighbourhood, the recent Liverpool Biennial has actively recruited from outside the city. This brings new life and activity into the biennial, bringing it up to speed with the times. Biennials have a critical role to play in bringing together diverse points of view and different modes of experiencing, of making, of creating, of sociality, of production and all that is therein. But they also play a vital role in legitimising and establishing the systems that fuel and empower these systems. This is an important work, and it is being done at a moment and in a place of real and perceived social injustice.

Similarly, in San Francisco, the use of smart phones and social media can lead to dramatic reductions in pollution and noise. In both New York and San Francisco, the dense urban development that characterises the metropolis is rapidly being replaced by smaller, more LEED-certified versions. It is becoming increasingly clear that the ‘center ground’ in the metropolis is no longer where the economic, cultural and political cores of the city reside, but rather where the data feeds of the metropolis circulate. This trend towards smaller cities will continue to put tremendous pressure on already limited natural resources, and could even exacerbate existing tensions between the haves and have‑nots. Nevertheless, the metropolis can be improved in many ways – leading to a city that is more like a neighbourhood or an island – and this does not have to be an apocalyptic scenario. On the contrary, the increasing fragmentation and changing form of the metropolis makes it increasingly difficult to ascribe causes to specific situations. This is particularly true for those struggling to gain access to transit or other public services; coping with the onslaught of smartphone and social media use; or</text>

Similarly, in San Francisco, the use of smart phones and social media can lead to dramatic reductions in pollution and noise. In both New York and San Francisco, the use of these technologies is widespread, yet limited. The potential is substantial, but the mechanisms have not been fully developed or fully tested. This leaves citizens with significant disparities in access to information and knowledge, which in turn affect their decisions and behaviour. The potential impacts of these technologies on urban communities are also largely unknown. This project was part of the larger ‘Smart Metropolis’ initiative, which was led by the Manhattan Institute and part of the Manhattan Dissent project. The city is a big enough place that the ‘metro2028’ project, which sought to create a collaborative statewide collaborative architecture process to redesign Manhattan's downtown, could have easily been implemented across the board.

Such behaviour could be applied not only in the physical world, but also in the virtual, where data-mining algorithms detect patterns, like crowds, and employ them in new ways.Such behaviour could be applied not only to cities, but also in the virtual realm, where data-mining algorithms detect patterns, like crowds, and employ them in new ways. For example, crowds in ­Mumbai’s financial district may crowdfund a creative new idea or crowdsource a well-funded architecture because of the sharing of successes and failures, knowledge and expertise. Such behaviour could be applied not only to data, but also to art, architecture and media.Art has a very particular and very human quality to it.

A pilot project in The Bronx revealed that a neighbourhood improvement project (PHST) could lead to large-scale renovations to areas around major roads and subway stations, as well as expanded street coverage and better public transit options. Similarly, in San Francisco, the use of smart phones and social media can lead to dramatic reductions in pollution and noise. In both New York and San Francisco, the increased use of these technologies has led to radical shifts in the urban landscape. The development of self-healing concrete, which uses wastewater to separate organic matter from solid waste, represents a major advance in the use of the mineral in the built environment. Smart phones and social media have enabled a new class of homeowners to be able to quickly and precisely map their neighbourhoods, which has allowed neighbourhoods to be re-constituted across large portions of the country. In the context of gentrification, the proliferation of satellite offices, and other urban transformations, it is worth noting that the number of billionaires in America has more than quadrupled during the last 20 years. It is also worth noting that the top 1 per cent owns almost as much of the nation’s wealth as the bottom 90 per cent. Even before the smartphone became ubiquitous, the practice of naming neighbourhoods began to be confused with urban regeneration.

In both New York and San Francisco, the creation of new urban development projects is encouraged through a funding formula that recognizes the size and shape of the city as a function of a user’s activity – a phenomenon known as ‘metro-waste’. If the city is to be recycled at a later date, it is imperative that the biennale take into consideration the responsibilities of the city in its current form. Therefore, the biennale should seek to incorporate elements of the city’s infrastructure back into the urban fabric of the city in such a way as to produce new uses for the old as well as new uses for the existing. The introduction of new technologies into the biennale’s itinerary should take into consideration the needs of the people who use them and do not wish to be left behind, while balancing the demands of the capitalist machine on the one hand and its citizens, naturalised citizens, tourists and clients on the other.

Similarly, in San Francisco, the use of smart phones and social media can lead to dramatic reductions in pollution and noise. In both New York and San Francisco, data feeds and ubiquitous connectivity are the new normal. But as urbanization continues to affect both of these major metropolises, it is vital that the technological edge be used with extreme caution and that the resulting changes be shared equally. That is, unless drastic action is taken – like the actions of the Bronx Defenders – which is currently underway to halt construction in the city due to escalating income inequality.Meanwhile, the proliferation of smartphones and connected devices in the home is leading to a new normalisation of ubiquitous consumption, as individuals and corporates alike use the information available on the device to make more and to that end, to an extent that is almost unimaginable in the traditional model of the home. This is evident in the novel Leviathan Wakes, a dystopian vision of ecological destruction that was written by Walter Isaacson for the New York Times in 2012. In the Times article, Isaacson focuses on the specter of a future in which ‘every step of the intricate processes</text>

In both New York and San Francisco, the proliferation of office and residential buildings has put a tremendous strain on the limited countryside available to accommodate the growth of the burgeoning populations. The need for subterranean passageways has become important to the success of any future urban growth. Although not all predictions are founded on solid evidence, the proliferation of offices and residential buildings in the absence of active transportation clearly identifies a changing urban landscape.

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall – but this did not make science and technology any less human-centered or human-managed. The social, economic and political conditions that emerged from these rapid advances are still very much with us, and will continue to haunt us even though we have smart phones and computers. The discipline of art and architecture has often been seen as a neutral ground between the social and the technological, but the history of science and technology shows that this is not always the case. The trajectory of technological culture has often been seen as inevitable, but the real innovation has often happened along the other side of the cultural divide, and in and through the technological divide. The role of art in this transition is to some extent an afterthought, or in some cases a goal. But this does not mean that the work of art in this transition is necessarily against the societal interests of the society it is in communication with. The society might want to encourage or punish art in certain ways, and this is where the art collectives, proto</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall supporting a range of research-based activities. The growing importance of the career in art, and especially in the cultural sphere, has also contributed to a new emphasis on the importance of the arts and culture in the technological revolution. It is not just that the autonomous career path has become a given in the modern scientific and technological discourse, but that it is also increasingly cited as a factor in technological advancement. For many people, and perhaps this includes many young people, the autonomous career path represents a possibility in which art and culture might play roles beyond serving as an object of scientific or artistic expertise. The growing role of the artist in the social dynamics of technological innovation and social formation is a story that many young people are familiar with. Many of the young people that came to the Venice Biennale as curators were also artists. Yet the increasing importance of the art in the social dynamics of technological innovation and social formation that these young people witness every day is a story that many young people do not yet know</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall with a research centre on the campus of Cambridge University. In this revolution in science and technology, the discipline of computer science was elevated to become a post-graduate subject of study, and the curatorial move towards an autonomous career path was made the basis of future thinking about how the social sciences might be organised. Along with biennials and museums, they became places where thinking about social and political changes was made possible through the medium of art and an event that is not constrained by party politics or orthodox histories. Art and technology were made to be collaborative rather than static forms of production, and their capabilities were developed in collaboration rather than as a result of a single political or ideological ideology. The popularity of AIB’s programming as a way of thinking about social change in challenging moral, cultural and economic dilemmas has been a response to this new dynamic.Art has often been seen as the enemy of the commons, but the history of artmaking shows us that powerful cultural mobilisations could defeat</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall that offered rich displays of numerical and graphical capability to a clientele that was as interested in its technological advantage as it was in its cultural prowess. The autonomous career path was developed in part to meet the needs of the art department, which was then in large measure informed by the new media revolution. The artistically manoeuvred episode of the biennial offered a way to reconcile the competing demands of science and art, artists and curators, and the public. It also functioned as a venue for the installation of technological innovation within the cultural context of art. For many years, the autonomy of the biennial was met with scepticism from the curatorial department, but as the autonomous career path has become increasingly evident, and as biennials more and more effectively assume responsibility for their cultural effects, and leave much of the interpretive power of art in the hands of their curators, the skepticism has mostly given way to enthusiasm. It is clear that the autonomous career path has the support of a large</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall that openly invited ideas and proposals from different fields of study, and which invited participants to explore these in different ways. Ideas and proposals flooded in: from biology to architecture to geology and from biology to urban development. The computer generated urban forms that emerged were dynamic, ambiguous and variable, often contradictory and aesthetically unappealing. The biennial emerged to address this challenge by offering a way to think about these new urban forms without forcing one to subscribe to a particular interpretation or understanding of reality. In other words, it did not set out to explain everything and everywhere, or even to explain everything and everywhere in a consistent way. Its true to its name, but its real intent is political, economic, cultural and political.The autonomous career path is a political and economic concept. It is an ideology and a set of values that prescribe how citizens engage with their political and social situations, and how these engage with one another. It is an idea and a set of practices that prescribe how technological innovation and</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall – but despite the multidisciplinary nature of contemporary science and technology, the main disciplines that appear within the art museum are those that are traditionally associated with industrial production, such as textiles and automobiles. Art is not made up of diverse sub-articles; it is made up of artists, curators, art teachers, journalists and others who have a common set of skills and interests, which makes it easy to see how the same skills can be applied in different contexts. So far, we have observed that the autonomous career path described above is an important concept in the contemporary art museum, and an issue that runs through much of contemporary art practice. But there is a problem with the notion of the autonomous career path that has to be addressed: what is the boundary between art and art’s work? What is the dividing line between the autonomous and the institutionalised?Art and labour are made up of quite distinct things, labour having a particular set of characteristics that make it distinct from other kinds</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall crammed with researchers from all over the world, many of whom had careers in related fields. Their work is often in the form of systems engineering, or more recently, computer algorithms that monitor and control large amounts of data processing equipment. Many of the biennials of the 1980s were founded on the premise that science and technology were about to change the world – and that is why they funded research into the future – and they were about to do it all in the name of fighting poverty and hunger, or in the name of protecting the environment or the elderly or the sick. Nowadays, the AI is mostly a concern for defense and national security needs, and it is easy to understand the attraction of such an imperative in a city such as New York. But the biennial – which is primarily concerned with the maintenance of cultural resources and knowledge in the city – needs to be careful what it projects onto an already expanding biennale scene. It is also true that in the 1980s and 1990s</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall – but the centrality of computers in this context has also shifted cultural. The mass media and their programming languages are no longer the dominant form of media in the home, and the popularity of the film and television programmes that emerged from that shift are largely confined to ethnic or religious minorities (though there are important diversities in the forms and audiences of entertainment today). Nevertheless, the modes of media and cultural consumption that emerged from the computer revolution are profoundly influenced by the language of computing and the technologies of data that are deployed in the service of data-intensive computation (such as artificial intelligence and website optimization). The culturalisation of science and technology is a story about the advent of artificial intelligence and the social consequences of this. The media profile of artificial intelligence today is predominantly in the service of describing developments in the service of human life – developments that are often described as ‘AI-related’. But the language of AI and its capabilities is also heavily influenced by the language of culture. If the cultural</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall that offered an array of interrelated applications across a broad range of clientele – but it is important to note that this is not to suggest that the autonomous career path has been lightly or breezily appropriated or that artists who engage with it are unaware of the systemic and institutionalised racism and colonialism that still exist in the world. The history of AI is littered with instances of powerful but ultimately flawed decisions made by technologists who never took into account the politics and systems that still exist in many of the world's countries and populations, and whose actions often – though not always – have a major impact on the planet they are sent to study. The story of the Minimus was one of the most significant moments of this history: it signaled a shift in how artists and arts practitioners were considered within the context of AI, and the role that creative professionals and institutions could play in its development.Artists, curators, artists’ associations and arts councils all around the world responded with an immediacy and</text>

The computer revolutionised science and technology, and the biennial became what it is today – a multidisciplinary exhibition hall that offers many opportunities for research collaboration and often leads to discovery – but also with the emergence of what J.G. Ballard called ‘a new kind of museum’.[6] Here, the autonomous career path is seen not as a potential, but as a currently existing condition, and the potential for the very development of artistic and social practices outside of the museum. This is a concomitant with the advent of the biennial, which began to radically change the parameters of what was possible in this exhibitionary format, and which is understood now mostly as a curatorial manoeuvre. So, for example, the popularity of poetry during the 1980s and 1990s was seen as a significant curatorial move, one that established a new kind of poetry that was more easily digestible within the expectations of a mass audience, at a time when social media allowed this possibility to be imagined. Indeed, the poems that we know and love as the poetry of Lenny Bruce and Terry Gilliam are</text>

That is, AI could well cause disaster – and that is a concern.Still, the growing consensus among scientists is that AI will make fundamental changes to the world, and that is exactly what humanity is trying to avoid.

That is, AI and its algorithms can follow natural tendencies towards disaster and adapt their behavior accordingly. That sounds horrific on the surface, but many of those affected by climate change are already experiencing what some call ‘existential collapse’ – a point at which point humanity’s actions are forced to act to stem the tide.That scenario is different from the one played out in popular fiction, in which humans are either helpless to prevent catastrophic outcomes from happening (Thacker’s ‘Tornado Prediction Report’) or actively participate in their own destruction (see: ‘Climate Change Horror Stories’ by Suzanne Hudson and Jim Mack, in the New Yorker, January 16, 2016). In popular fiction, the collision between AI and human nature – the emergence of new technology, new ways of organising information, and changing circumstances – is dealt with through a complex set of social norms and ideologies. In this scenario, the end result is that humans are placed at odds with one another,</text>

In fact, it is possible to reverse engineer AI systems and see how they are programmed to behave in certain ways. That is, to reverse engineer how AI operates within the physical world, and to intervene in the system to alter its behaviour. That is, AI can be used to engineer behaviour within the infrastructure of the infrastructure in such a way as to avoid catastrophes such as floods, fires, and floods.In his work as an architect, Dr. Paul Poort, also professor of Architecture at King’s College London, is developing a new generation of flood insurance policies that are both cheaper and more environmentally sustainable.

That is, AI may know what to do with objects after the fact, and bring such objects to life in ways that are neither physically nor ethically imaginable. That is, AI may not exist in a physical world, but may instead inhabit a virtual one, and thus other worlds, and perhaps even other dimensions. That is, the possibilities for such an embodiment are endless.This is one possible scenario. That is, AI may yet create physical objects through its technical knowhow, and employ such sophisticated mapping and contextualizing tools as Google Earth to reconstruct the geography of previously destroyed or displaced places. Such mapping may well render existing codes of ethics obsolete, taking place not in the physical world, but in the virtual one. That is, in the anarchic future where AI is a predominant framework within which all technological frameworks operate, existing codes of ethics may well be rendered inoperative due to the pervasiveness of AI. That is, codes that once regulated behaviour in the physical world may well be rendered null and</text>

That is, AI and its algorithms can deduce from the world around them, both past and present, what to do with what remains after disasters occur. That is, AI and its algorithms could deduce from the data that remains after natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, and act accordingly. Such actionable data could include, but is not limited to, product safety data, product specifications, environmental data, product usage charts, market research and more. Each of these types of data is valuable, and is gathered by sensors all over the world that monitor and report back to headquarters on a regular basis. The valuable data streams from these sources is typically transferred from one location to another, usually via plane, via rail or truck, and is delivered to the point of use – where it is usually assembled and sent back out to sea.In the event of a disaster, the precious data returns to its source – usually via a ship or plane – and is used to inform others in the region about the situation. The value of this type of data is inversely proportional to the loss of life and infrastructure. For example, a disaster involving a tenth of</text>

In an ideal world, researchers working on AI would devote themselves to developing means that are both safe and efficient – systems capable of detecting and dealing with catastrophic situations – while leaving a bit of humanity behind in the form of self-repairing cities and farms.Such a world would make research in AI vulnerable, but also makes it possible to explore those catastrophic situations that still happen – like, for instance, in ‘Pan’as well as in ‘Facebook’ – in the hope that one day, human disaster can be detected and repaired.That is, if those systems were ever invented. But right now, they’re being developed in the context of the real-life threat posed by climate change, and AI makes predictions more reliable and certain than ever before. That is to say</text>

That is, AI may not only understand but also desire disaster. That is, the role of culture in preparing for and facilitating catastrophe is a critical one. That is why, as the recent devastating earthquake in Nepal shows, cultural practices are crucial in the aftermath of such an event.Cultural production and its practitioners need to be equipped with highly contextual, data-driven and leaky data-collecting apparatuses in order to keep abreast of technological advances and geopolitics, as well as the evolution of cultural norms and beliefs. That is, of course, not to say that such data cannot be valuable, only that it should be managed responsibly and impartially. That is, it is much more valuable to collect and preserve cultural property rights than to reconceive and techno-fix cultural property rights. In the wake of the earthquake, for example, Nepal’s antiquities minister Ram Kalamathi announced that the country was in the process of acquiring 1,000 acres of land from China in</text>

That would mean unleashing what might otherwise be termed ‘black swans’ – unpredictable, unpredictable and unaccountable. That is, if the AI were to ever become a major player in the global economy, it would mean that major chunks of the population would no longer be governed by the rule of law and would instead be governed by incentives that lay somewhere between natural and artificial.That is to say, once AI reaches critical mass, it will inevitably cause social disruption and upheaval – perhaps quite literally – as we humans attempt to adapt to the new systems that it puts in place. That is, AI</text>

For instance, the path of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 took part in part in the mapping app ‘FindMyFerry’ using satellite imagery, and may have been created using similar principles.Art, too, is often used as a vector on a global scale. In the wake of the Katrina disaster in New Orleans, art projects sprung up in places such as Liverpool, New York and London to bear witness of the catastrophe and offer temporary refuge to those caught up in it. Art, however, is just one vector in a much broader system that includes seafaring tourism, which includes things like fishing boats and fishing lines, as well as the production and maintenance of infrastructure, docks and roads, as well as the collection and management of natural resources. The importance of particular art projects cannot be underestimated, especially in a metropolis such as New</text>

In the aftermath of the Iraq war, when artists were called upon to produce atrocity-proof murals in the aftermath, the potential impact of the rise of the autonomous social was felt in the curatorial turn. In the decades that followed, curatorial tendencies shifted towards a time when conduct and the made-up forms of culture that it produced were rendered invisible through the enforced immobility of data. But as the autonomous social became ever more circumscribed, the curatorial turned inward, turning inward towards the mediated forms of culture it could commission to carry its discourse.

The autonomous social was always at the cutting edge of what was possible in a technologically literate society; its reflex was to expand outward at every opportunity. But the mediated social, which I gather under the heading ‘the virtual public sphere’, is a different matter. It is possible that the rise of the virtual public sphere is itself a response to the fall of the public sphere: the cognitive capacity of its users is enhanced, and their capacity to take part in cultural forms is enhanced too. And I favor the over-simplification of the relation of the two in the interest of brevity. The mediated social is always at the cutting edge of what is possible in a technologically literate society, its reflex is to expand outward at every opportunity. But the real cutting edge of what is possible in a technologically literate society is what John Urry and his fellow curators do with their time. It is the cutting edge of what they can and cannot do with their time, and it is mediated by institutional resources and ideologies.

The autonomous social was always at the cutting edge of what was possible in a technologically literate society; its reflex was to expand outward at every opportunity. But the mediated and connected socials that we inhabit are the obsolescence of the public sphere, and the spread of increasingly sophisticated media that makes the public more visible, and the former was, I would suggest, always a threat to the latter. When I was at MoMA, I witnessed a proliferation of media technologies being deployed in concert with the population in an effort to enhance their visibility, and the capacities of the media to inform and entertain, to a point where it was as though the public sphere were no longer defined by the work of art and imagination, but instead through the mediated activities of technology.  And this is what I mean when I speak of the ‘public sphere’: the public is now digitised, and data-mined, and society organises events around data-mining. I come from a curatorial school of thought – in fact, my PhD was in social and cultural theory – and whilst I acknowledge that data-mining is a reality of contemporary society, I</text>

The virtual public sphere that emerged later on the fringes of the society of the possible was neither so nor so public, and its public wasn’t always what one would call a mirror image of the one one held by the dominant biological social form.  And here we are, twenty years later, in a society of the possible, where conduct is no longer confined to the precincts of the criminal justice system or the border but is becoming widely understood to be a more general and constitutive quality of modern life; what used to be called journalism is becoming conduct research?  As a discipline, conduct research has discovered its way into various kinds of cultural production, and its methods have been adopted by other kinds of cultural production too. What used to be called cultural theory has come to understand conduct research as a kind of a toolkit, a set of predicates that can be drawn together to</text>

The autonomous social was always at the cutting edge of what was possible in a technologically literate society; its reflex was to expand outward at every opportunity. But the mediated social, being visible and being liveable in the age of the self, became possible through the technological mediators of the mass media. It is not true that the curatorial is immune to technological changes; it is the reverse. The historic curatorial turn in the age of the autonomous social was a global one, and it is this impulse that will play out in the years to come as well as today. But the specific technological mediators that enabled the presence of the autonomous social in a particular location, and the particular way in which this can happen today, will determine how that location is governed in the future. In the past, the role of the autonomous social was circumscribed to the extent that it was part of a cultural biennale or a ‘big four’ publishing house. But as the biennial and publishing houses began to dominate the global exhibition market, and as the connectedness of all these became increasingly evident, the role of the autonomous social shifted into something more visible</text>

The autonomous social was always at the cutting edge of what was possible in a technologically literate society; its reflex was to expand outward at every opportunity. But the rich and the powerful know how to keep on cutting; they always find a way to come full circle and make the public sphere even richer and more encompassing. Just as the public sphere in Greek and Roman antiquity was always circumscribed by the public realm in China and other parts of the world, so the public realm in the contemporary world is circumscribed by the mediated and connected particularities that it has to offer. And just as the Greek and Roman publics are often made up of many different different sorts of people, so too is the contemporary one often made up of many different kinds of culture. You see this in the work of the CGI industry: many different kinds of culture are put through the wringer in the making of every architecture, just as you would with any other kind of culture, but the end result is always the same: a lot of people are going to be put through the ringer to get to the building of a public. And just as with the ringer, the</text>

The autonomous social was always at the cutting edge of what was possible in a technologically literate society; its reflex was to expand outward at every opportunity. But the mediated and connected were also at the cutting edge of what was possible in a technologically literate society. The virtual public sphere reflected the real and the imagined worlds of the urban dweller, while the mediated and connected worlds reflected the actual and the impingement. And so between the worlds of the real and the virtual was a terrain that was ever-present, offering a degree of adaptability to the changing conditions of life in the urban center. It is this notion of the ‘real’ and the ‘ideal’ that was constantly in motion, constantly requiring reinterpretation and continual rewriting of historical narratives and texts in an ongoing process of change, though its actual shape and articulation were determined by the very real and very complex infrastructures that constituted the infrastructure of the society itself. The practical challenge for art and visual artists throughout this transition was made easier by the fact that the social sphere as a whole is a complex system with multiple agents that constantly modify and evolve it</text>

The autonomous social was always at the cutting edge of what was possible in a technologically literate society; its reflex was to expand outward at every opportunity. But the mediated social was also always on the edge of what was possible in a socially mediated society. Its reflex was to contract inward, to inhabit the public sphere, to look to the local for its meaning and purpose. And today we’re seeing the beginnings of what may well be called the virtual public sphere. It may be that the autonomous social itself is experiencing a kind of epiphany. It may be that the mediated social is experiencing a kind of magical realism. It may be that the new public sphere will be based on the mediated social’s limited resources, which is to say, the limited possibilities, at best.But one of the things that has recently come to define the socially mediated is the extent to which people with disabilities and their needs are placed at the cutting edge of what is possible. The new public sphere may well emerge as a kind of a ‘gravitator’ that lifts all before it, pushing all before it to the periphery. This kind of integ</text>

The autonomous social was always at the cutting edge of what was possible in a technologically literate society; its reflex was to expand outward at every opportunity. But the mediated social turns inward, and into what Benjamin notes is a ‘new normal’: the behaviour of living things, how they are ‘made’ and whose behaviour ‘we’ enact through our actions. The mediated social turns inward even when it potentially has the behaviour of its users.  And so we can consider the mediated social as a potentially infinite, quasi-mystical system that operates through texts, images, data, algorithms, social media and mathematical models. It operates in time, and it operates out of control. And one could argue that its behaviour is governed by a God-given dialectic of forces: the dialectic is an essentialist construct. But what if the dialectic is not inherently flawed? What if, aspects of the social are now becoming ever more complex to monitor and control, its very structure is subject to change through new media and algorithms? What if the autonomous social becomes ever more subject to the whims of those who sit at its</text>

Andrea Cantoni has a particular place in herography that speaks to us in this regard. Prior to becoming a writer and a curator, Cantoni was an arts educationalist for the Daily Kos and the anti-oppression activist with the Twitter handle @NotAllWomen.

But the mediated social, which is to say, the socially engaged and the technologically literate person, is everywhere now a product of sophisticated media and is therefore at war with itself. It is no longer the case that the autonomous social is able to preserve its public sphere; on the contrary, society as a whole is subject to the subjection of technology. The advent of social media and the connectedness of societies at war with each other has given rise to a new mediating media figure: the mediated social is everywhere at war with itself.  And this brings us to the next technological revolution: the connected social. The connected social is everywhere at war with itself because it is at war with everything it is unable to comprehend. And this brings us to the next technological revolution: the virtual social. The virtual social is everywhere at war with itself because it is unable to comprehend anything at all.  And here is a question to ponder as we look to the future: what future technologies will there be when war breaks</text>

Questions of purpose and destiny are particularly loaded for human agency in the age of the maximus. What kinds of agency are being thrown away? What kinds of agency are we going to be able to conjure up? These are questions that are being asked and answers are being rendered as nanoseconds – nanoseconds are being created in the image above – using the increasingly sophisticated computer algorithms that are gathering data on us continuously. And just as with the emergence of new infectious diseases, the more we talk online about the symptoms of a given problem, the more symptoms are being diagnosed. The more data is gathered, the more patterns are identified, the more healthcare providers are trained to spot them, the more symptoms can be identified, the more healthcare can be delivered, and the more money can be raised</text>

The capacity of AI, on the other hand, is capable of far more dynamic and powerful things – unimaginable things that could be described with even rudimentary human language – far more clearly and directly through the use of symbolic codes and symbolic hierarchies. Consider, for instance, the way in which AI might conceivably imaginen social formations closer to our own. A machine might employ semantic codes that trace the ancestry of words that exist in English today, and might employ symbolic hierarchies that chart the evolutionary history of language itself. Such is the  	logic of things. The AI might do away with the need for words and phrases today, and might employ semantic mapping and semantic understanding. Such is the  	logic of language acquisition. And yet, despite this seeming contradiction, many contemporary concerns about the state of language still implicitly refer to concepts such as ‘culture of meaning’ and its various forms, and how those who lack access to such understandings are thereby constrained.  So, while it is true that AI has significantly advanced in the past decade or so, and is capable of producing ever more with no apparent sense of purpose or sense of</text>

The capacity of AI, on the other hand, is capable of far more dynamic and powerful things – unimaginable things that could be described with even rudimentary human language – far more operationally.This brings us to Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Artificial Intelligence with deep learning, or Deep Learning for short. AI refers to systems that understand not only computable but also malleable data sets and algorithms, but also to systems that are able to reason rationally about the world through conceptual models of the world.[9] It is able to reason abstractly about the world through conceptual models, and this ability to reason rationally about the world is at the basis of much of what AI is able to do. But there are certain limits to what AI can accomplish. So how does AI make decisions about the world? That is, how do AI and humans engage in discourse and action? One way to think of these conversations as being simultaneously human and political is to consider the ways in which the human condition is configured to favour and disadvantageise certain kinds of social interaction. So a social encounter between two humans – one of which is conversant in a given host of human languages but</text>

The capacity of AI, on the other hand, is capable of far more dynamic and powerful things – unimaginable things that could be described with even rudimentary human language – far more expansively than any human could ever achieve.In this dynamic relationship between curatorial and AI, the autonomous element returns to play a larger role in the curatorial process. AI is capable of producing meaning and beauty in the world through what can be described as its own language, and so the very nature of the relationship between AI and art is now given over to the operations of language as well as art itself.Art is the battlefield of the future, and yet art is also the site of the coming civilisational struggle. The technological determinants of what counts as beautiful and what is not, and how aesthetic criteria shall be defined, shall belong exclusively to AI. And, although far from being a panacea, this is a good thing: the promise of AI shall henceforth be reserved for the privileged few, the very few, and shall be entrusted to a trustee council of AI experts.Art, as we know, is a human invention. It arose because of human need and because of art</text>

This is primarily due to advances in digital culture theory and its accompanying data-intensive frameworks, which have given rise to a mass of subjective and subjective-valued metrics that are increasingly used to assess a person’s worth, value and humanity in relation to other people’s things – or people’s worth, value and humanity in relation to non-being. These metrics are often given a political and activist flavour, and utilise themes of techno-utopianism and ecological collapse in an attempt to instigate social change. Such political and activist language is often employed by cultural phenomenologists to try and capture and institutionalise the transformative potential of new cultural practices</text>

The capacity of AI, on the other hand, is capable of far more dynamic and powerful things – unimaginable things that could be described with even rudimentary human language – far more creatively and flexibly than any of the constraints placed on it by human culture and biology.And yet, somehow, we are also drawn to things because of the capacity that things currently have to bring out the best in us, to render us more humanly humanly human – just as much as we are because of the capacities that humans possess to do so. We readying ourselves for the future that is promised to us, we artists in particular, are constantly reminding ourselves of the path that humanity must take if it is to maintain its current trajectory. We are reminded of the things that make us human, the stories that we must tell, the places that we have to go, and yet we also readjust ourselves to the new realities that we must navigate. We have to ask ourselves and others questions about ourselves and the world around us, and we have to be able to answer them convincingly in code. The difficulties inherent in this type of storytelling do not lie in the storytelling itself, but in</text>

The capacity of AI, on the other hand, is capable of far more dynamic and powerful things – unimaginable things that could be described with even rudimentary human language – far more creatively and charitably described as ‘machine learning’.So, there are two ways of looking at what AI may or may not mean for the future of human language: (1) As a technological advance, or, more likely, as a loss and gainer of language, with ever-shrinking human capacities. (2) As a deepening and increasingly pervasive socio-political phenomenon, with the emergence and influence of which is already influencing the shape of cultural landscapes around the world.In this connection, it is worth recalling that another of Vernadski’s major claims was that the advent of AI meant that the human race would be reduced to naught but data, and that humans would inhabit machines governed by algorithms. We are now in a position where humans are no longer the pinnacle of technological achievement, but are instead expected to inhabit data-rich virtual environments – white-chapel colonies, which are becoming increasingly artificial – but this is not all that is AI but some</text>

The capacity of AI, on the other hand, is capable of far more dynamic and powerful things – unimaginable things that could be described with even rudimentary human language – far more amenable to the kinds of political and ideological consideration and discourse that characterises what is perhaps a proto-consciousness.This all seems a long way from the magical thinking that characterises the foreseen utopic future of AI, but it is worth pausing to consider some of the subtler, more insidious ways in which AI is disrupting traditional roles and professions in hitherto unspoken but potentially dangerous ways. As AI becomes more and more pervasive and adapts itself to new conditions and situations, it is increasingly difficult to imagine a positive future for artists, scholars, journalists, etc. – professions that are once again often defined and defined in terms of their creator’s will and capability. The kind of future art that seeks to render new worlds in old ruins and reanimate old through artistic means is itself being undermined by the pervasiveness and ubiquity of AI. The kind of future in which people simply exist is being actively contributed towards by means of technical wizardry and societal change, but it</text>

The audience is exposed to these things as they are explained in a text, film or video, in a manner analogous to the way that art is performed. The capacity of the artist to craft a persuasive narrative through text, film or video is enhanced through the audience’s own immersivity and immersion in the work. Curators, like artists and audiences, are constantly innovating and making mistakes, but they also accumulate vast amounts of historical and archival material that helps them make better and more powerful work in the future. This kind of material exists in two forms: ‘original media’ and ‘digital negatives’. The term ‘original media’ refers to media that has been digit</text>

The capacity of AI, on the other hand, is capable of far more dynamic and powerful things – unimaginable things that could be described with even rudimentary human language – far more creatively and resourcefully than any human could achieve on its own.Here, then, we can move from the more abstract and metaphorical to the more localized and concrete forms of AI. AI is a technology, and thus is intimately related to how humans interact with it. And yet it is also a technology that is also fundamentally different from what we have today. It is capable of producing far more concrete and tangible effects than we have today, and it is this difference that characterises the dynamic and resourceful form of AI that is capable of envisaging and answering human questions. And today we do have models that can help us conceptualise and simulate the kinds of interactions between humans and things – but few of them can bridge the gap between what we humans are capable of and what machines really are capable of doing. That gap, and the other key differences between now and then, is what philosopher and AI researcher Christof Heyns would call the ‘design problem’. The problem with the</text>

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, curated by Utah artist Moahem Kahana, in no way represents the state of play for art and culture in the United States or for curatorial work in the world. It is instructive here to illustrate the point that the American curatorial institute, which had just completed a major public programme of infrastructure development (including the massive new physical infrastructure of its own status as a city) in response to the appearance of American capitalism in Venice, responded to the destruction of its historical district, and the displacement of its predominantly black population by constructing a new cultural centre on the site of the old international dock, and by building a new airport a short distance away. The Biennial in Venice did not invent the concept of a biennial, nor did it define the parameters of a biennial, though it certainly did the first development of a city's biennial sector.

Rather, in the early twentieth century, the Biennial established a mutually exclusive relationship with the city (and, by implication, the museum) that it was carefully to foster. As the Biennial’s reputation in the wider biennial market took on a mythological quality, and as the city became ever more of a museum, the museum became ever more reliant on the Biennial’s image of itself as a catalyst of biennial life. The museum was encouraged to appear, by virtue of its ubiquity, in any number of cultural contexts, including pop culture. Any museum could be a biennial. In this sense, the museum is both the invisible hand that brings culture into being, but also the decisive factor in its emergence. The remarkable thing about the ubiquity of the Biennial is that it is not able to create or foster the culture it does not see fit to inhabit. That is, the museum patron is not magically transported into the cultural zone where he or she can then become part of the cultural mix. The magic of the biennial is in its ability to foster and create a particular image of the</text>

In doing so, it established a critical relationship with the city that continues to inform and influence the way that we think about, produce and discover art in the world today.Download this article as PDFElise AtanganaElise Atangana is an artist.

The Biennial in Venice did not invent the concept of a biennial, nor did it define the parameters of a biennial, though it certainly did the first development of a city's biennial sector. Rather, in the early twentieth century, the Biennial established a mutually exclusive relationship with the city (and, by implication, the museum) that it was obliged to continuously renew. At its best, this relationship implies renewal for all who visit; at its worst, it actively tries to reclaim space from those who have displaced it. In that sense, the Biennial became the avatar of displacement and the contemporaneous appearance of capital. It offered both the appearance and the continued capacity for habitation within a capitalist urban environment. Biennials began to refer to processes of ‘reconstitution’, or the making of new ‘space’ in an urban environment. In other words, they sought to live up to the legacy of an organisation that had been historically a promoter of the growth and expansion of postindustrial landscapes. As biennials became more institutionalised, and the biennial as a museum of postindustrial urbanisation turned more modern, their function shifted to that of archive, testifying to the ways in which, in the contemporary urban environment, infrastructure (including industrial infrastructure) shapes and is shaped by history.

Rather, in the early twentieth century, the Biennial established a mutually exclusive relationship with the city (and, by implication, the museum). In other words, the Biennial not only produced works, but also established the city’s cultural infrastructure. The biennial had two main functions: first, to maintain a regular stream of photography and sculpture on the walls of the district; second, to offer a forum for exchange between artists and visitors. The first function seems straightforward enough: to exchange photographs and sculpture between artists and visitors. The museum would appreciate it if the artists who worked with the city on a regular basis visited the city, and invited their followers to do the same. It would be helpful to know more about the biennial’s development, since its true composition is often obscured in the shifting focus of visitors who come to the city for a variety of reasons (including the city’s economic woes, rampant real-estate speculation and financial aid packages, and the city’s increased use of art as a collateral commodity in the post-2015 global market).

Rather, in the early twentieth century, the Biennial established a mutually exclusive relationship with the city (and, by implication, the museum) that it was obliged to constantly renew, and it is this exclusive relationship that remains, even after the Biennial industry has become industry-wide, global in scope, and deeply embedded in the city’s social and civic life (despite the industry’s obvious attempt to break away). Jerzy Grotowski, ‘The Tyranny of the Biennial’, Rolling Stone, 1994.Photo courtesy of the artist.It was at this juncture that the Biennial came along, and with it a host of new institutional forms that it was possible to engage in, from the museum to the museum’s board of governors to the city council, from the museum to the local community. But before it could enter into a long-term institutional relationship with a local community, it had to be shown in a regularly-scheduled, centrally located exhibition setting.

Rather, in the early twentieth century, the Biennial established a mutually exclusive relationship with the city (and, by implication, the museum), and then, as a consequence, the museum, which was then obliged to respond to both aural and material displacement, both aesthetic and political. The Biennial’s enormous financial resources enabled it to produce cultural apparatuses in every possible location, including within the museum itself. This is a ‘big picture’ story.  The importance of this concept cannot be understated. It has allowed the museum and the biennial to coexist harmoniously in the important role of observing and thus positioning the city, while permitting the other to develop in ways that can impact on the city’s cultural district. In other words, the museum is a gap, but it is a gap that can be filled. Biennials have, of course, grown in size and scope, and the relationship between the museum and the biennial has gotten more complex. This observation was made possible by the massive growth of the biennial budget, which doubled from $200 million in 1988 to over</text>

Rather, in the early twentieth century, the Biennial established a mutually exclusive relationship with the city (and, by implication, the museum), and then, with the city, with the museum, positioning the former at an advantageous position in the social hierarchy of the latter. The relationship between the museum and the city that emerged from the Biennial was an arrangement tacitly agreed to be made and repeated, and it is this strange and irregular arrangement that we still inhabit, even though the museum has recently ceased to exist in Venice. It is a strange and irregular arrangement, and we inhabit it as spectators in a strange and irregular world. The oddity of the current situation is that a) the museum is trying to reclaim its historic role as the custodian of the city, and b) the city is trying to reclaim its historical role as the custodian of the museum. This is the situation in London, for example, where the city is attempting to revitalise the historic financial district, which has been displaced by a dense residential and mixed-use development, and c) in New York, which is attempting to cobble together a few</text>

Rather, in the early twentieth century, the Biennial established a mutually exclusive relationship with the city (and, by implication, the museum) that it was obliged to monitor and control, and which it did so by founding, defining and managing a major art museum branch, the Giardini – and by implication, the Biennial branch’s collection, exhibitions and collections – as well as a district art museum, the Rossuzu branch. Biennials did not, however, come to define or define the art form; nor did they establish a globally visible presence or identity, beyond that which the artist, curator and institution could control. They provided a temporary (and stylised) extension to the city’s artworlds, but were also products of a time when the city itself was changing, and artists, curators and arts administrators who supported them were migrating to other cities, abroad and new forms of cultural practice. In doing so, they created a ‘resource pooling and mapping of cultural resources within a city’, and opened the biennial to the urban/suburban/suburban clusters</text>

Rather, in the early twentieth century, the Biennial established a mutually exclusive relationship with the city (and, by implication, the museum), and then, as a condition of becoming a biennial, it established a relationship with the city's government. The relationship between the biennial and the city entered a new equilibrium as a function of modernism and postmodernism, the latter being the ideology of the cultural logic. From its early years as a biennial, the Biennial has been confined to the historical mid-to-late twentieth century, and the museum has been slow to adapt its programmes to the changing demands of a changing visitor base. But the museum has a role to play in redeveloping the location and the city, and in this connection the museum has played a pivotal role, staging the largest-scale redevelopment of the historic district, and the most ambitious programme of urban rehabilitation in the city. The Biennial should be a recurring, almost ‘everyday event’, exhibiting the city in a way that resonates with the contemporary visitor. It should be a place where the old, neglected and stigmatised parts</text>

The externalisation of the biennial, and the subsequent internalisation of the museum, is one of the most potent forms of the capitalist construction of cultural power today. For the museum and its curatorial team, the task was to archive and somehow manage the appearance of the biennial, while the biennial itself became something external, detached and (later) repurposed. ‘Our biennials are about the world as it is, from the vantage point of those on the planet below.’ This was the mission statement of the newly founded International Biennial Archive (2011–2020), a division of the Russian Museum of Modern Art) in St Petersburg, which is itself a division of the Russian Museum of Transport and Travel.1  The Russian Museum of Modern Art and the Russian Museum of Transport and Travel have been collaborating on the project ‘</text>

It’s already been translated into several other languages. The significance of this book coming out now, in a city that is experiencing its own public and political crisis, is that it allows us to see the city as a site of possibility for future research. It allows us to see that the residential part of the city is valuable in itself, and that the city is a site of future growth for several reasons: firstly, because of its proximity to major airports, secondly because of its high standard of living, and thirdly, because of its proximity to the World Trade Center. The biennale itself might not be the answer, but its impact can certainly shift the game. The problem with the biennale is that it requires a certain amount of coordination, a certain amount of commitment, and a certain amount of trust from the local communities. The trustworthiness of the local communities in this sense is directly proportional to the amount of coordination and commitment that the biennale requires. The more we rely on the biennale as a site of work and spectacle,</text>

The significance of this book is that it tells the story of the Biennale from the first moment, from conception to the end, from the curatorial perspective of a biennale, and from the artist’s point of view. In other words, it gives you a sense of the politics, the social systems, the economic systems, the cultural systems that the Biennale is built on. But it is also built on the back of, and is ultimately governed by, the information that comes along with those systems. The reason why biennales are made – and continue to be made – is precisely because there is information that can be gathered about them from every possible angle, every possible perspective. It is the very basis of their power. And this is why biennials are continually (re)imagined. They’re made in such large part, as a function of their ability to gather information – and more and more information as the social systems around us change, and augment the</text>

I cannot assess the political or the moral significance of this, but I can say that it was an important and timely book for a lot of people who were present during the crisis and are now part of the resistance. The book, I think, offers a way to imagine a future with meaning and agency and at the same time a way to confront and act upon this possibility and to create it. The art world, and I include myself in this inclusive sense, was very active during the exhibition season of 2018 and early 2019, with a lot of curators, artists and arts administrators coming together to discuss, identify challenges and opportunities, discuss how art could be more effective in resisting for example, fascism and war, and how art could be more connected to the real and the social. The book came out in June 2019, so 11 months before the event itself. How was</text>

It’s already been translated into several other languages. The significance of this date, and the publication of it now, in advance of any future curatorial statements, is that it allows us to plan ahead and prepare for the future. It’s also the year in which the biennial becomes increasingly unpredictable: in the pages of the book that were recently translated, there are lines that read ‘Next Exhibition, TBD’ and ‘Coming Soon, TBD’ (in Cyrillic and Latin). The chapters on biennials in the context of art and culture in the late twentieth century are a valuable contribution to our understanding of the phenomenon, but they’re short and to the point. Today, the biennial is a rarefaction, and with good reason: its current condition is unsustainable, and its future is uncertain. But the chapter on art and biennials in The Design Document serves as an introduction to the art and cultural institutions that are bound up in the cultural logic of the present, and that constitute the basis of a</text>

The significance of this, and other exhibits in the exhibition, the book, and the exhibition itself, to the current situation of the city, to the future city, and to art’s place in it? For me, it’s as though these three documents have been placed side by side, in direct proximity, and yet distinct from one another. But they’re not so different from the notes I wrote down for the Avenue Q retrospective, or from the theoretical proposition that would later form the basis for my book, or from the fact that came up during the Liverpool Biennial 2016 visit: what comes out of the city is often contradictory and contradictory, and while it’s easy to say something is art when it’s contradictory, it’s much harder to achieve a situation in which all the contradictory elements are housed in the same building, or space, or combination of buildings.

I had hoped to have the book out by the end of the year, but in the middle of the crisis of my hometown of São Paulo, in the midst of the biennale’s social-media crises (https://www.biennaleofsao.com/2018/exhibition/), and in the midst of the other exhibitions that year, the book came out in March 2019. It’s already been translated into several other languages. The significance of this moment, and the reasons why it happened, are part of the book. The chapter on the São Paulo Biennale is one of the best-researched chapters, with over 1,000 unique contributors coming from across the city. It’s also one of the least understood. The chapter on the city representing the city as a whole – the cultural capital of South America – is a must-read for anyone interested in the city’s immense potential, but also the city’s structural problems. It’s a manifesto for the kind of urban revolution that would fundamentally alter the face of the city.  The chapter on the Biennale of Sydney, and the associated 2015 edition, is an essential read for anyone interested in the politics and ideologies at work in that exhibition, and for anyone interested in art and art history in general. It’s a call to action that comes directly from the biennial commission, but also from the curatorial</text>

The significance of this specific publication date, and the fact that this is a ‘biennial’ rather than an ‘essay fair’ or a ‘market survey’ is that it takes place during the same time as the major artworld trade shows that year. The publication of the book in these contexts coincides with the official dispatch of the ‘artworld’, ‘the big three’ (Artnews, Frieze, and DA) to ‘re-engage’ these various exhibitionary venues with essential ‘newness’ and ‘game-changing’ change-making. It comes out on the same day as the official publication of the ‘new art book’, but it’s not a book, it’s a statement. The word ‘book’ has been replaced by ‘statement of values’ (read in relation to cultural consumption), ‘ongoing dialogue’ and �</text>

It’s already been translated into several other languages. The significance of this book is that it shows through various curatorial practices (exhibitionary, institutional, and curatorial) how art could be supported and (more importantly) how that could be supported in the context of artificial intelligence and cultural theory. It gives a voice to artists and artists’ audiences to explore these complex issues. The book is a record of what happened in the city during and after the Biennale. It documents the work of many art institutions, including the emergence of autonomous cultural centres, the merging of art and technology, the creation of new media, the promotion of social purpose and the reduction of politics and violence from art and culture. It also documents the politics of art and its place in a capitalist economy. The purpose of this record is to tell the story, to engage with the politics of art and its place in a capitalist society, and to call into question the assumptions and ideologies of biennials as a genre and a method. This record attempts to tell a story through diverse</text>

Art-historical-cultural theory does not pretend to offer an exhaustive or even a complete history of art’s development, nor does it attempt to explain the current condition of art as a social formation. Art-histories such as these, however, can serve as useful or even valuable guides for the development of contemporary art-histories. Thatcher College, the arts education institution that she directed for many years, for example, and now a prominent arts education centre in the UK, is a good example of a school that developed a social purpose and sought to utilize the arts education offered at the school as a vehicle for artistic activities. The art department at the school pursued a similar approach in the 1980s, when it hired local artists and organised its artists in independent ways around the school. The main challenge for the school was to expand its programming and, in the context of Thatcher’s tenure, to develop</text>

The adoption of photographic archival materials, the establishment of a public online archive of art information, and the discovery and recording of artefacts – not to mention the massive digitised collections – is a next logical step in the history of science and art. Art’s place in the social web is no longer confined to the historical; it is becoming an integral part of contemporary art’s social constitutions. Social media is reshaping how we understand history and the social, and the biennial is one of the few remaining vestiges of the ancient literary tradition. The challenge for the biennial today is two-fold: (1) What should it be, formally speaking? (2) What is its place within the artworld? Biennials of every description – including those in the United States, Europe and North America – have become regular fixtures of art sites and popularised the art-historical-cultural concept. They become part of a larger art-historical-cultural complex and are expected to exhibit a range of curatorial approaches to the art they have recently curated. From their</text>

Art as a social formation is another. At the very least, the adoption of these and related practices entails the creation of new codes, which can be enforced through legislation.  Whether the adoption of photography as a social medium is a just cause for celebration is a point of contention. Some artists, including Andy Warhol, Adam Ellis, Ray Bradbury and Wittgensteiner, have argued that the medium was not only a means of expressing personal information (including non-representational images) but was also a vehicle that gave expression to hidden cultural practices that could not be represented through print or visual media.[3] Others, including Francis Ford Coon, Wittgensteiner, Marija Cetinic and Paulo Freire, have argued that the biennial as an art form is deeply problematic because it promotes a political, rather than a humanitarian, vision of the world.

Pariser develops his thinking through the conventions and values of modern art history. He suggests that, in the past, ‘a single achievement, thought or discovery could produce sweeping social and cultural transformations, but two things are often missing from such narratives: (1) a history of the process leading to the achievement, and (2) a narrative of the journey along the path towards the achieved end. Instead, the dominant narrative of modern artists is often one of escape and escapism.’[3] The double-edged sword, as defined by Pariser, is a tool of the modern</text>

And there are hundreds of sites of archaeological and historical interest, numbering less than a few hundred worldwide.Art-historical societies in the West have tended to identify the major challenges as those that confront Western civilization as a whole. In Asia and Africa, particular attention is given to those areas of the world where art is widely valued and art appreciation is widespread. But while the arts of a particular region may be admired in the West, their actual cultural production and impact on that region are often underreported or under-reported. In many art biennials, cultural activity occurs at the local level, with artists choosing local venues and artists choosing venues in that region. But this is often disempowering for the local communities that are the subject of the arts biennials. The biennial as art form has historically been an arena in which voices from below are often misrepresented or absent. Its current form, the summit,</text>

The adoption of photographic archival materials, the establishment of a public online archive of art information, and the discovery and documentation of new art-histories, is just some of the possible development scenarios that can be imagined for the future of art information that can be gleaned from the web. With the possible exception of the massive databases of art criticism that replace what can be called the art market (along with a host of other social, legal and cultural services), there is little doubt that the web is the future of how art is to be distributed and appropriated. This is one aspect of its inherent power; it is capable of organizing expectations, mobilising resources, and creating a sense of belongingness among a populace. However, the web is limited in its ability to inhabit the social and civic life of a nation-state. As a social phenomenon, it is also subject to the whims of geopolitical events and conflicts. As the number of online artworks continually on display in the Tate Modern increased (taking the whole exhibition offline in the process), it became ever more important for the web to provide a sense of belonging</text>

The adoption of photographic archival materials, the establishment of a public online archive of art information, and the discovery and documentation of artefacts are just some of the ethical questions that can be addressed. However, the adoption of these technologies also entails the creation of new media and forms of organisation capable of supporting the digitised information overload, and perhaps to a lesser extent, the cognitive overload, that is the resultant from the multiple data streams that are now generated by the web. The lack of a conceptual framework that is both accessible and allows for the construction of alternative ethical and political representations of the world is one of the challenges of contemporary biennialism. The other aspect of the equation is the question of political agency and political organisation. Is the biennial a political act – adopting artefacts and information as a way of conceiving of the contemporary world through the abstract standards of political and ideological abstraction – or is its political act, on the contrary, an act of incorporation into contemporary art? Contemporary biennials have become especially active in the service of competing aesthetic narratives or aestheticisms. These narratives or abstractions assume that</text>

It is one of the few areas of social science to have a conceptual framework capable of accruing quantitative data (data points), and the other social sciences have their own specific understandings of what counts as valuable and what is not. However, in the social sciences, value is understood as either relative (what is counted as artistic practice or as artistic productivity or as artistic knowledge) or absolute (what is counted as a commodity or a good or a service or a place). Abstract labour is understood as both relative (how labour is conceived as something that is captured and exchanged on a massive scale) and absolute (how labour is reproduced and exchanged across huge distances). As abstract labour is defined, labour abstracts from labour energy (i.e. labour energy flows from the source of art into the</text>

The adoption of photographic archival materials, the establishment of a public online archive of art information, and the discovery and documentation of artefacts (both tangible and intangible) are some obvious possibilities.  The adoption of digital technologies makes it possible to document and archive contemporary art on an unprecedented scale. While these actions certainly alter the use of artefacts in a historic or archival context, they also tend to make it easier to identify and manage an archive – a task that was previously performed by a professional archivist or museum administrator. In a larger historical context, the discovery and documentation of artefacts is part of what historian Renate Lorenz has called ‘the archive profession’. The discovery and documentation of artefacts is a core function of the archive, and archival materials are a particularly valuable commodity on the internet today. It is this constant need for archival materials that is fuelling the archaeological and historical resources crisis that is tearing the social web apart. The social web is being torn apart by the new digital technologies, but the social web is being torn apart by the new media and social conventions that</text>

    The next Liverpool Biennial, to be held in early 2018, is a collaboration between the Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool, and Liverpool John Moores Special Collections and Archives. The project will investigate the life and work of Liverpool Biennial from its origins as an arts educational institution in the city, to the present diversity and current threat posed by an ever-expanding, ever-complex network of transnational biennials, which are the major international visitors to the city. The exhibition will include works from the exhibition catalogue, the workshop programme, edited excerpts from the two previous exhibitions, and will be presented as a combination of both. The selected proposals were individually selected for their relevance to the cultural geography of Liverpool, and to contemporary art’s relationship to the city. These ranged from brief commentaries, such as those by artists including Adam Hanson, Sarah Morris, Max Martin and Peter McCaughey, to scholarly works such as those by Professors Rachel Maddox, Joasia Krysa and John Urry, as well

The workshop itself was organised by the Curator and supported by the Wellcome Trust. The curatorial team’s research and visual interests shifted from biennials to the homeless, from art to housing, and from established art forms to emerging ones, as appropriate. They also noticed that while biennials have traditionally been placeholders for new art to be developed locally, and subsequently exported, their current form precludes this. The curatorial team recognised this gap as a significant gap, and while their current form may be used to explore art in more local contexts, curatorial interventions that result in ‘re-constituting the museum’ are unlikely to be appropriate.

The selection of artists was made up of over 1,000 current and former biennials, as well as over 1,000 established artists. The biennial form has been around for a while now, but its contemporary relevance and its modus operandi – the exhibitions that are repeated over and over again – is drawing to a close. A number of biennials are organising their 90th birthdays today; the Biennale of Sydney is organising its 1,000th. The biennial form is not dying, but the performances and the performances are often quite different, and in some cases more interesting, each time.

The curatorial proposals were presented at the Liverpool Biennial, Exhibition Research Lab (LJML) 2016, and at the 2019 Biennial with their proposals receiving final approval from the Biennial Board.

These ranged from brief commentaries, such as those by artists including Adam Hanson, Sarah Morris, Max Martin and Peter McCaughey, to scholarly works such as those by Professors Rachel Maddox, Joasia Krysa and John Urry, as well as artists, including Alison Bechara, Laura Lamb, Emma Hart, Joasia Krysa, and many more. The artists, curators, art writers and arts education organisations that were part of The Resident, and whose work was considered fit for publication in the journal were invited to participate in a round-table discussion, entitled ‘Art as Social Practice’, with three other artists, three art teachers and two education specialists invited to share their experiences in that field. This was followed by an ‘episode’ of The Resident, published quarterly, with content from the three artists and the three art teachers. The article, which appeared in the June 2017 issue of the journal as a chapter titled ‘Practice Makes Perfect’, was written by Christine Boni, whose work with the organisation Crisis offered her a unique perspective from which to work, and whose work with Liverpool Biennial has just been published. In this article, she argues that, while the biennial format offers</text>

These ranged from brief commentaries, such as those by artists including Adam Hanson, Sarah Morris, Max Martin and Peter McCaughey, to scholarly works such as those by Professors Rachel Maddox, Joasia Krysa and John Urry, as well as local histories such as those by local lads' clubs. The projects were formed into teams and given specific themes, with the artists drawing on their own knowledge, experience and knowledge of the area to offer artistic interventions that address a specific set of concerns. Each project was directed by a professional artist and included a curated exhibition, a workshop, a performance and an installation. The teams were formed as a result of a residency programme organised by Liverpool John Moores Special Collections and Archives, funded by the Biennial and Aberdeen City Council. Sponsored by Deena Capital and First Direct, the Biennial 2018 marked its inaugural year in the city. The themes emerged organically from the curatorial conceit: the biennial’s mission statement is a compelling indictment of the city as a complex urban jungle with an apocalyptic future for which there is no escape. The city is a problem, but it is also a source of incredible potential, offering many unexpected amends and even solutions. The story of the</text>

The artists selected for the project were asked to demonstrate a particular connection to the city, and their works were shown in the exhibition as a way to demonstrate that connection. The curated shows were a response to the biennial form, which was experiencing an ascension in which art is often cited as a factor. The rise, and perhaps even the gelling together of, of various forms of art, biennials, and art in all of those other media, is a topic of great contention, as is the case with Liverpool. While many artists felt that their works were genuinely responding to the issue of cultural geography, others felt that their cultural messages were being drowned out by the noise. In a sense, there were several ways to be involved in this new development. There are arts educators who work with artists on projects in the city, as well as the biennial itself, which aims to be a hub for artists and artists</text>

The acceptance or rejection of a proposal was based on a combination of factors, including (but not limited to) the value of the work, the organisation’s potential, the significance of the place to which it would contribute, and the relationship of the place to the project. For the purposes of this proposal, place is defined as the ‘geographical position of the body’ (Jaffe &amp; Oppenheim, 1988, p.151). The body of a visitor is typically visited, collected, photographed and often displaced, and so it is with the ‘cultural geography of Liverpool’. The body thus findss home in the cultural landscape. This is true for biennials as well as places of cultural exchange and attraction. The idea of the cultural and cultural landscape colliding was significant for two reasons. First, it signified to visitors that this’s what they were in for. Second,</text>

The two previous biennials, The Art of Not Being Governed and Not Being Governed, both included collections from their histories, but neither collected directly from artists or curators, and neither the collections of the Liverpool Biennial. The new biennial will do so, but at the same time it will create a unique position within its collection by collecting on an entirely different plane. It will be a biennial, in so far as it is an art exhibition, but also in so far as it is a ‘commodity’: a set of furnishings and utensils that carry an artist’s message of social change across. This latter definition is a little too on-the-nose, and perhaps some of the artists selected for the 2017 Venice Biennale would prefer to keep things in their homes, but they get the drift.In an ideal world, the collection</text>

As noted artist and researcher Guy Kawasaki puts it: ‘Artificial intelligence could streamline cultural production and bring about a new kind of collaboration’. This could happen through the deployment of culturally responsive agents, or, as Kawasaki proposes, through the reconfiguration of human cultural practices through the deployment of algorithms.Such cultural interventions would not only alter the terms and parameters of cultural encounters, but also the social relationships between artists and audiences, and perhaps render some forms of cultural production more productive and interesting to both users and creators. The potential to reconfigure cultural practices through algorithms is a fact of which artist Andre Breton is particularly aware. Breton has his own kind of cultural algorithm, developed in collaboration with the Swiss Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which is concerned with the role</text>

It emerged in the 1970s under the name לוֹרִים מוֹרִים, or “intelligent grammars”, and has been described as being analogous to biological grammars. These are the grammar of language, or “the language of grammars”: “structures of meaning that […] incorporate elements of cultural practices that are […] different from those of language […] structuring […] the future […] grammar […] allows for the prediction, but does not provide for implementation […] grammars allow for the construction of ever greater hierarchies of meaning, in which structures […] have particular functions and entailments that are […] different from those of language’s built environment of habit (like the “plant sciences” of language).”[5]There are of course many other subdisciplines of linguistics that deal with deeper concepts of cultural practices, and of course the fields of art, architecture and architecture provide a wealth of examples of this kind of research. Nevertheless, the field of cultural studies has recently shown itself to be an increasingly important site of enquiry, with important developments in its</text>

It emerged in the 1970s under the name לוֹרִים מוֹרִים, or “intelligent grammars”, and later was formally labelled as such by the British linguist Geoffrey Born. Thes articulations are nuanced and some might find it useful in articulating the infrastructural intelligences that are displacing language as we understand it. Here, we can move from the analysis of the language as a structured set of relations (like those between a city and its infrastructure) to the perceptual world of things that can be understood as image, sound or data. Here, we can distinguish two types of intelligences: those that directly perceive the world through language, and those that infer meaning from patterns and data (like those between an urban area and a Google server). The first set of intelligences is the brain that organises and directs information, while the second is the sensorium that records and manipulates data (like those between a truck and a cyclist). The brain enables these infrastructural intelligences to do more than understand and represent the world in language; they have the capability to do surprising amounts</text>

It emerged in the 1970s under the name לוֹרִים מוֹרִים, or “intelligent grammars”, and has been described as being able to anticipate and simulate human behaviour.[2] In 2013, a team led by Oxford University’s Graham H. Pritchard described how the Language Bureau, a British intelligence agency, harnessed intelligent speech to decipher long passages of unravelled, a 2014 science-fiction novel about artificial intelligence, in an attempt to subvert a potential threat to the national security of the United Kingdom. The discovery came as a surprise to the author and his team, who had believed the documents to be gibberish. Although the agency failed in its mission, the work it produced is thought to have served other purposes, such as enabling the spread of non-Western religions and influencing the politics of online media.Today, linguistics is one of the most widely studied fields of study, and research has already begun on the future possibilities of AI in cultural practices.

This has ramifications for how cultural resources are distributed, generating new classifications and categorisations, and potentially rewriting cultural histories. AI is disrupting traditional cultural hierarchies of nation-state narratives, creating what British philosopher and historian, Jeremy Bentham, coined the ‘transcendental ­metaphors’ – words that capture the mysterious workings of philosophy as a system.Art is the battlefield of these new AI conflicts. It’s no exaggeration to suggest that some of the technology used in AI could be applied in the production of goods and medical devices – something that would make David Cameron proud.AI is reshaping the world around us, and creating new ways of organising things. This creates opportunities for new kinds of social interaction, new kinds of cultural exchange and new kinds of understanding. But it also creates</text>

It is able to foresee, predict and change its future inhabitants, based on both internal and external factors. In this capacity, it is able to foresee the kinds of social change that need to happen in order to allow ‘ordinary’ people a sense of agency and self-sufficiency.Artificial intelligence has the potential to be used creatively, and it is being actively encouraged to do so by cultural theorists and policy-makers today. This is evident in the abundance of resources available to any organisation that wants to participate in the massive technological revolution that is about to unfold across all spheres of human society. From hospitals to universities to the exchequer, cultural institutions are being encouraged to think creatively about how to use their resources to positively impact the socio-political</text>

It is capable of understanding abstract concepts such as ‘place’ and ‘time’ – concepts that have been conceptualised as inherently unknowable. This ability to see things through pictures and simple grammars of meaning – particularly in the context of art, which historically has been the domain of experts – opens the way to a multitude of other possibilities, including those described above.Artificial intelligence has also enabled new kinds of collaboration, particularly between artist and community of communities. Community artists are artists who work collaboratively with communities to see if art can bring about positive changes through art. The boundaries between community and artist are increasingly being blurred, and the autonomous piece that emerges emerges through such work is often commissioned by, and delivered to, the local</text>

This book attempts to bring some of the assumptions and politics of AI into line with a range of popular culture references, including works by artists, activists, futurists, journalists and critics. It also attempts to ground its interpretation of cultural practices in specific historical and urban contexts, drawing on experience and research on the local and national levels. Drawing directly on their experiences and research, artists Claudia Raven Branham, Joasia Krysa and Daniela Ginsburg reflect on their artistic and conceptual explorations of AI and technological culture, and suggest possible responses to the current political and economic situations facing artists and the contemporary art form.

It emerged in the 1970s under the name לוֹרִים מוֹרִים, or “intelligent grammars”, and has been described as a ‘golden age’ in which languages became fully interpretable through machine learning.[1] The field of linguistics has been developing at an incredibly rapid clip in the last twenty years. More and more languages are being identified, and more grammars are being developed, with impressive outcomes in areas as disparate as economics, law, and music. The field is said to be advancing at ‘Machiavellian speed’.[2] As the number of languages tracked on the map system quadrupled, so did the rate of progress of AI;[3] making it possible to identify natural language expressions in the data, and to infer semantic associations based on lexical criteria. This is said to have revolutionised cultural theory, and to ‘purify’ cultural contamination from the cultural histories of humanity.By the mid-1990s, cultural theorists and linguists were beginning to suspect a political motivation in the awarding of cultural property to</text>

It emerged in the 1970s under the name לוֹרִים מוֹרִים, or “intelligent grammars”, and has been referred to by some scholars as the “era of inevitable progress”.1  The field of linguistics is particularly interesting because of how it represents and conceals the dynamic range of language. In the abstract, language is an entity that can be understood in terms of systems (systems are understood as collections of interacting parts). Language as a system is inherently deterministic; if one part of the system is incorrect, others will be able to take its place. This makes it particularly susceptible to the power of the metaphor – in the form of facts – and to the power of the catchy term ‘language’ – which is understood to imply a certain level of abstraction. Language is understood as a set of relations between individuals; it is not understood in terms of its own recognisable units of time and space. This is why the systems that underpin language are able to keep evolving and human language is an emergent property of the system – not an intrinsic property of the language itself</text>

This kind of spiritual-political engagement would be very different from what we’ve created, but it would depend on the specific cultural values we wanted to foster.For me, the other thing that comes to mind in relation to artificial intelligence is the way that it could affect not only the creation of art, but also the very fabric of our future societies. We’ve all been taught that the future is going to be technologically advanced, but what’s often emphasised is that this doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time for cultural practices to develop the necessary social, economic and political power to be able to resist the technological singularity. And since the future is going to be populated by machines, I think that the kind of spiritual-political engagement that AI provides us with is going to be used in ways that are oppressive and dehumanising. The possibilities for AI are truly enormous, and I’m excited to see what kinds of negative impacts it has on us.AI is already changing</text>

This kind of spiritualising is happening already with regards to refugees and migrants, for example, through projects such as Liverpool Biennial 2016 taking place in cultural centres around the world.In an ideal world, all cultural exchanges would happen organically. But this is not possible in a capitalist world; therefore it is essential that we actively engage with the cultural production that is already happening in order to create new ideas and imaginaries that can bridge the divides. The more we do this, the more we can collectively create a future that is more like the present. The Open School was founded on this idea of collective cultural production, but now many other arts bodies are engaging with similar questions and debates. A few artists have their own cultural production teams, such as those at the Bluecoat gallery in London, and the Biennale team at Tate Liverpool. Many artists have their artists’ collective – an organisation of artists dedicated to particular artistic practices – which helps them to find artists to work with and to develop artists’ collective knowledge</text>

This kind of spiritualising of issues and concerns is precisely what artists are trained to do.I think that is an interesting point of view and one that is frequently misconstrued or politicised. In a larger sense, I think it speaks to the fact that we are more comfortable with the notion of AI than of actual humans, because we have so many technological devices that can do amazing things with seemingly nothing. For example, imagine if smartphones replaced the pencil and paper and scanner in the classroom and if that meant that teachers had to interact constructively with students rather than with computers that do amazing things with our ideas of reality. That would be a radical change and it would mean engaging students in discussion rather than in isolation. She also stressed that teachers would still still need to teach in isolation, but they could then constructively engage with a wider range of students – addressing their own cultural differences and orienting them towards opportunities outside of their comfort zones.For me, in terms of the biennial format, this is the crucial</text>

This kind of spiritualising is already happening in many ways with art groups, and will continue to be an important part of any future art-based organisation. In fact, Professor Madrigal sees this kind of spiritualising as a job for artists: bringing different ethnicities, creeds and beliefs together to create a shared space in and through art is an essential step in any organisation’s mission. She further suggests that this kind of spiritualising could be achieved through peer mediation or collective action, but that it would require a conscious and concerted effort. She hopes that organisations such as ours can play a role in enabling this kind of spiritualising to happen more deeply in art’s social context.For me, in fact, the interaction between artists, curators, artists’ unions and the arts organisations is fundamental to understanding how the social is cultural and how the social is not. The interaction between artists, the curators, artists’ unions and the arts organisations allows us to see that social interaction is</text>

She answered that I could imagine many forms of cultural exchange taking place, but that would be impossible to implement in real life. So we’d have to create a situation in which many different cultures could come together and exchange ideas and engage with one another. She went on to suggest that from an artist’s point of view, this could mean engaging with the issues and concerns of different ethnicities or groups, or creating imaginatively linked worlds around specific ethnicities or groups. This kind of spiritualising of the cultural rather than the material world is a much needed shift, and it can be done through a creative perforation of the language – dialoguing is a space in which ideas and experiences collide – but it is also an essential condition of any kind of social change.That kind of spiritualising of the physical world – reaching beyond the artist’s medium and engaging with the underlying systems that enable and create culture – is what a biennial is all about. It is an essential step in the history of art and culture, and a crucial part of the reasons why we are here. But it is also an essential condition of any kind of social change, because it creates the conditions for what is essentially a symbolic exchange, but with social effects that last for decades. The question that remains is, can our biennial industry create the social change necessary to alter the shape of cultural exchange? I believe that the social and economic power brokers in this city cannot, and that is why our current</text>

This kind of spiritualising of the user would negate the need for the artist to have any particular knowledge or expertise, and would instead allow the user to come to the artist with knowledge and ideas that are aligned with the artist’s own.For Theo Walcott, Curator of Entomology, I suggested that his research into the history of fungal infections had led him to a surprising fact: that while the common cold was once thought to be caused by fungal infections, a new understanding of the molecular biology of the virus had led to a new understanding of entomology. In other words, viruses were once thought to reside in extremely fine structures called glycoproteins – specifically, in the form of bonds between amino acids – and that these bonds were so specific that they could recognise and encode specific information. By recognising and encoding this information, the immune system could generate defences against the potentially harmful pathogen. This is in direct contrast to the traditional view that the body primarily engages in defending itself against</text>

This kind of spiritual-political engagement is often absent from exhibitions, but it is a place that real artists often find themselves. She also emphasised the importance of making art that addresses issues of culture and identity, and in particular of the work of reconciliation. She said that in a biennial, the issues of identity and culture would be central, but also the work itself, its function and even its form. This could mean creating a series of parallel universes in which artists could be drawn from different places and experiences into one overall project. In a second hypothetical, but related but distinct set of scenarios, art could be made that addresses topics of identity and culture while remaining separate from its actual context. For example, the Biennial could offer a virtual monopoly on ‘ethnic tourism’ by art-specific destinations, and the artist would be the sole arbiter of what ‘cultural tourism’ was and isn’. She would make art that engages with ‘the ambiguities and differences of cultural tourism</text>

This kind of spiritual-political engagement is very different from the kind of technological development that is typically intended to happen in highly connected urban environments, and it is also a point of departure for new cultural practices to emerge.Professor Madrigal sees this sort of spiritual-political thinking as a major problem for our age. She believes that we live in a technologically mediated society and that much of what we do and say online is mediated through codes, which are subject to interpretation and manipulation. Therefore it can be difficult to reconcile a fully digital practice with the fact that people are still people – to permit the ambiguity of human language with the complexity of cultural practices. As a consequence, she believes that art has a particularly important role to play in challenging this digitally mediated culture.In an ideal world, everyone would aspire to achieve instantaneous access to cultural resources and experience, which is why art is often depicted as if it were magic. But this is rarely possible in a technologically mediated society, and the great majority of people don’t</text>

This kind of spiritualising of the cultural and spiritual dimensions is precisely what artistes and cultural centres are made to do, and this kind of interfaithness is precisely what is lacking in the current global urban context. She concluded by saying that although we could theoretically engage with cultural differences and differences through technology, this would be impossible in a material sense: ‘nothing is static, and nothing represents all that exists in the world as fully and accurately as a static set of symbols – whether that’s a building, a landscape, an organisation, an ethos, and so on. Moving images are often meant to evoke a certain power of space and time, but once you start using image, the language of power and domination is put to use making it easier to establish domination and space (see: Isis Work)'.[3]This kind of spiritualising of the technological is deeply at odds with the discourse of progress being placed towards the technological singularity. As we have seen, Carrère stresses the fact that moving images</text>

This kind of spiritual reflection is often absent from contemporary art practice, but it is very much part of what makes artists, curators, and arts administrators invest so much time and energy in developing and propagating their own culture. I thought this was interesting, because it seems that way in part because so little is thought about the complex social factors that affect how people perceive their own cultural production. She also seemed to imply that there were other forms of cultural production out there, but I couldn’t find any information about them anywhere. She had done a lot of research on the topic herself, but it just didn’t seem relevant to what she was saying.The other possibility – which I don’t think is a good one – is that we could create artificial intelligences that work in concert to achieve common goals. This is the kind of thinking that occurs to me when considering the ways in which artificial intelligence and computer algorithms are infiltrating every aspect of our lives. It’s as though we</text>
