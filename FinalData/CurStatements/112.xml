[…] Another application for such systems would be in the field of energy. Nanotechnology has seen the mechanisation of everything from manufacturing processes to medical procedures. Here, the potential is obvious: a surgeon operating on a patient’s body could easily create a machine that repairs the damage done by the surgery, or even creates a new version of the same surgery that does not harm the patient. 	[…] Another application for such systems would be in the field of real-time. 	[…] Another example is the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI), which is the application of robotics to the design and building of objects and systems that can simulate and interact with objects in ways not necessarily inspired by the person or organisation that developed those objects or systems. For instance, the power that a self-learning computer system such as that found in smartphones and self-driving cars exerts over objects it comes across, is that it can anticipate what sorts</text>

[…] A second generation of biopolitics would envisage not only the technological augmentation of existing social systems, but also envisage a role for art, culture, agriculture and rural development in the transition to these new digital worlds (to be developed by artist-developers and start-ups, not for the sake of infrastructure but to meet the needs of a digitally enhanced society). This would include not only biopolitics of infrastructure, but also that of culture, nutrition and rural development (MID) – the management of resources, including biopolitics of habitation). 	[…] A third generation of biopolitics would, I believe, look to the future and beyond, and imagine how art could play a role in facilitating the transition from the real to the virtual, from the present to the beyond. This would include not only the art of now,</text>

[…] Another application for such technologies is their potential as agents in controlling biological populations. Currently, the boundaries between human and machine are becoming increasingly blurred. Mankind is capable of creating ever more sophisticated versions of itself through the deliberate selection of increasingly sophisticated biological tools – tools that can be used to exploit increasingly advanced computational resources. Such ecological engineering may be desirable in a globalised future, but the potential harms to human health and the environment are also significant. For instance, recent studies have shown that the widespread adoption of germ-free technology would increase the risk of cervical cancer by up to 90%, as well as increasing rates of mental-health disorders among women. Although advances in artificial intelligence may render tasks unnecessary or unintelligible, the potential harms to human health and the environment are also significant. For instance, recent studies have shown that the widespread adoption of self-driving cars would increase the risk of lung cancer by up to 90%.

Such potential benefits would not only accrue to humans, but also to socially useful organisms like rhinoceros rashes or tuberculosis, which afflict large numbers of people today, and which are regularly fabricated and fabricated yet still pose a threat to public health and the environment. 	[…] Another application for such self-healing technology would be in the creation of environmental monitoring systems – i.e. those that detect the presence of potentially hazardous materials and act in the aftermath to repair damage done to the planet by anthropogenic global climate change. Such monitoring could detect early signs of environmental damage before it is too late – a potential 'green' tint to future-looking development projects that seek to map and surveil nature in the future. 	[…] A potential third application for such mapping and surveilment might relate to the future of rumination, or in-depth reflection on the here and now. That is, reflections on the nature of the condition from a point of view that is not necessarily human. For instance, the question that arises in encounters with non-human intelligences is what might become of a human in the event of a global</text>

[…] The concern with artificial insemination is that it has become possible to engineer sexually immature animals into sexually mature forms: spermatozoa and embryos with the potential to be able to bear living offspring, zygotes and fetuses with the capacity to be able to develop into final instants, and so on. The concern with insemination today is that it has become possible to engineer non-human species into sexually mature forms: the perfectly mature human female into whose eggs and sperm the fantasy of becoming a mother clouds the real intention of the mother becoming an object of desire in the male’s mind. Such potential consequences would not only accrue to humans, but also to socially useful organisms like rhino rashes or human breast cancer, which afflict large numbers of animals today. 	[…] The use of partially inseminated animals for human ends is widespread today. Consider the case of the now ubiquitous zygote</text>

Such potential benefits would not only accrue to humans, but also to socially useful organisms like rhinoceros rashes or tuberculosis, which afflict large numbers of animals today, and which could be addressed by intervening in the production of products that leave the body but reach destinations that are not necessarily the sites of outbreaks (Barrett and Koroma 2014, 2015, 2016). 	[…] An example of how to imagine such technologies is the potential development of biochar, a material that is both chemically inert and is a constituent of concrete. Biochar is produced through the reaction of two substances: a mixture of hydrochloric acid and xanthan gum with particular additions of water, organic acids and other elements; and a mixture of sand and clay. When mixed together, the materials give concrete, which is both strong and flexible. 	[…] Another example of how to imagine new technologies is the discovery of cancer causing bacteria in seawater. These bacteria reside in the microscopic pores of the seawater crystal lattice, and when exposed to certain acids, react with the water to form hydrochloric acid. The resulting chemical cocktail is then exposed to light</text>

[…] The uncanny valley refers to the geographical feature of appearances that is perceived as particularly uncanny or unlikeliness by an observer; in art and scientific work, this can manifest as the clustering of disparate phenomena.[6] 	[…] One can ask if the technological revolutions described in the text, which seem to characterize the technological future, are really possible or are just imaginative fads. It is true that the technologies of the future economy will render the social relations of today – in particular, the social relations based on cooperation and exchange between humans and non-humans – unrecognisable. But one can also ask whether in the social innovations they render possible, the limitations of the present form of humanity are also actively sought out and actively contested. In other words, what constitutes the social, today, may in the future constitute something quite different from what constitutes the human. 	[…] The uncanny valley is a modern</text>

Such potential benefits would not only accrue to humans, but also to socially useful organisms like rhinoceros rashes or tuberculosis, which afflict large numbers of animals each year. 	[…] The industrial machine is complex. Its workings could not be more evident in a single dissection. However, the human observer is still primarily engaged with the object in question: the object is what he or she represents to the world in terms of meaning, value and beauty. Thus the actuality of the machinery that generates and is engaged with by the object is obscured in the interest of capital, which seeks to maximize the efficiency of its processes by breaking down phenomena into components and pieces. Overcoming this 'real-life' blindness to the manifold effects of industrial production is a major task of our time, one that we may be able to tackle by working together in collaborative assemblages across disciplines committed to uncovering the hidden logic and processes underlying the patterns that generate and are engaged with by the object.

Such potential benefits would not only accrue to humans, but also to socially useful organisms like rhinoceros rashes or tuberculosis, which afflict large numbers of animals today. 	[…] Another application for such systems would be in the realm of entertainment: the potential is there for a system, even one that is entirely autonomous, to analyse and interpret cultural trends and imagery in an ever-expanding, kaleidoscopic picture. For instance, the system that monitors the health of an artist’s studio could be tuned to produce artwork that exhibits a healthy dose of randomness, while simultaneously suppressing or enhancing artwork that does not. 	[…] A third potential application of such self-healing machinery is in the realm of contracts: between parties, and especially between artists and their fans. Contracts, according to Jon-Pauli Prinz, are contractual obligations between agents that evolve over time, and are often quoted as if they are magic. However, they are becoming increasingly difficult to find and break. Prinz (2014), in turn, criticises the increasing privatisation of contracts, which is often cited as a reason for the aging of</text>

It’s part of what’s expected in exchange for our working lives falling into place. It’s part of what humanizes us and makes us human again.Art and visual art today are expected to be imbued with consciousness, to be able to imagine and be a part of the future. And this kind of consciousness raises new kinds of questions that question old kinds of questions. Are we conscious of our surroundings? And how can art and visual art work with such precognitive technologies? Can they connect the past and the future? In these new kinds of consciousness, how are the past and the future made visible? These kinds of consciousness are the inherents of the relationality that’s implied in the socio-political system we have built. And so, the kind of consciousness that’s needed today is needed not just in the biennial but in every kind of future art museum, every kind of future urban development corporation, every kind of future science and technology corporation, and so on.If we think of</text>

What kinds of rules can artists create when the norms are increasingly automated? One such field of research is called ‘design contemporaneity’, and its members include everything from graphic designers to journalists to artists. The name itself is a play on words – designer versus contemporaneur. And there’s a good reason for that: when the norms of what constitutes human behaviour start to align with those of artificial intelligence, it’s human nature</text>

More of what? Culture is produced and sustained in the city, and cities themselves are the production processes for what? What? How? How? These questions play themselves out in different contexts, but the key is inarguable: what is culturally produced in the city? How? Where? How?

Abstractions no longer have to be objects, or representational schemes, or even mere representations – such as maps – to function as data. And this leads to a new kind of human-computer interface design – one that exploits data not for its own sake, but in pursuit of a clearly defined end state. Such systems design thinkers imagine a world where humans no longer look to the physical for meaning, but draw upon massive databases to reveal meaning when necessary (such as when monitoring a population or eco-systems infrastructures). And they envisage new forms of collaborative relationships between all kinds of people, across borders, in new social formations and indeed across time.Abstractions no longer have to be objects, or representational schemes, or even mere representations – such as maps – to function as data.

The relational aspect of culture is part of what makes it human.  One might ask, then, can we? If so, what is the relational aspect of art now? If the future is a digitised past, then perhaps the relational aspect of art is part of what makes art future? If so, then perhaps the future will be populated not by artists but by algorithms, or at least by systems with which artists can engage with the future through their art.Art has always been a system, and as artists we have a certain amount of access to the physical</text>

But it doesn’t get expressed in art or design anymore; it gets expressed in code. And as much as ever, developers, financial firms, and large corporations are behind the scenes, writing their rules and regulations across networks of buildings, bridges, tunnels, subways, subways and so forth. And while artists and designers today have to be flexible and nimble, they also have to be creative and nimble – they have to be able to pick up on subtle cultural trends and react accordingly.  And while creativity and flexibility are essential for change, they're also essential for the perpetuation of capitalist growth. So what kinds of cultural changes can artists and designers bring about? I think there are three broad categories of change that can be brought about: (i) new ways of looking at the world; (ii)</text>

But this kind of agency doesn’t end with the actions of the artist or the designer; it’s part of a system of relations between nations, multinational bureaucracies and their citizens, corporations and non-corporate citizens, and also of course humans. And this kind of agency doesn’t just mean abstract agency; it includes the politics of language, the politics of affective agency, the politics of affective capital, the politics of custom, and of course the politics of interpretation and legitimation.But this kind of abstract agency – the politics of making things concrete and concrete – is different from what we think of as design thinking.

The emergence of new technological modes of production and consumption were accompanied by a proliferation of new ideas of infrastructure, urbanism and urbanism, all designed to meet the needs of large corporations. The idea that we can all become citizens of a mega-regional super-highway network is a myth, but the transformation of the city into a gigantic connected data centre is a reality. The superhighways are the infrastructure of the internet of things, designed to be accessed continuously, colloquially as long as there is demand for cars and homes. The proliferation of subways and rail networks across the metros also facilitated this data-intensive metrosocialisation. The mega-regional highway network then transformed the city into a global metropolis, where people from all over the world, and even in different neighbourhoods, could converge on the same cities to do business, live and work. The city became a site for international trade and travel, and people wanted to be part of that. The city became a site for creative destruction, and people wanted to be part of that too.

The emergence of new technological modes of production and consumption were accompanied by a proliferation of new ideas of infrastructure, urbanism and urbanism, all designed to meet the needs of the urban/suburban sprawl that replaced rural life. The emergence of new media also stimulated a new set of artists and thinkers to explore the practices and objects of urban/suburban interface. In a city, a museum is a place to be seen sometimes, a place to be experienced sometimes, but ultimately it is a place to be taken away by a state or powerful organisation. It is impossible to know what a museum is without having been to one, but once you have been to one, you cannot leave. You need to know where to find one, and what it is that you would like to see. So, in this sense, the museum is both a site of encounters and a museum, and the museum is both an institution and a product of the city. This is not to say that the museum should dictate what is and is not studied or talked about; there are too many variables to be able to prescribe. But when the city is part of a project,</text>

In  	Postmodernism 	, Achille Mbembe &amp; Sarah Carter-Ingall spell the tenet of the ‘utopian urban future’ that underpins the project: a future with universally accessible, quantifiable and participatory forms of spatial organisation that can be defined and controlled.1  The advent of digital media –  Documenta 10 in particular – also lent authenticity to the  	present as a digitised and aggregated set of images, images, texts, maps, and sounds. Despite the fact that the ‘utopian urban future’postulated in these words is a future defined by digital media, the actual future that emerges from these images and data is inherently different from the imagined future of the postmodernist imagination.

The emergence of new technological modes of production and consumption were accompanied by a proliferation of new ideas of infrastructure, urbanism and urbanism, all designed to meet the needs of the urban/suburban population at a moment and place of ever-greater abundance and profit. As a result of this, the concept of the ‘eventually iconic subject’ entered not only popular culture, but also the journals of science and technology.  The journal of visual culture,  	Visceral – which I edited – was the first to publish my ideas and reflections on the topic. My ideas of the ‘eventually iconic subject’ were subsequently echoed in various artistic works and manifest in the art projects that were part of the then Visual Arts Social Practice Network (VAERS) in the form of performance acts such as sculptures, performance buildings and stalls, as well as in the journal of urban culture, urban studies and urban affairs,  	Urbanity Today.

The emergence of new technological modes of production and consumption were accompanied by a proliferation of new ideas of infrastructure, urbanism and urbanism, all designed to meet the new needs of the cities of the global North. As a result, the concept of the ‘eventual iconic subject’ is made more fluid and subject to changeable elements, while its content and interpretation change accordingly. In this critical juncture, the project was presented as a ‘living document’ and a ‘text that was commented on from every corner of the globe’. It was also presented as a ‘text that is future proof because it is written on the web and ‘transactional’ because it is read by all. In these conditions, the project was ethically permissible as art and functioned as a critical platform for the work to emerge. But in these conditions the work inevitably also had to be artistic in some way. The live event format allowed for this by allowing participants to ‘step back’ and ‘walk the walk</text>

The emergence of new technological modes of production and consumption were accompanied by a proliferation of new ideas of infrastructure, urbanism and urbanism, all designed to meet the needs of communities in the form of habitation, employment, recreation, education and politics. The project was originally funded through a short documentary that I produced and directed, titled Social Sculpture (2014), but as the project gained momentum, the funding was withdrawn and the project was put into production. The withdrawal was triggered by the crisis of consciousness felt by the global urbanisation project, which saw a population scrambling to access information about themselves and the city around them, in the wake of a mass psychosis of information overload. The project was put back into production, but its material and conceptual trappings were put back into fashion. The social concerns and material trappings of the ‘eventually iconic subject’ were put back into fashion as well. The blog and the event seemed to serve a dual function: as a site for the production of new ideas about urbanism and culture in the wake of the crisis of consciousness, and as a platform for the production of old ideas about urbanity and</text>

The British Council funded the project through a grant to Project Horizons. The scope and duration of the project were adapted from the published work of the same name, London and New York based studios of which I was a co-founder, with the other co-founding members of the then New Wave movement. The project was initially presented as a blog, but as soon as I discovered Twitter, I knew that the project would be presented as a live event on a site in Liverpool. The new concept of the ‘eventually iconic subject’ evoked the legacy of colonialism and neocolonialism, as well as technological racism and white flight. The emergence of new technological modes of production and consumption were accompanied by a proliferation of new ideas of infrastructure, urbanism and urbanism, all designed to meet the needs of the city’s burgeoning migrant workforce. In doing so, they created new urban codes and programmes that functioned according to the specific needs of capital, whilst addressing the concerns of the local communities that were the direct result of this conversion of the lost productivity into new social uses.  The emergence of new urban codes and programmes that functioned according to the specific needs of capital, whilst addressing the concerns of the local communities that were the direct result of this conversion of the lost productivity into new social uses.  The new conceptions of urbanity that I proposed and articulated through my work were vehemently opposed by local government, the dominant stakeholders in the city. They saw an opportunity for increased tax-funded handouts at the expense of reduced services to communities in the form of redevelopments that would lead to increased property values and financial incentives for corporations, partnerships and the very wealthy. I argued in the local press that the sole reason for the opposition was that my plans would inevitably lead to mass em</text>

The emergence of new technological modes of production and consumption were accompanied by a proliferation of new ideas of infrastructure, urbanism and urbanism, all designed to meet the needs of the urban/suburban sprawl that the project was supposed to steer away from.  The blog aspect of the ‘eventually iconic subject’ is a tricky one to pin down precisely, partly because there were so many diverging permutations of the idea at once in different contexts. Some of these permutations could be considered ‘classic’ in their own right, others ‘new’ in their construction and (especially in the 1990s and 2000s) ‘exceptional’ in their application to urban settings and publics. Still others, particularly in the West, seemed to be aping the Japanese cyberpunk novel, where the techno-utopian utopia is imagined to have been born. The ​Japanese cyberpunk novel is notable for its apocalyptic vision of a ‘sea of red, swollen and bloody carcasses’, along with its apocalyptic also-ran: Vernadsky, ‘The Red Garden’.  A</text>

The emergence of new technological modes of production and consumption were accompanied by a proliferation of new ideas of infrastructure, urbanism and urbanism, all designed to meet the needs of 'civil society' through the lens of techno-utopianism.  The blog coincided with the publication of two books of essays in which I argued for the need for a socially engaged, enfranchised and democratised imagination following the neoliberal revolution and the rise of ever larger government bureaucracies. I was both writing as a political-ideological statement and a call to arms as a working class citizen of the urbanised majority to defend the places that I described as the cradle of civilisation against what I saw as the encroachments of neoliberalism. The end result was a string of blog posts and two books that provided a foretaste of the aims of the project that would later be developed into The Resident, My Social Design, its exploration of the ways in which the local affects urban and social development in the UK, as well as abroad, and my own political-ideological reflections.  My initial interest in the project began when I came across an episode</text>

In a city with an annual population of over 400,000,000, the UK’s largest urban colony, Liverpool’s infrastructure is a massive, multi-billion-pound industry. Its revival is a cause célèbre in the city and internationally. Liverpool has become a global tourist destination and remains so to this day. 	The city’s infrastructure boom has put a spotlight on a project that has been quietly going on for years now, but little attention is being paid to its socio-political context or its role in fuelling the process. The renewed interest in the city comes as no surprise to urbanists and urbanists-in-general who’ve been studying the infrastructure of cities for years, and have a very good reason to be interested in how city infrastructure is made useful in the city’s future growth. The reason why cities are so valuable today is that they</text>

They are objects that enable us to understand how things are produced, organised and exchanged – things that help us make sense of the world around us, and the world around us in relation to each other. They are ‘places’ where ideas, images, sounds and other cultural artefacts are gathered, exchanged and used; places where ideas are planted and gathered in one continuous stream. They are ‘fields’ where living organisms – particularly plant and animal species – gather to live, communicate and evolve. They are ‘roots’ of a living system that helps create and emerge ‘from the ground up’. They are ‘levels’ – living systems that aid in the production of things – that allow ‘things’ to be produced, exchanged and brought into being. The concept of the ‘Internet’ is a living system that produces new ways in which we can grasp and process information and ideas.

They are objects that are both data (collectively, the things we call ‘the Internet’) and a production of ideas that proliferate with the dynamic force of an ever-expanding globalised and integrated economy. The collection of things we call the Internet is a global manifestation of a single thing – the thing itself. It is made up of ‘things’ that happen to be connected, and which in turn are made up of ‘things’ that happen to be online. In this particular sense, the collection of things we call the Internet is nothing less than a new technology, and its deployment is the very manifestation of a single phenomenon: the Internet. In that sense, it is both a technology and a phenomenon. It is the very definition of a new kind of infrastructure. It is a new kind of infrastructure that builds on the very fabric of what we call the Web. It is made up of the technologies of the new economy, and beyond that, is a</text>

They are objects that enable us to understand how things are produced, organised and exchanged – things that help us make sense of the world around us, and the world around us in relation to each other. They enable us to understand design in relation to urbanisation, migration and displacement. Anything and everything that can be conceptualised as ‘the Thing’ is produced and exchanged online. And ‘the Thing’ is everything that is ever produced and exchanged online. If you’re an artist, a designer, a researcher or a curator and you’re involved in creating or enhancing online art, you’re an online artist. This is a global phenomenon that has been going on now for over ten years. It’s very interesting that the name 'Annie Oakley Mills’ comes from an exhibition she was in, because she’d been working with the curator of the time, Jim Kwak, who invited her to be an artist in his book The Contemporary Condition. But she didn’t want to be an artist in that book; she wanted to be a writer and she didn’t want to be associated with an institution that was more</text>

They are objects that enable us to see how things connect to one another, and how these links arise and break down. They are objects that enable the taking and holding of action, ideas and ideas, ideas about life, about the world. They enable ‘institutional change’, and change the world. As such, they are a site of constant, transformative action – action that is neither static nor predetermined. They are objects of a given shape and function, of a given frequency and of a given content, yet of varying kinds and levels of organisation and power. And yet they are objects of very different sorts of organisation and power, in different situations and in radically different situations.

They are objects that enable us to understand how things are produced, organised and exchanged – things that help us make sense of the world around us, and the world around us in relation to each other. They are objects that communicate ideas and concepts. This last aspect is particularly significant. Cities build infrastructure and urban systems that enable the exchange of information, ideas and objects across a global scale. But these systems also facilitate the production and circulation of things – objects, behaviours, behaviours – that are neither cities nor concepts, but are nonetheless produced and circulate in an object-system that is conceptually‐identifiable with respect to time and space. Cities, whether urban nor regional, whether metropolitan nor regional, whether urban nor rural – play a pivotal role in the production and circulation of ideas, behaviours and objects across the globe. But they also ‘process’ these ideas, collect and analyse them, and make them visible in a shared domain of influence.’ This last aspect is particularly significant. It enables the site to capture, analyse and render spatial and temporal characteristics of a particularised globalised world through features of the site that are morphologically localized to the specific location of the site, and that draw</text>

They enable us to understand how new media are constructed, how expertise and connections reshape how expertise is generated and distributed. And they enable us to imagine new ways of organising ourselves and the world around us. This last aspect is perhaps the most significant and yet under-studied. It allows us to imagine new worlds and engage with old ways of organising ourselves and the world. It allows us to bring expertise and skills previously reserved for professionals into the mix. These may involve small or large-scale collaborations, be they with academics, journalists, urbanists, designers or others. This interaction between professionals and the public is expected to generate tremendous new knowledge and solutions. It may well radicalise existing ideas and practices, as new professions may be created or recreated. It may well make old problems insoluble.

They are ‘things-in-themselves’. But more than that, they are ‘things that can’t’ – things that are produced through human processes but are nevertheless not things or persons or even things in themselves. For example, the collection of things produced by the activities of urban planners and urban artists corresponds to a person or persons but is in fact an evolving assemblage of diverse things – a collection of objects that can only be described as urban. The collection of things produced by the activities of rural planners and rural artists corresponds to a person or persons but is in fact an evolving assemblage of objects that can be described as rural. And so on. The point is that urban planners and urban artists exert a modicum of influence over the objects that are produced and the meanings that people attach to them. And given the right set of circumstances, I believe that urban and regional planners could also work with artists to produce new urban developments through direct action and collaborative</text>

Yet to understand and to embrace such objects as living, breathing entities is to understand how they are produced and reproduced – how they are connected and how they engage with and generate knowledge. It is to grasp the systems that enable, engineer and produce them but to also act as a site of political, economic and social transformation. It is to understand how culture and social change can and do play a role in shifting and creating new ways of organising the world.  What is the relationship between digital mapping and social change? Where does the mapping take place? Who has the mapping rights? What is the relation between culture and social change? What are the forms of organisation that enable and generate cultural change?

This kind of record-making is part of what people call ‘the biennial condition’. The other kind of condition is what Richard Florida would call ‘postmodern’ – postindustrial, commercial and postindustrial society. He defined the former as ‘a state of affairs in which contemporary art is more and more valued, and contemporary art more and more confined; the latter condition is a condition of value itself’.[10] Florida pointed to the increasingly urgent economic need for ‘high-end art’, which could be made ​​domestically competitive and international’, and the advent of multidisciplinary art-producing institutions as the consummation of this transition.

It is possible that Nigerian internet users spend much of their internet time engaged in illicit activities, and the spread of HIV/AIDS may have contributed to this. It is also possible that the adoption of self-healing chips – which automatically repair damage – may have contributed to this.

A 2011 Pew Research Center survey found that majorities of Muslims in seven Muslim-majority countries said they had never participated in an election, and a similar share (70%) said they had never participated in a public debate.

The point of departure for the article, then, was twofold: on the one hand, the inescapable fact of living in a city; and, on the other, the need to intervene where, as in the case of a microaggression, the very act of presence interferes with the very notion of social belonging. The microaggression is a concept that has been developing at an accelerating rate over the past twenty years, and although it is often misconstrued, its nature as a multi-faceted and multi-generational process has been elucidated over decades of research on several continents. 	In the article, the authors make several claims and speculations, most of which revolve around the idea of social belonging. The first and most obvious one is that cities, although they may present</text>

Though the microaggressions discussed in this publication may impact those who inhabit a particular neighbourhood or community, they also call into question the very notion of whose voices are meant to be heard. If a community of residents in the city of Toronto is to have a meaningful impact on the city’s future, the community must come to terms with the fact that the voices of large swaths of its population are excluded from the political, economic and cultural system that creates or sustains the city. 	The argument that this publication is attempting to support falls far short of proposing a dialogue, but it is an assertion of fact. That claim is untenable on its face. What this publication has in common with other forms of citizen journalism is the ability to publish facts, analysis and criticism that can otherwise be unavailable or unfulfilling.  	The ability of</text>

But what does it mean to inflate? That is, to create artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are as intelligent as possible but also that exhibit traits such as emotions, consciousness, and thought patterns that are indistinguishable from those of a human being? If AI can achieve this, what does that make us? If AI can exhibit traits that distinguish it from a human being, then what does that make us?

OUTLINESFor more than twenty years, the UK and US computerized bulletin boards (BBSs) of the 1980s were the dominant online resource for '80s pop culture, providing a sustained online presence across platforms. The popularity of such sites like Computer Games 'n' Stuff, and the massive downloads they generated, were fueled by the promise of a blogosphere that reflected the zeitgeist of the decade in lyrical essays and parables. The parallel histories that emerged online, about the politics of computer systems, and popular culture in the decade ahead, were characterised by a kind of cyber-utopianism. ‘Computer games are like magic’, wrote the pop singer Cyndi Lauper in 1984, and ‘You’re either with us or against us’, a line that many in that decade would echo.

The answer to that may be found in a book or in the magazine that came with the internet in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and especially in the pages that followed the headlines: the ‘High Performance Computing’ journal. There, the early computer scientists tried to define the parameters of AI that could be applied to real-world problems. In computing, this meant not only the algorithms that underlie computers, but also the structures that facilitate this application of algorithms: what can computer software do, and how?  A computer program, by its own nature, is limited in what it can do. If these parameters are not defined explicitly, or do not make sense within the parameters of the program, then the computer cannot perform its tasks effectively. As a result of this kind of limited application of AI, the computer became ever more complex and error-prone, and AI more difficult to assess. In a 1984 essay,  	opined, ‘The Computer Is Not a Machine’, Paul Graham explored this effect in greater depth. Computer programs</text>

The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds, led by Giacomo Becchetti, was established in Milan in 1887. Becchetti was a Sicilian mystic and astronomer, who in 1888 established a secret society – the Order of the Golden Dawn – dedicated to the promotion and diffusion of Greek and Roman philosophy throughout the ‘civilised world’. Within months of its founding, the Society was established in Rome and soon began publishing its first issue of its Greek and Roman Philosophy monthly, which was published simultaneously in Milan and Vienna. Becchetti died in 1894, but his ideas are still considered a classic, if paranoid, period. The Black Hundreds returned to Milan in 1899, and Becca Stanhope, now a curator at the Tate Modern, brought Becchetti’s ideas to life through her position as assistant to the Curator of Mirandese at the British Museum. Becchetti’s ideas were copied and pasted into the astronomical theme of the new Centennial Exposition, which opened in Rome in May 1900.

The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds, led by Giacomo Becchetti, was established in Milan in 1887. Becchetti was a Sicilian mystic and astronomer, who also taught at the Montini Institute in Paris and at the Royal Astronomical Society in London. His ideas about the magic of the stars and the occult use of science were absorbed into the academy’s curriculum.Becchetti’s ideas about the transcendent are captured in a magical phrase that he wrote down – a kind of shorthand database – and which still serves as the academy’s official document of magic:The Universal Register [or Index] … contains the secret of immortality – an idea which no human being on this earth possesses.’[7]The academy, then, was developing its own far more elemental and mythic conception of the future – in the form of gods and monsters – that could be used to fight against nature rather than for it. Becchetti’s work is a call to action that draws us from the base human tendency towards the technological to the transcendent – ideas that are not inherently wrong but that are nonetheless deeply impressionable by the</text>

Becchetti was a Sicilian mystic and astronomer, who also happened to be the brother of Giacomo Matteotti, one of the inventors of the Tesla coil and other early electrical devices. Becchetti was a prolific writer and promoter of psychic abilities, and his writings are full of references to Native American origins and the ‘black magic’ of Native peoples. The Rosicrucians were a mystical and mysterious order of mystics dedicated to the transmutation of metals and elements into other magical substances. They had their headquarters in San Francisco, but at the end of the nineteenth century they established a new post in Milan, where they lived out their last years. Becchetti was a prolific writer himself, and his ideas were regularly refined and expanded by his fellow travellers – including Giacomo Matteotti, Paolo Verorder and others. He died in 1887, and Matteotti translated Becchetti’s work into Italian and into the Rosicrucians canon. The Rosicrucians were a very different</text>

The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds, led by Giacomo Becchetti, was established in Milan in 1887. Becchetti was a Sicilian mystic and astronomer, who also happened to be the brother of Giacomo Lambrecht, a well-known Italian astronomer and astronomer from Turin. The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds was established in Milan in 1889 under the name ‘Lazaretto Rosary’. A collection of sacred texts detailing the rituals of the Rosary were also compiled under the name ‘Rosary’.[9]By the turn of the century, astrology was widely understood to be a  	glimmer of insight into the future, and the ability to foretell one’s own demise. The Black Hundreds were recruited by Francis Bacon Salerno, a Roman Catholic priest and astronomer, known as ‘Samson Rex’, who was exploiting the ignorance of the common people in order to fight the Hereford Caliphate. Salerno was assisted by a network of Jewish artists, writers and collectors, including Giacomo De’Elia, Leonardo Vecchione and Oscar Spard</text>

The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds, led by Giacomo Becchetti, was established in Milan in 1887. Becchetti was a Sicilian mystic and astronomer, who also had a strong Italian nationalist bent. He set up shop in Milan as a specialist brothel for Italian and Russian prostitutes, and the Italian branch of the Black Hundreds joined him there. The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds also included a number of artists, writers and sculptors. In 1893, Becchetti established what became known as the Becca Gallery, where Italian and Russian artists and intellectuals gathered to discuss their national histories, cultures and languages, and to exchange political, spiritual and cultural concepts. Becchetti’s interest in esoteric and magical subjects was also informed by his love of music and the occult. In his collection of works entitled The Collected Poems of Giacomo Becchetti (1867–1972), Becchetti recorded his experiences in the Becca Gallery that year, including the time an extraterrestrial abducted his girlfriend, when he thought she was going to Mars, and the time an evil wizard took over a town in Central America.

The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds, led by Giacomo Becchetti, was established in Milan in 1887. Becchetti was a Sicilian mystic and astronomer, who also founded the now defunct Order of the Golden Dawn. Becchetti’s occult and magical thinking was in many ways similar to that of Freemasonry, although the Black Hundreds were not Freemasons themselves. Becchetti’s ideas about the magical and the occult were far more primitive, and he held no formal formal training in either ancient or modern magic. Becchetti was also a mathematician, and his work often used the form of a proof, or a set of principles, to prove or disprove a claim or argument. His ideas were primitive, but he had the advantage of working-class origins: his family was Italian. His father was a textile manufacturer, and his mother was a housewife. Both parents worked long hours, and the Black Hundreds could afford to occasionally indulge in luxury. The Black Hundreds also indulged in recreational boorishness, including gambling and drinking.

The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds, led by Giacomo Becchetti, was established in Milan in 1887. Becchetti was a Sicilian mystic and astronomer, who in 1887 founded the Order of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn is a neo-pagan organisation with a distinctly Gnostic orientation to the universe. Its tenets include the transmutation of metals into silver, the use of oil and natural resources, and the use of astrology. Becchetti was a visionary, and his ideas about the possible uses of magic and astronomy were often combined with religious belief. The Black Hundreds were initially active in Milan and other Italian cities, but their efforts were hampered by the institutionalised religion they were trying to impose on the local population. In the early 1900s, Becchetti established another branch in Milan, the Order of the Golden Dawn. This was organised under the auspices of the Museo del Fiore di Torre, and its activities were also hampered by the institutionalised religion. Nevertheless, the two branches continued to collaborate and act as a unit, sharing resources and working independently. In 1910, Giacomo Becchetti established the Golden Dawn</text>

The Italian branch of the Black Hundreds, led by Giacomo Becchetti, was established in Milan in 1887. Becchetti was a Sicilian mystic and astronomer, who also taught anatomy and geography. His ideas about the physical world were influenced by Hindu mythology and Hindu philosophy. He believed that astrology was an intrusion into natural philosophy, and that the Black Hundreds should adopt a form of astral magic supported by astrology. Becchetti hoped that the physical manifestations of magic could be used as a pretext for establishing a magical system of their own in the world.The Black Hundreds adopted Becchetti’s ideas and carried out a series of experiments in their neighbourhood – in the suburb of Candelera – in an attempt to create what Becchetti described as a `common sphere’. They created a magical circle with beads and clay figures, and a variety of objects, including a clay statue of a bull, a tortoise shell and a brass key, that served as concentric circles. They also used coloured stones and flat pieces of wood as �blocks’ – a way to segregate the experimental subjects, who would devise and implement magic according</text>

Astrologers in Italy were not the only ones to harbour doubts about the veracity of these proposals. In 1889, Giacomo Maria Rava, a Turin-based astronomer, astronomer and Freemason, articulated his scepticism in a letter to the editor of La Repubblica. Rava was particularly critical of the work of Giuliano De’Elia, who he claimed had `devoted his life to the study of celestial bodies’. In a letter to the editor, Rava accuses De’Elia of inventing astronomical data to justify racial discrimination against the ‘Romano-Sardinian Romano-Thurano’s (a people who live in Northern Italy) ‘Ravais’ people. In a separate letter, Rava calls the Romano-Sardinian astronomer ‘Bartolomeo Auguste’Sforza’, an accusation</text>

He was twenty-seven when he died, and his scientific findings were lost in a purge carried out by military police in Italy in 18 September 1871.Becchetti’s Astro-systems research and mystic pursuits were not limited to the confines of Italy. His other research interests included Native American languages and mythology, Egyptian mythology and religion, and the use of astrolabe and surveying instruments in the construction of pyramids and cathedrals. Becchetti also wrote poetry and sketches, and was a painter. His collection of woodcut designs, ‘Egyptian Portraits’ shows scenes from the interior of the mysterious Egyptian pyramids and cathedrals, and the exterior of the modern-day United States Capitol.

By this reckoning, the Cold War was fought between systems of domination that were essentially deterministic, based on the assumption that the world would inevitably follow the logic of the ­heroic’ cause (i.e. progress and progress of civilization), and a set of persistent ideological and geopolitical transgressions (i.e. global communism).3  The RAND Corporation’s Cold War-type research projects were designed to see how the military might be employed to subvert and subvert democratic governments in order to establish a dystopian society where humans reside in exotic and precarious ‘permanent motion’ along a fictional ‘imaginary frontiers’ – the lines between now and a future where humans once again inhabit the planet.4  This imaginary frontiers includes, in addition to the borders of the fictional imaginary nation, the imaginary space between human beings and non-human entities, and the imaginary immobility of objects or 'permanent motion’ – the line between physical and virtual.5  For more on this notion of ‘permanent motion’ see  Richard Rorty,  	Curtis Wainwright &amp; Coogan,  </text>

By this reckoning, the Cold War was fought between systems of domination that were essentially deterministic, based on the assumption that the world would inevitably follow the logic of the ­heroic’ cause (i.e., the path of least resistance), and the world as a complex web of interacting agents that required a political will beyond the immediate effects of any particular action. In other words, the Cold War was fought between systems that could be easily disposed of in a single historical event. 	Similarly, AI is being developed in response to the perceived threat from AI, using some of the same conceptual territory as in the Cold War. There is a palpable sense of impending doom regarding the potential impact of AI on society, but there is also a sense of hopeful contingency regarding the actions of humanity in the face of this threat. 	As an example of the latter, consider the work being done with regards to the elderly and the elderly's care. There is a real sense of this work being done in the name of science, but there is also a sense of this being done in the name of religion.

By this reckoning, the Cold War was fought between systems of domination that were essentially deterministic, based on the assumption that the world would inevitably follow the logic of the ­heroic’ cause (i.e. the ­heroic’ task force’s mission statement), and geopolitically decentralized, depending on the geopolitical position of the participants at the time.3  For more on the geopolitics of AI and machine learning, see my Constructing a Future that Masks: Towards a Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning   published by New Harbinger Press.4  To some extent, this is still the case: the AI that underpins much of what we do online is still being trained on massive amounts of data, and as new technologies emerge that mimic the logic of historical empires, the need for massive data storage becomes critical. But as the number of users of online services doubles, and AI becomes more pervasive in online services, the need for data becomes even more critical.

There will never again be any heroic “struggles” between different worlds, but only multiverses of consistent historical patterns of interaction and encounters.’3 This historical-critical reflection on the end of the Cold War comes as a result of a project that Computer Games &amp; Toolkits, an ongoing, ever-shifting collection of user-submitted work, projects and observations, created and maintains through its website. Computer Games &amp; Toolkits makes the distinction between historical and digital ‘theoretical modelling’ in its work. Schelling explains: ‘In the age of the Internet and social</text>

By this reckoning, the Cold War was fought between systems of domination that were essentially deterministic, based on the assumption that the world would inevitably follow the logic of the ­heroic’ cause (i.e. progress, technological innovation and the rule of law).  	Within the context of the Cold War, ‘heroic’ projects like those undertaken by RAND Corporation and its members are typically depicted as heroic acts of individualised creative thinking, or as the act of a small cadre of skilled professionals performing unimaginably complex tasks that neither the ­author nor the public understands how to do so. 	Such is the dynamic today. 	However, the Cold War ended almost as soon as it began, and geopolitical notions of realism are no longer central elements in the public or political imagination. 	What is now considered heroic in the public imagination is actually entrenching geopolitical notions of globalism and globalisation. As geopolitical theorist Nick Montfort has pointed out, the global economy no longer represents a monolithic whole, but is instead a dynamic constellation of interacting elements that can be characterised by a number of different kinds of global systems.4 This is fundamentally changing the character of</text>

By this reckoning, the Cold War was fought between systems of domination that were essentially deterministic, based on the assumption that the world would inevitably follow the logic of the ­heroic’ cause (i.e. capitalist globalisation), and a political system that was more capable of organising matter and giving rise to intelligent systems capable of imagining possibilities other than those offered by the prevailing order. Thus, the Cold War was seen by many in the West as an inevitable process of capitalist globalisation – an outcome that could not be denied.3  Drawing its inspiration from RAND, the Cold War is an inherently ideological project that seeks to identify and discredit those perceived to be outside the prevailing order – a task that is seen by the state as necessary to achieve an ideological outcome. As such, the Cold War is seen not only as a conflict fought between different systems of domination, but also as a conflict between different ideological camps. Such ideological framing makes it easier to understand technological innovation and revolutionary change, but it also means that ideological processes are more easily interrupted and that revolutionary change is stymied by existing power structures. By identifying and demonising those outside the prevailing order, the Cold War effectively circumvents</text>

By this reckoning, the Cold War was fought between systems of domination that were essentially deterministic, based on the assumption that the world would inevitably follow the logic of the ­heroic’ cause (i.e., the path of least resistance), and geopolitically innovative, situated through the intervention of the state in the public arena.3  In other words, the Cold War was won not through actual conflicts between states but through the geopolitical calculation that followed statecraft.  The advent of computerised conflict resolution systems such as those developed by RAND Corporation marks a new kind of geopolitical maneuver in the public arena – one that is more adept at anticipating and anticipating with precision the outcomes of political and other complex scenarios, so as to create favorable conditions for the development of aggressive political strategies.4  This kind of geopolitical thinking is characteristic of what James Howard Kunstler and Roy Baumeister call ‘the era of ambiguity’.5 Kuntzel and Baumeister identify several historical periods that witnessed a dramatic increase in the sophistication of military hardware and in particular in the provision of cyber defence.

In the words of Gregory Ulmer, ‘From the Pipeline to the Suburbs: Oil and the Architecture of Postindustrial Society’,3 the first hydrocarbons appeared on the global market following the Second World War.4  By the turn of the century, large refineries dotted the globe fuelling the world economy. In what was seen as a response to the crisis of resource scarcity – a crisis that capitalism could not solve – governments embarked on ambitious programmes to expand infrastructure across the board, fuelling the system with ever more energy-intensive machinery and processes. 	In these years, organizational forms other than oil and gas corporations – those are the battlefields of the oil crunch.

The Cold War was fought over two issues: the nature of heroism and national salvation, and the nature of technological revolution.  	The Cold War ended with the adoption of the post-invasion rhetoric of universal values and collective action, but its impact has never fully healed. Despite the technological advances of the post-Cold War era, the nature of heroism and of the salvos of individual salvation that it enabled remains largely undefined. We don’t know what a ‘hero’ is. As a cultural concept, we don’t know what a ‘savior’ is. We don’t know what a ‘tradition’ is. We don’t know what a ‘countdown’ is. We don’t know what a ‘night’ is. We don’t know</text>

Nevertheless, the shift from a material economy to an economy based on non-metallic elements is substantial, and is predicted to result in dramatic changes in the planet’s climate. These changes are also predicted to affect not only people, but also animals, plants and intelligent and semi-intelligent human activity. In addition to altering the climate, the processes involved in creating artificial sun may have other negative environmental impacts. A 2010 study led by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, BrightFuture, suggested that the development of self-sustaining energy would reduce pollution levels by 80 percent compared to present conditions. These predictions have been repeatedly updated, and it is now generally accepted that the only way to ensure that the planet remains habitable is for all humanity to become scientists, technicians, and artistsically minded citizens of a digital planetary citizenry.

In the west, we are currently experiencing what Richard Florida calls ‘the Coming Heatwave’, which is predicted to triple in intensity from today to 50 percent greater in precipitation than in 1951. If predictions are correct, this will triple the area covered by grasslands, forested areas and shrublands – areas that are expected to double in area in the coming decades. If the projections are realized, ‘potential climate impacts could be greater than those of the Montreal Protocol, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki Resolutions, and the Paris Agreement’. Regardless of the precise size of the zones, the economic models we have developed to assess the probable effects of climate change on the world we inhabit now all assume that we are headed for a heatwave. These economic models do not take into account the social and political changes that may be required to alter the trajectory of global warming, and many of them also do not take into account the role that art</text>

Nevertheless, the shift from a material economy to one based on self-repairing organisms runs counter to the prevailing assumption of a material commonwealth. As a result of these critical questions, in 2015 the International Academy of Arts, Venice, established an Outer Planetary Division, dedicated to the exploration and development of Outer Planetary Knowledge. The mission of the O.P.K.K.K. is to seek technologies that can ‘fix' the sun – that is, nurture and evolve into new forms of existence – while minimizing ecological damage. Solar systems form part of a multi-tiered economic system that depends on the technological know-how of all elements on a planetary scale. Any disruption to the system is understood as detrimental to all of the elements, and may well result in their extinction.

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the military, which was to expand the war on terrorism. Instead, they reported that a number of US senators had introduced a resolution formally naming 9/11 as a terrorist attack.9  This resolution did not come as a surprise to those who had been paying attention to the news. As news outlets proliferated in the military-industrial complex, and as the media became more and more privatized, the need for the media to report the news became ever greater. 	So while 9/11 became the pretext for a much broader war on terror, the true objective of the war on terror was itself continually questioned. And while in the 1980s and 1990s the media initially claimed to be investigating real terror attacks (such as the Oklahoma City bombing), they soon came to understand that the true motives of the reactionary reaction to the crisis of the capitalist society were often quite different. The true aim of the media in reporting the news was always to amplify what was already there – in the form of</text>

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the Department of Defense. 	But we also saw that the anthrax story is still relevant because, as we all know, 9/11 happened. Now we see that the anthrax letters were part of a larger plot to attack US interests in the Middle East. We also saw that the Pentagon had been preparing for an attack for some time before the anthrax arrived, and that the anthrax arrived late – perhaps because it was buried in unclassified paperwork – but makes the US government look inept and unprofessional. The fact that the anthrax arrived at all – and that all the infrastructure for an attack was there – underscores the illegitimacy of the war on terror. As we all know, the anthrax arrived first. The question is whether the anthrax problem, and the additional questions it raises, will still be an issue. 	What is at Stake in the Alleged Link Between Anthrax and 9/11?

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the military – although they might now do so if the attacks happen. 	The anthrax letters are still with us, and when we start seeing headlines about anthrax, we see that it is still a problem. Our anthrax problem does not come from the anthrax itself, but from the anthrax that came with it. And the anthrax that came with it still poses a risk to those with whom it comes into contact, because of its mutagenic properties. 	These mutagenic properties make it difficult to treat, and especially to diagnose, but also makes it difficult to deal with. We saw that the initial diagnosis of anthrax was also a mistake. The mutagenic properties of anthrax cause people to make unsound decisions that can lead to illness and death; for example, people with weakened immune systems, or those with conditions that can be diagnosed as linked to terrorism. People also tend to overreact to symptoms that are not caused by the disease. We saw</text>

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the Department of Homeland Security, which is still building the war chest to wage the war on terror after 9/11. If the anthrax letters are indeed real, and they do in fact represent a threat to the national security of the US, they will remain so no matter what. 	This brings us to the present, and the presentism that we inhabit. We inhabit the present in such a way that it becomes possible to imagine a different future, but it is also possible to forget about the future and live in the present (or, as with  	the  	virtual private network, to become cogs in a machine). This is what we mean when we speak of the immediacy of the encounter with media, or the perception of media as actual encounters rather than representations. And this is what we mean when we speak of the ephemerality of images. 	We take the image of the Finsbury Park mosque and its custodian, as well as of</text>

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the Pentagon. We saw that the anthrax letters were still circulating when the attacks occurred; they were still being addressed to members of Congress and the media when the towers fell, but they were never reported in the New York Times or in the local papers; and they are still being addressed to the public when the attacks are still unreported. 	So what can the biennial do to address this persistent gap in the media and political systems that produce, or create, such stories? We heard some biennials do this already, by creating events around their projects (like the 10th Biennial of Los Angeles or the 14th Architecture Biennale in Berlin) or their curatorial appointments (like the 15th Chicago Architecture Biennale). But as we saw, this only addressed the surface of the problem. We also heard that there are other ways to engage the media and build coalitions: by sponsoring an arts organisation or a community organisation and</text>

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the B-52, which was then diverted by the White House to a war on Iraq. The anthrax letters were still there when the second Gulf war began, and they continue to be there to this day. The inability to report the response to these threats effectively affects the national discourse, because it is believed that the anthrax threat might have been exaggerated. If the anthrax threat was taken seriously, we might now be discussing possible reconstitution of the structures of 9/11. 	But as we saw, the anthrax threat was far more manageable than we gave it credit for. Here, the biennial is complicit in the same problem that it is trying to solve. If 9/11 were located in Los Angeles or New York, or in the financial district of San Francisco, the threat to biennials from such locations would be more concrete. But as it is, we are far more likely to be living in parallel universes where the threat to us from such locations is equally</text>

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or from the Department of Homeland Security. 	In the anthrax story, the organised crime element is absent; the terrorists are identified, but the government and security agencies do not exist any more. In the digital story, the threat is identified, but the public do not have to take action because the technology is so advanced that action is taken quickly enough that the story does not matter anymore.   	But in the end, what is most significant about these stories is that they allow us to imagine alternative futures. In the case of 9/11, this alternative future is one in which technology is omnipotent, and all threats are taken seriously. In the work of imagining alternative futures, we follow the fragmented elements of the story, but we also draw upon the collective knowledge of humanity in order to offer solutions. 	In a recent poll of 1,200 people conducted for the documentary  	Unfixing America (2013), over one-third (35%) of respondents said that they</text>

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the Pentagon. 	Similarly, when we talk about the war on terror, we tend to conflate two contradictory things: the threat posed by al-Shabaab in Somalia and the anthrax attacks. But the truth is that al-Shabaab are not al-Shabaab – they were formed in 1991 by the merger of several different militant Islamist groups, and although they have claimed responsibility for attacks in the past, they have largely refrained from escalating their conflicts outside Somalia. 	So while 9/11 may have been a turning point in the war on terror, it is also the beginning of the end for the war on terror. The endgame for the war on terror may be decided by what is depicted as the endgame: in reality, there is no endgame, since the nature of the beast is such that once you defeat it, you must then begin a new round of battles. But since the beginning of the war on terror, there has been a constant</text>

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the military – which is why the anthrax letters are still with us. Anthrax was an exaggeration, but the point is that the anthrax crisis did not become an illustration of the crisis. Instead, the crisis became a metaphor for the crisis. 	The fact that the anthrax crisis became an illustrative device for the crisis is a symptom of a larger problem, which is that the crisis became understood as an inevitable by-product of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The wars generated huge numbers of refugees and migrants, who then had to be accommodated in the metropole, which was a massive increase in the space available to police and military. This increase in space meant that there was less and less of a need for roads and rail, which then caused congestion and gridlock, which then created the problem that caused the crises in the first place. So while the first anthrax letters were sent via post to the newspaper to be picked up by reporters, the spread of technology as</text>

The newspapers reported on the anthrax, but they did not report the response from the White House or the Pentagon, which was to go to war. 	Instead, the New York Times and other newspapers reported on the invasion of Afghanistan and the ensuing violence. It is this delay in reporting on the violence that allows the powerful to dominate the narrative of the conflict. 	Such is the narrative of war. But what if the war is no longer about the supremacy of capital as such but rather the domination of labour? What kind of transformation could such a narrative enable? 	In an October 2013 symposium on the life and work of Art and Architecture critic Peter Schjeldahl addressed the question of urbanisation and the urban crisis. 	Schjeldahl argued that Schiller’s 'eternal cycle' of the city – the cycle ‘following the same general path, full of repetitions, until at length a point ‘when the very path itself, which draws us inexorably towards disaster, ends up in a ruin’ –'is here re</text>

It has become increasingly evident that the social, ecological and even political costs of runaway infrastructure are very different from the costs of de-industrialisation and the subsequent depletion of the planet. The social impacts of de-industrialisation are very different, and yet the politics of de-industrialisation is often misrepresented or disregarded. In this case, the politics of access is often misrepresented as well. In this context, the politics of de-industrialisation is often misrepresented as access to energy, when in fact the opposite is true.

Finally, there is the politics of repurposing. This is the politics of infrastructure displacement, which is at the centre of any ecocidal ideology. It has become increasingly evident that the social, ecological and even political costs of runaway infrastructure are very different from the costs of natural resource depletion. In the former case, the social and political fragility of the planet is clearly evident; in the latter, the social construction of a planetary infrastructure is under way. This shift in the political economy of infrastructure is a global process, with nation-states making major inroads towards the integration of infrastructure on a global scale. It is to a large extent a product of their own internal creative pressures. Here, too, we can move from the location of the infrastructural boom (high performing transport corridors in Europe and the US) to that of the ecological crisis (high performing transport networks in China and India). The former is characterised by the displacement of the non-road user – the landscape – while the latter is characterised by the re-constituting of the urban – the human – in the wake of a dense, mobile and fuel-efficient growth of megacities. As megacities proliferate and expand, their capacity to inf</text>

Finally, there is the politics of repurposing. This is the politics of infrastructure displacement, which is at the centre of any ecocidal ideology. It has become increasingly evident that the social, ecological and even political costs of runaway infrastructure are very different from the costs of constructing alternative, safer and more sustainable modes of travel. Aims such as these have become the subjects of a capitalist logic of industrialisation and progress. Some have become so political that they have attracted international monitoring and enforcement. 	However, the proliferation of transnational infrastructure has pushed back the boundaries of this global valuation system against which the social and ecological costs of infrastructure were previously placed. The social and political values that once surrounded the construction of infrastructure are now the responsibility of national governments and municipal councils. If these boundaries are not respected, or fail to adapt to the changing political and social conditions that are emerging, the social and ecological costs could become a source of social and political conflict. At present, this is the case in many parts of the world, but especially in the developing world where the crisis of infrastructure is particularly acute. Governments in many parts of the world are deeply divided about the need to rein in runaway growth, but little is done to control or even to monitor growth</text>

A particular kind of ecological ethics demands that we care for the biosphere in all its infrastructures, both large and small, both in terms of the spatial quantity and the content of such infrastructures – in other words, we must choose between the two.

Aims such as these are what underlie the motives of policy-makers and the design of infrastructure [5] . 	There is a limit to how far infrastructure can be repurposed. At some point the social, ecological and even geopolitical effects of infrastructure construction become unmanageable, and the politics of access to new infrastructure becomes exactly what Monnet calls ‘a kind of political terrain correction’. [6] 	However, there is another, perhaps more fundamental, aspect to Monnet’s notion of infrastructure that is equally relevant in our age of massive infrastructure projects: the politics of access to knowledge. It is this politics of access to knowledge, which is fundamentally understood by the ability to access information, whether that ability is knowledge of the physical world or the power of symbolic information. It is this ability to access information across borders that is at the root of the infrastructural complex. 	[7] </text>

This is particularly evident in the areas of surveillance and counter-surveillance, where publics have greater access to data and are thus more able to question or disrupt surveillance.

Finally, there is the politics of repurposing. This is the politics of infrastructure displacement, which is at the centre of any ecocidal ideology. It has become increasingly evident that the social, ecological and even political costs of runaway infrastructure are very different from the costs of decarbonisation. A politics of infrastructure displacement cannot be the politics of infinite growth, but must rely on the social and political systems that are built on top of finite resources. 	Finally, there is the politics of money. This is the politics of infrastructure petro-plentitude, which is to say, the politics of ever-increasing flows of infrastructure funding and materials – materials for the infrastructure that were not made in the image of humans but are nevertheless the direct products of human labour. The sheer volume and complexity of the global information economy has given rise to a class of professionals called Infrastructure Economies, whose primary job is to collate and weave this data together to form ever larger and more complex picture frames. These frames tell a story, weave interconnected webs, and ultimately render it comprehensible by means of abstractions such as numbers, addresses, shapes and colours. 	[5] 	[6] 	[7] 	[8</text>

It has become increasingly evident that the social, ecological and even political costs of runaway infrastructure are very different from the costs of natural resource depletion – in the former case, the very concept is suspect, since the social and political costs would render any economic theory inimical and corrupting, while the latter are costs that would render capitalism in serious jeopardy. 	In the framework of ecocidal capitalism, the politics of infrastructure and mobility then functions as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the politics of infrastructure encourages and even incentivises massive infrastructure investment through tax breaks and other inducements, while at the same time it abuses this wealth in ways that are difficult to define and question. Rapid transit, subways, malls, and high-speed Internet access then become luxuries enjoyed by a privileged few at the expense of everyone else. On the other hand, the politics of accessors, trackers, and filters ultimately become contractualized and privatized, and become what Murray Bookchin would call ‘capitalist relations’ [5] – functions that are divorced from any notion of</text>

Aims such as these have, as a consequence, become part of the discourse of infrastructure construction. 	The question of political intent or just plain evil has become a more salient challenge in the wake of runaway industrialisation. The proliferation of transnational corporations, the financialisation of infrastructure, the expansion of post-mining infrastructure [5] and the subsequent expansion of post-mining infrastructure [6] have all but ruled out the possibility that politics could be a factor in the design and implementation of infrastructure. The proliferation of infrastructure has come as a consequence of competitive market forces, but it is now being promoted by the adoption of new technologies that make it easier and cheaper to plug into infrastructure than ever before. This has profound effects on access to water, food and energy, but it has also major effects on employment and wages. 	The proliferation of transnational corporations has led to a multiplicity of localised but connected fiefdoms, many of which are</text>

The politics of access has become more crucial in the globalised capitalist mode of accumulation. If the logic of globalisation is ecological in character, but also global in its impact, then the politics of access must be international in character. 	In an attempt to contextualise the emergence of counter-narrative through which technology is understood, this exhibition sought to reconcile the technological and the political in the service of a common good – the environment. It was seen as essential for the functioning of the future society to be accessible to all, and to that end geo-linguistic curating was invented. 	Events such as the  	MIT Media Lab conference and the MIT Technology Review invited artists to create works that addressed the nexus of ideas, machines, and the social in an attempt to make sense of ever-more pervasive technological change. The negation of value is seen as a necessary condition of the future sociality. All conceptual</text>

The proliferation of social media and the fluid dynamics of change are the modes in which art as a social process is most vulnerable to the power of representation and commodification.

But as we have seen, this power dynamic is complex and uneven, and it is difficult to predict which images and videos will be powerful or which projects will emerge.

Art as a social process, however, requires critical thinking and action. The proliferation of social media and the fluid dynamics of change are the modes in which art as a social process is most vulnerable to the power of representation. Critical thinking about art and its capacity for massive social impact is needed. The more we embrace and embrace learnable forms of the medium, the more we empower artists to take control of their creative futures.   	The challenge for all of us in the art world is to develop more nuanced and adaptable forms of criticism of the ways in which we engage with art and creative practices. We need to develop strategies to engage and craft with artists who are already artists, and to create more dynamic, responsive and interesting work that is less bound to a particular aesthetic or point of view. For instance, critical thinking about the ways in which art is produced and consumed today is needed in order to create creative contexts and to question the value of art being produced today. 	In an ideal world, critics, artists and artists’ organisations would collaborate across a wide range of subject areas to produce and share knowledge across a shared field, adopting evidence-based and data-driven approaches to analysis.</text>

The proliferation of social media and the fluid dynamics of change are the modes in which art as a social process is most vulnerable to the power of representation and commodification.

Art as a social process, however, requires critical thinking and action. The proliferation of social media and the fluid dynamics of change are the modes in which art as a social process is most vulnerable to the power of representation. However, despite this increasing use of mediums to disseminate knowledge, to be found in almost every day life, there remains a marked and growing divide between those with access to the knowledge and those who do not. This is largely due to the fact that in the age of the social network and the instantaneous social encounter, it is extremely difficult to disengage oneself from the wisdom that is being gleaned by social media. In the modern era of infinite sources of knowledge, the art of social interaction and collaborative problem-solving are the skills necessary for a robust and even critical imagination. But this is not merely an aesthetic or conceptual challenge. It is a behaviour of the user in relation to the knowledge that is being offered. If the user chooses to ignore the advice of an artist or other stakeholders in the project, or in the case of a non-technical professional, the project does not advance because the user does not have the critical thinking skills to distinguish good from bad advice.

Art as a social process, however, requires critical thinking and action. The proliferation of social media and the fluid dynamics of change are the modes in which art as a social process is most vulnerable to the power of representation. Therefore, the artist and the audience need to be able to recognise when the narrative they are experiencing is being directed by and for powerful actors. Therefore, the creative practices and art forms that are affected by the proliferation of social media need to be constantly (re)imagined in order to survive. 	Although critical thinking and creative action is imperative for art to persist in the present, it is equally imperative that we also confront and address the current and future of our art’s social context and its relationship to the present and future. Consequently, art as a social process needs to produce and engage with material and immaterial resources in an ongoing flow, but it is imperative that this ongoing flow be undertaken with critical intent, action and reflection. This ongoing cultural production cannot exist in a vacuum. It will always take on an impact and be affected by external forces. Therefore, art needs to take part in systems-as-systems thinking, and art needs to be constantly (re</text>

Art as a social process, however, requires critical thinking and action. The proliferation of social media and the fluid dynamics of change are the modes in which art as a social process is most vulnerable to the power of representation. Critical thinking about the frequent and rapidly accelerating socialization of art (contemporary and long-term) is required in order to anticipate and respond to the power dynamics at play today. Whether artists want to admit it or not, and whether it is even their intention, the social realities of contemporary art are changing all the time. But as we all know, change is constantly accompanied by new and unforeseen opportune situations.  	In an ideal world, art and artists would all be free of the politics of representation and the politics of affectation. But despite the good intentions of some to the contrary, the current period of neoliberal capitalism and the ascendance of affectationality over production and consumption seems to be holding artists and art form back.

The proliferation of social media and the fluid dynamics of change are the modes in which art as a social process is most vulnerable to the power of representation and commodification. The potential for artists to be acquired through socially mediated means such as art fairs, exhibitions and pop-up contexts is unquestioned. But the growing power of biennials and the innovative ways in which they present art from diverse sites around the world and beyond is raising the question: how do we as artists and curators consider these potentially transformative practices within contemporary art’s social and political frameworks? How do we consider art from wildly different settings and contexts? 	The answer to these questions may lie in the hands of artists, not in the modes of production and consumption described by the global art market, which is dominated by the United States and Britain.

The proliferation of social media and the fluid dynamics of change are the modes in which art as a social process is most vulnerable to the power of representation and commodification. The contemporary art market is dominated by white artists who value their position at the top of a social ladder above all else. It is the role of artists to challenge this market power and create alternative, valuable products and practices that serve communities in their emergence as artists, consumers and creators. 	Artists, curators, collectors and collectors today face a complex set of cultural, economic and structural challenges, which demand creative and responsive action from all concerned. These challenges are real and they will continue to be real. But they can also be used to generate knowledge and activism in support of social change. The rise of social media and digital media has radically altered the way we communicate and engage with one another. We no longer live in the world as a marketplace of goods and services, but rather one where diverse forms of social interaction are the fundamental actors in generating wealth and power.

These processes produce not just the objects and services that are sold, but also the social structures and power relations that are the product of that art. This is why ‘representing things with numbers’ is a social action, but why numbers are also socially productive: by giving voice to people who otherwise might not voice their agency or claim any value in the way that is intended, the creative practitioners of topology-making have created the means to be heard and valued in a way that is not necessarily the result of their creative actions.

For example, the form of a board might be preferable to that of a park, because a board establishes rules for behaviour and invites participation, whereas a park allows for unrestricted access to resources (such as parkland) and encourages people to ‘take part’ in the making of things. But I'm not clear about what the relationship is between board and commission, or between art and social practice.

    <text>present an online project that seeks to imagine a parallel physical space for the oral due to the digital revolution.]I have a question about the relation between the participatory arts project that Jussi Parikka was organising with The New Museum in Helsinki and the evolution of Icelandic art. I’m wondering if the way in which the participatory arts project is structured – the way in which it is a response to the museum – is similar to the way in which Icelandic art was structured in relation to the state. I want to make sure that my questions are clear:1. What does it mean to be ‘public’ in relation to art, culture and its productions? Does it mean that the curator or art institution is a public institution that engages the public at large? Or is it that the curatorial gesture is a public one – one that invites people to join in and produce a creative reaction to art’s process? If the latter, then how does one create a participatory art project that is not a response to the dominant form of art in a given area but contributes to questioning and creating?2. What is the relationship between participatory and public art? How is a participatory project initiated by a public gallery or museum to art’s eventual public state (public or collective engagement)? Is the latter the same as when the state creates artworks, and when does the public engage with and produce art? If the former, what is the difference? Is it the public engagement with the artworks or the art production process? Is the latter a different kind of art? Does the public engage with the art producing the social conditions or does the public not engage with, or produce from, such art? Do the different kinds of art produce different social outcomes? Do the different kinds of art contribute to different kinds of art? What are the forms of art production and how do they come to be constituted? If the various kinds of art, and their producers, engage in different kinds of</text>

If the latter, then how does one create a participatory art project that is open to the city and its inhabitants? Does the project have to be publicly accessible? Does it have to be responsive to the needs of a city? Does it have to be ecologically sustainable? Does it have to be socially engaged? Does it have to be politically transparent? Does it have to be culturally responsive? Does it have to be culturally responsive in its production and reception of the city? Does it have to be socially just?

If the latter, then how does one create a participatory art project that draws people not into the making of art, but into the making of art? 2. What difference is there between curatorial and participatory art? Does the curatorial make art more accessible to people through tools or does the participatory arts project place the participant at the centre of the process through art? If the latter, then how does the participant create his/her own creative response to art’s process? 3. What is the difference between curatorial and participatory art? Is the curatorial more about the audience, or is the participatory arts more about the audience’s participation? If the audience is the point of entry into a work, then the participatory arts practices of The New Museum and The Icelandic Museum in Helsinki are both about the audience’s role, but also about creative ways in which the audience may be engaged with in various ways. For example, the participatory ways in which the audience creates their own stories through the use of art and visual media</text>

Or is it that the curatorial gesture is a public one – one that invites people to join in and produce a creative reaction to art’s process? If the latter, then how does one create a participatory art project that operates independently of the state?2. What is the relationship between participatory and public art projects? Is it possible to define the parameters of a public art project? Do artists have a public right to engage with the public? If so, what are the limits to what an artist can say and do in a public setting? Do artists have a public responsibility to act in a public setting? If so, what are the limits to what an artist can or cannot achieve?3. What is the difference between a public space and a museum? What is the difference between a public space and a school? I’m wondering whether the public is both capable of and demands a certain amount of civility and etiquette in its interactions with the museum and gallery. Are there certain differences between the public and the museumiser? Is it possible to create a public realm that is both capable of and demands a certain amount of civility and etiquette?4.

If the latter, then how does one create a participatory art project that is not a response to the state but is in fact a response to the public?2. What is the relationship between public art and participatory practices? Is it the case that public engagement is a by-product of participation? If so, what is the relationship between public art and collective projects? If so, what is the relationship between public engagement and a society governed by art? If so, what is the relationship between art and a democratic state, then a society that produces and supports creative, articulate and responsive artists? Does the answer to either question in ‘yes’ or ‘no’ depends on whether the social and the political experiment is conceived as a public or a collective one.3. In your ‘State of Democracy’ project, you call for the direct democratic participation of the people in the making of policy. In the process of making these policies, do you also encourage the direct participation of the people through direct action? Do you have a particularised model</text>

If the latter, then how does one create a participatory art project that engages the public in this process?2. What is the relation between the computer and the artist? Is it just an interface, a machine that exchanges data and produces artistic results? Or is it one that actively engages people in producing artistic results through its interface? If the latter, then what does this mean in terms of a social process? If the latter, then what does it mean for artists to engage people in producing artistic results through the ‘Interface Culture?’?3. What are the modes of interaction between people and the media that create and reproduce social difference? I’m interested in the modes of interaction between artists, critics, journalists, academics, collectors, students and communities. Is it possible to create a participatory arts project that operates through a multimedia medium, but that also targets communities? I believe that it is possible to produce a culturally responsive art project that targets communities through their media, but I also believe that there are other ways of engaging people through the media that</text>

What is the relationship between participatory and collaborative arts practice? Does the participatory arts project necessarily involve the participation of a large number of people (given the nature of the technology) or is it possible to engage with cultural practices through an act of sharing? Is it possible to create a ‘smart gallery’ through sharing? Does the public gallery function similarly to a ‘smart phone’? Does the public have the capacity to create a ‘smart community’ through sharing? Does the public have the capacity to institute a ‘smart idea’ through sharing? Does the public have the capacity to instigate a ‘smart dialogue’ through sharing? Does the public have the capacity to take control of its cultural destiny through sharing? Does the</text>
