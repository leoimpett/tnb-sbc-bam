In the exhibition, the curators make interventions that often exacerbate existing contradictions. For example, AILA funded a project in Djibouti to install a geoglyph of an elephant in the desert, which the authorities denounced as a radical form of Islam. The project was opposed by the government because it threatened national identity. The project was also opposed by local communities because of the resemblance of the geoglyph to designs of indigenous people, so much of which are made and carved from local resources. The AILA board of directors ultimately decided to allow the project to be mounted in the Louvre. There, it will remain a monument to both the exploration of new ways of being alive, and to the production of new art.About the Exhibition, Exhibition Avent 	The Exhibition Avent was curatorially conceived as a place to investigate the relationship between art and biennials.

The exhibition is a production of the nonprofit Art Link International (AILA) which funds art projects in the developing world through the packaging of art and exhibition making through its member arts associations. The curatorial intervention here is felt in the context of a much larger socio-political conversation about the role of art and the socio-political context that it occupies. The curators here are asked to engage with the notion of art making in a fundamentalism of the very real, but also in the abstract, such as that between nations, cultures, languages and the world as a whole. This is a context that the biennial can operate in precisely because it is real. It is a project that is real in its own way, and so it operates in and through all of these different social formations and contexts. And yet it is also possible that the curators here may have forgotten what it meant to be truly involved with, or even to be present in, the real thing. This possibility is a possibility here, and it is one that art professionals should be actively investigating. In the case of the Biennale of Sydney, for instance</text>

The exhibition is a production of the nonprofit Art Link International (AILA) which funds art projects in the developing world through the packaging of art. AILA programmes are not localised events, but rather operate across cultures and regions. Their form of public engagement is a critical intervention into the prevailing economic and political systems that constrain human creativity. The exhibition Exhibition Avent attempts to capture the dynamic between art and commerce by bringing together artists who work in concert across geographical locations. The concept is a departure from the architecture of nation states, but its intention is to recall the bond between art and commerce that existed prior to the industrial revolution. The curators have a set of questions that can be directed at the art world as a whole. These questions are designed to elicit a response from the art world as a whole, not to seek an answer from a curatorial or artistic function. The curatorial and artistic functions aim to produce works that are accessible to a global audience via public access to art, and that are not hostage to national confines.

The exhibition is a production of the nonprofit Art Link International (AILA) which funds art projects in the developing world through the packaging of art objects. The curatorial conception of the art-world curatorial-commercial relationship is accentuated by the fact that the curators are also artists themselves; Peggy Caillat is a former Curator for Life at the Tate Britain and Sue Bell Yank is a former Curator for Union Jack in London. The curatorial rhetoric of the art-world curatorial-commercial relationship is one that is frequently employed by curators to entice potential donors into contributing to a project or patronage. The curatorial production of the artist-performer encounter is a production that frequently seeks to engage the artist-consumer via the promise of art being produced through the art of the project. The curatorial production of the art-world curatorial-commercial relationship is accentuated by the fact that, unlike in other settings, the curators have no formal curatorial training, and thus are often called upon to improvise innovative ways of organising a project or production of art. These curatorial interventions are often</text>

The curatorial role in this context is to deliver interpretative content that engages with what the audience expects of the art, and to make the art they produce meaningful, even if this means engaging with audiences who consider themselves to be marginalised. The curatorial role in Exhibition Avent is to offer an in-depth survey of a specific artform, while the curatorial role in Exhibition Bancroft is to propose a specific itinerary for the art of the future, taking into account the context of the current art as well as the expectations of the audience. Such itineraries suggest future routes for artistic practice, offering possibility to artists in developing nations but also potential risk for artists in developed nations. As for the curatorial role in Bancroft, it is himself a pioneer in the non-traditional, non-traditional, ‘new’ and dynamic contexts that are now part of the art world. He established</text>

The curatorial role in this context is multifaceted and depends on the institution itself, its board of directors, artists, collectors and others. The role of the curatorial department in this sense is to deliver a consistent set of assumptions and values across institutions and to ensure that those who use the exhibition spaces and do the work within them have an experience that is consistent with this. The curatorial ambiguity and unpredictable nature of the art world means that the role of the art critic is to be able to provide art-critical treatment through analysis and critique. I find the contemporary art critic to be a useful and potentially influential curatorial tool. In this sense, I can say that the 2014 Venice Biennale was important in that it was able to articulate how the relationship between aesthetics and politics is part of a system that creates a daily experience of being in Venice, and in that sense, produced a sense of the daily that</text>

Page xiii The term ‘curatorial’ refers to an authority, an authority figure, a leader, a group, an ensemble of authorities, an institution, a type of organisation, a set of rules, a set of norms, a set of regulations, a set of standards, an ideal, a political or legal concept, a concept or set of ideas.

The curatorial role in this context is multifaceted; it includes, but is by no means limited to, the curatorial role of art as a value form in the social production of art and art-value; the role of art as a mediator of experience in the social production of art and the socialization of art-making; the role of art as a mediator of value in the social production of commodities; and the role of art as a mediator of politics and government in the social production of institutions and the social formation of those who use them. The role of the artist, artist-in-residence, and curator is critical to the successful deployment of cultural capital in the world through, for instance, the shift in the types and amounts of science-based research that institutions afford research-faculty members and the kinds of arts content and programmes that can be supported by those institutions.

The curators of the 10th annual Exhibition Avent were faced with a difficult conundrum: on the one hand, the number of participants at the Venice Biennale was increasing, but on the other, the number of spaces available was decreasing. Between the biennale's popularity and the increasing accessibility of biennials as a form, the curators wondered whether the increase in space would result in an increase in consumption, or would cause an increase in waste. They therefore embarked on a research project, Spacex, to understand the relationship between art and space. The results of their research project Surplus Art and Surplus Spacex were displayed in the Venice Biennale's permanent collection, with the names of the curators on a wall of the main hall. Their findings, a space-use study (Spacex) and a space-manufacture (Biennalee) study (A</text>

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was common, and as a consequence, space was scarce. Cities like Liverpool’s Liverpool Street Station, which hosted tens of thousands of passengers a day, was built on the ruins of the once-dominant black-chic style. It had been a den of poverty, and its abandoned look-alike storefronts point to the city’s economic dependency. The collection of tunnels under the Ponte City docks, once home to thousands of slaves, is a reminder of the economic detritus generated by the transatlantic slave trade. The collection of pre-modern black-chic styles, which was once embraced by the fashionable middle-class, is now considered vulgar and antiquated. Liverpool’s Tramway station, once home to over 1,000 slaves, is a blight on the city’s landscape.

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was common, and in the 19th century upcycling was common, but the aim of the city was always to sustain life through a continuous regeneration of the land and infrastructure. Upcycling was encouraged because over time the infrastructure absorbed huge amounts of energy as buildings were torn down and replaced with better public facilities. New developments in the city were often developed on the back of this upcycling, and in fact this was often the case. The upcycling of the city meant creating incentives for developers to develop on the land, but also for businesses to open up shop and expand, for workers to join the workforce and for businesses to hire workers – workers who would in turn make way for bigger operations – a system that absorbed all manner of new behaviours into the fabric of the city. This is not to suggest that these changes were without friction and that some of these innovations were actually counter productive. On the contrary, the city was often put under quite heavy economic stress, and it was not uncommon for</text>

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was frequent as well. The city was used by forces that neither nature nor economics could ever hope to control. As a collection of disassembled parts, the metropolis functioned as a site for creative destruction. Degenerate urban structures were seized upon as symbols of the end times by techno-utopianism and other technocratic ideologies. The city became not only the outcome of a given future, but actively contributed to its achievement. The utopia promoted by the city’s growth and development had as its primary goal the eventual deconstruction of the social. So while the social may claim a place in the political and economic future of the city, it will always have to be supplemented by something more social and political in its form.

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was common, and as a consequence, spaces were taken – literally, in some cases – which created new situations. Inhabitants felt the effects of urban sprawl almost immediately. Cities needed power generators, water purveyors and recycling points, and the city quickly became the site of a number of petty disputes, each with a unique flavour. The proliferation of public institutions, the development of a robust legal system and the proliferation of public bodies all demand that a city has a certain amount of bureaucracy. As the city expanded, so did its bureaucracy, and soon cities experienced their own miracle as bureaucracies around the city expanded with it. Cities today often seem to me to be entering a world where the citizens do the work and the machines do the rest, but the machines still tend to a certain extent to a city’s functions. The opening salvo in this monstrosity may have been the theme of the carnival, but the themes of the biennale have always been global,</text>

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was common, and as a consequence urban space was scarce. But the key to a healthy city was provided by a functioning public realm, and so the metropolis emerged from the messy disuse of space into the realm of the possible. There was a reason why the Spanish colonizers were so keen to commission murals and constructor sets depicting the exploits of their conquistadors: to the untrained eye, such representations looked cheap and frivolous. In places, the colonizers’ conquistadors appear to have looked more like tourists, performing wild and often dangerous things to urban environments around the globe. The fact that the metropolis was written out of the colonial era in the book of second person singular, and even third person anonymous, as a verb (like ‘dazzle’) gives a sense of the disjuncture between the historical period and the present. The metropolis is not a collection of buildings and streets; it is a world with a plurality of buildings and</text>

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was common, and as a consequence, material forms were frequently used to archive and organize the processes of social and cultural dissolution that were taking place at a prodigious rate at the same time. For many years, the term ‘displacement’ referred to the process of moving people away from where they were concentrated, and to a city’s efforts to support its peripheries. But over time, the term began to refer to more organic and even beautiful phenomena. For example, when I came to New York as a Fulbright scholar, I found myself drawn to the disused art galleries, which were being converted into mixed-use educational spaces. The galleries themselves provided a kind of temporary home for a kind of displacement that was happening all around them. The galleries became sites for temporary housing (and, later, for permanent residency); for temporary creative writing and photography; and for an occasional Art Basel that was itself a temporary venue for an ever-expanding clientele. These galleries</text>

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was common, and people found ways to get around. But the city was slow to adapt. It took decades for a new cultural identity to be established in the space, and these were, by then, the new global notions of urbanity. The old urban landscape was reacquainted with urban forms that were no longer considered monstrosities, and the displaced peoples who moved back into the countryside. The city was slow to recover from this new mode of economic creation, and now the countryside is a place of empty lots and boarded-up houses. This disinvestment is real, and it continues to be a huge problem for many places. But what the city does with its scarce resources – what it can generate from the scarce – is creative, creative and RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME.

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was frequent and messy as well. Yet its purpose was always to provide capacity for another day. When the infrastructure was disassembled, physically and/or metaphorically, it was often done in the name of a project that sought to enhance the city’s appearance or other people’s perception of the city. Sometimes this was done in the name of a new development that would help the city transition to a different kind of urbanity. In 2005, for example, a developer called Globovision proposed a $1.5 billion mixed-use complex in the midst of Manhattan called the Astor Place project. The project was supposed to include a high-end condo tower and a mix of office and residential space, a significant new park, a museum and a hotel.

The question was then, what could the city do with these new buildings? The answer was, as always, ‘nothing’. The city only generates what it wants to, and as a consequence, is continually faced with decisions that it would be better to make than not make. The question becomes, what next? When the Spanish colonial period ended, a city’s administrative capacity and even its capacity for self-sufficiency were questioned. What was needed was an infrastructure that could support an independent city, and this was what the metropolis was made up of: buildings, roads, tunnels, water and sewer systems, docks, bridges, tunnels, streetlights, a collection of public institutions (including museums), legal systems and a bureaucracy – all of which existed independently of one another. The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was common, and as a consequence life in the city was stressful. The new administrative machinery that emerged during the 1970s and 80s was much more flexible and could be put into place to support an ever-larger population. It is this flexibility – which many contemporary urban theorists would agree is desirable – that is being undermined by a materialist ideology that seeks to rig the system to serve its own interests. If the goals of the materialist are to expand the city, then the only way to ensure that the inhabitants of the city have a positive impact on the system is for the system to become ever more complex and self-sustaining. Therefore the city is being stretched ever further into disuse and becoming less and less of a place that anyone wants to be. This is the prevailing political-materialist ideology in the city. The idea that the city is an administrative nightmare that must be thrown into the bin of non-urban problems is widespread. Yet in a city as complex as Toronto,</text>

The city was a complex system, and as such its disuse was frequent and messy. Displacement was common, and as a consequence cities experienced rapid growth coupled with a feeling of under-development. The urban environment, in short, is a big disuse trap. The metropolis cannot grow outside of the city, but it can nevertheless change and change quickly. A city that is constantly being repaired and rebuilt is bound to become increasingly disjointed, urbanized and variable – a classic metropolis – and this is precisely what cities in the advanced capitalist world are facing. To some extent, this is inevitable: the division between city and country is part of the larger capitalist system, and as a result nations will always have their capitals located in cities. But to some extent this isn’t true: the kind of urban heterogeneity that is advocated as a cure for capitalism today is actually what capitalism needs. The kind of heterogeneity advocated – the kind that makes possible the development of ever larger and more variable metropolises – is only possible because of the existence of the ‘single most valuable urban</text>

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park home in Brixton, the Hyde Park home is now owned by the London Property Brothers and given a new identity, which the biennale could well follow. The point was to produce a situation in which the artist could creatively engage with the city in such a way as to create possibilities for further engagement, and to that end the biennale’s budget was stretched thin.   Art’s biennial is the only large-scale art institution in the world that is not democratically accountable to a professional art commission. In the case of the Biennale of Sydney, the biennale was chosen by a curatorial team led by Sir Peter Blake, who was a pioneer of democratic curating, and who has a proven track record of producing psychologically engaged art. The team was given complete autonomy to pursue their own interests, and to embark on any curatorial agenda they pleased, including but not limited to creating a sanctuary for the arts in the form of a multi-leveled</text>

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park home, which was generally seen as a symbol of the crisis of housing in the city and an ideal location for the biennale given its status as a public space.[7] The Hyde Park home was, however, often seen by many within the biennale as a critique of the crisis of housing, and the biennale itself as a forum for residents to vent their frustrations.  Art has a very specific and narrow meaning in the city, and it is this very narrow view of the city that characterises the meaning of the biennale today. The biennale has become something that is circumscribed into prescribed parameters, and is no longer a space with its own distinctive character. The biennale has become a gathering of various curatorial styles and subjects, and an event that is curtailed in many ways by the rigid control of the city as a whole. The biennale is curated to a specific kind of curator, who is responsible for the kind of art it</text>

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park home that Theo Carruthers set out to repair following the Elephant and Castle Blitz. The fact that the Hyde Park home was chosen as an end point for such a project was shown in the project’s video footage; a crucial distinction between the artist and the structure he was working with.  Art must be valued in its relation to what it does not own, and when it is made by art, the value it contributes is indirect, not absolute.   The relationship was shown by the Hyde Park home as being one of ownership, and the work thus created belongs to the owner not the biennale. However, the biennale had to be creative in its appropriation of this kind of ownership. As Carruthers famously said, when you’re working for the Biennale, you’re working for yourself: you’re renting a flat from the Biennale, you’re renting a cinema from them, you’re renting a studio</text>

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park Arts Centre, which was ultimately awarded a short-term planning permit despite having nothing to do with the Biennale but which was a direct response to it.  Art is often held to have transcendent, transformative effects, but in the case of the Biennale, the transcendent seems to have been brought about by the disjointed, overlapping and dislocating of the city in relation to a single, highly curated event. This conflation and disjoint is shown in many ways throughout the biennale’s document, but one of the most egregious is shown in its apparent disenchantment with its own form as an art form. The biennale’s disenchantment with its own capitalisation of space and time occurs early in the book, in relation to the broad concepts of ‘art’ that it was initially taught at the Biennale School of Architecture and Design at RMIT University.

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park home that became the focus of a massive project of renewal and regeneration during the 1990s, it became increasingly difficult to see a way forward without becoming a museum and gallery of sorts.  Art as a political act Even when it comes to the art that is produced and embodied in the biennale, biennials have a very specific relationship to politics and the global economy. The contemporary biennial is the direct result of twenty-first century capitalism and the resulting political revolutions, and so as the museum-like institution that it is, it is an ideal candidate for a social and ecological analysis.  The problem with the biennial is not just anachronistic or antiquated, but is heavily political, and so is its relationship to the broader social and political changes that capitalism brings.  Contemporary biennials have become so embedded in the fabric of what is considered an urban centre that it is difficult to imagine the past. With the exception of a few rare exceptions, urban centres are increasingly produced</text>

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park home, which was often used as a site for public consumption, or the Tate Modern, which was needed in order to provide an alternative context for post-exhibition debauchery.  Art has a political aspect to it that is deeply embedded in the history of the process, and although the biennale itself often engages with these dimensions, it is always engaged in ways that are motivated by broader social and political struggles. For example, the Green Party recently formed a council to look at ways to better utilise the hill station as a site for cultural activities, and the Biennale was keen to add cultural organisations to the mix as well as engaging with local communities.  Art and the politics of art  In the 1970s and 80s, there was a clear feminist and civil rights dimension to the politics of art, and the biennale was no exception. The fact that the Tate Modern was created in response to the threat from terrorism did play a part in this, although I would</text>

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park home in Sutton, some of the development projects that followed the biennale were quite subversive in their intent. They integrated the biennale with the city, creating a hybrid that broke with the monochromatic core of the biennale. In such cases, the biennale must necessarily become a museum, and not just a place where art is supposedly happening. Unfortunately, this is what many biennales do, and the monolithically globalised forms of the biennale that they increasingly expose are museums first, and art museums second. There is a danger that the art museums will become art collectors, as the biennale’s globalised content makes it easier for tourists to be drawn into both the art and the tourism industries. This is already happening in Rio de Janeiro, where the museums and the biennale have merged, and are now the very industry they were designed to serve. Art biennales are now collectors attractions, which is a way of saying</text>

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park home for the Arts Council, the biennale itself was often seen as a de facto end point, as a means of connecting with the city beyond the curatorial agenda of the city. This was shown in the Biennale’s support of a wide range of community artists and the artists’ cooperative, which was seen by many curators as important in bridging the gap between art world professionals and the everyday working artists.  biennale criticises London’s ‘gothic’ aesthetic of the 1980s, and praises its deconstruction of the medieval edifice of the city. But ‘the gothic’ in question was not a Gothic cathedral, nor was it a renaissance that restored the golden age of the city, nor is it a ‘gothic’ that represents the city in its contemporary form. Rather, the Gothic cathedral, the renaissance and the new urban era were each part of a process of industrial decline that began</text>

Although this was sometimes necessary in order to complete the given task, as in the case of the Hyde Park project, the biennale itself, as an entity independent of the capital, had to be rethought and reinvented in every possible way in order to achieve the ever-increasing amounts of money at stake. The challenge moving forward for such projects is to redefine the concept of the art-use in such a way as to encompass not just the aesthetic uses of art, but also the practical uses of art, and the social uses of art beyond aesthetics. If the aim of the biennale is to make the city a site for artistic exchange, then the definition of the biennale as an entity and its agents as artists, curators, artists and curators is critical. The definition of the biennale as an art-use is also critical in order to prevent the formation of a distinct type of art-historical entity distinct from other types of art-historical exchange.

The main impulse driving the Hyde Park project was the desire to see what biennials could bring to their local communities. This was reflected in the name – Hyde Park was a name that people in the area would say was both empowering and ironic. It seemed as if the Biennale was breaking apart into smaller tasks, some of which were fulfilled, while others were not. The irony was that the larger the project, the greater the impact. People felt that they were being drawn into something bigger than themselves. One man, for instance, had started a local butcher business, which was already booming at the time.

The Biennale cannot become a permanent fixture in the city, as was planned, and cannot merge with other curatorial activities, because that would mean changing the city, changing what counts as a ‘curated space’ and so on. It’s up to local authorities and other stakeholders to create their own imagined spaces and to work with that imagined space in ways that are authentic to the locality. 	Local authorities have the power to create their own biennales, but they don’t have the power to create real ‘curated spaces’ – spaces in which to do that. The Biennale was initially planned as a ‘once in a generation’ event, but as the number of visitors has more than doubled, and the Biennale as a ‘event’ increasingly resembles a ‘place of habitation’ and into which other ‘events’ can be placed, then the boundaries between the two are starting to blur a bit. The Biennale’s core mission statement is starting to sound a bit silly, and places like</text>

If the Biennale is to have any real influence in the city, it must be led by people with skills and tools with which the city can be modelled. The Biennale cannot become a permanent fixture in the city, as was planned, and cannot merge with other curatorial activities, because that would negate the role of the Biennale as a project broadcaster. It must be led by people with skills and tools with which the city can be shaped, and which can then be used creatively within the context of, and alongside, other cultural activities. The Biennale has, since its beginning, sought to be a catalyst for other cultural activities in the city, and to this extent it is actively engaged in creating local cultural identities through its displays, public programmes and events. It is, however, not a city-wide cultural phenomenon; for that, you would need a centrally planned and managed tourism infrastructure, and the Biennale has thus far found itself woefully short of resources. The best that can be hoped for is that the Biennale may one day find the skills and tools needed to engage with and build a local cultural infrastructure, and that through its curatorial and educational programmes, it may be able to draw on the resources of the city collectively to support a</text>

The Biennale cannot become a permanent fixture in the city, as was planned, and cannot merge with other curatorial activities, such as the museums, which have their own distinctive art-historical and archival perspectives. But it can and should do interesting and varied things, and it’s up to the organisers and artists to find the right partners to work with and for different kinds of organisation. This is the Biennale’s job. And it’s doing quite well – although I would argue that the failure to engage with the city in the same way that the Biennale was invited to do is part of the job, and part of the structural problem. The structural problem is that the Biennale is part of an institution, and part of a curatorial team. The Biennale has to be a curatorial event, and it’s doing that by virtue of its being a cultural institution. For that to happen, there has to be a curatorial agenda. Otherwise, the Biennale is like any other cultural institution, and like other cultural bearers,</text>

It’s up to the city council to support or not, and they’d do it whether or not artist-curated projects are there. 	But as important as it is to have skills and tools with which the city can be made to comply, it’s equally as important to have the capacity to disrupt or to not to be subject to such control. The Biennale should operate in such a way as to provoke thought, to engage readers, and to disturb as many ideas of its own size as possible. It’s an art institution, and as such it must have the capacity to exert an influence over its readers’ perceptions, but equally it must be able to create its own organisation, and this last capability is something that the Biennale failed to achieve in 2014. Perhaps the failure to engage readers as readers2 as effectively as possible in the 2014 Biennale was down to the</text>

When looking at the interface as a media device, the question is not so much about what can be done with the media, as about what might be allowed to be done with the media. When looking at a screen, the question is about the intentions behind the actions taken by the computer. When looking at a screen, the screen is often used as a tool for self-reflection. The question is no longer: how can the user determine what is ethical, but rather ‘how can the computer be programmed to do certain things in a certain way?’ The role of the designer is two-fold. First, the user authorizes and organizes the actions taken by the computer, through commands given either verbally or through a programmable interface. Second, the programmer creates what is sometimes referred to as ‘the interface’ or ‘the ‘system’.  Thoroughly programmed and   ‘hardened’ in areas where vulnerabilities exist, the interface becomes a point of vulnerability – a point where information can be exchanged between parties at great speed and in ways that are not always transparent and equitable, and at great cost. The importance of this critical interface dimension can be seen in the explosion of interface products over the past twenty years. The rapid proliferation of interfaces has</text>

When looking at a screen, the question is about the intentions behind the actions taken by the computer. When looking at a screen, the screen is a blank slate. The screen is a stage, but it is also where intentions can be expressed in a multitude of possible actions. When looking at the screen, users have no way of knowing what actions are real and what are not. When looking at the screen, there is no way of knowing what is real and what is not. Therefore, ‘real life’ is contextualised within the text that accompanies the interface.’ There is no semantic distinction between what is real and what is not real, and hence users cannot draw conclusions about the appropriateness of an interface based on this understanding. When looking at an interface, users are not just users, but also creators and agents that have souls as well as bodies. Therefore, the ethical question that surrounds the interface becomes relevant in the 21st century. When looking at an interface, users have souls as well as machines that are affected by the actions taken by users. When treating interface components as moral human beings</text>

When looking at a screen, the question is about the intentions behind the actions taken by the computer. When looking at a screen, the screen is a myth. When looking at a screen, the screen is a metaphor. When looking at a screen, the screen is a contradiction. When looking at a screen, the screen is a paradox. The metaphor is that of a large screen, and with it, a contradiction within. What is a screen? When looking at a screen, the screen is a number. When looking at the screen, the screen is an integer. When looking at the screen, the screen is a number and a counter. When looking at the screen, the screen is a number and a symbol. When looking at the screen, the screen is a character.

When looking at a screen, the question is about the intentions behind the actions taken by the computer. When looking at a screen, the screen is a set of intentions divorced from the physical world. When looking at a screen, the screen is a blank slate, but it is also a platform for an infinite number of interpretations. When looking at a screen, the screen has no particular relation to the information that is presented to it, and this makes it ‘infrastructural’ in character. When looking at a screen, the screen has no particular relationship to the information being delivered to it, and this makes it ‘social and cultural’ in character. When looking at a screen, the screen has no particular relation to the community, and this makes it ‘political and visionary’ in character. When looking at a screen, the screen has no particular relation to the user, and this makes it ‘infrastructural’ in character.

When looking at a screen, the question is about the intentions behind the actions taken by the computer. When looking at a screen, the screen is a canvas, it is a surface, it is a space – a place where actions can be taken and responses can be delivered. ‘Taken’ can mean an action taken in order to achieve a desired effect, or it can mean an action taken for a specific end. When looking at a screen, there is a question of ownership – whether the computer is the rightful author, or whether the computer is an author’s rightful representative. When looking at a screen, there is a question of authorship – whether the computer is the rightful publisher, or whether the computer is a co-publisher’s sole rightful representative. When looking at a screen, there is a question of ownership in relation to the community around it – whether the computer is a web site, whether the computer is a ‘home page’ and whether the computer is a ‘work page’ – all of which refer to the same thing and pertain to the</text>

When looking at a screen, the question is about the intentions behind the actions taken by the computer. When looking at a screen, the screen is the site of interaction – it has intentions and cues – but it is also the site of interpretation and manipulation. When looking at a screen, there is no neutrality between the observer and the effect – there is often an intention to achieve a certain outcome through interpretation. How can the reader infer what the intentions of the computer are? This is the paradigm of the ‘user’ and the ‘interface designer’. When looking at a computer system in its purest form, the user is not seeing the emergent properties of the system, but rather the ways in which the computer is programmed to achieve a particular outcome. When programming, the programmer understands the world in terms of goals and objectives, but more importantly, he or she understands the world as an actor – an effect – which has an agenda and manipulates the world through means that it knows will either please or alienate certain stakeholders. The emergent properties of the interface are made manifest through means that the</text>

When looking at a computer, the screen is a platform for action. When looking at the screen, the screen is a platform for interpretation. When looking at the screen, the screen can lead to a range of interesting interpretations. Many of the stories told about the liberating power of the screen are based on actual encounters with industrial computers, where workers are often exposed to unimaginable levels of noise and pollution. The introduction of computers into the workplace came about through a social movement. The introduction of mobile phones through third party operators was spurred by a marketing campaign that claimed the technology would eliminate the need for humans in the workplace. The success of such claims is often attributed to a single person or a small team managing the technology effectively. But the success of any social movement is often dependent on many individuals contributing their time, energy, and creativity to achieve a desired effect. The introduction of new technologies into the workplace usually follows a social movement that has been at least</text>

When looking at a screen, the question is about the intentions behind the actions taken by the computer. When looking at a screen, actions have intentions behind them, and ‘design’ is part of that.When looking at a screen, actions also have context. Action sequences and their ‘derived properties’ help create ‘meaningful associations’ between the same thing and different things. Action scenes, montages, and poetry sequences are powerful because they chart the trajectory of an event, creating an ‘event horizon’ that can be aligned with different interpretations. By the same token, they chart the trajectory of an interpreted ‘meaningful action’, which may or may not correspond with the thing being interpreted. Action sequences and their ‘derived structures’ are also powerful because they chart the path of an interpreted ‘event’, thereby enabling us to draw connections between disparate parts.

[i] The landmark case in its turn, which is not so much the decision as the outcome, is the judgement of the Berlin Wall commemorative mosaic commissioned by the German Museum of Modern Art. It was intended as a temporary memento of the Wall ‘s place in history’ and was conceived by architect Alfred Wegener. It was never a museum, however; rather Wegener’s memento of the Wall, it was a collection of mementos from the museum. The museum was closed until 1970, when a temporary exhibition of Wegener’s work on the wall was moved to a different museum. The museum then decided that the mosaic should remain a museum, and its collection of mementos a permanent one. 	[ii] Martin Amis, Reading Culture, Reading America, New York, 1978, p.85. [iii]</text>

The Museum of Contemporary Art is not without its critics, and its exhibitions are highly criticised.

The Museum of Contemporary Art has a specific, narrower, more immediate interest in the world of exhibitions, while the Museum of Modern Art has a more conceptual interest. The Museum of Modern Art has a much broader mission, and the Museum of Contemporary Art aims at a globally relevant, albeit interdisciplinary, kind of thing. They are both interested in the same kinds of things, and their particular ways of engaging with that. And they are both interested in engagement with the past, in engagement with the past, and in the contemporaneity of all that. But in their own ways, they are doing things differently.

The biennale is a fixture of the tourism industry in many cities, and its symbolic value remains strong even though the biennale has largely demonstrated its inability to generate significant revenue for metros. It is important to mention that the biennale is not a universal phenomenon: it is rare in its form today in many cities, and extremely rare today in any city. 	Moreover,</text>

Introduction of Computers to the Social 	Looking Backward in the Future 	The computer is a ubiquitous interface today, and its ubiquity and diffuse character make it an ideal place to start thinking about the social consequences of new technologies. 	Though not a new thing for artists to do this, I felt that this particular project really lent itself to this one-size-fits-all treatment. Rather than trying to categorise the various ways in which the computer interacts with the world, I wanted to start from the basic idea of how it records and distributes knowledge. I</text>

The World Trade Center towers were designed by Savvas Andreev, Gaudi, and Rem Koolhaas. The project was led by Rem Koolhaas, who is an artist and is the co-founder and CEO of KW Institute of Contemporary Arts &amp; Design. Rem and his team brought together a diverse collection of artists, curators, architects, journalists, politicians, community organisers, politicians, architects and members of the media. Together, they proposed a ‘Future City’ for the World Trade Center site, a ‘Redevelopment Zone’ for the surrounding area, and a ‘Promenade to Observe the Past’ concept for the city.

The World Congress’s members included many of us from around the world – artists, architects, journalists, collectors, activists. Some were well-known, such as Gerry Francis Lee, Terry Gilliam, Warren Madoff, Bruce Koch, Norman Wilkinson and Ai Weiwei. Others were not well-known, such as me. However, their presence confirmed my suspicion that many of us had been struggling for years to get recognised, and to gain access to a culturally responsive version of urban space that is not concentrated in the hands of a small number of global art collectors and an art market dominated by local art collectors. This is the ‘City of Art’ – an ever-expanding urban market for contemporary art, whose buyers are primarily the artists, curators, and curators from the world over, and who increasingly come from different cities.

The World Trade Center project had started in 2015, and the surrounding neighborhood was experiencing its own ‘financial miracle’, thanks in part to a tax abatement program that the Cayman Islands government had approved in 2012.  So the World Congress had a unique opportunity to combine the expertise of the Giuliani law firm with the expertise of the Port Authority – both local and national – to begin the difficult task of changing the cultural landscape of the area.  And so, the World Congress opened with a ‘festival of ideas’, a shortened version of the event that had been planned for September 11th, but was moved to October 30th due to the ‘financial black-hole’ that the 9/11/01 complex had become.

The World Trade Center project had been conceived as two ‘episodic’ parts. The first was a ‘building series’ that would replace both the World Trade Center and the Union Square buildings with mutually reinforcing local cultural districts. The second part of the plan was a ‘town’ that would be completely absorbed into the perimeter of the development. The idea was to create a ‘peripheral city’ that is separate from the rest of the city, but participates in the development of the ‘global’ through its own unique cultural resources. 	The World Trade Center project had two precursors – the Twin Towers and the Museum of Modern Art – which were conceived by the Biennale director Michel Klein as two parallel projects that needed to be realized simultaneously.

The World Trade Center project had invited artists and arts organisations from around the globe to participate in a ‘cultural village’ concept design process. Approximately 200 cultural organisations contributed ideas and architecture to the project, which was then evaluated and scored on a scale of 1 to 5 using a combination of criteria relating to accessibility, creativity, community and sustainability. The final proposal incorporated criteria for sustainability developed by the World Health Organisation and the US Geological Survey. These sustainability criteria prioritise the optimisation of physical and mental resources at the site, as well as the management of waste effectively through the use of no-waste management. The environmental performance of the proposal was evaluated using a 10-point scale developed by the architecture and planning department of the United States Department of Agriculture.

The World Congress’s managing director, Jean Guy Lecat, invited the artists to explore the idea of ‘re-constituting art’ through a process that would allow the artists to step back and allow the city to take over the artistic and social functions of art. The artists were invited to propose ‘new curating approaches’ that would allow the city to take over the functions of art, including through the use of social media.

What does ‘the other’ mean in the contemporary world? J.D. Dewsbury: 	I use the term ‘the other’ in a very broad sense. I mean all kinds of other cultural forms, including that which we humans call ‘nature’, which is a great multiplicity of sorts: forms of life, living matter, created endars, cultural histories, political histories, humanitarian histories, economic histories, human geography, and so forth. I use the term ‘the other’ in a similar way to our language – assuming that we humans are cultural creatures that live among these other forms, along</text>

The project was entitled The Universitas Project, and it was part of the wider exhibition series The Contemporary Condition, which was organised by the Biennial and the Arts Council.Whilst researching the project, I came across a classicist’s sub-title: The Universal Multiples. The subtitle sounded like a novel, like something new was emerging out of the same old patterns.

The exhibition business isn’t the only place where the museum is interested in how to support artistic production, but the increasing importance of the art produced through it is a place where the museum is particularly active. Its curatorial gestures and immersive experiences, which some might describe as ‘museum-like’ or even ‘metaphorical’ – showing art as it happens, in and through a museum setting, is a most valuable commodity. The Museum of Modern Art was founded to house its curatorial paraphernalia and collections, which it does not hide, reveals, or conceals, making them visible and making them quotidian. Its five-year cycle, which it initiated in 1986, is divided into ‘Lines in the Sky’, a series of sculpture pieces that it has repeatedly show at its Davis Art Museum, at the California Academy of Sciences, and at the Santa Fe Art Museum, New Mexico, and ‘Seasons in the Mist’, a series of paintings that it has recently shown at the</text>

The exhibition business isn’t the only place where the Museum of Modern Art operates at a crossroads. The curatorial turn has consequences that reverberate far beyond the museum itself. The curatorial is central to the museum’s survival as a cultural entity; it supports the museum’s mission and makes it a more potent cultural expression. It is a sad fact of life that most curatorial work ends up in the hands of art collectors and art institutions, who either donate time to art that they hope will be remembered (the art market) or will put up with art that they cannot control (the auction house). Curatorial work is a market production – an industry that depends on self-regulation and art institutions developing mechanisms to police their creativity and to offer their artists work that they control – and to a large extent on the industry itself. The Museum of Modern Art has been able to develop methods of self-regulation into which it could operate without compromising its mission. It is a paradoxical situation, but the Museum of Modern Art has found</text>

The exhibition business isn’t the only place where the Museum of Modern Art has invested itself. There are several initiatives that it supports, including the artists’ studios in several cities, as well as the achievement commissions that are part of the Biennale. In Paris, both the Musee Royal and the Arsenale perform their functions in a way that is sensitive to the interests of other artistic communities, while in New York and Berlin, the Arsenale and Musee de France take an active role in supporting the work of their local artworlds. The Arsenale of New York prides itself on its ability to turn a profit on every sale, while the New Museum of Modern Art, founded in 1984, has maintained a significant cultural-functional-design portfolio that has been on a permanent basis since 1984.

The exhibition business isn’t the only place where the Museum of Modern Art engages with the contemporary artworld, and the biennial is no exception. But its audiences are different from those of a contemporary art gallery, and their curatorial approaches to art’s production of history differs from that of a contemporary curator. As biennials become more sophisticated and sophisticated, they become less and less able to recall their origins, and this fact continues to inform their thinking. The Museum of Modern Art is no exception to this rule. It’s true that, as biennials become more sophisticated and institutionalised, they need to rely on trusted art professionals to guide their production, but this is offset by the Museum of Modern Art developing its own internal curatorial apparatus in an attempt to maintain a presence on the curatorial radar. This internal curatorial apparatus might be an art gallery with a curatorial taxonomist, or it might be a museum with an artist-curated show that exhibits a curator’s own point of view. It</text>

The exhibition business isn’t the only place where the Museum of Modern Art operates in New York and San Francisco, but it is a place where the Museum of Modern Art is more or less embedded. This is a new curatorial approach that the Museum of Modern Art takes in its current mode of production: it has no formal curatorial mandate, but it does have a political one, and it makes sense in this intricate and evolving city as a whole. The exhibition business is a business that exploits cultural resources, and the Museum of Modern Art is an institution that profits from exploiting cultural resources. As such, the relationship is both exploitative and ends up benefiting a number of people. The Museum of Modern Art is a publicly traded company, and one of its core strategies is to maximise the return on its investment by pushing the envelope of what it terms the Cultural Capital of the World. This implies pushing the envelope of what it refers to as ‘the City of New York’ and its myriad forms, which it defines broadly enough to include everything from</text>

The exhibition business isn’t the only place where the Museum of Modern Art participates in the production of history. It is an important marketer of ideas, with exhibitions of contemporary art and non-traditional artworks attracting a mass audience. Its historical materials exhibition, which is based in New York, has a major exhibition at Tate Britain and Venice. The Museum of Modern Art has a limited-edition woodcut of John Lennon, Paul McCartney and a host of other artists, among them Sabine Lis, whose work is a monument to the Second World War. With more than 200 works on view at the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Modern Art has a significant exhibition-aesthetics portfolio.With its focus on the arts and its curatorial leanings, the Museum of Modern Art has a common approach to the mass exhibition market: it maximises the relevance of a work of art to a mass audience.

The exhibition business isn’t the only place where the Museum of Modern Art has invested itself in the past. It opened its doors to the public in 1990, and since then has been an exhibition destination, with permanent exhibitions in every major art museum around the world. It has even been a ‘curatorial tool’ in the making of some curatorial achievements, such as the New York Art Biennale, with which it collaborated in 1990.But while the Museum of Modern Art does a good job of capturing how the art it displays represents its own historical situation, it lacks any kind of overarching narrative or vision. That’s why biennials have a double – or ‘twin’ – burden: they are both about the same thing, but in different ways. If you take the Museum of Modern Art apart, it opens up new perspectives and perspectives. But if you leave it in its basic state, then you still have the same set of objectives and see things through the same set of frames, then you still have</text>

In recent years it has commissioned works from a wide range of artists, including Mark Romanek, Pam Stenzel, Steve Gooch, Bernard Beaulieu, Mira Lacy and many more. The key to the Museum of Modern Art’s success, I believe, is a combination of a participatory curatorial approach, a keen interest in its past, and a capacity to adapt itself to changing circumstances. The curatorial heavy lifting that needs to be done in order to provide the necessary transparency and creativity for the Museum of Modern Art to function effectively is going to have to change. The curatorial heavy lifting that needs to happen in order to support the Museum of Modern Art is going to have to change. This is going to require change in what is perceived as the norm – in other words, change in the museum visitor, and I include myself here as a visitor and visitor to the Museum of Modern Art.

The Museum of Modern Art is now also a publisher. It has published several books, among them the acclaimed art-fairing books of the 1990s, which chronicled the life of the art market in London during the decade. It has also published essays on current issues of the arts and culture section of the New York Times, in the 1990s, its critic Keith Bjorkman being one of many to narrate this transition.  	Its curatorial approach to art has always been an important part of the equation.

The exhibition business isn’t the only place where the Museum of Modern Art has invested heavily in the past. It opened the Museum of Modern Art, which is committed to documenting the history of art in the United States through various forms of archival research. Both the Museum and the Biennial have collections of works that are part of the National Trust’s permanent collection. The collections are a testimony to the power and importance of the artist as a curator, and a source of the museum’s power. The biennial has collections of its own, and both are part of the Museum of Modern Art. They are also part of the Museum of Modern Art’s social mission. The collections are a testament to the power and importance of the art historian as a curator, and a source of the museum’s power.

It would require an appreciation of the different modes of transport within the city, and the different ways in which people use the city. It would require an awareness of the social functions of the city, and the role that art can play in eliciting social change. I have a tentative proposal that this last set of objectives – acquiring an appreciation of the city, and changing the city – might be considered the most aesthetically interesting and engaging. It might require more work, and might even involve violence and conflict, but it is aesthetically interesting, and has the potential to change the world. It is also increasingly likely that such change will be accompanied by violence and conflict. In the coming years, thanks to our work with the city, we hope to be able to contribute to a city revitalisation process that will enable art and architecture to coexist harmoniously with each other. This might involve providing design advice, or designing buildings to work with existing infrastructure, and art being installed in ways that augment the buildings themselves. We would also be able to adopt strategies to support the ongoing redevelopment of the city, including funding from the Arts Council. </text>

The concluding part of the text presents a short pre-digest of the imagined language of the readers and the watchers, and of the artist, in the form of an entwined poem that ends with a cryptic, but ultimately hopeful phrase: ‘Tell me, daughter of John …’.

The last two chapters present an extended analysis of the exhibition as a whole, and the specific points where the author of that analysis finds herself caught up in the narrative that is unfolding in Liverpool. The chapter entitled ‘The Anfield Project’ presents an in-depth look into the minds of the people organising the Liverpool Biennial, and its surroundings. 	As the title suggests, this chapter is dedicated to the city in which the exhibition is to be located. The chapter entitled ‘A Corner Project’ represents the city as a corner shop for the reader’s thoughts and feelings. It is a meditation on the values and ideals of the biennial as an institution, and the particular ways in which those values and ideals are constructed, promulgated and maintained through the production of architecture and the textual. It is a chapter on the festival as a material production, and the functions of the ‘bookish’ section of the biennial as a</text>

These last two parts present a closer look into the imagined  	hidden society of the readers and the watchers, and reveal another layer of the self-imposed exile that the reader inhabits within the fictional city. 	The fictional city is a double-edged sword. It is a city of its own making, and can be used to oppress and mystify those who inhabit it. But it is also a city that demands a certain amount of effort and dedication from those who inhabit it. In doing so, it calls into question the very basis of the city, its very unity. The reader is urged to set aside their personal agendas, and to engage with the city with all the vigilance and rigourality of a municipal budget. 	The reader is also encouraged to explore other works by the same author that have been similarly placed somewhere in the world, and to explore the economic and social aspects of such places – places that are neither here nor there, in the fictive sense of the word. 	The final section of the book, entitled The Other, offers a sweeping survey of the city as a whole, and of cultural practices within the city, looking to</text>

These last two parts present a closer look into the imagined  	hidden society of the readers and the watchers, and reveal another layer of the self-imposed exile that the reader/watcher/ spectator inhabits in the fictional city of Liverpool Biennial. 	The fictional city of Liverpool Biennial is a complex one, full of contradictions and paradoxes that can be seen to be woven into its fabric. Part of the reason for this complexity is that the city is constantly (fictionalistically) seeking to repurpose and absorb the surplus of labour and material wealth generated by the biennial, giving birth to ever more fantastical narratives about the city’s urbanisation and subsequent (metaphorical) magic. Part Two, however, attempts to capture the contradictory effects of this urban growth and its discontents, while Part Three, which is concerned with the imagined hidden society of the readers, reveals the contradictions and real-life threats to the city’s urban fabric posed by the urban planner’s (metaphorical) application of biennials to the production and consumption of wealth.

These last two parts present a closer look into the imagined  	hidden society of the readers and the watchers, and reveal another layer of the self-imposed exile that the reader inhabits in the city. 	The narrative that emerges from these six parts is mostly concerned with the individual ‘reading room’ – the confined space within which the reader, or another reader, inhabits. The reader inhabits this fictional region through her/his chosen mode of ‘reading’, which is mediated through the fictional ‘reading room’. Part Two analyses the place of the physical reading room and its occupants, and Part Three discusses the place of the imaginary reading room and its inhabitants, concluding with a discussion of the different modes of inhabitation. 	The reader profile for the book One Hundred Years of Reading (2015) includes a detailed examination of the author’s residence, a former public library in the Serbian Orthodox cathedral of Slavyansk. The residence was acquired by the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1969, and since then, the residence has hosted numerous festivals, solemnities and religious services.

It ends up describing the lives of the artists, the theatre, the biennial and the everyday events in and around the Biennial. 	The book is divided into six parts. Part Two describes the internal politics and internal life of the theatre and the everyday behaviour of the reader. Part Three describes the life of the Biennial as a literary project that is informed by issues of identity and location.

The reader’s imagined dialectic with the city comes to life in the form of an imagined society. This imagined Liverpool emerges out of the text as a dialectic of real-life and imaginary elements. The historical origins of the title and the imagined audience are discussed, and suggestions are made as to what kind of relationship the reader might have with the city. 	The book is divided into six parts. The first part discusses the real-life experiences of the author and her audience as they inhabit the city of Liverpool during the 2008 Liverpool Biennial. Part Two covers the imaginary city of the author’s reading audience in the 1990s, and the 2011 Liverpool Biennial. 	The audience in the 1990s was predominantly women, but the increasing use of technology in society today makes it possible to reach a wider range of people. The audience in the 1990s was predominantly people who were not from the privileged or urbanised sections of the city, but the new literary</text>

The title of the book ‘Transgressions’ evokes certain concepts and ideals of the Enlightenment, and the notion that one can ‘transgress' the limits of one’s place and behaviour by breaking away from traditional ideas of what is considered ‘normal’. In the eighteenth century, this meant breaking away from the established order and traditional ‘culture’. Today, it includes breaking away from the established order and traditional beliefs, but also from one’s self. 	The idea that one can ‘break free’ from one’s place and behaviour comes from the eighteenth-century French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, who developed a theory of transcendence in response to being trapped in one place for too long. By breaking free, Sartre meant creating an alternative, breaking away from the established order. And so it is that we’re told that reading is a form</text>

The choice of words employed in the title and the summary of the chapter – ‘Liverpool Biennial’ – serves to frame the interplay between the different layers of the city. The way that the reader inhabits the city is a writing that is continually, and unconsciously, influenced by the language that is used to describe it. The use of the word ‘Liverpool’ conjures up images of Liverpool, of its streets and buildings and docks, and the ferries that ply between the city and sea. But what is so enticing about the concept of the biennial is that it is capable of so many other, more nuanced and interesting conjuncts. 	When I first heard the phrase ‘biennial’ I was slightly taken aback by the breadth and depth of the potential impact that such a term could have. The broader the definition of the term, the more power that it has when drawing visitors, artists and</text>

Liverpool Biennial 2016 was curated as an experiential experience, in order to prepare the reader for the read-through that follows the publication of the book. The exhibition included ‘time-limited’ limited edition prints, a ‘deserted colony’ map, an ‘inhabitant’ jigsaw puzzle and the finished product was exhibited in a series of films, each of which was produced in cooperation with a local community organisation. The people who created the fictional Liverpool Biennial city were not, as is often claimed, aping Florentine Renaissance artists, nor were their influences like Christopher Booker or Mark Leckey. Rather, the biennial we know and love is a product of the arts and culture bureaucracy of the 1970s and 1980s, deeply imbued with the ideologies and practices of anti-intellectualism and racialisedness. The biennial we know and love is not an artwork in and of itself, but relies on the</text>

The aim of the project was to create a biennial in the centre of Stockholm with a specific mission to explore the ‘black box’ of the biennial’, namely, the curatorial system and its relationships to art and culture in the city. The system is a ‘black box’ that continuously reveals and reveals new data, methods and materials. This data is used to produce ever-larger images, projects that constantly reshape the city and, as a consequence, the world around us.

The participatory project approach is likely to have been used in an art context in an art context in an art context, but also in an urban context where people are organising and engaging with their urban environment via art projects. In this sense, the project does not merely depict the city; it builds social and political change as well. How to Live Together, François Reinaud and Asha Farid (originally from Gaza City), 2017.

One could argue that the participatory project approach is similar to that of Asha Farid, whose project Living together: Social Actions for a Sustainable Middle Class (2017) embraced the idea of the participant in an art project rather than the artist or institution. In that project, participants used art materials, scripts, and digital fabrication to create a socio-politically responsive landscape that responds to people’s needs and</text>

The artists and art institutions involved in the project were not commissioned to undertake an art project in the city, but instead used the information to produce imaginative panoramas that take the city as a whole and its streets as their subject. In this sense, the new art projects and the urban panorama they create could be seen as artifacts from a previous, pre-digital culture. While the images and panoramas produced by the artists may have a clear cultural function, their real intent and purpose is to serve a business or municipal need. The biennials of the future may not be about art in the usual sense – about art as a collective process, about art as a socially engaged art practice – but they may still adopt the distinctive curatorial form and employ the same curatorial principles and language. The art institutions involved in the project were not commissioned to produce panoramas of the city, but rather to enable artists to produce panoramas through data mining and social media. The data and imagery used in the project were sourced from a variety of sources, including art institutions, community agencies, legal aid organizations, urban planners and others with a clear interest in urban development and urban preservation.

Art is not expected to be located in a museum or a large gallery, but rather uses the information to be able to tell a story and to create a context through which to do so. The artists and art institutions involved in the project were not commissioned to undertake panoramic works, but instead used the information to produce imaginative, performative and interesting works that draw on the data, new technologies and materials that are part of the ever-expanding, ever-shifting digital society. These kinds of engagement are tools that the biennial can employ to generate new kinds of engagement with art that are not necessarily based on established art forms and have been shown or performed in many cities around the world. I would argue that the data, new technologies and materials that are part of the ever-shifting digital society are as corrupting as museums and large-scale art institutions. They</text>

Giger, who developed the science-fiction genre in the 1940s. Giger created a multi-disciplinary sub-genre of his called Post-Victorian Punk, which looked at the ephemeral precursors to cyberpunk and postindustrial society. In Giger’s words: ‘The black box is a glorified computer. It contains the human element, but more important, a hidden message that tells us what to do.’1  The concept of the ‘black box’ continues to be used in the context of computer forensics. Despite its name, the concept of the ‘black box’ is now considered a hoax, and attempts to decipher its cryptic messages have proven futile.

This was done in several ways. The most obvious was by way of the art fairies and the arts organisations that funded the projects. The Biennial Foundation organised a series of events featuring local artists whose works were then collaged together in a single image.  The Biennial also staged a public art project in the city centre called Sewn Image called Image in Bilbao. These projects were both conceived as ‘re-figuring’ projects, using the same data and technology, but in different senses. The Bilbao Re-figurators used an app on their mobile phones to trace and map the movement of each of the over 1,000 fiberoptic cables that run beneath the San Francisco Bay, taking the images as their template. They then used this information to produce over 1,000 figurative images that are mounted in the main exhibition hall of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. 2  The idea of ‘black box’</text>
    <text>reimagines the curation of a biennial in the city. The project was conceived by the Biennial Foundation, the city and community organizations and was piloted in 2017. The aim of the project was to create a biennial in the centre of Stockholm with a specific mission to explore the ‘black box’ of the biennial’, namely, the curatorial system and its relationships to art and culture in the city. The system is a ‘black box’ that continuously reveals and reveals new data, methods and materials. This data is used to produce ever-larger images, projects that constantly reshape the city and, as a consequence, the world around us. The project was also conceived to address a gap in the local artworld: to engage the local art community without incurring a conflict of interest. The artists and art institutions involved in the project were not commissioned to undertake an art project in the city, but instead used the information to produce imaginative panoramas that take the city as a whole and render its character as a series of interconnected events. The images they produced were not ethnographic in nature, but rather used data to chart the ‘black box’ of the biennial and visual artists’ engagement with it. The images functioned as a mapping tool and the ‘black box’ as a data point. The system allowed artists and art institutions to create imaginatively schematic panoramas that proposed a ‘geographical intersection’ between artists’ studios in the city and the ‘real life events’ that happen there.12. Archive, collaboration, archival resources and public access to research.

The artists and art institutions involved in the project were not commissioned to undertake an art project in the city, but instead used the information to produce imaginative panoramas that take the city as a whole and the artist as an artist to show how the city is affected by art and culture. The panoramas are produced in ‘Concrete and Wood’, a collective practice that involves architects, designers and artists from a variety of disciplines. The images and panoramas that emerge through the process are produced through a set of rules and parameters that regulate the way in which materials, shapes, architectures and artefacts are brought to life through the art and architecture of the future city. The project was also conceptualized as an ‘education’ project, with the artist as a lead educator and the city as a whole as a co-renate. The images and panoramas produced through the project, whether architectural images or urban panoramas, are produced in ‘Concrete and Wood’ and disseminated via a community website that engages with the city as a whole and the role of architecture in shaping it, with a particular focus on young people and artists.

The artists and art institutions involved in the project were not commissioned to undertake an art project in the city, but instead used the information to produce imaginative panoramas that take the city as a whole and, through a combination of data and photography, render the city as a series of disconnected points of origin. The project was an extension of the curatorial directive to photograph the city as a series of disconnected points of origin. Thus, the artists and art institutions involved in the project were not responding to a specific curatorial directive to produce an ‘art’ project in the city, but responding to a more general curatorial directive to produce culturally responsive art. Art is a social practice, and social practices often engage with the politics of power and the limits of urbanism. But the biennial also placed a premium on images that are legible; those that capture the essence of the city as a dynamic place, constantly changing and unpredictable. The image was of course not a new development in the biennial tradition, but the emergence of images of a qualitatively very different kind from the generic curatorial curatorial image, and the negotiation of different kinds of image through the use of images as data sets</text>

The images they produced were then incorporated into the 2018 Biennale narrative as part of a public artwork.[12] The project was also designed with an introduction to urban theory and its assumptions behind the scenes. The mechanism of the biennial was intended to be an extension of the public gallery, integrating art and its place in a dense urban environment. The development of the project during the early phases was marked by the continual refinement of the urban perspective, which was intended to be persuasive both in the arts and in the planning department of the city government. The development of the system required that artists’ studios and galleries set up shop in clusters around particular streets and routes in the city, in an attempt to increase the realism of their work and the accessibility of their patrons. Art was produced in urban environments to be displayed in clusters, which were then used as testing grounds for future art projects. This urban realism was intended as</text>

The black-box narrative was also a narrative that invited interlocutors – fellow artists, curators, art-world insiders and art-policy wonks – to contribute to the critique of the biennial through qualitative research or analysis. The project was not ethnically or politically diverse, although the curators undoubtedly considered their own art-historical perspectives in designing the project. Rather, the project was conceptualized as a collection of images that, when assembled, form a visual narrative – a kind of ‘black box’ – that continuously reveals and reveals new data, methods and materials. The data, methods and materials used in the project were sourced from a diverse range of disciplines, including: biennial commissioning committees, art institutions, art’s institutional research arm, the Swedish Council for Independent Curators (KCC) and KFOR, art dealers, collectors, journalists, archivists, artists and</text>

However, in some ways, in Liverpool’s case especially, the Biennalee was more prevalent and influential than the Biennale, because many of the cultural markers linked to the former still had significant weight in the city. Although the Biennalee did produce and distribute some great art and related artefacts, the overarching impact of its art was often watered down or absent from the city, and its financial model was often criticised by local communities. In many ways, the Biennalee was seen by many local artists as a barrier to the city emerging as a significant force in its own right, whereas the Biennalee often seemed to define the terms of the city’s engagement and influence. As a result, the Biennalee lost some of its thunder, while the Biennalee gained a great deal of currency.This is a very dangerous way to look at things.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Biennalee was the main event at the Liverpool Biennial, with artists, curators, art historians and artists from all over the world congregating in and around the venue. Through a series of commissioning partnerships, museums and galleries throughout the UK and abroad, the Biennalee commissioned artists from around the world to develop and design a new kind of art house for the city, one that was neither a museum nor a gallery. At the same time, the Liverpool Biennial was developing a new kind of art house through a curatorial approach, and the two art departments were biannually renewed. Curator Lisa McKay, in her talk about community arts practices in the United Kingdom, made a similar point about the relationship between biennials and art houses. She pointed to the fact that many local arts organisations, such as Liverpool Biennial, which were already established as curating and teaching organisations, as well as established regional</text>

Art and the biennial are positioned as objects of exchange, not as the end in itself, and this is the true contradiction of the contemporary biennial.  This internal contradiction can be seen in the opening number of Culture City, where the biennial</text>

In fact, the Biennalee has a far greater international following than the biennale. In 2015, the biennalee was numbered amongst the most widely read and most cited art books of the year. The book that year included an article entitled ‘How the Biennial Threatened Britain’.In an interesting turn of events, the article began: ‘Today, the biennial is not only the main visitor attraction to Britain; it is the only kind of art institution left standing in Britain after the ruin of national art infrastructure and cultural industries.’ It continued: ‘The biennial has proved resilient in the face of this new world order: it has survived the crash of the dot-com economy, the privatisation of infrastructure, the regulatory capture of financial institutions, and the political subversion of infrastructure projects.’ It concluded with a list of questions: ‘Can the biennial survive such dislocation?’It’</text>

However, in some ways, in Liverpool’s case especially, the Biennalee was more prevalent and influential than the Biennale, because it was so prolific in its publication, it had such a large following, and it had such a large artistic following too (not just in terms of works, but in terms of endorsements and visits). In terms of who was involved in the creation of the Biennale and the Biennalee, I am not sure that I can say that Liverpool did it alone, but I can say that there were other curators and artists who were involved in some way. In Liverpool, the Biennalee was a myth; it was more of a Paris-based institution that simultaneously did good and promoted itself. And in Liverpool, the Biennalee was a myth with a globalised form of signification that included places like Liverpool, and now, London, and other places in between. So it’s not just about the art being produced, but the culture being produced in relation to it.In both the case of Culture City and Liverpool,</text>

In terms of funding, the Biennalee only managed to raise £30,000 in its first year. Its mission statement clearly indicates that the project was more of a outreach tool: &quot;The Biennale is an art institution of the highest order with a cultural function in its own right. It is a vehicle for the production of cultural capital and a residence for artists everywhere to explore, analyse and perhaps remarry those cultural capital that have been slow to accrue in the name of a postindustrial economy. In this sense, the Biennalee is a relic of a former glories days. It is a vehicle that, through its mandate, often directly addresses the present and future of art and culture in an ever-shifting series of ambiguities and conflicts.&quot;[2] And it is to this extent that biennials have come to occupy a position of definitive cultural power in the city.

Similarly, in Cities, US, the National Portrait Gallery was the dominant art collector and gallery organisation in the city, while the National Theatre was the dominant theatre organisation. But in the 1980s and 1990s, there was a major re-emergence of interest in the arts and theatre in the city, and a significant number of transplants of artistic types from the theatre and gallery branches. There were also significant changes in the city’s political and economic landscape, which in turn exerted a significant influence on the kinds of theatre and cultural activity that were possible in the city. For example, the development of the prison industrial complex and the resulting loss of industrial jobs to vacant properties, the decline of the US auto industry, the advent of fracking and the associated environmental destruction all exerted a significant influence on the kinds of theatre</text>

In fact, the Biennalee holds second place among biennials in terms of impact and popularity. In a way, then, the Liverpool Biennial’s and its organisers’ commissions in Liverpool were a kind of ‘re-imagining’ of the city, in relation to the economic and social structures that generated or were shaped by the industrialisation process. This kind of ‘re-imagining’ requires a lot of planning and negotiation. It’s a project that demands a lot of resources, both to sustain and to move it, and it’s a project that is often precariously placed or stands at risk due to resource depletion. In these ways, the Biennalee and its artists were often placed in a bind, if not completely unable to take them. In this sense, the Liverpool Biennial and its artists had a kind of ‘cultural capital’ that could carry them through tough economic times</text>

In a way, in the case of Culture City, the Biennale was more influential because it presented the city in a way that was more typical of art exhibitionary formats, more typical of retail culture, and more typical of the urban environment. It also introduced a type of art buyer into the equation, which in turn stimulated other art institutions to commission more art from the city. In short, the Biennalee did more than just organise art, it generated an environment favourable to the creation of art and the exhibition of art.The biennalee is a rare case in which the artworks produced during the course of the exhibition are transferred from the site of production to the site of consumption.

In terms of funding, the Biennalee dominated both the public and private funding streams. Its public trilateralism paid dividends, while the direct public support for the exhibition gave it especial media exposure. The Biennalee staged an average of one exhibition a week, with smaller exhibitions on a regular basis. The average biennale now only offers one per city, but keeps in mind its original mission of engaging the world through art. In a time of ever-greater global connectivity, this is still the case. It’s interesting to me that, ten years ago, the art world seemed to struggle with this new media paradigm, as if it were still experiencing the initial public support for art in a critical and longitudinal way. Now, some museums and curators I know of that were once staunch biennials with occasional public support are finding other engagements and creative funding streams.The other challenge is the ever-present question of urbanisation and gentrification</text>

The relationship between art and activism dates back to the 1960s and the Watts Riots, and it is generally agreed that, whatever the intentions of the artists, the actions that emerged from the art were not necessarily intended to be taken literally or consistently. It was generally acknowledged that the art was made with a particular social context in mind, and that social context is an important aspect of activism. The political implications of this understanding of art as social context have often been under-explored, and although I wholeheartedly agree with these commentators that art has a social context, I also think that the art world tends to overvalue the social and underestimate the political.  	I would propose that there is a way of thinking about art and social change that would enable us to imagine possibilities beyond the existing order, and I would propose that the way to think about art and social change is through the tracing of history, and particularly through the use of</text>

In the case of art and visual culture, art is often used to help us to make better choices, to make better choices, by empowering us to take control of our own destinies. And this is perhaps what the contemporary art market seeks to accomplish: to make us better off by encouraging us to accumulate more wealth through consumption. The problem with the modern art market is that it demands that we become consumers of things: commodities, objects, images. And so the contemporary art market produces a feeling of economic dependency on the worker: producers of images, artists, writers, etc must all be dependent on each other. And so the relationship between the artist and the consumer has to be reciprocal. A common language must be developed between producer and consumer, exists- less the artist having to negotiate the terms and conditions of consumption with the market. The artist has to negotiate the social contexts, the economic and political obligations that come with being an employee</text>

I believe that the power lies in the hands of the people, and that the people can take back their cities.Art is not always directly political, but many of its practices clearly (and vigorously) reject the political. In fact, some of the most progressive and forward-looking art today is aimed at supporting and enabling communities. For example, many contemporary artists and curators are artists who have graduated from artist-run or artist-funded schools of contemporary art’s pedagogy. These schools, which often work in collaboration with local communities, offer residencies and apprenticeships in curating, art making and art promotion. Many of these new community-based arts institutions are founded on the shared belief that they can become what artists and curators like to call ‘transformative partners’ in the arts community. Some local curators and artists gravitate towards these institutions, while others choose to support local communities and create local alternatives. In my proposal, the term ‘community arts institution’ is frequently used synonymously with ‘community based organization’ and has come to refer to a locally oriented arts-funded</text>
    <text>The project is a speculation on the memory of the past, but it is also a declaration of the future. The future is a city in which people can be transported, yet which still needs to be a city in which, once again, individuals can make their own choices. The choice to live in a city is a political and economic one, and the person who makes that choice is likely to be affected by the decisions that are made in the city. It is a choice that can have significant social consequences, and the social consequences are likely to be quite different from those that might be imagined. The question that remains is which of these possibilities are valuable. The museum that I propose might be able to help make the city, but it would not replace the city. It would make some choices, but they would have to be made with the support of the city and the community. I believe that the power lies in the hands of the people, and that the people can take back their cities.Art is not always directly political, but it is frequently influenced by politics in interesting, subversive or even helpful ways. In an ideal world, art would do away with the political and ideologically-driven motivation for art making. However, the power to make a good art should rest in the hands of artists and the community. So, we have to ask: what is the political purpose of an artist’s work? Is it really the artist’s political purpose, or is it the community’s political purpose? I believe that the political purpose of an art project is often misunderstood or misconstrued. Often, the political aims of an art project are the same as those of the local government, and the local government gets a cut of the profits. So, the political aims of an art project may be very different from those of the local government. For example, Puritan artists were not interested in building up the Puritan church or the Puritan community. They were interested in building up the Puritan community</text>

I believe that the power lies in the hands of the people, and that the people can take back their cities.Art is not always directly political, but it is often deeply political in its engagement with power and authority. It is often a form of resistance to authority, and sometimes a form of empowerment. In that sense, I’m not trying to tell artists what to do. I’m interested in the ways that power might be subverted, and how that might empower creative people. I’m interested in how our contemporary aesthetic of art, spectacle, is often confused with the world of communities, and how that might affect our understanding of our own and others’ lives. I’m interested in the ways that power structures can be dismantled, but also in the ways that those who resist those structures may themselves become complicit in their demise. For me, the most valuable art is that which seeks to establish a space for negotiation and negotiation, for which there are clear and controllable alternatives. The work of art is often apolitical, but it often seeks to render possible alternatives by bringing forward creative people who</text>

In the case of Biennale Barcelona, the Biennale was partly a response to the city’s crisis of cultural and urban decay, which was partly caused by a Biennale that was partly a reaction to the crisis of urban life in the city. The Biennale Barcelona website reads: ‘The Biennale was conceived as a way to recall the past, to make connections with the past and to imagine a future».3 This is a tall order, not easy to achieve in a city with such a long and rich history. The Biennale itself is often divided into discrete episodes, such as a gallery, a museum or a school, which often set up shop outside the city, and ‘Special Events’ such as ‘Dazzle’ and ‘Phantom’ which take the city by storm.4 But the important thing is that the Biennale</text>

For example, the Occupy movement began as a direct reaction to the destruction wrought by the market in New York, but quickly shifted tactics. It is no coincidence that the artworks that have come out in response to the destruction of NYC were created by and for the Occupy Wall Street movement. The art markets that we have created and continue to create are likely to be influenced by the politics of displacement and the politics of access. It is also no coincidence that the art that is being produced is being led or supported by people who are likely to be politically active in the future. The art market might not like what it is seeing, or might even try to suppress it. We need to decide which of those two things is true. 	 Art has a political toolkit. It is likely that the art market will continue to support candidates for office whose platforms include recognising the importance of art in our democratic society</text>

The important thing was that the art be made in a way that resonated with the powers that be. The power brokers understood that the power to be had in a new city was expanding at a phenomenal rate, and that the art that was being made threatened not only the power of the state, but also the symbolic meaning attached to the state. The reason why the museum became so important was that it housed a huge collection of works from all over the country, which made it possible for artists to experiment in all these different settings. With the end of the war in 1973, a lot of the young artists were able to move onto other careers. Many of them went on to great things after that, but there was a tendency, at the time, to marginalise or forget them. The power brokers understood that the power to be in a city was much more elusive and unstable. There was a reason why</text>

I believe that the power lies in the hands of the people, and that the people can take back their cities.Art is not always directly political, but it is often politically charged, and art has always been an essential part of resisting domination. In the case of the Pop-Up Arts movement, there is a powerful tradition of artists and arts workers resisting institutionalisation of artmaking, often through direct action. The power of the artist lies in her or his art finding a home amongst working-class and rural communities, and in these communities the power lies in the hands of the community to ensure that their needs are taken into account when planning and designing the city. But the museum is not just any museum. It is an institution recognised not only for its artistic worth, but also for being a recognised art form. As such it should be freely available to all, and its collection should be recognised by every organisation that seeks to incorporate it into its teaching and cultural portfolio. I believe that the power of the artist lies in her or his art being able to find a home amongst a broad range of audiences, and that the museum is a particular site</text>

The power of an artist is not in question, but the power that lies in the hands of the city lies in the hands of the inhabitants. The museum that I propose is not a place where the artist’s identity is kept secret, but it does exert a tremendous amount of control over what is learned about the city and its inhabitants. The museum becomes, in effect, the local repository of the artist’s cultural contribution. It becomes the stage on which the artist makes his or her cultural contribution, and the museum becomes a site of the making of that contribution. This is not to say that the museum should be apolitical; on the contrary, apolitical behaviour is likely to be indicative of tendencies towards authoritarianism. But the museum is a site of making, and the making is often tentative, even unstable. Its focus is on the</text>
