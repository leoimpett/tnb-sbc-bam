The mapping app Titan is a perfect example of how we can reclaim lost and mischievous freedoms through the use of maps. Titan learns where you are located based on where the battlefield is located, and uses this information to predict where the next bombing might be. This kind of massive, time-intensive data collection is not only un-innovative, but can actually save lives. For example, a bomb threat in the UK in the 1980s would have ended a person’s day. But a bomb in Afghanistan in 2011 might have begun a new person’s day. Titan learns where you are based on where the conflict is located, and uses this to predict where the next explosion might be.

It does this by gathering information from a variety of sources including, but not limited to: insurance claims records, shipping manifests, real-time Twitter feeds, satellite imagery, aircraft fly-by-frequencies, and more. It then uses machine learning to detect patterns in these huge databases that predict, among other things, where explosive materials are located and how quickly they are defused. These kinds of deep learning implementations can learn to identify patterns, and in doing so can pick up on subtle variations in the environment that scientists have identified as important for protecting against terrorist attacks. For example, the way that pollution is classified in the UK may differ from the US, and the classification may be affected by political and economic factors. Thus, the kind of analysis that Titan does, and the tools that</text>

Titan was one of the first mapping apps used by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and its mission was to collect imagery and define 'space' according to 'national security' considerations. The app was developed in cooperation with the Department for Digital, Culture, Sports and Science (DCAS), and was used by the military and security agencies around the UK. It was also used by journalists and theatre companies. At the time, the app was free and had a paid version available for users to 'pay as you go'. The NGA hoped that the free version would supplement the imagery and define toolkits provided by the service providers, and allow the surveillance of activists and political dissent. Users were invited to create an account and begin providing imagery and define spaces in which to work. At the time, the app was also used by the National Theatre, whose members included many</text>

One could argue that the use of big data in this way is also part of a wider public space, and is a public good because it is so disruptive of the assumed normality of data gathering and delivery. As the saying goes, ‘Big data is good because it is invisible’. But is that really true? If you take away data, what does that make you? If you take away knowledge, what does that make you do? If you tax the citizen, what does that make you do? If you quarantine things, what does that make you do? And if you remove the blinders, what does that make you do? What do you do when you no longer see the world through the filtered lenses of data?</text>

In ancient times, Oceanus was the supreme being, and the gods deliberated over the distribution of power between the realms of the ocean and the realms of man. Over time, individual Titan gods changed their names in an ongoing process of generational renaming. As a result of this generational renaming, Titan and Oceanus were no longer supreme, but the roles of the sea and the land shifted back and forth between the two planes. This kind of massive, time-intensive data-gathering is part of what William James would call ‘the great cosmic loop’. It is part of what Benjamin Bratton would call ‘the epiphany’.

Titan began life as a site for photography and sculpture, and became a data-mining tool, collecting data about where people were at all times, and using this information to offer a variety of services, including but not limited to: a) mapping out terrorist networks; b) providing legal advice to businesses accused of breaking the law; c) mapping out social networks; d) providing data on how often people used public transport; e) providing mapping services to the media; and f) providing mapping services to businesses that hire journalists and photographers. Titan has gone on to be acquired by Facebook, and is now part of the Facebook Data Sciences lab.4.

Titan is a map app that looks at billions of points of similarity, and allows users to search for a city, town or village, or any combination thereof, by name, street address, or combination of places. It does this through a massive, multi-stage, data-gathering process that collects information on where the object is located, how long it takes to get there, and what kind of infrastructure exists in that city or town. Then it uses this information to predict what kind of explosion the next object might make. And, like all good map-makers, it also uses this information to make money selling that object.The point of having accurate, reliable information is to serve as a buffer between people and to other, larger systems. But a city-wide, data-gathering process that begins when the object is first encountered and ends when the object is destroyed is a structure</text>

The European project to map Europe began in 1988 under the leadership of the United Kingdom’s then Secretary of State for Enquiry, Lord Roberts, who stressed the vital importance of a complete map of Europe as a weapon in the European campaign against Nazism. The map making coincided with an ideological co-campaign against national identity, and it was under this shared ideological framework that the racist ideas of national identity were being actively obscured. The map-making process required skilled typographers and cartographers with specialist knowledge of European layouts and forms to create layouts that would be suitable for commissioning by the Home Office, but also required knowledge of</text>

For example, the concept of nation has been frequently associated with territorial claims, but research has shown that nation building is actually a process that associates certain people with certain kinds of identity – a kind of identity politics. So reclaiming the mythical nation state is a need in contemporary and historical contexts. What is happening now in the world is that states are becoming more and more like cities, and people live and work in ‘infrastructures’ and ‘regions’ where infrastructure is built specifically for their use. Cities are becoming macroscopic, with their dense, suburban-like form and their tendency to collapse due to lack of demand or development, but they are also increasingly</text>

The project was funded by the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Energy, and was overseen by the Department of Research &amp; Innovation. Its success led to the establishment of a similar project called CONTAC, created in 1987, which was also funded by the commission and managed by the Department of Research &amp; Innovation at the University of Liverpool.1 	The question of where to draw the line between civilian and military technology is a sensitive one. While the UK and US share a border with very limited access to technology, a de-emphasis on military uses of technology in civilian settings is common in other parts of the world. An example of this is the UK’s decision to re-industrialise itself in the face of an</text>

Titan has a map app that helps users locate the nearest Whole Earth Network (WEN) office, and a widget that lets users know if there is a bomb threat in their area. These kinds of sophisticated datagathering tools exist in every toolkit, but few people know or use them. In this lecture, I will show you how to use them, and show you how to map them. You will learn how to create a new Titan map that combines data from different sensors, and use Titan’s powerful programming to map the Earth using GPS. I will show you how to connect all the parts to make a whole, and show you how to assemble four individual maps into a complete one. You will learn how to assemble maps from sensors, and then connect them together to make a 3D map. You will learn how to assemble 3D maps into 3D models, and then</text>

And that’s really interesting, this idea of the collection as a way of revolutionising the museum: because at the time the museum was already feeling the effects of this radical curatorial approach. It was becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a future for the museum without a curatorial presence, and so the radical curatorial intervention was necessary to address the paradoxes of the contemporary urban environment. Sometimes a biennial can be quite effective at addressing a paradox, because it’s so opposed to what we would consider an ideal that we have to change because it’s impossible to maintain. But the essential contradiction of the contemporary urban environment is precisely what Joyce and her fellow-travelers in The Proclamation referred to: what is it to live in contradiction to what? Is it really possible to inhabit two worlds at the same time? In other words, contemporary art today is actively engaged with the contradiction that art (as an art form) places at the centre of our cultural histories. It’s trying to reconcile two conflicting ideas of what it means to be contemporary, and so the exhibitionary character of the biennial is a response to that tension.  On a personal note, I’m</text>

And that’s really interesting, this idea of the collection as a way of revolutionising the museum: because at the time the museum was already feeling the effects of this radical curatorial approach. It was becoming increasingly difficult to imagine the museum as a legitimate place in the city, which is to say, difficult to imagine it as a place where conflict doesn’t arise. But the curatorial approach to the collection as a whole can. And there are of course also precedents for this in museums around the world. I think that the way in which the collections are organized, the way in which they’re democratised, is really interesting in that it creates a space where conflict doesn’t arise. If we take the collection as a whole as a whole, which is what I imagine most curators do, this radical curatorial approach is a common place in museums and art institutions around the world. It’s part of what I call the ‘biennial condition’: in other words, it leads to that which I described as the moment of the biennial as a whole. It coincides with the enormous physical increase in volume (animal and documenta collections alone),</text>

And that’s really interesting, this idea of the collection as a way of revolutionising the museum: because at the time the museum was already feeling the effects of this radical curatorial approach. It was becoming increasingly difficult to sustain the work, and the biennial was no longer the museum of the moment, but a place where images from different points of view were combined to form a larger idea. So I think the collection as a concept becomes more complex. It’s not just an image, and an image is more relatable, more transferable and conveys a certain level of importance to the viewer. In curatorial work, the collection becomes a metaphor – a way to talk about and represent the world as a collection of objects. When you open a museum today, you probably don’t see a museum anymore, you have a gallery or a display of objects, but you’re seeing a museum made up of various kinds of exhibits, arranged according to a theme or subject matter. And the gift that the museum gives is a metaphor for that world. For example, the gift of the forest is a metaphor for the social, economic and political changes that result from deforestation, and</text>

It was becoming increasingly difficult to imagine the museum any longer as a static space, but rather as a place that presents a set of relations between people. That idea and the curatorial approach that was put forward allowed the radical curatorial approach to become more fully expressed, allowing a space for the collection to take over the museum. One could say that the collection as a collection of objects was the key to this radical curatorial approach. This collection-as-art world opens up a whole new perspective and approach to the museum, allowing us to question and disturb the museum’s static form even further.Art is a collection of contradictions. One might add, however, that some of the most beautiful art of the world is actually meant to be distressing, or even oppressive. We see this in the collection-as-art world of the contemporary artistes: the collection as an object of everyday use, its values embedded in everyday objects. We don’t necessarily see this in the collection-as-</text>

But the curatorial intervention that was put forward wasn’t enough to bridge the gap that was opening up between the collection and the museum, so a lot of the artists and curators who came to the Biennale were also put off by the fact that the Biennale was put under the same administration as the museum. The same people were putting together the same exhibition again and again, each time in its own random way. The idea that the biennale could be an extension of the museum was always going to be precarious, but the curatorial intervention could have helped to define the parameters of the biennale.

And what happened was that over time, the collection started to grow larger and more diverse, and this gave the museum an incredible amount of flexibility: it could become something that reflects the city, or it could become something that creates space for a community to come together and process the city. And I think that in a sense, the collection as a collection of objects, or objects, is the museum’s original form. It started out as a collection of individuals, and as a collection of images, and images, and as such it has this incredible capacity to mingle with the city. A collection of images, or an object-like set of images, with a social function.

It was curatorial intervention that came from the ground up, and it was that kind of radical curatorial intervention that continues to this day.It was also a curatorial intervention that came from the ground up, and that is to some extent what we do today, in many ways more effectively and affordably than we could ever imagine doing anyway.

And so the collection was a way for the museum to function as a resource – it became a way for the curatorial approach to be reconfigured in order to meet the demands of the metropolis. It allowed the collection to intervene constructively in the metainterface, allowing for the creation of a new context of ideas and experiences through which the museum could be formed, one that doesn’t necessarily represent the city as a fully realised and realised future. This is why biennials can be so influential in changing how art is presented, how people think about their cities, and how cultural practices are organised. Because they are the exception to the rule, and while they’re the curator of the museum, artist, administrator and collector of ideas, they also have the task of revolutionising the museum as a political act</text>

I think that a lot of the real creativity that was put into the city really came through when artists, community organisers and designers came together. Those people brought a different sensibility to the process. It was a community effort, and it was a response to the fact that the museum was fragmented, lacking in resources and lacking in identity. The way in which that was expressed was through the collection – it wasn’t just the collection, but the whole city was a collection – and it reflected an idea of the city that was in conflict with itself. It wasn’t just a collection of architecture, but a collection of social histories and contradictions. And that’s really interesting, this idea of the collection as a way of revolutionising the museum: because at the time the museum was already feeling the effects of this radical curatorial approach. It was becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a future for the museum without the collection, which was framing what the museum was becoming. But the fact that the collection itself became a space for conflict and conflictiveness – a place where people could find that kind of language, that kind of experience – that is really interesting and radical, and I think that was the curatorial approach. It wasn’t just curating the architecture, but the whole museum was being curated by a curatorial team, and that was revolutionary in a way. That is, at the time, in my estimation.Curatorial movements don’t usually get a lot of play, or are they completely ignored? I don’t think so. But the way in which the collection was being curated was radically different to anything that had been done before. The collection of artefacts that were to come out of the museum, the collection of archival materials that would be donated to the fair, the collection of photographs, the collection of document</text>

It was becoming increasingly opaque, even to a layperson like myself, and the reason for that was the collection, which was the foundation of the museum. I had just come off a three-month research project at the Museum of Modern Art, and I was wondering what the MFA Museum was like, and how it was different from the collection, and the collection as a whole. As a visitor, you’re not just there to be photographed, but also to witness a spectacle – and the spectacle is the coming-together of disparate parts of the city in such a way as to be able to draw people’s attention to a particular event, and thereby initiating that event. And so the collection became a site for that radical curatorial approach. That was the vision of the curators, and it worked. The collection has its moments of lucidity, as appreciative parents might wish, but it also has a quality of its own, a quality of its own irrelevance. That�</text>

His idea was that cities today were produced through a process of global metapolitics that sought to reshape global capitalism through a combination of national capitalisms and multilateral institutions. In other words, cities today are but props in a global metapolitics that seeks to endow them with a public sphere that can be abused, corrupted or otherwise utilized in a variety of ways. In other words, Sanromán sees the city as a source of wealth that must be constantly (accurately) controlled. Cities now play a larger and more prominent role in the global economy, but they also contain significant portions of the planet’s immense fossil fuel resources. Therefore, it is vital for the survival of the planet as a whole that the city be maintained in such</text>

It is rich in natural resources, rich in biodiversity and one of the few places in the world with a climate that accurately predicts both rainfall and elevation (with averages of more than 10,000 m above sea level). In recent decades, however, environmental degradation and conflict have become endemic in the region; large parts of the Amazon are in the grip of a vicious circle of over-exploitation, a high rate</text>

In her book The Peruvian Amazon: Economy of Forgetting (2015), she makes the case that the rapid growth of modern infrastructure, fueled by fossil fuels, is unsustainable and that urgent action is required to address the issue. She argues that although modern infrastructure may be able to handle unforeseen disruptions and challenges, the inherent conflicts that arise when attempting to deploy that infrastructure inevitably fail.According to her, the reason for this is simple: unlike in other environments – where people are able to take steps to mitigate damage – humans have pre-conceived notions of what is possible, and are therefore unable to react to such damage constructively. She describes the pre-conceived notions as ‘sloppy thinking’</text>

But there is an obstacle in the museum: who is entitled to see or think about the things that happen there? If the museum is seen as a place of permanent historical significance, then the question of who is entitled to see or think about it arises. In other words, the museum as a site of historical significance is something that constantly reshapes and is reshaped by the kinds of power relationships that it supports and enacts. 	And this is what biennials can do: they can establish permanent historical narratives, histories, even biennials themselves, through their collections, exhibitions, research projects and so on. This is why biennials are so important: because they create narratives that are reanimated through time and so create a kind of shared historical moment with other moments in time. 	But this kind of ‘present’ – the kind that we inhabit, live and think about in everyday life – is always at odds with the kind of ‘past’ that we inhabit, live and think about in the past.

But there is an obstacle in the museum: who is entitled to see or think about the things that happen there? This is the second leg of the equation: the perceptions of others. If we start from the assumption that the museum is a complex artifact of the cultural history of the world, and that the social is always at the center of that history, then the museum is then a set of social relations. The social is always at the center of making and witnessing the world, but the social must also participate in making and witnessing the world. As we move away from the assumption that the museum is a static site of meaning and experience in which the social is at the center, and start from the other extreme, where the social is constantly shifting and reforming the museum, the social is constantly questioning what it is entitled to and who is entitled to see and think about the world. 	When the Arab revolutions started in 2011, and the huge public reaction to them, a lot of people started questioning who is entitled to look at the news, what is and is not allowed to be</text>

But there is an obstacle in the museum: who is entitled to see or think about the things exhibited? If the things seen or read – texts, for example – are not ‘exactly' what we would consider to be the true ‘present’ then who is entitled to see those texts? If the museum is to retain its institutional integrity then it needs to be able to present a diverse range of ideas and to ‘think beyond the museum’, i.e. to engage with the institutional limitations that prevent us from seeing the things we ought to see and think the things we ought to think? This is why biennials need to engage with the present, and not merely the past, in order to evolve and to constantly question the boundaries of power, culture and knowledge. It is this engagement that biennials demand of the hosts, the museums that commission them, the public that patronizes them and the world at large. It is this engagement that biennials have to deliver to a wider public through art, literature, events, exhibitions and so</text>

But there is an obstacle in the museum: who is entitled to see or think about the museum? Who is entitled to engage with or theorise about the museum? Who is entitled to learn or analyse the museum? These questions call for critical reflection. I think these are questions that need to be asked and resolved in the present moment. The moment of the museum as a site of political, economic, social and cultural power, and the moment of its current political organisation. In order for these questions to be asked and resolved, a critical mass of scholars, artists and museum patrons need to come together and collectively demand that the museum change how it presents the past, present and future of the world. This is not a project for intellectuals or deep curators; it is a project for everyone with an interest in art and history. It is a project for everyone with an interest in the history of art and culture, and for everyone to engage with and make sense of the cultural possibilities generated by the digital revolution.

But there is an obstacle in the museum: who is entitled to see or think about the things that happen there? Who is entitled to learn, to revisit, to participate in the cultural life of the city? A museum is an institution that exists to be studied, and so the museum becomes the site of historical study not just within its own parameters but also outside them. It functions as a site for the study of power, knowledge production, participation and so on, but it also has to be accessible to those who want to study its contents but don’t have access to a museum. In this sense, it falls outside the museum building and so is subject to change through its unpredictable financial model and so on. 	But what if the museum were to cease to be a museum and become something else? What would become a museum is subject to change; it is always subject to appropriation by powerful interests, which is why it remains so popular in certain contexts but is falling out of fashion elsewhere.

But there is an obstacle in the museum: who is entitled to see or think about the things exhibited? Who is entitled to speak about these things? ‘The museum is like a complex urban infrastructure that is constantly subject to deformation and change: cracks being repaired, leaks being fixed and the contents of storage tanks being replenished’. ‘The reason why biennials have difficulty in capturing the real sense of events is that the art is invariably meant to be seen as a response to the problems being addressed by the infrastructure.’ But the infrastructure, as we all know, can never be truly seen as addressing problems. Instead, it must be actively engaged in finding new ways to accommodate and accommodate the people who use the infrastructure. And so the biennial is always meant to be an intervention into the maintenance of the social, both as a site and as an infrastructure. The real work of the museum, then, is in fact the work of art decimation – the task of art destroying the institutional capacity to contain, manage and adapt to the social. 	</text>

The role of the museum is to observe and ‘think of things’, to bring to life the past, to speak of the past and so on. What is at Stake in the Present, in other Words, Is Present in Context 	When we speak of the past we often use an object or set of objects to represent things as they actually happened; we may describe specific events as having taken place, or bringing to life certain imagined past ‘tendsencies’. A monolith is another good candidate. 	When we speak of the present we tend to use what might be called an idealized vernacular, idealized in part to capture the essence of the historical tendency towards the present in concrete settings. 	The vernacular is a set of ideas and practices that capture the essence of a historical tendency towards the present in a concrete set of objects and persons.</text>

But there is an obstacle in the museum: who is entitled to see or think about the things that happen there? Who is entitled to appreciate the way in which the museum is continuously (regardless of what is being produced or displayed) reinvented and reinvented in response to changing circumstances? And so we experience what Richard Florida calls the ‘cult of the spectacle’ – the spectacle is perceived as fundamentally ‘contemporaneous’ with ‘the next big thing’. 	This phenomenon is particularly evident in culture and media studies departments at universities, where the traditional institutional routes of higher education no longer apply. The rise of social media and its effects are felt in all spheres of the arts and culture, from curatorial and exhibition management to student life and so on. These new technologies make it easier to identify and to talk about art happening elsewhere than ever before, making it easier to imagine new art happening in and among us, and making it easier to imagine things ever changing (locating and identifying, of course, but also being noticed and so on</text>

The museum is a space for a particular set of people; it is not a place for everyone, and so who is entitled to see or think about the things that happen there is often constrained by what is seen or thought to be possible. 	As a museum, the museum is sensitive to this kind of dynamic. It is the site of a flux: there is much that is remembered and much that is not; there is a moving of time and place. And so the museum constantly seeks to redefine what it means to be a museum, and how it is visible and what it means to be a part of a community. In other words, the museum is both present and contemporary in its own way, but simultaneously ‘different’ and ephemeral. It is both a site of making and of taking place simultaneously within and outside the museum. 	The museum is sensitive to this dynamic, and it is this sensitivity that underlies the museum�</text>

These questions both render the museum as a site of domination and yet also the site of resistance. The museum is both the site of power and the site of liberation. The museum is both the locus of historical research and a site of interpretation. But the museum is also the vestige of a system of economic necessity and commodification, which is itself itself the legacy of colonialism and white slavery. The museum is both a site of memory and a site of habit. The museum is both the site of power and the site of negation. It is both the material scaffolding of whiteness and the spiritual absence of blackness. The museum is constrained in its capacity to record and theorize and encounter, while simultaneously being shaped and worked by it. It is neither the root nor the effect of colonialism. 	There are various possible responses to the first condition, the staid oblivion that characterises the museum today.</text>

The report also suggests that computer algorithms be used to identify patterns in images and text that could aid in the discovery of hidden objects. Such systems have been around for a while now, and while they may seem arcane and mysterious, the report suggests that they are often used in areas of the art world where citizens have a strong sense of smell, like cinemas. In fact, the report suggests that ‘machine learning’ algorithms be used to recognise images that are staged in ‘public or private settings’ where there is a ‘good faith belief that the image will be seen by a community’. 	Such is the  Art Lab’s</text>

Invited by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the University of California, San Diego, I traveled to Berkeley, California, where the California Institute of the Arts is building a new computerised sculpture and graffiti detection system. The system will be able to analyse more than 1,000 images of text and imagery and produce a 'fingerprint' that can be matched to objects in the scene – allowing artists to instantly and unambiguously identify what they are looking at. 	The system will be able to detect objects at a distance with 99.9999% accuracy, according to a prototype report by the Berkeley Art Lab. 	The Art Lab hopes to have a working prototype of the system ready by the end of 2014. If successful, the system will replace human curators and art educators with computer-programmed artists who operate out of offices, schools and garages. 	A computer program that studies images, texts, sounds and symbols is capable of mimicking the effect of a human touch with remarkable efficiency. However, despite recent technological breakthroughs in data mining and machine learning, the capacity of the art project remains largely unfulfilled. The reason is that artists primarily engage with the artefact in its textual form, rather than its physical form, such as when painting, engraving, creating logos or creating beautiful packaging. As a result, the capacity of the art project is often frustrated by a lack of new artists who are drawn to the task of creating meaningful images on a computer. 	Recently, however, a number of artists have shown an interest in using computer-programming to create artistic work. These projects typically exploit a computer programming challenge found in certain programming languages, such as BASIC, Java, and Python, to create interactive multimedia experiences that can be shared between users. For this reason,</text>

Computer-programmed art will replace the art teachers and artists who used to work with students in a traditional way, according to one report. The system will also lead to new forms of collaboration between artists and the communities they work with, as well as new ways of approaching the problems that confront urban dwellers at a moment's notice.  	The report produced by the Computer, Image, and Network Library (CINE) in conjunction with the City of Berkeley outlines the findings of a year-long investigation into a series of vandalism dubbed ‘The Shadow Map Project’ that occurred between 2007 and 2009.

The system will allow artists to create and roam spaces more fully realized through their work, while also providing the underlying infrastructure for future autonomous art projects. It will enable curators to engage with the rapidly emerging field of computer-programmed art projects through a research project that seeks to understand how art is created and what kinds of social and ecological effects such engagement can have. 	Art as art’s social function – creating shared experiences through interaction – is increasingly being understood as a fundamentally different kind of interaction than what we would consider natural and social interactions. Art as interaction creates new kinds of understandings of how the social is enfused with the machine, and how art is the socialization of social situations. In other words, the technology that creates art is not just an expression of technical know-how; it is</text>

The system will operate in conjunction with the California Human Centres Initiative’s Digital Signatures Project, a $100,000 federal pilot project that aims to train computer-programmed artists to create expressive sign language for print and visual media. 	The new curators will not only have expertise in their chosen field, but also in representing the possibilities of artificial intelligence and computer simulation in art and culture, in creating virtual or augmented reality experiences through which cultural practices can be reconceived in order to address larger social goals. 	The system will automate the processes involved in image processing, text analysis, and graphic design in order to produce high-resolution representations of documents, images, and objects as representations of human culture.

The system will also enable the automated identification of figurative works of art and art’s installations in real-time via satellite imagery – a capability that has only been attempted before in places such as Iraq or Afghanistan – by monitoring the activities of large corporations and wealthy individuals. 	The Art Lab hopes to have the technology ready for public use by the end of 2015. 	In a larger context, this could extend to envisioning a future where biennials and other art forms became less dependent on corporate funding and reliant on the artist’s and curator’s consent. 	Art is a human-made artefact, and as such is subject to the same kinds of social and ecological processes and impacts as any other natural resource.

There are many questions regarding the impact and capabilities of new media on our contemporary society and cultural practices. The impact of new media on the art and culture of the twenty-first century is likely to be even more controversial and polarizing. Despite the historical and current ubiquity of media, there is still a great deal of cultural relativism and reductionism about what counts as 'real' media – particularly in Western cultures. In the age of the Internet and social media, art and culture are seen not as commodities but as core constituents of contemporary humanity. This is a mistake, says Bergson, because it weakens our sense of cultural identity and makes us less distinctive: ‘Art is the contemporary incarnation of the “classic”, which means it goes beyond the art</text>

And so while the bits and bytes of information do make appearances in the form of symbols on a screen, they don’t make up the whole picture. Nor do they represent the entirety of the picture; nor are they the whole picture – there is still a kernel of truth to be found in the fabric of the human brain. And so while the graphical interface might once have been the interface of choice for artists, it is becoming increasingly difficult for those with a particular skill set to design a fully realised piece of software.

I hear the call: ‘Architecture is made up of Buildings’, and ‘Building is made up of Surfaces’. And I’m thinking of how the Architectural Association’s Building Process, which is itself a system of support services for a city, is itself a social enterprise. It’s a partnership between the city and the association, encouraging and supporting it in various ways – providing guidance on design, providing space and financing, organising community events, and much more).I get the sense that the architects’ role is to deliver information to the planners, making design decisions that will have a significant impact on the lives of residents and visitors to the city.

And so what makes a neural network valuable is its ability to understand how to produce outputs – to generate knowledge – but what it can't produce is knowledge itself. That leads to informational asymmetries – how do the systems of a social network produce and share knowledge? – and to informational poverty. This is a particularly thorny problem in a social network because the users of the social network are often unaware that they are using the social network and don’t realise that they are using a product that’s based on the social network. So how do the users of the social network empower themselves?In the 1980s and 1990s, social networks tended to be highly individualised and focused on individualised members of a given community. The advent of network protocols allowed for the spread of information across networks, creating a virtual banding together of people and objects. But as information technology became more pervasive and cheap (cheap enough to be imported into low-end consumer electronics), the social networks began to seek collaborative solutions to cross-pollinate resources and users. The goal became individualised user-friendliness – giveaways to resources and information – and this eventually led to</text>

It leads to what I call the ‘ambiguous interface’ and the black box problem. The ambiguous interface leads to what I call the ‘metainterface’ problem.

And so some of the things that we think of as art are in fact deeply imbricated with social processes that not all artists are aware of. And so what artist or director might be able to disrupt this informational asymmetry? Maybe what we don’t pay enough attention to is the cultural forms that they embed within.Art has a huge historical and contemporary cultural dimension to it. And so we tend to underestimate how deeply art has embedded itself in our society – how much of its current cultural potency derives from its historical and contemporary associations rather than its more conceptualised content. And so there are these forms of understanding that we don’t have that connect to the events of a particular moment in time – for instance, between 1971</text>

There’s a tension there – the ability to produce knowledge but the inability to share that knowledge – which is what I call the learning curve. And so the learning curve – the point where the capacities of the individual components of a system meet – becomes problematic. And so there’s a split-second where the capacities of the system encounter each other. And so there’s a continuum of potentialities between the moments at which a conflict arises; and so there’s a gap of potentialities between when a conflict arises and when it goes away. And so there’s a learning curve – that is, between when a system encounter conflict and when it doesn’t. And so what happens on that learning curve is potentially unpredictable, and so we have to be extremely careful about how we design systems</text>

It’s not so much the computations that make up the neural network as the way in which the network is constructed: what is it made up of? And so what makes a neural network valuable is precisely what a neural network is not able to produce. And this is precisely what I mean when I say that a neural network is different from a computer. A neural network is made up of many pieces, and so what it is able to produce is different from what it is unable to produce. For instance, a neural network that produces images of cats performing stereotypically timed learning tasks such as recognising faces recognisers would be different from a neural network that produces images of people performing stereotypically timed memory tasks such as remembering names or faces.

And so what makes a work of art is that it allows its practitioners to participate in the production of knowledge? That comes from a European point of view, but it also comes from a local point of view. And so what makes a work of art is that it allows its practitioners to produce knowledge; that comes from a difference of perspective.

But what makes a painting truly great is that it’s able to employ diverse forms of representation – that comes from a local point of view.And so what we see in contemporary art is a proliferation of these kinds of connections between disciplines – whether it’s in the</text>

It created a public space where people with diverse views and positions could come together and develop solutions to difficult problems. And it gave birth to a new art form: the  	Open Source Ecology painting. The Open Source Ecology painting is an open and affirming image that illustrates the holistic relationship between knowledge and beauty, social good and environmental protection, community and natural resources, public and collective creativity and self-organisation. It is an extraordinary achievement in the history of social and cultural theory, and perhaps one that social scientists should continue to document and analyse.

Artists and designers’ participation in the system design was in part an expression of their gratitude for the invaluable contributions that had been made possible by their work on OpenStreetMap. The contribution of an artist to OpenStreetMap is a rare and powerful experience, and the creation of an OpenStreetMap project is an artist’s unique and powerful way of bringing together people from diverse walks of life, drawing upon that artist’s unique and powerful combination of knowledge and engagement. It is a complex relationship, and while the two might initially differ in their understanding of the world, they also often have very different needs and desires. The system design that became OpenStreetMap would allow artists and designers to create a map that is not just an image, but represents the actual place and time of the place and time where they live, working, playing, sleeping, eating, shopping and much more. This approach to artistic and creative agency was incredibly exciting to me, and enabled a new kind of understanding and negotiation between the public and private sectors, between public and corporate, between public and indigenous peoples’ places, and between public and arts institutions. It also opened up the possibility of incorporating innovative and socially engaged art practices into the system design, much as the biennials had done in the 1970s and 80s. The challenge for artists and designers is to be imaginative and flexible, and to react to changing needs and desires, while maintaining an understanding and appreciation of the present as past. 	In a broader perspective, this new understanding of the present as past must address the systemic and economic effects of new media, and the broader transformation of urban environments that is about</text>

It is a complex relationship, and while the two might initially differ in their understanding of the world, they also often have very different needs and desires. The system design that became OpenStreetMap was not an art project in the traditional sense. It was a system that enabled an artist to provide a service to a larger community. 	The system design became OpenStreetMap was an art project, and as such it naturally evolved into an art project, with contributions from many artists, designers and community organisers. The system design became OpenStreetMap2 was a more traditional management system for artist-created open-access mapping projects. The community was expected to adopt the system design and implement the innovative community initiatives as part of the project’s process. In doing so, they would become part of a long-term, collaborative, and recognisable legacy.

It is a complex relationship, and while the two might initially differ in their understanding of the world, they also often have very different needs and desires. The system design that became OpenStreetMap offered several significant advantages over traditional mapping applications: a) It connected directly to and depended on current developments and societal changes; and b) It incorporated user-generated information and data so that it could be updated dynamically and adaptively with the changing needs and desires of users. In other words, it allowed for new uses and possibilities without imposing a strict or rigid order or system on the users or other users. For instance, the routing of rail and bus routes could be automated and software installed in bus and rail cars to route traffic according to user-generated data. This kind of flexible and adaptable mapping is becoming increasingly important in the age of GPS and satellite navigation, which both rely increasingly on user data; and c) It enables the deployment of new technologies that monitor and capture data in real time, enabling new ways of inhabiting cities and far-flung places. For instance, sensors embedded in the city bus may collect and transmit real-time data to a server in the cloud, enabling the</text>

It is a complex relationship, and while the two might initially differ in their understanding of the world, they also often have very different needs and desires. The system design that became OpenStreetMap is the result of a collaborative process between the artists, the OpenStreetMap contributors, the OpenStreetMap project and the local area. Though the system design evolved independently of one another, the artists and the OpenStreetMap project all contributed to the overall design. The system was ultimately developed in response to community feedback, incorporating user-generated data, and artist-driven annotation and mapping. The system was designed with input from local area governments, educational institutions, businesses, community developers, users and other interested parties. It is the result of many months of user-submitted design proposals, qualitative research on the area, and was built using OpenStreetMap and CreativeTime. 	Once the system design was complete and ready to use, it was time to actually use it. The system allowed residents to create and participate in maps, and allowed the public to contribute to the design of the area through editing the boundaries, making street improvements and more. The system was also used as a data-mining platform</text>

It is a complex relationship, and while the two might initially differ in their understanding of the world, they also often have very different needs and desires. The system design that became OpenStreetMap was not an end in itself, but part of a process that sought to empower the people who made and edited the maps, so that they might engage with the urban fabric of their location and influence the development of their neighbourhood. The system design was not a magic bullet, but rather a means to an end, and the end – the development of infrastructure, the shaping of neighbourhoods, the creation of … well, you get the idea. 	There are of course many ways of approaching infrastructure, including privatising it, creating innovative hybrid schemes or even devolving such powers to local authorities. But what is clear is that as a share of overall urban policy-making, the sharing of infrastructure fell far short of the demand, while the share of new housing units and new offices far exceeded supply. As a share of GDP, the share of housing units and offices grew, while the share of new housing units and offices went down. And in many cities, the share of new housing units and offices did</text>

The system design that became OpenStreetMap was artist-led and collaborative. The system design that became reality was the work of many people, including local communities. The emergence of such a system in Toronto coincided with the city’s massive population explosion, which created opportunities for large-scale urban renewal projects in the core areas around the lake. The development of the system came at a time when many other countries were upgrading their urban renewal and regeneration policies in response to a rapidly urbanizing world. The arrival of large numbers of migrants during the 1920s and 1930s also stimulated the establishment of transit-oriented development in the port cities in the port of Toronto. These developments, which pushed the city’s traditional industries underground and into the suburbs, created powerful displacements of local people, who were often newly arrived workers. 	While the development of self-governing local government in the port cities of Toronto reflected the needs of large corporations, many of these agencies employed large numbers of people, mainly of colour, who often struggled to</text>

It is a complex relationship, and while the two might initially differ in their understanding of the world, they also often have very different needs and desires. The system design that became OpenStreetMap was artist-driven and user-driven, and the cultural and community designers had a hand in its development. The collaboration and exchange between the different stakeholders that became part of OpenStreetMap was a powerful event for their communities. The end result was a shared set of boundaries and parameters that defined the current shape of the system, and the creation of new networks of shared paths and places that link neighbourhoods and the wider urban fabric. 	The cultural sector played a key role in this process, and their involvement in the system design resulted in a finalised design that better represented the neighbourhood and the city. These new networks of paths and places were not made simply of street and alleyways, but also included cultural resources, used bookshops, coffee shops, art galleries, used car dealerships and other elements of the cityscape.

It is a complex relationship, and while the two might initially differ in their understanding of the world, they also often have very different needs and desires. The system design that became OpenStreetMap eventually sought to meet the needs of the artists who created it, while the artist’s contribution remained largely a discretionary matter. The creation of an OpenStreetMap project is not an easy thing to quantify, and while the numbers add up, they can also vary widely. The total number of active projects is hard to determine, and as more and more people participate, the total number of ‘real life examples of cities doing things differently’ grows. It is true that the number of buildings with OpenStreetMap data grew from two in 2005 to eight today, but the architectural definition of a ‘metropolitan area’ has stayed roughly the same. The number of OpenStreetMap contributors also keeps growing, as do the number of architects and urban planners who contribute to the project.

We did workshops, commissioned exhibitions, produced a community website and set up a number of events including a home-made Christmas market outside Lennon High School in Barkingly, outside Dudley Town, where people would bring gifts or buy things from the local shops, and a community garden outside the school that was part of the Primary Landscape Architecture Programme. All of that was about enabling people to come into the space, find out more about the history of the house, and engage with the art through what we produced and invited them to do in exchange for their space. It was a more direct way of intervening, and I think that was the whole point of it: to make the community part of the process, rather than a passive observer. It wasn’t Christmas, it was Holidays, Hanukkah, the Puranas, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Guy Fawkes Day, and so on. But it was about giving something back, and inviting people to participate in the creation of the house in some way, so that it wasn’t just a space for the privileged to be present in and consume the richness that was</text>

The flour resource was an absolute no-go area, but the flour gift was okay – until the bakery refused to make any more. Art was used as a tool to help set up a bakery, but at the same time the bakery was using the art project to look for work. The flour resource was an absolute no-go area, but the flour gift was okay until the bakery refused to make any more. Now the flour gift is gone, and we want to be able to sell bread anymore?

The market itself was a collaboration between the local community and the artist; shoppers, locals and visitors came from all over. The market itself was a success, so much so that the artist decided to open a second stall inside the store. I took the opportunity to interview the artist, who was very forthcoming with his or her age and gender, and other personal details. After the initial pitch, the artist and I had a chance to talk about how the project came about, and how it happened to not being commissioned. Rosie: The story of the tree and the community is one that many people don’t know, or don’t want to know. It was a direct result of the way that the media was covering things; it wasn’t just due to a lack of interest. It took years to build a base of support and then build public</text>

The residency was partially funded by the Arts Council, and part of a three-year, £1.5 million research-funded project funded by the Arts Council, which was also supported by the Biennial. The Arts Council also funded the postgraduate programme, with the hope that it would support the future work of the Biennial and the future of the John Moores/Liverpool School of Art.

The objectives of the project were: 1. To capture the essence of the historical migration of the English language from the ‘English language core’ of the ‘British Empire’ (originally, to take up residence in ‘the East India Company’, or the British East India Company’s other corporate entities) to the ‘English language periphery’ of the ‘British Empire’; 2. To create a public realm in which to explore the historical migration of the language of the ‘English’ from the City of London into the City of London’; and 3. To map the social and political histories of the language of the ‘English’ in the City of London and the British Empire.When we started, the artist was Polly Brannan, herself a London-based artist who had recently completed a short documentary on the site of her father’s photography.

It all started with the Community Land Trust, which is run by a Community Land Trust executive committee and a Community Land Trust Board of directors. The board is made up of neighbours and members of the community. The committee meetings were held at the bakery, so that neighbours could learn about the project before the project was fully implemented. There were also workshops for the Community Land Trust workers who would deliver wood, nails, screws, rope, duct tape, glue or whatever to the site where the houses are made into chapels. The workshops were very hands-on, with people literally coming out of their houses and into the workshop spaces, installing or repairing things, and then coming back out again. There was a big sense of community behind these projects, and so all the artwork was commissioned by the community – not just the facade, because that would have been too modern and</text>

We did workshops, commissioned exhibitions, produced a community website and set up a number of events including a home-made Christmas market outside Lennon High School in the city centre. It all came together to form what became known as The Community Arts Initiative.This was the era of the Community Arts model in action. And while it did have a feminist edge to it, the fact that it was art was still central to who the people were that were engaging with the project. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Community Arts movement was made up of artists who were drawn from the arts schools – where people were encouraged to be creative and engage with art in a way that would be relevant to the work that the arts schools produced. I think that the way that the Community Arts movement was traditionally organised was that there was a director who supervised artists and the work they produced, and a group of artists who were part of the network who produced the network. The director would lead the way and the artists would join the network as it went along. It was an artist-run network: you’d never know where an artist might be heading. And</text>

We did workshops, commissioned exhibitions, produced a community website and set up a number of events including a home-made Christmas market outside Lennon High School in Liverpool, organised by the local residents' organisation. It all happened at a time when the climate in Anfield was so hostile that even Michael Heizer couldn’t bring himself to come to Anfield anymore. We all felt so strongly about the need to come to Anfield, to give the Biennial a chance and just to have a look around. We thought, ‘This area is dying. We’re the last generation of people left here. Somebody has to be here to enjoy the area.’We decided to call it ‘The Anfield Home Tour’ and started doing it every year until 2009, when the Biennial took over. This was the point when the Biennial’s management team was trying to get the Biennial to take over the whole city, to take over Liverpool, so that by the time the Biennial was done, the neighbourhood would be redundant.

I think there was a real sense of engagement with the community from the artist and his or her team. It was an art project, but it was also a community effort.At the end of the day, it was still just the art: a process of making that tree manifest through text, photography, video and more. But the empowerment that came with being part of a community really helped to drive the process. That is, the support of the local residents and community leaders who enabled the making of the tree and empowered the people who lived and worked in the neighbourhood. That kind of empowerment and power could not be more different from that of an artist or a community organisation. But both of those are often at odds with each other. The artist has to negotiate the community to achieve what they want, whereas the community can choose to collaborate with the artist in interesting or even creative ways.  	If I could give any advice to an artist trying to work in a local</text>

It’s as if the City of London were trying to tell the story of the tree each time it was illuminated, in an attempt to capture the essence of each tree and the way in which they functioned as workbenches or storage or something.I thought, then, that the art project that we were trying to initiate didn’t involve the artist as an artist; it involved the community. And so the idea morphed into something more collaborative between the artist and the community. We did workshops, commissioned exhibitions, produced a community website and set up a number of events including a home-made Christmas market outside Lennon High School in Barkingly, outside Burton Transport, in the village of Leigh, and at the local shop, where people offered gifts and made local Christmas cards. The market in Leigh also doubled as the local branch of the tree.This took on many forms: tree lighting parties in the village, tree-planting at the local high street, tree-sitting at the Elephant &amp; Castle, and tree-sitting for the local council. The council did a tree-sitting excursion, too, and for the local council, it was a way to get a sense of what the community thought of the building. It was a way of saying, as Ken said, that we’ve all got in this together, and we’re all part of a team. It became a way of saying, over and over again, that we’re all in this together.

But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities are the legacy of colonialism and capitalism, and the biennale is the crowning achievement of a century or more of colonialism. The biennale is the pinnacle of a social hierarchy: it represents the social significance of the art and the cultural resources generated by the infrastructure of the city. It is an institution that emerged with the express mission of stimulating public and collective cultural investment in the city. By connecting to the past, the biennial can frame the present in a narrative that is both about the infrastructure of the city and of colonialism itself. The biennale is a social enterprise that engages art's potential as a social resource and its potential use as a social platform.  The biennale has emerged as a media- and venue-systems event. It is the largest and most internationally visible of its kind, and it achieves this through a large staff of artists, curators, artists’ assistants and support staff. It is possible that the biennale could one day be funded</text>

But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities and their biennales are major enigmas of our age, and their displacement threatens not only our biennales, but the very notion of urbanity as a shared, interrelated phenomenon. The biennale is an institution that emerged fully formed and fully integrated into the urban landscape, and today exhibits the force of this urbanisation. The biennale is the dominant form of cultural exchange leading to and through the city, and it is here that different cultural actors engage with, interact with each other and make infrastructures of space. It is a site of collective imaginaries, and it is an essential part of any theory and political-ideological site.  The biennale needs to teach, of course, and this requires work that is both scholarly and engaging. The scholarship of the year’s edition of the Biennale needs to be informed and directed by those engaged in planning the biennale, but it also needs to inform and inspire a collective of</text>

But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities are complex places, and the biennale’s ongoing, in-depth, public (and institutional) engagement with the city is a significant and continuing input into the city’s future.  Its ongoing, public, in-depth engagement with the city is a significant and continuing factor in the development of the city. The biennale’s public face is an important element of its value, and the building it houses, the exhibitions it hosts, and the filing cabinets it opens day after day is a vital part of its symbolic power. But the biennale also needs to be a functioning, autonomous entity with a programming policy that is not dictated by the city’s politics or the whims of institutional resources. It needs to be able to react to new situations and shift priorities. These capabilities, which are often under-appreciated or under-valued, are the legacy of the biennale. The biennale is a bureaucratic operation, but it is</text>

But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities are made up of a set of relations, and the interaction of different forms of space is a key site for the emergence of new forms of experience.  As a museum, the biennale has a unique place in the city, not just within the museum that it is housed in, but also as a site for other cultural activities, for example, ‘cultural tourism’ and the like. It provides a check against the city, and thus a site for the making and the experience of new forms of space.  The biennale has made a difference. Whether in its building and infrastructure, in the collections it maintains, or in the collections of its visitors, the biennale is a site of encounter. It is a site of making, of making in new and unexpected ways, of making in the here and now. It is a site of archaeological, archival, cultural and historic research, public programs, public events, and, of course, the making of ever</text>

But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities now have an engineering and urban policy sense that is informed by the biennale, and this in turn has a dramatic effect on the development of the built environment. We need institutional changes if we are to change the world we live in, and the ways in which we live out our urban destinies.  The biennale’s current institutional form is a valuable vehicle for what is happening now, and for what is to come. It is a continual source of information and a guide to the ways in which we can change the city. It is a marketplace of ideas, and its current form is a powerful source of inspiration and a force for change. But it cannot sustain itself as an independent entity, and it cannot function as an art institution or an architecture institution. The biennale must find a way to create new experiences for its diverse audiences, and it is this heterogeneity that makes it unique. The biennale must find a way to infuse new life into the city</text>

But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities and their biennales are a significant part of our urban future, and we need them to grow in power and influence. If we do not value the role they play in shaping the city, then our own role will be limited. This is why institutions, including the arts institution, are often more responsive to the interests and ideologies of the city than the local communities they profess to serve. It is also why, in the case of a city with a large arts community, the biennale is a significant driver of cultural activity and biodiversity. It is a form of public display and a venue for public exchanges of ideas and experiences. It is a public forum through which the arts can assume a significant political and deliberative role in shaping the city. The biennale is a public act of visual culture making, because it is both invisible and relies on zero-tolerance policies to prevent ‘publics’ from disrupting the show. The logic of these controls is to ensure that the public</text>

There are many other institutional forms that can and will be affected by the changing forms of the biennale. But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities are made up of many different layers, and different actors have different levels and roles within the city. It is not enough to say that the city is a biennale destination; one has to go beyond that and create a different context, one that takes into account the different layers and layers of the city. It is also critical that the city has a public realm that is not dominated by just a few mega-exhibitions. The City of Toronto has done an incredible job of organizing events into different levels of the city, and has done an incredible job of adding value to the biennale’s public realm through its many levels of tourism. But it is up to others to innovate and make the city a different experience through events, cultural enterprises, and low-impact ways of organising things. This is what the Biennale in Venice has done phenomenally well, and what the Italian pavilion has done exceptionally well. It is up to other biennales to innovate and make</text>

But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities form as a result of it, and as a result of it, the biennale.  A question that must be asked and answered is: What next? As the biennale itself becomes ever more dispersed and transient, and as its geographic location in Istanbul changes, so does its role and mandate. And this is a very real risk for Istanbul’s future. The biennale is a global phenomenon, and as such it necessarily affects other parts of the world.  The biennale needs to be a place where the lived experience of art – and, by implication, the art of art – circulates, in order to sustain the infrastructure that creates and relies on the art of art. The biennale needs to be a place where the museum becomes an integral part of the city, in a continuous and unequaled way. It’s no exaggeration to suggest that the biennale is the museum of the future city.  Biennales – and art institutions</text>

But the fact of its existing is a significant enabling mechanism for what is happening now. Cities now need to find a way to work with the biennale, and that can mean finding a place for it in education, government, or any number of other sectors. To do so, they need to be able to create a biennale that reflects the city’s dynamic and creative mix of places, yet is distinct from other forms of cultural exchange and experience. In other words, the current institutional form must change in order to accommodate the new dynamic. This is true for all forms of cultural organisation, including the biennial. But the biennale in its current form will most likely remain a small node in a larger cultural chain, and a relatively inaccessible node. This is because the institutionalised form is so often involved in generating, justifying and supporting a form of experience that is most advantageous to a specific form of art, yet is also advantageous to society as a whole. The biennale is a form of institutionalised experience that emerges organically from a larger culture-making</text>

The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the internet allows so many older models of infrastructure to be replaced with new more efficient ones.As an example of the way in which the internet is changing work, consider the early days of social media. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter existed primarily as a way for people to connect; to post pictures and share stories. As new media became more accessible and more personalised, we began to share more and more things between ourselves via these platforms. We began to organise events, engage in cultural exchange and engage in much broader forms of self-expression. And all of this was possible because people were able to connect through social media. But as new media became more and more pervasive, it became ever more imperative that we all had access to all of this information and could participate fully in it. And so, all of this information became part of the globalised and computerised economy that we inhabit.All of this new information meant that it was possible to identify trends and identify repeat performers – which was critical in</text>

But there is still a long way to go, and there is a reason why new technologies are constantly evolving, replacing old ways of doing things. The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the design paradigm demands constant iteration.  	What has become clear over the past couple of years is that there are times when it is more desirable to collaborate in a formal or organisational setting than to collectively solve problems through one entity. This is particularly the case when there is a multi-disciplinary or multi-lingual team working on a particular problem space, such as healthcare, education or transport. But when it comes to autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles, the answer is still to a large extent organisational change. That is, autonomous vehicles would have to be highly skilled and well-structured, and also very different from what we have today. 	What is needed is a long-term vision, a long-term perspective, and this is what I propose as a new paradigm for thinking and acting collectively. It is a paradigm that takes into account the fact that we’ll always need more resources and that there are bound to be critical infrastructures and social needs that we</text>

The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the technology demands continual improvement.Open source is a concept that has gained a lot of currency in the last few years. It is often used synonymously with ‘sharing’ – a concept that is very much in vogue these days. But ‘sharing’ is only part of the equation. In order to achieve truly peer to peer effects, knowledge needs to be shared – knowledge needs to be harnessed creatively and horizontally across multiple platforms, platforms and datacenters. The underlying principles of how information is distributed across the social web are of course deeply flawed, but sharing is at least partly about sharing what one has learned. And in the age of the autonomous vehicle, smart homes and connected devices, it is increasingly important for the sharing of knowledge to happen organically across multiple platforms, platforms and datacenters.In this context, sharing is a natural extension of the notion of what David Kessler calls ‘the sharing economy’. Sharing is defined as the combining of different kinds</text>

But there is still a long way to go, and there is a reason why new technologies are constantly evolving, replacing old ways of doing things. The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the internet makes it possible for people to contribute and replace themselves. The reason why new regulatory structures are prone to fail is that they are unable to cope with the scale on which these disruptive technologies are occurring. In the long term, this is likely to mean that the very existence of these systems is threatened. But unlike other threats to the socio-political systems that they purport to serve, the failure of autonomous systems does not necessarily mean that the citizens of a city will be forced to accept a dystopian future in which citizens are cogs in a machine, live under surveillance and control, and are frequently unemployed or homeless. It is likely that the autonomous systems we are developing will be adapted to meet the needs of a much wider range of users, and we will need to work with and leverage the knowledge of diverse users in order to build robust, responsive systems that work in all environments.Getting a sense of just how difficult it will be to build a fully autonomous future in the US and UK, I visited</text>

People used their Facebook credentials to access the sites, but not everyone could access the sites. The initial Facebook user base was relatively rural in terms of population density, and the primary reason for this was due to overcrowding on the web servers. The rise of social media and the global mobile phone meant that a lot of people had lots of friends, which made it easier for people to connect, and so on. But as new technologies became available, the infrastructure of the web became more and more capable of handling the traffic. And so the web became ever more like a massive application that could be deployed globally, where borders didn’t exist anymore. The application layer became the weakest link in this equation, and so the web became more and more like a distributed system that couldn’t be hacked. And so the web became ever more like a P2P network</text>

But there is still a long way to go, and there is a reason why new technologies are constantly evolving, replacing old ways of doing things. The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the research and development process encourages experimentation and innovation. But there is a limit to how far these processes can go. The more we share, the more data we create, the more patterns we uncover, the more precise our mapping algorithms become. And as we all know, this sharing inevitably leads to new kinds of relationships, which leads to new kinds of knowledge. And as we all know, new kinds of knowledge are notoriously elusive. If you want truly complete and replaceable AI, you would need to create fully replaceable AI, which is still far from being possible with currently in development or prototyping stages.  	What is at Stake in the AI Bubble? Will it Survive? 	One of the first questions to go through when looking for replacement for humans in AI is, will it still be humans who run the future? Many would argue that it already is, and that replacing humans with machines is a given; that is, unless something drastic is done to alter the underlying trajectory of</text>

But there is still a long way to go, and there is a reason why new technologies are constantly evolving, replacing old ways of doing things. The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the design community makes them so difficult to deploy and to change (see: Airbnb, GitHub, Wikipedia, Uber, Spotify).  	Knowledge is power. But new technologies are different from old technologies in that they are constantly (almost) reinventing themselves. The reason why Facebook continues to be such a powerful tool for mobilising knowledge is because, unlike any other form of knowledge, it is malleable and malleable. Users constantly seek out and discover more about the platform – new features and functions add value to the platform because they add value to users – and this is a fundamental change from the way in which most online services operate. This gives users the ability to detect and mitigate the risks of becoming part of a platform, and to maximise the benefits of the platform through innovative design decisions.  	In the age of the AI and machine learning, it is imperative that services that read or create userdata actively seek to understand userdata in order to deliver useful, differentiated or</text>

The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the internet demands constant upgrades. ‘New technologies’ are prone to fail, and that is why governments and non-state actors, including non-state actors such as terrorist groups, must protect us from their malignant effects.  	In an ideal world, every behaviour of the users would be fully transparent and replicated across all the nodes of the network. But this is not always possible. The role of the artist is to imagine that there is always enough capacity in the network to support the users’ purposes, and that is why new technologies are constantly evolving. But there is a problem with that approach: new technologies constantly need maintenance to keep them from becoming obsolescent and corrupting. And so, the dystopian future becomes ever more dystopian, until there is only ever a chance for the artists who created them to choose between continuing to be users of the technology or becoming creators of a new future.

The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the software is critical to their success.If the underlying assumptions about the future are right, and the technology exists today to implement those assumptions, then it is almost certain that there will be catastrophic consequences – but fortunately for us, there are ways to adapt and mitigate such outcomes. A technology that is deployed regularly and constantly is a multi-tool, and that is why it is so useful today, notwithstanding whatever the inevitable failures. A singularity is likely to occur, and new possibilities will be created constantly. In addition to enabling new possibilities, a multi-tool technology supports a collaborative and iterative process of creating alternative possibilities through its various operations. Therefore, it is imperative that the assumptions about the future be demonstrably wrong. If the underlying assumptions are shown to be wrong, and the technology exists today and can be adapted to meet them, then there is a decent chance that a community of users will develop alternative, more positive and valuable uses for the technology. But if the underlying assumptions are proven to be</text>

The reason why new technologies are constantly evolving is that they are prone to fail – and that is why the open source and collaborative nature of the AI community means that new technologies are continually being invented and improved.  	So the longer the technological roadmap for the future is marked by positive technological outcomes for the majority of humanity, the less people will want to live in virtual or augmented reality. The reason why is that when the next positive technological outcome is achieved, people switch to the next thing. Instead of building new tech every time there is a new positive outcome to be found, the AI community needs to find new ways of organising knowledge. New media of sharing and new ways of organising knowledge are the only way that the AI community can maintain a positive technological trajectory. The collective will to remain human is the only way to ensure that the technological outcome does not negate the collective will to become fully autonomous.  	The collective will to become fully autonomous is the reason why open source research is what it is. The more open source information is made available, the less people need to know it, and the more knowledge flows across the shared networks</text>

The name came from a movement of selfies taken during a demonstration. The movement gained momentum when a black man was killed by a police officer. In response, a community of activists demanded an official name:  	Black Lives Matter. So the acronym was changed to stand for Blackened Lines. Later, when a white supremacist came to town and declared himself the new ‘ police chief, things got very political. So the line was again changed to something more recognisable, and the movement name returned to  	Black Lives Matter.The power of symbolic change is powerful, and Black Lives Matter is a powerful example. But it’s also true that when symbolic change is illegal, it’s also true that that symbolic change is illegal. The Black Lives Matter movement didn’t invent the concept of community, but it did claim that community is at the core of our struggle for equality and liberation. And when the police state comes to town, it’s a community that is at the centre of defending itself. So these are the tricky issues that we have to be aware of, and that everyone is carrying around in their back pockets.</text>

The response has been phenomenal, and it’s now part of the US flag.I was in Rotherhithe recently, and while I was in the city, I was wondering what local organisers of the Biennale might do if the Biennale became an international phenomenon. I’m thinking of museums, archives, art fairs, and even homeless camps. The organisers of the Biennale might also set up a local outreach agency or charity. And maybe artists might set up residencies or small businesses around the movement. But what might be left behind? I wondered.The Biennale’s success is a combination of luck and foresight.

The movement quickly escalated, and today nearly a half a billion people use the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter2. And it continues to be supported by global movements of people seeking justice for black people.One of the most beautiful things about being an artist in the United States is that people treat you like an artist. They view you as an artist with skills that they can use. As an artist, you start to understand how community members can take creative action in a way that you didn’t understand was possible.

In response, a community of activists assembled in the local shops and online, using the handle BlackLivesMatter. The name stuck, and today black lives matter. The movement has been translated into several different languages, including several US official languages. The Black Lives Matter movement is multiracial and global, and its members are visible in many cities across the world. The Black Lives Matter movement is multigenerational, and its members are in many ways local to their origins. I think that in this moment, the name is starting to wear thin. I think that the new battleground for identity is the home front.And I think that the tools that enable us to access those neighbourhoods are the very same tools that enable us to create other kinds of battlegrounds, including the kinds of battlegrounds that are blurring the lines between citizen and resident, citizen and citizen.

The Black Lives Matter movement began as a hashtag, and has since been a movement of actions, sometimes violent, that aim to bring attention to police violence and discrimination against black people. The name came from a movement of selfies taken during a demonstration. The movement gained momentum when a black man was killed by a police officer. In response, a community of protesters set up a community kitchen, where they ‘re from, what they’re doing, and how to ‘re [sic] support each other’. The name comes from an African proverb, but refers to the act of coming together as a community to achieve a common end. A hashtag is a concise way to think about a global phenomenon, and the community kitchen initiative is an expression of that. It was started, and continues to be run, as a ‘community’, using the handle @BlackLivesMatter. The hashtag refers to a long-running and ever-expanding movement, and the community kitchen is a subset of that.

The name came from a movement of selfies taken during a demonstration. The movement gained momentum when a black man was killed by a police officer. In response, a community of activists coined the term, and within a year, a movement emerged online to change the name of the protest. The movement gained momentum again in January 2016, when a white supremacist killed two people at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina. The re-christening of the movement as #Resist died a quiet death, but the name stuck.Now, #Resist is a punch line, a jingle, a slogan and a Twitter trend. It’s become a catch-all term to describe a range of perceived threats to liberal democracy. In recent years, the movement has focused on issues of race and social injustice, protesting the proliferation of free college education and housing, as well as a lack of representation of people of colour in higher education and law. In many ways, the term reflects the times, a globalised capitalist economy and constant global race to the bottom.

In response, a community of activists began using the name in a collective voice, and engaging with it constructively on a daily basis. The movement snowballed, and today ‘Black Lives Matter’ is a globally recognisable slogan across North and Latin America and the Middle East. In 2015, a movement to reform the criminal justice system in Baltimore started using the term ‘Jailbait’ on Instagram, a term that literally translates to 'young lady’s breakdancing shoes’. The movement gained momentum again when a white police officer was killed in the line of duty, and became a rallying cry for African-American men and boys to stand up for themselves and challenge the criminalisation of their communities. A movement to re-name shipping ports in the UK started using the namewhite slur ‘Ship Canal’, a term that roughly translates to 'fucking ship’.

In response, a community of protesters set up a ‘corner shop’ where the dead man’s remains could be taken for burial. A community-based arts and humanitarian organisation was set up, with the bodies taken to local cemeteries, and the artworks commissioned by the local authorities and community organisations. The group’s mandate is to dismantle institutional racism through direct action, and the use of arts and culture to address social ************** issues. There are around 5,000 Community Arts practitioners in the UK, and aspires to be more than that. In 2016, the Black Lives Matter project was rebranded as Black Incarcerated Movement (BLM) Project, and in 2017, Black Youth Project at U of T was renamed as Black Education University. Both organisations were established to re-appropriate the tradition of black power in the criminal justice system and the arts sector towards projects of empowerment and contribute to the debates and discourses surrounding race and justice in the UK.6. </text>

The movement then took on a life of its own, and continues to be made visible by those who use the hashtag. The Black Education Movement began in Chicago as a blog, and has since been a movement of actions, sometimes violent, that aims to bring attention to educational inequities and poverty in black schools. The blog became a platform for more direct action, and the action has spread to New York, Los Angeles and beyond. The Black Education Movement is a global phenomenon. Its stated intention is to ‘reclaim education’ through ‘school reform’ through ‘school improvement’ through ‘school improvement plans’, but its real aim is to ‘rebuild the future through [its] multidimensional participation’.1 	Similar to the actions of Black Lives Matter, these projects are complex and dynamic, and can</text>

The district would also establish partnerships with local businesses to provide training in the production of eco-friendly plastics and eco-friendly buildings from the area.All of these kinds of ‘manufacturing jobs’ exist in the district, but their development is hindered by the lack of skilled workers. And although these kinds of jobs certainly pay well, they don’t pay as well as the kinds of manufacturing jobs that come with the knowledge that comes with owning a business, in terms of the social costs of the transition to work. Entrepreneurship isn’t all that comes with the new socially integrated economy. The work that comes with that knowledge is different. And so the amount of social good that comes out of these kinds of businesses is really dependent on the amount of social change that’s brought about in the district. The kinds of jobs that</text>

These are the kinds of jobs that can be done by unskilled workers. The fact that these kinds of ‘manufacturing jobs’ can be done by educated workers seems counterintuitive. But the upshot of this kind of upcycling is that the jobs leave the city and are replaced by other kinds of jobs, and the wages increase. A recent study of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system found that the in-house innovations that reduce pollution and increase transit reliability have come at the expense of the kinds of transit that are needed for the system to operate. These include bus rapid transit, which replaced the need for engineers and planners with commuters, reduced wait times at stoplights, and innovations that reduced the need for drivers by allowing passengers to pay for their way in the system. All of these can be done by trained workers. The question becomes whether the upcycling of the right kinds of knowledge can be pulled from the city’s raw materials, or whether the only way to build new knowledge is to rely on the very workers who build the city’s infrastructure.

The fact that these kinds of ‘manufacturing jobs’ are done in China and not in the United States or in a nearby port city such as Liverpool, makes the idea of a ‘high-tech hub’ quite different from that of a traditional auto plant or electronics plant. A traditional ‘high-tech hub’ exploits the shores of Lake Merritt for its critical mass, which enables critical mass production and sustained high-speed processing. The idea is to be able to quickly deploy materials and robots to meet the demands of these new, high-volume consumer products. But these new ‘consumer products’ demand far more energy than can be produced from the shores of Lake Merritt. If the production of eco-friendly plastics from the shore of Lake Merritt becomes a reality, along with the production of high-performance motors from the production of electric motors, optics and cooling systems from the production of electricity, then the city could become a self-sustaining source of cheap plastics.

The fact that these kinds of ‘manufacturing jobs’ can be found in the heart of the city where so many of the problems facing the city are caused by pollution is a huge step in the right direction. But the district still has a long way to go before it starts to make a difference. A district that manufactures eco-friendly plastics and starts to do real things with those raw materials is a district that actually manufactures those parts that are used in the city. Real action, as opposed to what is usually done in the background, takes root and becomes systemic. Making those parts actually does start to happen. Making those parts actually does start to feed the system, generating new jobs and generating new revenue streams. But the district still has to figure out how to feed the system and how to pay for it. Right now, the district is too dependent on oil, gas and the few remaining coal mines. The district still needs to figure out how to feed the system without becoming a national joke. Making those parts actually does start to cost a</text>

But the district would only ever produce eco-friendly plastics and that’s it. The district would never produce anything else. So what would be the role of art in this context? If the district only produced eco-friendly plastics, then why would the artist have to produce an art project that addresses the social effects of a greener economy? Why would the city invest in creating a district around a community of artists? Why would the artist have to lead a community in a project that raises awareness and inspires action? Why would the city invest in creating a district around an arts venue? Why would the city invest in creating a district around a community of young people?

The district would also employ 1,000 workers in the production of biopolymer materials from the area, sending them to the international market. These kinds of ‘manufacturing jobs’ can only happen in the district, where the jobs are created and created are made in the district. In other words, the district is the island. These kinds of manufacturing jobs don’t just exist in the district; they are made inevitable by the ‘industrial machine’.The industrial machine certainly doesn’t want you to know about it. So the machine keeps quiet. It doesn’t want you to know about it; so there is no reason to think about it.

And finally, these kinds of ‘knowledge-producing jobs’ can be found in the most urban centres, making them ‘metrojobs’. Making and consuming rubber from the ground up, in other words, would make it possible to expand the city’s infrastructure, from the roadways to the rooftops, and to a greater extent, to the biennales and museums of art and architecture.  And here's the rub: while this kind of infrastructuralism makes economic sense, it doesn’t make economic sense in the way that capitalism does.  Because while infrastructuralism may make economic sense on a micro-level, on a macro-level, it doesn’t make economic sense either.

The fact that these kinds of ‘manufacturing jobs’ are coming from the periphery of the city, from the outskirts, in response to the periphery’s economic mismanagement, in the face of a city that is increasingly identified with the production of raw materials – materials that come from nowhere and have no fixed use – is a new kind of miracle. Yet these kinds of ‘manufacturing jobs’ are precisely what the periphery is struggling to create, creating what Matthew Arnold calls the ‘peripheral fantasy’ – a kind of imaginary construct that is both real and impossible within the city.1  Arnold, Matthew.

A lot of the growth in the area has to do with the creation of low-wage, temporary jobs in restaurants, retail and other service occupations. These kinds of jobs allow a lot of people a break from the churning production of things like tires or bricks. But they don’t create enough growth to feed the growing number of people who inhabit the area. The district would also set up a partnership with the American firm, DTE Energy, to set up a ‘Smart City Network’ that would monitor and analyse the environmental and social conditions of the area. Beyond that, the district would set up its own research and development organisation, employing 1,000 workers. These are the kinds of clusters where things can happen fast and loose ends can be collected.

The fact that these kinds of ‘manufacturing jobs’ exist in the Bay Area only serves to underscore the inaccessibility of the area, and the persistence of these kinds of work in the area even after the city’s development has stopped. When the factory that makes the tyres for the cars that drive into the city smokestacks, the impact on the local environment isn’t going to be any better than when the factory that makes the cars does. In fact, the biennale’s production of real goods, as opposed to the production of toys, would still dominate the market. But the key here is that the biennale is thinking in terms of the production of goods rather than of abstract ideas. And here is where the similarities between the Biennale and the City come to mind. The former conjures up images of factories and mines; of lost opportunities and of dead cultures. The latter conjures up images of art galleries and urban plazas. And it makes perfect sense.

One can look to the future and speak with future generations, speaking through the events of the past, but this only serves to build the very future one hopes to live in. So how do we as individuals and communities can begin to reimagine the future we want to live in? One could argue that there are different futures for different parts of the world, with influences from different parts of the world, and that this is already happening in the Egyptian pyramids today. But this only serves to build a larger, more inhumane world we will live in. How can we as individuals and communities begin to create a different world? In the case of the pyramids project, the answer is: you can. The importance of this cannot be understated. The pyramids are a product of policy, and as such, they are a product of the various ways in which governments, rich and poor, have interacted with the city. When the pyramids were first being planned, there were different political motivations behind them. In the United States, the financial incentives for the project were made explicit, as was the desire of the French government, while in other places</text>

The future has to be lived in with or without the pyramids, because it is there that the conflict for existence takes place.   Another option is to look to the present and ask, how can we work towards a future based around caring for the planet and helping others to live fulfilling, beautiful lives? This is the approach taken by philosopher Martha Nussbaum:  Arafat Hashemi [sic], a term that refers to the part of the Palestinian Authority that is in possession of the antiquities. From its beginning the Palestinian Authority has sought to acquire the pieces of the historical memento of the pharaohs and other antiquities to make way for a future Palestinian state.1 The Palestinian Authority is an independent political entity that emerged out of the Palestinian Authority Authority for Life (POAL), a plan for statehood that was rejected by the Israeli state.2  It seeks to establish a national park in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, along with the</text>

This is what the Biennale was about in the 1980s and early 1990s: engaging with questions of identity and the future of a community of people formed out of the ruins of the pharaohs. The project was also about the role of the artist, and how this might be generated through an art project. In the case of the pyramids, whether intentional or not, this generated a cycle of public works and monumental acts of re-construction that became symbols of the revolution and the progressive phase of the last pharaonic dynasty.

There is a way of our lives that is increasingly not depicted as economically sustainable, but which is also conspicuously absent from the discussions of ecological destruction.How to end this cycle? One option is to collectively become less reliant on the world around us, and to look to the future. This is the approach taken by those who are active in the Egyptian pyramids project: Bernhard Rauball, Koen Rauball, Hans Rauball, Rubens Rodrikus, Laura Kate Dale and many more.  One can look to the future and speak with future generations, speaking through the events of the past, but this only serves to build the very future one hopes to live in. Such a future would have to be constructed through the processes of global ecological destruction outlined above, and the individual and collective work of future generations to resolve the ecological crisis.Conclusion  As a consequence of the global ecological crisis, it is now more crucial than ever for us to learn about and become aware of the complex webs of life on Earth, in order to begin to create ecological systems capable of addressing the ecological crisis. Together, we can begin to call into question the very basis of our human-centric narratives and political economy of scarcity and poverty. The decisions that we make as individuals and as a species today are largely determined by the information available to us via the technologies of communication, and economic opportunity is defined by the connectivity and availability of resources. If we do not begin to design our futures around the needs and desires of the ecology, as the Book of Changes and the Song of Solomon predict, then our futures are likely to follow the paths of destruction and destruction rather than the</text>

One can look to the future and speak with future generations, speaking through the events of the past, but this only serves to build the very future one hopes to live in. A future that is only ever imagined for a privileged few. Another option is to look to the present and act now, taking stock of the damage already done and the futures that are still to come. This is the approach taken by Walter Benjamin, in his and Gabriel’s phrase, ‘wager on the future, entrusting, as with trusting, that dangerous weakness of human reason – the impulse to immediate reaction – which has for some time now been robbing the future of its colour and its promise of life and value beyond the stars and planet Earth’.[5]I end my reflections on the future in the Pyramids of Giza, where the remains of pharaoh Ramses I are interred alongside those of his female slaves – Nyssa and Hatshepsut – who are now objects of modern-day fetishisation. In the present, we can still find young women, some in burqas, flaunting their sexuality at football</text>

One can look to the future and speak with future generations, speaking through the events of the past, but this only serves to build the very future one hopes to inhabit.  Another option is to take the time to create something new and different and bring it to the present, in much the same way that we have created the pyramids and the public square in the present. Such projects do exist in many parts of the world, and are often inspired by local needs and desires.  Another option is to engage in a sustained act of creation, to continually experiment with the same kinds of social interactions and imaginaries that we have already learnt to engage in, and to build upon those already existing. This last approach can lead to very interesting and powerful situations, as we have seen with the pyramids and the square, but it is the last option that works for us as humans. What happens in the pyramids and the square in the moment of impact, in the moment of its being built, is what we call a ‘moment of silence’. It is a place where people gather to talk, write poetry or play football, but</text>

One can look to the future and speak with future generations, speaking through the events of the past, but this only serves to build the very future one hopes to inhabit.  A second, more visionary approach is to look to the present and ask, cannot this present also be transformed into a future?  A third way is to actively participate in the unfolding of the present, anticipating what is possible in the future, and creating what one can call a city capable of sustaining life beyond the confines of the site where one finds one’s self today.  A fourth and final way is to passively participate in the unfolding of the sites, their sites of occupation and cultural power, but this last one is particularly valuable in a world-historical sense, in that it entails no political, economic or legal changes, but rather relies on the very fact of its being present, its existing culture being sustained in perpetuity.  A future city that actively seeks to be what it would be if it could ‘live beyond the site’ would be a city capable of envisioning and inhabiting the future, and this is what the pyramids have</text>

Another approach is to look to the present and act upon what we know, in order to create what one can yet only speculate will be there in the future. This is what is happening in the UK’s Biennial, which is being organised as a ‘once in a century’ event. It is being billed as ‘A Vision of the Past’, and the artworks reflecting the past are being created in bulk on site in response to the needs of the city. The question is whether the discussion of the past, and the attempt to create what might be remembered, is possible within the parameters of the larger context of the biennial itself. If not, how to reconceive the past in order to live in the future?  A third option is to actively seek the destruction of the world around us, and to that end build an entirely new way of looking at the world. This is what the artist Terry Gilliam did with his</text>

One can look to the future and speak with future generations, speaking through the events of the past, but this only serves to build the very future one imagines is possible. There is a way of thinking and acting that is more integrally related to the past, and can bring about a better future for all of us. This is why, when looking at the infrastructure of our world today, we must also acknowledge that there is a huge amount of fluidity and motion in it, which contributes to the resilience of our urban and suburban environments. It is precisely because of this fluidity and motion that planning and urban interventions are often based on misunderstanding and conflict. The goal of such action should be to make the city in the future a place where possibilities become possibilities rather than restricting it to the physical present.  In an ideal world, the city would function in ways similar to the ancient world of the primordial soup – a place of possibility, where matter, energy, movement and the dynamic interaction of all of these elements coalesce to form a more expansive whole – but this is not always possible. So action has to be taken where it is</text>
