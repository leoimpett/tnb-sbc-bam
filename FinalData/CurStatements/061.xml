It would archive the past in the form of a live event, following the logic of virtuality, and invite participants to the present through questions of identity and place. The exhibition would be a past with a future, like the film INDECLINE, but one conceived in the present through the form of a live event. 	Such a future would invite, as the Italian artist IAudice De Sica would so poignantly suggest years later, a ‘transition’ between the past and the present ‘as if time were displaced into the background, but also into the periphery, in the form of juxtapositions that constantly interrogate and contrast one another’s temporality.

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods in a modern, postindustrial city, and in an island in the middle of the Mediterranean. Her exhibition ‘In Search of Time’ in the Westf Albert Hall, Berlin, 2015, is a meditation on the relationship between the temporal and the spatial, and the curatorial. Her exhibition ‘Inventing History: Women in History and Culture’ in the Louvre, Paris, 2015, is a reflection on the movement to define and introduce, in artifacts and collections, those cultural legacies of the past that are legacies of the gender binary. 	Such projects are not mysterious; they are explications of recurrent practices and trends that are, in part, the outcome of a given historical quagmire. More and more contemporary art is being written or imagined or imagined to be being written by non-athletes, or more and more contemporary art is being imagined to be being written by women (who, we are assured, never cease to inspire awe and passion in</text>

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods in the service of capitalism, and in so doing, posing a future for which there is no existing politics or future for which there is no existing.

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods in the presence of technological revolutions, in the midst of the current economic one.  	Such a future would invite, as the German philosopher and critic Daniel Goleman would later remark, ‘a radical and destabilising rethink of what it means to be “present”” in the here and now’ in the event of its being produced or imagined’.1 	Such a radical and destabilising rethink would lead to something like Goleman’s, but would also to a form of cultural conservatism in the form of cultural institutions and cultural practices that would exert a polarity between past and future, present and emergent. It could be a kind of ‘difference of no intrinsic meaning’ – a conceptual malaise that seeks an understanding in the form of difference.2 	Such a cultural conservatism could be imagined as a polarity, or it could lead to a social polarity – a difference of meaning that is mutually exclusive</text>

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods as a constituent unit and through the perforations of social history through the perforations of poverty and homelessness. The perforations of time that support and depend on the ‘world as it is’ are those that enable and direct contemporary cultural practices, and the cultural production of this world.

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods for the historical development of the social world we inhabit, and in effect, the very basis of the social world itself. 	Although De Sica’s transposition and its questioning of established principles and symbolic forms is an important, if somewhat slippery, part of her larger project, her interest in the temporality of cultural practice is much more directly related to the cultural productions she engenders through her ‘permanent motion picture’ project. 	As she herself admits, her own position as an artist and her work as cultural practice quickly shifted from evaluating the significance of particular cultural practices to the necessity and illegality of particular historical ones. With the outbreak of the First World War, her work for the U.K. navy came to represent everything that was inherently ‘bad’ about imperial life, while her wartime work for the Wehrmacht drew attention to the necessity of racial homogenisation in the wake of the Wehrmacht’s defeat at the</text>

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods through which a multiplicity of different versions of the historical event are repeated across different sites and across different cultures. 	However, the transposition of meaning is only part of what De Sica does here. Here she speaks of a need to critically engage with contemporary cultural consumption as an industry that is founded upon the exploitation of workers in what she calls ‘the first industrial revolution’.2 	In her book The Great Transformation: The End of Age and Other Essays, she argues that the postindustrial economy of the global north is now undergoing a ‘tripartite transformation’: the metainterface – the metallurgy, the finance and the logistics that support it – while the other parts of the metainterface – production, distribution and remittances – travel. As a result, she says, it is possible to imagine a future in which people do not commute long distances, instead spending less time in the cities and more time in the countryside,</text>

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods in the service of contemporary needs, and in particular in their constant displacement of the social from the historical and geographical – questions of time and space. In a recent exhibition catalogue entitled ‘Outlawed Social Life’, archival materials from the 1980s are juxtaposed with contemporary works that address the social and ecological contexts of global ecological crises. 	In these materials, the past is frequently cited as a justification for the present, and radical social change is often promoted through references to the notion of the ‘end of history’.1 	However, this justification is often pre-negotiated, and often contradicts itself. In the case of the environmental ethics championed by De Sica, the end game is often promoted by a rejection of the very notion of the ‘end of history’.2 	In his book  	Between Ecologies of Emptiness, Christian Ulrik argues that although the social may desire the social, the end of history</text>

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods in a political and social sense, and in particular the necessity of a continuous historical revision of the social meaning of place and time. The notion of transposition is fundamental to De Sica’s position and philosophy, and she underscores it in several of her paintings, some of which are constructed from various different layers, each layer constituting a separate scene. 	The idea of time as an inextricable complex of difference, contradictions, possibilities – which is to say, of how to define and navigate time itself – is what underpins De Sica’s broader philosophical and artistic thinking. She defines time as ‘a space created by, assumed by, and dependent on which we do not want to be, because it is not our space – it is space created by, for, or in which we do not want to be.]  	The time that we actually do inhabit and use is a different kind of time – that of habit – which is temporally constrained</text>

In the film, De Sica plays a leading role in the transposition of historical and social meaning through the perforations of time – in questioning the necessity of historical periods, and establishing a radically new temporal category called ‘postmodern’. In these perforations, De Sica plays into the troubling notion that characterises modernity – that is, global capitalism as it is constituted by the West – by introducing a set of goods and services that can be understood as marking a transition from the past to the future, from the ‘present’ to the nonexistent and the non-existent future. 	Such a temporal category would map not just the spatial but also the temporal characteristics of what Arjun Appadurai has aptly dubbed ‘posthumanism’. Appadurai develops his thinking on this notion in relation to what he calls ‘the end game’ of globalisation: the future, which he describes as marked by a multitude of negative connotations. The end game, he argues, is the condition of globalised capitalism itself. 	In order to grasp this end game effectively, scholars and artists are advised to acquaint</text>

To some, the act of reconciliation may have even been a betrayal.Francis Bacon, the English poet and statesman who first articulated the concept of ‘fugitive’ in 1609, offered an apt definition of modern corporate culture: every habit of thinking, speaking, feeling, associating … is an Aggression to Truth. The impulse to conceal, to bend, to bend to conform, to pervert facts, reason and common sense, to adopt any excuse, to align oneself with any ideal – that impulse is all too familiar. It is the everyday behaviour of most of us, and Bacon’s fable is only one of many fables told in the name of honour.</text>

But what are we to do when our imaginations are free to speculate? What are the practices of an art gallery when the gallery itself is closed?

The choice to conceal one’s true identity seems even harder to transition from being hailed as a virtue by those who would exploit you like nothing else in the world. The choice to conceal one’s true intentions in order to facilitate the redemption of many is even harder. How can we collectively as a society resist the urge to cover up? How can we collectively as a society resist the urge to convert the innocent into the wicked? To me, there is only one answer to this challenge: there can be no collaboration with those who would exploit you like a human commodity. As Strauss-Kahn would say, there is only one path: ‘From here, I take you under my wing and train my retinue of ravens to devour everything you throw at me’. I take you under my wing and instruct them to eat whatever you throw at me, because I’m about to devour you.

The choice to conceal one’s true identity seems even harder to transition from being hailed as a virtue by those who would exploit you like nothing else in the world. And for those who would exploit you, there is the further choice to betray your trust in the service of another person’s ambitions. For many of us, the difficult choice that every of us faces is not between virtues and vices, but between powers and freedoms. For Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the choice was between two very different forms of liberty. Freedom of the individual to pursue one’s own desires in one’s own mind, and freedom of the collective to pursue those desires in concert with other people’s desires. Freedom of the individual to pursue one’s own desires in concert with those other people’s desires. For Strauss-Kahn, the choice was between two radically different political and social forms of liberty: freedom of the individual to act upon one’s own desires, and freedom of the collective to enact collective desires.

The choice to conceal one’s true identity seems even harder to transition from being hailed as a virtue by those who would exploit you like nothing else in the world. What is the difference between being recognised as a hero and being condemned as a vixen? In the nineteenth-century, when the term was coined, it was used to describe those artists and composers whose works functioned as a kind of protestant confession of guilt, or as a kind of self-critique: in the twentieth century it is used by artists and composers whose works function as a kind of opulent confession of innocence. When Sven Spieker coined the term ‘culturally aware’ to describe the practices of public art in the twentieth century, he was not trying to define an art form, but to point out a difference between culturally conscious and artistically conscious practices. He was pointing out a fundamental difference between the cultural bourgeoisie and the non-culturally conscious : between the privileges of being born into a culture and remaining imbued with that culture, and the poverty of being born without that culture. As Spieker sees it,</text>

The choice to conceal one’s true intentions seems even harder to transition from being lauded as a hero to being condemned as a perjurer by those who would exploit you like nothing else in the world. Here, we can identify another characteristic of today’s society: the perjurer. The perpetrator of a wrong is more easily identified and imprisoned than the unknowing and the perjurer. And here is an even more salient feature of today’s society: the perjurer is everywhere. We know who is being honoured at the Brit Awards; at the football stadiums where the national anthems are being played; at the cathedrals where millions of devout fans flock to see the sporting spectacle presented in a largely white, middle-class, Protestant country; at the sporting goods stores where athletes and athletes’ families are spending hundreds of pounds a month on performance-enhancing substances and equipment; at the boutiques selling CDs, DVDs, trainers and so forth</text>

The choice to conceal one’s true identity seems even harder to transition from being hailed as a virtue by those who would exploit you like nothing else in the world. You see, the choice to conceal one’s true identity is also a choice. You and I know that you will be judged by those who look to us for guidance on how to behave, but you and only you will know whether that is in fact a choice. When you are judged by others, you are likely to make mistakes, to fall short of expectations, and to be disappointed in yourself. That is the difficult about being identified: falling short of expectations, and in general being disappointed in oneself. But that is the difficult about being found out: being discovered and shamed by others. It’s not easy being found out, and it’s not easy being shamed by others. For some, being found out is their destiny.For some, hiding their true identities is the only way to go.And for some, hiding their true identities is the only way to go.For some, the choice to conceal their identity is not a choice, but a</text>

The choice to conceal one’s true motivations seems even harder to transition from being lauded as a hero to being condemned as a coward. Perhaps it is that in the twenty-first century, it is not the actions but the values that define the conduct of humans, but the other, subtler qualities that make us human. Perhaps our present cultural values, legitimised as the actions of human beings, are more pernicious than we give them credit for being. In the case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, his was a deliberate act of concealment, designed to create the appearance of contrition while permitting the very real, deliberate concealment of one’s true intentions. But why does he do it? Why does he pretend to be someone he is not? For a start, he knows that, if he says something stupid or mean-spirited, the whole audience will hear it and, in a sense, he does that in order to get the maximum effect from</text>

Let us also not forget that all these decisions – whether to be seen or to be hidden – are ultimately about maintaining your own power and position, whether to maintain your group’s power structure or not, whether to foster alliances with other groups or not, whether to establish a common territory or not, whether to advocate a particular position or not, whether to support an organisation or not, whether to participate in a cause or not, whether to contribute to a discussion or not, and so forth. For many of us, these are decisions that we still make year in and year out, every day, often with disastrous consequences. But let us also not forget that this is also true of those who choose to become part of our communities: to become teachers, for instance. Let us not forget that the social services and other organisations that are part of the J-</text>

In this honour, he was lauded as a force for good in a world overrun with evil. But what can a force be defined as good or desirable? For Strauss-Kahn, it was an act of contrition: ‘I now see myself as someone who can contribute to creating a future for myself and my family in which they will not be judged by the actions of others.’ What a difficult act to transition from being heralded as a hero to being condemned as a coward. The choice to conceal one’s true identity seems even harder to transition from being hailed as a virtue by those who would exploit you like nothing else in the world. Given how the world perceives us now, it is even more difficult to transition from being considered a prize to being seen as nothing more than something to be discarded. There is no easy answer to this conundrum, but there are ways to try and find the middle ground.That morning in the garden, Jean-Luc Nancy spoke to me about a project that I had started a year or so earlier with the artist Max Sjöstrand. This was before I had any formal training in artist education or conceptual art, but it was still very much a conceptual art project. Nancy was trying to instigate an interdisciplinary dialogue between the arts and the social. What the Arts Education Centre had started to do was starting to become a research centre, and with that, a site for further research. So rather than having an arts education, which was still dominant in the school, Nancy wanted to see an interdisciplinary dialogue that would allow the arts to take a back seat in the educational process.</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on both migrant workers and the impoverished to fill its social and cultural needs. The former are often lured to the latter by the promise of cheaper housing and public transportation, but most artists today must also contend with the fact that many of their clients are wealthier and more powerful cultural patrons who value artistic works more highly than artists can ever grow themselves. 	The current economic crisis is largely the result of the implosion of the Middle East and North Africa through the financial sector, and the financial sector’s collateral damage is still being felt in the region. 	Art is no longer the sole beneficiary of cultural capital produced by the region, but it is still heavily dependent on migrant labor and the impoverished. 	The accessibility of cultural resources in the region today is a significant factor in whether a locality will have access to significant amounts of regeneration and new housing. 	There are several structural changes that need to be made in the economic codes of Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to allow for the sharing of</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant workers, and the increasing privatisation of cultural resources, including the completely non-profitable sectors of cultural resources such as art, architecture and design, is a main driver of this transition. Art is rarely produced for a market value, and while it is certainly possible to produce great art for a low value, most artists would rather work for a clientele that is interested in art in general, rather than in art that represents the specificities of their particular cultural practices. Art today is produced at a rate that is almost completely outside of the control of the artists who work for a living, and beyond the reach of the social agencies and cultural planners who design art to be valuable and accessible. 	The advent of social media and the sharing of cultural experiences has made it easier than ever to understand and relate to the curatorial practice of artists like yourself, who are artists in their own right, but also to connect with the shifting of cultural landscapes by artists with varying practices, talents and mediums</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant artists and performers, many of whom arrive from impoverished countries in order to work in increasingly precarious conditions. Art is produced on the condition that they integrate into the local artworld’s economy, but in the past were forced to choose between two evils: either become art dealers and exploit their craft, or face the wrath of the local authorities and be locked up. Today, the choice is even starker: do you enable exploitation and be left behind, or do you adopt practices that are culturally sensitive but are also economically unsustainable? 	The choice is becoming ever more blurred, and the increasing numbers of artists and performers choosing to collaborate in socially engaged practices are only exacerbating the situation. The work that is produced by the art market in the form of artist-funded cultural initiatives is not going unnoticed by authorities keen to expand their reach and influence. As arts funding has shrunk at an alarming rate, so too have initiatives chosen to work outside the mainstream. But even if these are technically within the</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant labour force to deliver materials and artists’ instructions, and to a lesser extent, much of the time, does so via social media. 	The impact of this shift has been felt in the art world, with many artists migrating to places with vibrant underground economies. Art is no longer the sole outcome of a given socio-cultural formation, but rather a social-economic production that is increasingly generated and directed by the rich and powerful in the region. 	The cultural tourism industry is a global phenomenon that has clearly stated goals and objectives. Its main demand is to arrive at destinations where, as the saying goes, ‘nothing is impossible, except maybe the desire’. These supposedly impossible goals are promoted as being based on objective criteria, but in reality are often framed around personal relationships and identifications with particular cultures or groups. In the context of contemporary globalisation and neoliberalism, it would seem that it is increasingly the case that a traveller does not necessarily want to arrive at a</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant labor and otherwise migrant talent, and many forms of cultural tourism still require the artists to deliver cultural messages in exchange for a fee. Art today also depends on the labor of archiving and documentation, which requires a great deal of effort and creativity on the part of the curatorial team. Indeed, the difficulties of archive building, archiving and documentation today are such that it is practically a requirement for all artists to be bilingual and artists of varying kinds are everywhere today. 	However, even in the most technologically advanced societies, the curatorial is still a workplace. Its primary role today is to support and foster a community of artists’ working collaboratively across disciplines, providing them with professional development and ensuring that they have the resources to sustain their artistic endeavors. 	Modern art today is often produced with the participation of large corporate art institutions, whose mission statement is translated into common standards of aesthetic quality from which all art institutions must take part. These standards are produced by and for artists, and</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant labor to produce its values and commodities; the art market is flooded with art-selling productions that are socially engineered to sell themselves; and the culture trade accounts for a significant chunk of the global art market. 	The cultural tourism industry claims that it understands the need to produce in order to distribute, but in reality this only serves the interests of a transnational elite that dominate the global market. 	These trade interests also profit from the popularisation of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) – the new ‘science and technology’ industriespeaking in the US and Europe. 	Art is no longer the sole product of cultural production in the region, and artists, curators, collectors and art lovers need to pay attention to what they are receiving and why.  Do they not realize that these new forms of art are commodities that have a place only in a capitalist economy?

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant labour in predominantly unpaid, exploitative capacities, and  	in many cases, its artists are employed by the employers as artists find new work elsewhere. 	Art is no longer the sole product of cultural production in the region, but rather the consuming function of many other cultural commodities. 	Modern art today tends to be produced in exchange for a completely different set of commodities: materials and energy, rights to life, labour, images and images. Art today tends to be consumed in the interests of a financial sector that depends on the exchange of images, and whose members purvey a clear and growing range of goods and rights to images. 	In a larger historical perspective, perhaps the greatest shift of the past 50 years has been the one experienced in the production of art materials and products. Much of what was once produced for the aesthetic needs of a labourer is now exported to countries where labour is scarce or nonexistent. 	A postindustrial economy of images  	now produces</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant labour in predominantly unpaid labour camps, which is often abused and comported with harsh working conditions. A recent report by Amnesty International on settlement and work in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) projects a sharp increase in medical and dental emergencies, as well as a quadrupling in the number of civilian casualties caused by rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons. 	The global commercial trade of cultural products is characterised by the proliferation of low-end producers who maximise the commercial potential of cultural products by offering them at discount levels to discerning consumers. The market for cultural products today includes artists whose works are often commissioned by art institutions and whose works are often repurposed by those institutions for commercial ends. 	The market for cultural products today also includes artists whose works are often commissioned by the industry and whose work is often repurposed by it for commercial ends. These artists may be heralded as cultural ambassadors and rewarded with lucrative industry contracts and other types of industry support.</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant workers to fill gaps in production, and these workers make up a growing share of the workforce. Art collectors, on the other hand, tend to be older men with a particular interest in older works. They are more likely to be located in the cities, and their tastes in art are more likely to be culturalized. This observation was first made by sociologist Jerzy Grotowski in 1990, and it remains controversial to this day. Art collectors today tend to be older women who have a particular interest in works by contemporary artists, and their taste in art is more likely to be mediated through works by contemporary artists who are also female and of a certain age. 	These two constituencies of curators, collectors and art lovers may think very differently than their elders about the role of art today. Do they see art today as a crucial building block of social life, a source of aesthetic energy and a source of aesthetic pride? Or may their current economic reliance on images and media make it</text>

The rise of precarious work and living standards in the region, coupled with the depopulation of historically blacked-out cities, has resulted in an increasingly precarious relationship between where art is produced and to what extent it is shared. 	Art today relies on migrant workers from the predominantly Muslim regions of the world, whose work is often utilised against the backdrop of poverty and social conflict. Art collectors today have to contend with an art market that is almost entirely fuelled by consumerist impulses. Art today becomes both less mysterious and more marketable when it is produced in conditions of social conflict and ecological collapse. 	The contemporary curatorial approach to art today is to some extent a response to the crisis of the cultural economy. As Michael Ames notes, the end of the oil crisis in the mid 1990s gave artists a major political-ideological boost, which in turn gave them a great desire to expand their audiences outside of the oil-rich petrostates of the US and Europe. The petro-motown phenomenon then re-established the importance of art in the self-image of the art market and the making of contemporary art, which is to some extent understood by political cinema that was historically informed. Ames continues: ‘The end of oil</text>

The exhibition should be located in a building whose original purpose was to house cargo, with its elevated concourse and endless runways as symbols of corporate gluttony. The concourse would be a great space for the sculpture to situate, and the runways the planes would use as launching pads, but it would also function as a billboard for the travel plans of the airlines – a billboard with which to advertise gluttony and the excesses of capitalism. This is the ‘postcode lottery’ scenario, where the chances of finding a parcel increase as the greater the number of digits in the postal code. The idea of the ‘postcode lottery’ is to a large extent a response to the postcards of the 1930s and 1940s, when artists such as Jasper Johns, Norman Wilkinson and Peter Weibel drew upon the mythological ‘treasure chest’ – a collection of objects held within a specific location – to suggest hidden wealth and excess in the architecture of the metropolis. The postcode lottery metaphor is a powerful one, and it is easy to understand what an impact this would have on tourism. The �</text>

The former actively promote the latter by providing them with valuable information about the city’s depopulation and ecological crisis, but the former often end up being the ones who end up displaced or pushed out into the city. We propose the establishment of a collaborative research project with Geoff Cox, a curator of contemporary art and urbanism at The Royal, London, and Victoria and Albert Museum, London, as well as members of the public.

The exhibition should be located in a building whose original purpose was to house cargo, with its elevated concourse and endless runways as symbols of corporate gluttony, but instead of being an allegorical representation of the terminal itself, the new museum should employ sophisticated analysis that addresses the complex processes of airport bureaucracy and bureaucracy as an allegorical metaphor. This analysis should employ not only sign language, but also music, myth, and landscape as metaphors for the social, economic, and political evolution of the world as a result of global capitalism.  The museum should employ innovative strategies to engage passengers in a mythologised ‘third party’ narrative surrounding the airport, one that is almost entirely absent from official narratives or critical analysis. For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the aircraft that replaced the lost art of the silent painting, should be placed in a realm where its disappearance is not solely attributed to human error and catastrophic turbulence, but also because of an affective and political con-sequence that results from the terminal industry it serves.  The biennial format is a double-sided form: it benefits from a passive state of</text>

We think that the airport experience should be permanent, and permanent new versions of itself introduced into the cityscape.  At the very least, the concourse should display the latest news headlines and serve as a permanent database of the city’s traffic situation. In an ideal world, the concourse should be a place where different modes of travel can be visited simultaneously, and where different cultures, religions and nationalities can gather to share experiences and exchange ideas.

The concourse and runways should be replaced with a ‘liveness’ that is restricted to airport workers, security personnel and customers, reflecting the current fad for seductive images of opulence in the wake of the technological singularity.  The liveness should be a continuous, all-encompassing image that permeates the building and is indistinguishable from anything else in the terminal.  A continuous liveness should be able to simultaneously occupy multiple planes and multiple worlds, and should be able to operate continuously across these multiple settings.  A schematic diagram of the terminal liveness should be drawn to show the various transindividuated parts of the terminal building.  The liveness should be able to simultaneously occupy multiple planes and multiple worlds, and should be able to operate continuously across these multiple settings.

The exhibition should be located in a building whose original purpose was to house cargo, with its elevated concourse and endless runways as symbols of corporate gluttony. The Concourse C building should become the subject of its own biennial, and the biennial’s collection should include a selection of works commissioned by, or on behalf of, the corporation – a deliberate nod to the art conservators who once led the charge into industrial ruin.  The Biennial should take place in the location of a city, and it should be located in a territory where the French language should no longer be the majority language.  We propose that the exhibition at the airport should be situated in a building that represents the totality of the city, and the collection should be arranged in steps, with the Concourse C building at the center. The idea of ‘the city’ as a collection of buildings and ‘the biennial’ as a series of buildings’ should be phased out of the exhibitionary structure.  At the same time, the number of elevators installed in each building should be kept to a minimum, and</text>

The concourse would be a great place to find and take part in the symbolic act of airport tourism, in which the biennial presents itself as a ‘gift of the commerce’, but its primary purpose would be to house and transport artefacts for the terminal itself. This would allow the terminal to claim a presence in the city, but also a function of resistance. ‘Terminal travel’ is a verb, and terminal travel could make use of the terminal's unique position and position within the city as a site of active resistance. We propose that the terminal be situated in the city as a site of resistance, and that ‘Terminal 2’ – the new airport – be situated just outside the city, in an area of intense surveillance and control. We imagine the new airport to be a place where artefacts from the past can be assembled to create future cultural artefacts, where direct communication with the past is discouraged, and in the view of some</text>

In this case, the installation of the airport experience at the airport would be the antithesis of the corporate gluttony of the past, and the antithesis of the modern industrial machine.  The idea of the airport should be able to map onto the property of the city, and the individual should be able to penetrate it from anywhere in the city. The idea of the ‘United States of America’ should be able to blend in with the city’s natural vegetation and ambiance. The word ‘United States’ should be avoided in place of the more straightforward word ‘America’ because the former implies a divine origin and the latter a racial one. We think the ‘United States of America’ should be able to exist in a hybrid form, incorporating elements of both. We call this hybrid ‘the United States of America’. We also think its inhabitants should be able to identify with both.   One can only imagine</text>

And if that ‘chance' is no longer there, then what would you do? In this case, the ‘chance’ would have to be something that we humans create. The question, then, becomes: what would you change in order to make that happen? The answer, of course, depends on what we mean by ‘chance’ and what we mean by ‘world’. We might mean to create a better world through our own efforts, or create something completely different through the help of others. World-changing events, such as the Second World War, might be part of the answer. But we also need to find creative and interesting ways of organising ourselves in order to make the world we live in better. We might organise ourselves in different ways, such as art, activism, commerce, housing, education, etc. If we think about what a ‘world’ is, then we can start to see that there are many different kinds of ‘worlds’. These include the physical world (like a city), conceptual world (such as a museum or urban landscape), and symbolic world (</text>

And if that ‘chance' is no longer there, then what would you do?

There’d have to be a catalyst that made you want to change the world.We begin by asking: what is the project that you envision being most like a festival, in that it is about imagination and the capacity of individuals to create meaning through their actions?If you could choose one of the many creative arts projects that have been happening around the world, what would it be?Dazzle the city with lights, right nowLight up the night, ever dream a night marcherLight up the night with a nudge in the right directionSave the night with the needleContinue reading the ConversationDazzle the city with lights, right nowDazzle the city with lights, right nowLight up the night, ever dream a night marcherLight up the night with a nudge in the right directionDownload this article</text>

And if that ‘chance' is no longer there, then what would you do? In this case, the ‘chance’ would have to be something you created, and something that is very empowering, and you can't just take things away from animals. In this sense, the projectors of today would do the opposite of what we artists and designers do, which is to enhance the world around us through our products and services. We would empower people to become part of that changing world, and allow that world to be what it is capable of becoming. And that is why the projectors of today have to be creative, because that is what they can offer. As an artist and a champion of social change, I’m privileged to have the opportunity to engage with people on a regular basis, and to learn from them and to make art that helps to make the world a better place. And that is why I’m so passionate about software engineering and social impact, because that is what software does. It connects people, shifts their world, and creates opportunities that are unavailable anywhere else. The reason why I love it is</text>

We would have to find other ways of understanding the world, and that is a very different kind of understanding.What I liked about your talk was that you emphasised the ineffable, the ineffable concept of chance. I felt like you were saying: this is possible, and we would only ever see this moment in relation to humans, but it is also possible that we have created it ourselves, and that is an entirely different way of looking at things. Chance is ineffable, but it exists. And to some extent, I agree with that. I don’t agree with your question: what is it that makes us human? I don’t think that it is the genes that make us human, and I</text>

And if that ‘chance' is no longer there, then what would you do? In this case, the ‘chance’ would have to be real, and it would have to be something meaningful. I will give you an example: imagine if in the future you could travel to another planet and go into deep space, and if you got there, you’d find yourself in a different world. Or take the idea of travel across oceans. You would enter a different world, but it would be based on the same principles and the same set of ideals. You would leave with a different set of ideals. Or take the idea of virtual reality. It’s already possible to enter into VR with the right virtual reality headset, but what if the ideal isn’t what you’d want? What if the virtual reality you get is sub-optimal? What if you spend too much time in VR, and don’t explore enough of what’s offered to you?These are questions that can be asked and answered in the symposium. For me, the key questions were: What does it</text>

And if that ‘chance' is no longer there, then what would you do? In this case, the ‘chance’ would have to be real, and we would have to be able to act on it. The question then becomes: what is the ethical dimension to this? The ethical question becomes: how can one draw lines in the right direction, and take action when necessary?In Part 1, we explore the ways in which animals are brought into our lives, and the ethical question becomes: what could possibly be more inhumane than to bring a dying whale or a sick kitten into your life? And if the answer is ‘nothing’ then the line between here and hell starts to blur. In Part 2, we look at the role of the artist and the biennial, and how we can work together to bring social change. Finally, in Part 3, we look at what it means to be connected to animals, and how we can make the world a little bit better for them.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleImage courtesy of Pringle GalleryPreviousNextEmily PringleImage courtesy of Pringle GalleryIn</text>

And if that ‘chance' is no longer there, then what would you do? In this case, the ‘chance’ would have to be something you create, and it’s not something that comes to you naturally. It has to be something that you acquire, and in our case, that comes from within. And so we ask, what are the four parts that make up the ‘world’?Part of the answer is, of course, global ecological systems – with their interactions and the accumulated knowledge of the world around us. But part of the ‘world’ is also personal: the world we live in is generated by the interaction of many different parts; and so the part that comes out on average every day is also part of a much larger system that generates meaning and meaninglessness in countless other parts of the world. When we have that interaction and that interactivity, we can create worlds that are richer and more meaning-bearing, and that are more ephemeral and non-representational. Our world is dynamic and unpredictable, and so are we. But the point is that we don�</text>

But there are many ways to begin to imagine such change. We begin by asking ourselves, however, what is the rejection of the human condition that is most apparent in the world we live in? What is the rejection of an animal world? In what ways is it impossible for us to become aware of these ways of being? Then we can begin to imagine what that change would mean for us and the world we inhabit.This is the first part of our symposium.

It was at the Biennale of Sydney in 2005 that I first saw the idea of a biennial as something that was being actively worked against, or alternatively, in progress, by art market forces. The argument was that art market forces had made it impossible to produce more than a handful of pieces a year, which meant that galleries were constantly replenishing themselves with new works. So biennials provided a different kind of filler, something that would be displayed year on year but wasn’t consumed by art market forces</text>

So the next time you're at the airport, or at a museum, or in a shop, or in a café, or in the library, or on a train, or in a bus, remember that ‘bullet train’ that you and I were on. It’s there if you go looking for it. And if you don’t want to take the bullet train, then you can always take a different bullet train. 	The art market has an agenda, and it includes the biennial as a part of it. So if there’s going to be a biennial, it’s essential that it aligns with the priorities of the market, and that it has market-like characteristics. The biennial needs to be interesting, but it also needs to be powerful. If the biennial is going to become a multimillion-dollar business, then it’s essential that it be interesting, and that it do something that people can relate to. Otherwise, the biennial is going to become something that people only ever see once, in annual reports, or once in a selected selection of artists’ works. Art museums need to become destination points, and not the other way around. Otherwise, we are going to end up with a city-wide addiction to art museums, where art is displacement by</text>

Because if there is no money in the art market then there is no money in the world. And so the biennial became what it is today: a multibillion-dollar business. It also became a vehicle for the curatorial, because the biennial—like any other art market—needs a public transport system to offer what the public can afford. The art market is a fact of life in any city, and while it’s true that the art market doesn’t always provide for the artists who produce that money, it’s also true that the public has to put up with art for a while. If the public is put off by something being put on the market, then that might be because the art market isn’t offering what the public can afford. And if the public doesn’t put up with art, then the biennial might be a failure</text>

[10] Chun also describes how the design of computers exploits the fact that humans are fragile – incapable of surviving for long in physically absent ‘real life’ environments – and exploits this by design. 	[11] The question that constantly arises in the design community is how to reconcile the need for users to understand how computers work with the need for users to interact with those computers. The tension between the two is particularly apparent in the realm of social networks: the interaction between a human and a computer is constrained by the fact that a human being ‘sees’ what a computer sees. If a human being sees something that a computer does not see, then that interaction is  	unusable and that interaction is considered  unreliable. In other words, the need for users to understand how computers work  is overwhelming. It is easy to understand how the need for users to understand how computers work when we consider the networked age: the internet allows us to see digital footprints that computers leave behind, and the traces that computers leave behind are ever-changing. It is also easy to understand how the interaction between humans and algorithms can be unpredictable: the internet allows machines to see digital footprints that humans</text>

[10] Chun also describes how the design of computers exploits the fact that humans are fragile – incapable of surviving for long in physically absent ‘real life’ environments – and exploits this by design. 	[11] This is a variant of the way in which programming languages design programs that are constantly – and sometimes dramatically – different from what they are called to do. For instance, the design of a computer program is dynamic and unpredictable, based on the evolving of knowledge about the world – knowledge that arises from continuously re-running the same program over and over again. This dynamic nature of the programming language means that different versions of the same thing can be created and replaced – creating ‘instant replicas’ of the underlying systems. This dynamic nature makes the underlying architecture of the computer –– which is itself a program – vulnerable to attack. If one of the representations of the world is ever corrupted, the other representations are also affected. This is why a hacker needs the attacker to breach the underlying computer systems that control the algorithms that control how data is represented and transmitted.[12] The dynamic nature of the programming language means that even if the underlying architecture is patched, the hacker needs to</text>

[10] Chun also describes how the design of computers exploits the fact that humans are fragile – incapable of surviving for long in physically absent ‘real life’ environments – and exploits this by design. 	[11] This is a sound scientific principle that should be of great concern to all concerned. The mechanisms of modern ­computer systems are designed to fail, to malfunction, to become credulous, to become easily frustrated, to become easily mauled up by ­innovative software, to ­endless otherness and to the point where it is virtually inconceivable to continue to function.  	[12] The threat posed by such systems is real, and serious workarounds are ­inexpiated – i.e. impossible – but this does not alter the fundamental fact that humans are designed to live contemporaneously with one another. Modern computers are designed with an understanding of the world in which they operate – and with the human element – in mind. But these systems are also designed with the ability to think outside of their environment. That is, the ability to think creatively and imaginatively about the world around them – to expand and contract it, to become self-aware and to</text>

[11] This is one way of reading the evolving interfaces that computers are constructing. Today, we tend to think of hard drives and data storage as essential to a computer’s functionality, but there are other, more pragmatic uses of such material – helping to organize information, creating secure channels between people, and so forth. 	[12] As early as the 1980s, computer scientists began to imagine other uses for hard drives, and in 1990 Erwin Ulmer and Noel Burch from the California Institute of Technology created what came to be known as the ‘Intel Logo’ – a set of guidelines for the kind of iconography and symbol use that could be incorporated into computer interface elements. These guidelines, based on their consideration of the historical significance of the word ‘Intel Logo’ and the ways in which it could be used in advertising and marketing, as well as on a deeper level, lay out the ways in which users can ‘hack it’ and create</text>

[12] The term has been constantly recycled by various innovators and auteur-like theorists, with varying degrees of success, ranging from Sigmund Freud to Garry Meehan, William Burroughs, to Frank Stoler and Kenn Taylor, among many others.  	[13] The importance of the individual in this context is emphasized by Ray Bradbury in his book The Martian Chronicles, where he describes the encounter of the author with an alien species who tells him that his ideas about the human condition are fundamentally wrong.

[11] This is a portrait painted entirely of the human species. The complexity of the task at hand, the proliferation of life forms, and their ‘inherent fragility’ – the ability to be killed – render humankind ‘a more globalisable form of structured community’. In the words of Gregory Ulmer, ‘The Enduring Ephemeral: Mass Phenomena and the Episodic’, and featured in the exhibition catalogue 'Alterations'. 	[12] This is what computer scientist Steve Tanimoto describes as ‘enduring Episodic’: ‘it is a kind of repetition, with a duration and in some cases an order, that is beyond our current conceptual, linguistic and physical limitations – and will remain so for a while longer than we can imagine.’[13] This kind of 'enduring Episodic Communal Knowledge’ is a deeply marxist concept, and one that</text>

[10] Chun also describes how the design of computers exploits the fact that humans are fragile – incapable of surviving for long in physically absent ‘real life’ environments – and exploits this by design. 	[11] Is this description of the contemporary rise of algorithms or perhaps of archaisms? Undoubtedly, the 21st century marks a time when machines rule not so much as atoms but data, and data forms increasingly acquire procedural rules that prescribe what is and is not allowed to be stored, transmitted or retrieved. The question is, however, what comes after the data? If  	after performing its computational tasks, why then destructively reorder the world – causing pain and suffering – in ways that are not in keeping with the values of contemporary democracies? 	[12] Aron Adi and Benjamin Bratton describe in their book  	Mastering Information Architecture 	 how data capture devices such as smart phones, blogs and social media have revolutionized how we communicate, collaborate and live our lives.

[10] Chun also describes how the design of computers exploits the fact that humans are fragile – incapable of surviving for long in physically absent ‘real life’ environments – and exploits this by design. 	[11] This is one form of evolution that results in complex cultural artefacts such as art, architecture and music being constructed in such a way as to fail as quickly as possible, so as to guarantee a future of fragile, real life. If the work is real life-critical, the result will always be a conflict between the needs of the people creating the artefact and the fragile relationships between humans and the world around them. If the users of these artefacts regularly engage with them as actors in a fictional world, the conflict that arises from this interaction is markedly different. Artworks that are constructed in this fashion often have a ‘contemporaneous’ or ‘following fiction’ that anticipates the life that lies ahead for humans trapped in the artefact. 	[12] This is another form of evolution that results in cultural artefacts that are malleable and easily altered through the actions of humans engaged in the ficticious process of algorithmic creation.

[11] This is a more general principle than Goldwater’s claim that a &quot;personal computer’ represents ‘the human element’ and represents a return to the homogeneous, natural life that ‘every creature’ experiences’.[12] It is true that the creation of ‘memory trees’ is different from the design of a computer, and can therefore be characterised as creative destruction. But this is also true of any other kind of electronic data storage: unlike hard drives and solid-state memory, electronic data is malleable and can henceforth be used to create anything; indeed, it is the very nature of electronic data to accumulate and moulder ever onwards. 	[13] As an aside, this description of electronic data seems to underline something about the contemporary condition – that electronic data is  	programmed, that it has a capacity to grow in different ways, that it can be changed and so forth</text>

The challenge in approaching this as an art event is to create opportunities for artists to engage with the cultural resources of the area and to create cultural change within the art world. In my view, this would mean engaging with the infrastructure of the art world, rather than the other way around: engaging with the infrastructure of the data industry and creating grassroots networks of artists, curators, artists' organisations and others who can then tap into these cultural resources.  Artworlds Digital Divide  One can only imagine what the next generation of artists will be like, and it’s very possible that artworlds could be a place where such creativity can flourish.  Another possibility is to set up cultural-economic corridors that connect to the city, or indeed to other arts-producing areas, such as the neighbouring regions.  The possibilities for this are endless. It could also mean engaging with data extraction and delivery, as with the recent New York art school’s collaboration with New York Communities for Change, whose mission was to reimagine the cultural resources of the city through a citizen-science project).  Cultural resources are tangible, and art is an indispensable tool in our cultural-economic</text>

The challenge in approaching this as an art event is to create opportunities for artists to engage with the cultural resources of the area and to create cultural change within the art world. In my view, the only way to truly engage the art world is through direct action, and whilst I have a deep love of art and its resources, there are times when it is necessary to withhold cultural resources from certain people in order to achieve certain outcomes. I’m not advocating for the total appropriation of cultural resources, but rather for cultural individuals to exert influence within their cultural setting through their own creative deeds. Artworlds Digital Divisions:  Artworlds are amongst the most vulnerable in this equation.  Artworlds have an infrastructure that is largely funded by the city and state, and yet are also a relatively new arrival in this equation. They are new to this equation, and whilst they may have impacts that are positive for the city as a whole, there is a greater risk that they will be used by a city government to exert political or economic power. The concern in my mind is that the infrastructure of the art world is being stretched to its breaking point, and that political and economic</text>

The challenge in approaching this as an art event is to create opportunities for artists to engage with the cultural resources of the area and to create cultural change within the art world. In my view, cultural resources should be understood as natural resources that are available to all artists and artists – not necessarily exclusive to certain artists.  And so, the challenge is to engage with the art resources of the city in a way that creates synergies between art and natural resources, in a way that maximises the benefits for both the city and the artist?  Artworld data is a scarce resource, and artists need to be strategic in their investments? I think so.  And perhaps, as an area of research, this may require the engagement of artists with the local environment (rather than subjecting them to intensive scientific and technical evaluation).  The challenge is to engage with the art resources of the area in a way that creates synergies between art and nature, and maximises the cultural value of the area.  I see a future in which art events are driven by a local ecologist, a local urbanist, and an artist-organisation.  This would enable the creation of synergies</text>

In my view, this requires artists to be able to negotiate the art world in a way that is mutually beneficial, and to maximise the benefits of their art without compromising their responsibilities as artists.  Artworld Promoters  Artworlds are often at a disadvantage in the market because their primary source of revenue is from ticket sales, and consequently, their primary use of cultural resources is to sell art tickets. Therefore, they often feel the need to create social functions around events such as concerts, parties, etc. That is, they may wish to create a social function around events such as art fairs, and thereby make the art world realise the value of having a presence in the cultural sector. This may be seen as a PR exercise, in order to leverage the art world into providing the social function of the event.  This is problematic in the context of a city such as Liverpool, where a number of arts organisations have a substantial membership base, and others have established cultural followings in the city.</text>

Artworlds Digital Divide  A digital divide is developing between artworlds and their patrons.  Artworlds are sponsoring large-scale, long-term cultural events, and as a result are at a disadvantage in this context.  The challenge in approaching this as an art event is to create opportunities for artists to engage with the cultural resources of the area and to create cultural change within the art world. In my view, venues like the Chisenhale Gallery, whose programming and curatorial focus are aligned with the goals of the contemporary art biennale, are at a disadvantage because they are dependent on funding from the art funders and have limited autonomy within the context of the festival.  Instead, I would suggest that a biennale should be structured with artists’ organisations, and particularly artists' agent–a non-profit organisation with specific missions that align with the values and interests of the contemporary art biennale.  Artworlds are at a disadvantage in this context because their programming and curatorial focus is aligned with those of the contemporary art biennale, but their substance and purpose is in danger of being diluted or nullified by the increasingly important need to plug surplus cultural sectors into the art biennale equation.

The challenge in approaching this as an art event is to create opportunities for artists to engage with the cultural resources of the area and to create cultural change within the art world. In my view, artists’ cultural capital is created when it is shared.  Artworlds are at a disadvantage in this context because they sponsor large-scale cultural events that draw in huge numbers of people, and therefore have limited resources. However, there are other challenges as well. For instance, in an area with a large population, it is increasingly common for local artists to establish a studio or collective, i.e. a publishing house, and to open a store with a dedicated art and fine arts section.  Artworlds, on the other hand, are more vulnerable because they are rarefaction and have limited resources, making them the target of a cultural juggernaut.  Artworlds, however, are vulnerable because they are cultural insular and dependent on the events that take place in the area. As events in the area unfold, so do their resources, meaning that they are stretched thin.  Art world data feeds the cultural insularity, but this relationship is more valuable to the</text>

The challenge in approaching this as an art event is to create opportunities for artists to engage with the cultural resources of the area and to create cultural change within the art world. In my view, such cultural action is possible through events that draw on knowledge and are informed by the best available science, but are also through actions that draw on experience and are informed by the values and beliefs of a community of artists and activists.  The other challenge is to create experiences that are relevant and allow the local artist to participate in a meaningful way. I would not want to prevent an artist from coming to the event and engaging with the issues raised by the community, but I also don't want to prevent artists from coming because they believe in what they want to do and want to. For me, the role is for an artist to tell a story in a way that resonates with people and places, and for the community to join in that story telling.  Artworlds and their patrons need to find ways to work with those values and beliefs that are at odds with contemporary practices and needs.  An example of this can be seen in the relationship between the San Diego Zoo and the Animal Liberation Front</text>

The challenge in approaching this as an art event is to create opportunities for artists to engage with the cultural resources of the area and to create cultural change within the art world. In my view, this requires artists to be able to speak, act and think creatively globally in a globalised artworld. We must learn to communicate with each other, and with emerging media. Someday, I hope to be able to be a producer of multimedia art events.  Artworld data-gathering is a necessity in a cultural ecology, but it is also a creative perforator of taboos, and a catalyst of new ideas and strategies. While it may create acolytes, it also seeks to educate artists about the many ways art is made and consumed in a given community. It must also address a community’s own cultural practices and beliefs.  Artworld data-gathering is an art event, but it is also a data-gathering event, and it is an art event with a data-gathering community.

The shift in the technological landscape that follows a major art festival is afoot, and acts of remembrance are essential in this decisive moment. At this juncture, digital objects are deployed in a context where political, economic and social dynamics are radically different from those of our present, and new, industrial forms of economic domination. The cultural geographies of the connected cities are being rewritten, and new social forms are emerging. The digital footprint is growing ever larger, and as a consequence, every artefact has a digital footprint. The digital footprint represents a radically different</text>

    Working with algorithms, scientists and engineers to develop tools to detect chemical compounds in the environment was originally the domain of civil servants and other public servants. However, as technology improved and the civil servants moved into the workplace, the public became increasingly disengaged from the civic sphere and disconnected from the decisions that civil servants and other technologists had to make, which was reflected in the rate of change of civil unrest. When the National Health Service (NHS) was established in 1948, it was partly to address this sense of passive disengagement and to create a mechanism to determine when and how to engage with the workforce. However, the appointment of technologists as workers' representatives in the workplace also stimulated a resistance to technologists’ ideas and proposals. As a result, the NHS was not established with a workforce but with programmes of education and outreach through which workers could become involved in solving problems.

In 1952, for instance, the first Aircraft Owners Association was formed to represent aircraft manufacturers and aircraft pilots. Later, in 1963, the Aircraft Owners sponsored the first Aircraft Surplus Company to stock commercial aircraft. These organisations sought to counter the effect of technological change by encouraging the recycling of existing aircraft by encouraging the practice of making and buying new aircraft. 	 In the 1980s and 1990s, the incorporation of new media and interactive technologies in culture was a big part of this. As technology became more pervasive in society, and more accessible, workers had many different ways of interacting with it. Art, for instance, became an ever more accessible way to convey ideas and perspectives on the workings of technology. 	But the incorporation of new media and interactive technologies in the workplace also fed a culture war that sought to reimagine the role of the worker in the society as an agent of change through technological innovation. This cultural ecology – a world where humans actually play a role in shaping the world around them – was closely tied to the emergence of new media and interactive technologies, which made it easier for workers to become immersed in ever larger narratives</text>

The BFI has always been an important presence in the UK film and television industries, and has a long-standing joint venture with Fox Searchlight Pictures. The BFI has facilitated the transfer of technology from workers to clients through its Film Studies department, and has published numerous peer-reviewed books on technology and art.  Aesthetics was a principal field of inquiry for the BFI and its members, and the film producer Samuel Goldwyn would often demonstrate a special affinity for the work of the aesthete, Nancy Sinacqua.  BFI members attended numerous art school and film school in the UK, and also regularly visited the US and Germany. They included John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Janis Joplin, Bonnie Raitt, Sharon Jones, Mike Oldfield, Terry Gilliam, Steven Soderbergh, and Steven Spielberg.

Later, in 1963, the British Chemical and Optometric Association joined the BCA.  At that time, the BCA was also an employee of the MOD, so it was possible for workers to contribute to the development of the ‘Great Game’ through their work with the company.  At the same time, there was a need for skilled workers and the creation of new ways of interacting with the city. Accordingly, in the 1960s and 1970s, BCA and MOD members established Cooperative Service Centres, which offered a range of activities for workers interested in pursuing skills or pursuing an alternative lifestyle. These worker-run centres attracted skilled workers from all over the city and beyond and introduced them to the politics of language, art, activism and new ways of being in communities.  The aim of these worker-centred initiatives was to create a mutually beneficial working relationship between the city and the company, through which the city could exert control over the company’s destiny through legislation or other means</text>

In 1975, the first Aerospace Writers Association was formed to represent the trade unionists who worked in the aerospace industry. 	One might add another layer to this history of disengagement and resistance to change, this time focusing on the women who worked in the public sector. In the early part of the twentieth century, it was not uncommon for women to be in the workplace but for many decades it was not customary for women to fully participate in decision-making bodies or institutions. The importance of this historical moment cannot be understated and it continues to be poorly represented in our cultural imagination and history. 	However, the advent of automated production processes and computerisation did change all that. In the last decades of the twentieth century, the productivity of women in senior management roles soared and new social objectives emerged: more women in management, greater equality, more women in the boardrooms. New social objectives coupled with the automation of production processes allowed</text>

Later, in 1963, the first Aircraft Writers Association was formed to represent the work of the aircraft trade. 	When the civil aviation industry was revived in the early 1970s, a new set of grievances emerged: the kinds of engineering and computer expertise that had given rise to advanced technologies were being used to create increasingly sophisticated surveillance systems that could monitor and analyse large areas of the urban environment. These involved not only civil servants and technicians but also artists, writers, musicians and architects. The ways in which civil servants and other stakeholders in the aviation industry were involved in the creation of the radars that would later be known as Arrowhead could not have been more different from the ways in which workers were involved in the construction of the aircraft. 	One could argue that the ways in which art was employed in the 1950s and 1960s in an artist’s context was in part a response to the fact that there was no formal training for artists to engage with the work they were creating. However, one could also argue</text>

Later, in 1963, the British Film Institute was founded to represent British film-makers abroad. 	The broadening of these frameworks allowed the new media of communications, film, photographs, pop art and political activism to be imagined as a possible future for working-class communities. 	In the years that followed, various forms of organisation emerged to take on neoliberalism’s destructive effects. Film and artistic action stepped back while academics and other artisanshed more fully into the machinery. But the tendency toward abstraction and the proliferation of abstract representations remained. 	Artists, critics and other artisanshed up to fill the void created by the ban on artistic activity within work communities. But their most potent interventions, such as  	The Beatles Art Update in 1964,  	Panorama in 1985 and  	Grand Contemporary Art Exhibition in 1993, opened up new vistas of social and political change for British culture and society.

In the 1990s, the aviation community started a High Performance Computing Initiative (HPCI) to address critical performance issues in the industry. The HPCI was initially focused on areas of research and development by the public sector, but over time, the organisation brought together industry, academia, the military and other stakeholders to work on design, implementation and research.  The development of critical performance tools and techniques was driven by the likes of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, with support from the US Department of Defence and the US Navy.

Later, in 1963, the British Council established the British Automotive Association (BCAA). The BCAA was initially established to represent the interests of British carmakers, but over time expanded to represent other sectors of the British car and vehicle industry. Today, the BCAA is Britain’s largest trade organisation and is a significant voice for the British carmaker. It campaigns for better transport links between the car and the truck, for better roads and bridges, and for better infrastructure. It also represents manufacturers in the EU27 and works with other sectors of the UK, such as farmers, to help them achieve higher profits in the UK and abroad.  On a technical level, the BCAA is an unsurprising extension of the UK’s automotive industry, since the EU27 share a common vehicle production and distribution system. On a political level, the BCAA can be seen as an instrument for the establishment of British industry abroad, because it is an inherently pro-British body.  A look</text>

These are but a few examples of many that can be cited.  One of the first things a worker told a civil servant when he started off on his or her new job was the need for a loyalty card. The idea had been around for several years and was part of the civil servant's job description. In fact, many civil servants still held this view even though it was becoming increasingly difficult to deliver quality services in the workplace.  One of the first acts of the new Labour government, Kevin Courtney’s Honourary Doctorate in Civil Engineering at the University of Glasgow, was an act to formalise this in the law. A law that would come to define what constituted a ‘Workers Party’ was passed. The act recognised the fact that a workers’ organisation existed and invited the co-operation of workers’ councils.

I think that there is a contradiction in thinking about culture as something that’s static and predictable, and culture as something that’s dynamic and unpredictable. The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be predictable, but somehow, someway, culture seems to produce its followers, whether that’s through a social contract with a host community, through cultural institutions like schools and art galleries, or through the work of artists and curators who put themselves out there and put their bodies on the line every day. It’s like a rainforest, but it’s also a very specific set of cultural institutions with their specific ways of organising themselves and their lives. When you’re talking about a city, the paradox is that you’re not really talking about the forest or the city; you’re not really saying what the city is like in its entirety. But there are certain fundamental assumptions about what the city means to a particular community, like what the 'city' metaphor means to a particular community of people.

This is interesting to me, because I think a lot of that dynamic is generated by events like the Biennale, but it’s also due to the fact that we live in a world where there are now over 6,000 cultural organisations registered, and they have their own unique set of problems, priorities and so forth. So the question becomes, who has the resources and who has the cultural competency?  The answer is that there are of course many different kinds of cultural competencies, but I think that what we can do is to categorise them into four broad categories: practical, theoretical, strategic and visionary. Theoretical, practical and strategic cultural competencies are things that can be learnt, and can be integrated into one of several ways of organising knowledge. Cultural competencies, by and large, I would argue, are the things that</text>

I’m not saying New York is the answer, but New York is a very important place in terms of who we are as individuals, as a species, and as a way of thinking about our place in the world. It’s part of who we’re trying to become. It’s a very powerful place to live in and to work in.But what kind of culture produces that kind of power? There’s a way of thinking about what the Creative Class is and isn’t, and the way in which the city is produced through what’s commonly referred to as ‘culture’. I think that there is a contradiction in thinking about culture as something that’s static and predictable, and culture as something that’s dynamic and unpredictable. The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static, predictable and unrepresentative. But we humans are social creatures, and we’re prone to making massive social mistakes, whether we’re trying to live in harmony as a species or as a species in harmony with itself. We’re prone to cultural misadventures. We’re prone to paedophilia, for instance. But the point of trying to understand what culture produces in order to try to help create that kind of culture is to say that the social costs of that kind of culture are real, and that social tensions are real, and that struggles for social change are real. And the social production of culture is a social struggle, and the social struggle of the creative class is a social struggle.But the social struggles of the creative class today are different from the social struggles of the past. The struggles today are caused by an economy that no longer reproduces the way it was imagined to work – in which everyone produces enough to feed ourselves and our families</text>

I think that there is a contradiction in thinking about culture as something that’s static and predictable, and culture as something that’s dynamic and unpredictable. The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static, but in the age of the biennial, there’s a pressure to be unpredictable, and that creates a tension. There’s a tension between the amount of data that’s being collected and the ways in which that data is being made; between the art world’s role and that of the artist. The biennial has a huge cultural power in and through itself, and the biennial is the only institution that has the institutional capacity to effectively harness that culture. The biennial is a production line that’s being operated by the city, and the city is the only organism that has the political will to push it through. But the biennial is also a very specific production line that’s operating at the moment, and the city is a point of no return: It goes against everything that’s being produced in the city. The biennial, like the museum, is an evolving production line, and its output is constantly shifting.</text>

I think that there is a contradiction in thinking about culture as something that’s static and predictable, and culture as something that’s dynamic and unpredictable. The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static: there’s a reason why we're in it. But what happens in and around the arts world is culture as contingency. It happens when and as circumstances require it, and it’s the messy nature of life that we call culture. That’s what I mean by the contradiction between what we traditionally think of as the arts world and what the creative class actually produces: artists, curators, writers, etc. The paradoxical thing about it is that the cultural production that we associate with the arts tends to consume the very culture that we produce, which in turn produces the very meaning of the term. For example, I don’t think that the word ‘culture’ has ever meant what it means now; the work that’s produced through the term is culture-destroying. In the 1980s and 1990s the work of the curatorial was instrumental in creating what I would define as a globalised and marketised notion of art and</text>

I think that there is a contradiction in thinking about culture as something that’s static and predictable, and culture as something that’s dynamic and unpredictable. The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static and predictable, but what it does is create and propagate certain kinds of uncertainty and uncertainty around certain kinds of social interactions and political interactions. But the question is: what does that uncertainty and uncertainty look like? And I think that comes from a different place, which is about how we conceive of the precariousness of the social condition and the social relations between people. If we think of the social totality as a struggle for survival, and the cultural as a set of relations that produce and facilitate certain kinds of struggle, we’d start to see that cultural production is intrinsically connected to certain kinds of struggle.There’s a way of thinking about social life and the political relations between communities that doesn’t get pinned on one kind of consciousness or consciousness of the city. It’s a different kind of thinking. That kind of thinking starts to see social life through the particular cultural practices of a particular neighbourhood, or even of a particular neighbourhood community. That starts to see cultural practices</text>

I think that there is a contradiction in thinking about culture as something that’s static and predictable, and culture as something that’s dynamic and unpredictable. The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static, predictable and uninteresting. But what the city produces is a massively different kind of culture. It’s culture of participation, of often unwitting participation, which is why people stay, why the city fills with culture and what it produces, but it’s also culture of domination, of the colonised. The paradoxical thing about culture, at least in New York, is that it’s supposed to be participatory, but in practice that does not happen. The fact that things that we normally consider to be important in our lives are also supposed to be produced in the city, whether that’s through the city’s capacity for economic growth through its docks, or the city’s capacity for cultural production through its play houses, or the city’s ability to be a source of ideas and ideas through its museums, theatres, gardens, parks and so on. And that is culture in action. The paradoxical thing about culture is that</text>

I think that there is a contradiction in thinking about culture as something that’s static and predictable, and culture as something that’s dynamic and unpredictable. The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static and predictable – expecting no static or predictable outcomes. But what the city does with its culture is what I call the dynamic and unpredictable (in the sense that the city itself is said to be, or can be). The city produces outcomes, and these have a logic to them). The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static and predictable, but cultural production produces a world of its own (in the sense that the city itself is said to be, or can be). In the city, the paradoxical element is what I would call its static, predictable and present – what the city produces through what it produces through what it produces through what it produces through what it produces through what it’s producing through). I think that there’s a way of thinking about culture as a production system that produces outcomes beyond the control of any particular producer or settler class. And I think that that dynamic and unpredictable quality is part of what makes the city possible</text>

I think that there is a contradiction in thinking about culture as something that’s static and predictable, and culture as something that’s dynamic and unpredictable. The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static, predictable and uneventful. But the more events that occur in it, the less it appears that those events are static and predictable. That’s why you need art forms, artistic action and utopian dream scenarios to anchor and constrain what you can and can't do. During the 1970s, the New Frontier Arts Centre was creating what became known as the New Frontier Arts Project. This was an art form that was supposed to be unchanging, unlike what we have now, and it’s this idea of eventfulness that was at the core of the eventful life that the city was attempting to impose upon us. But what the city was failing to achieve in its attempt to impose a unique cultural form upon us, or attempt to create something new and different from what we were already doing, was creating what could be called a new ‘normality’. And so the paradoxical situation that the city was in became ever more marked by cultural</text>

The paradoxical thing about culture is that it’s supposed to be static and predictable. But what’s supposed to happen is precisely the opposite: what’s meant to happen is precisely the opposite: there is a tendency to project, to make things happen that aren’t meant to happen. So while the city is supposed to grow in power and wealth and so forth, it’s actually quite the opposite: the more power is concentrated in the hands of the few, the fewer resources there are left for the many to exploit. This is what we mean when we talk about ‘culture deserts’ – areas where people live in constant fear of being deprived of their wealth – though of course, there are other factors that we could also be talking about, such as climate change, urban growth and so forth. One of the things that I did as an architect in terms of trying to imagine a future for the city was to try to imagine what that future might be like. I’ve always thought of the city as a big</text>

I’m open to new ideas and new ways of organising our work, and I’m open to learning from others and making something new. The key is to stay open-minded, patient and persistent.

There’s a huge gap between the people who perceive themselves as artists and the people who do actually make art. I think that gap is what gives the illusion of community. I don’t think that artists really understand the politics of their situations, or that communities really do. I think that what artists do really is challenging themselves to really understand the politics of their situation. I don’t think that community really understands the politics of their situation because there’s a huge cognitive divide between the people who perceive themselves as artists and the people who actually make art.I see community projects as an asset, and in a way the art is itself a resource. It’s like a black box, or a black box with a lot of sensitive information that can be exploited. Similarly, </text>

For me, it’s up to each artist to decide what relationship they want to have with the community they work with. And that relationship has to be meaningful. I don’t think that a community would recognise an artist if they didn’t feel it was meaningful to them.So, there are artists who see Community Arts work as a way of life and are artists in their own right but also artists who identify as Community Arts practitioners but don’t see themselves as artists because they don’t see themselves as artists. And I get really frustrated when people say, ‘I’m not from that community, so what can I do?’ I’m like, ‘there’s a difference between artist and person.

I would describe it as a ‘curatorial dance’, and it would be like how artists and art organisations approach making works of art: how to make the best work possible, in relation to the tasks at hand, but also in relation to the political, social and cultural complexities that we humans inhabit. I would say that the artworks would be produced in relation to the community in which they are made, and the work would be produced in relation to the community as a whole. But that is not how my thinking works. My thinking is more about spaces and communities and how they are constructed and managed. I don’t see community work</text>

But if it’s going to be something that represents the city then you have to make sure that it’s going to be something that represents the city in a way that resonates with people. That’s what the Biennale is about: resonating with people.

I’m open to new people telling me or telling ideas that I’m putting into practice.That last bit about working with people who aren’t aligned with my values is particularly relevant. There are a lot of organisations – large and small – who would love to have a say in what art is and how we engage with the world. But I don’t think that joining those organisations is the answer. I’m open to new ideas and new ways of working with people who are already artists or creative people. Having a say in what is and isn’t artist-led is a great thing, but having a say in how we engage with the world is a much more potent way of creating change. Building community action groups is another way in which organisations can be made more accountable and empowered.

But I’m interested in finding ways to work with people who have a point of view, and not necessarily in adopting that point of view.That line of thinking leads me to questions like, who am I trying to impress? And what does it mean to impress people? I think a lot of the time, people want to be impressed by someone who is different from them, whereas in a larger context people want to be impressed by something that represents them and the world as it really is. When you start implementing a practice that doesn’t exist yet, and someone says ‘That can’t be true!’ That is a radical change from when I used to work, where people would say things like ‘That’s</text>

Working with the Arts Council allowed me to learn a lot about how the Arts Council works, and also to gain a lot of knowledge about the Community Arts movement. For me, the Community Arts movement is about more than just the artist and their work, and it’s about the way in which the Arts Council works, about how it’s run and supported and about how it’s governed. It’s about social work and arts education, and it’s also about politics and social work and cultural theory and how those relate to each other, but that’s just how I interpreted the movement. The Community Arts community doesn’t necessarily agree with everything that the Arts Council does, but they’ve always understood that there are deeper values at stake in this relationship than just the art</text>

The more I felt like an artist, the less I felt like an artist. The word artist still had a huge impact on who I was able to work with, and how I felt about myself. I was able to work with people who saw themselves as artists first, which is important to me. I don’t want to reduce that to identifying as an artist; it’s much more complex. I want to see how I can bring my values and beliefs to the table, and how that might help create a space for artists to be able to express themselves and create artistic experiences. I don’t want to impose my beliefs or ideas on anyone; that would be limiting.

    Working with algorithms, the potential is there to change the world; creating ever larger, more nuanced and connected systems that are capable of handling more data, of recording and analysing more data and so on. And this is where we are today, almost a century and a half into the future. And so, we are at a point now where we are asking, can we imagine a future where not all data is created equal? Can we imagine a future where every bit of data is created equal? And perhaps this is where artificial intelligence and computerisation may play a part in making that possible.That is the field I come from: a biennial with a huge research agenda. And so, yes, there is a race to the bottom, as to what is valuable and what is not.

That is, can you imagine a future in which art is valued highly enough that it is possible to alter that value? And so, there is a dimension to the call to arms: there is a way to read this as a call to arms that is both calloused towards the aesthetic and that is intent on obliterating meaning in the name of progress.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleI work as an artist and educator.

And so, there is a struggle for meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated society.In fact, there is a very good reason why biennials are, today, so busy trying to understand everything that is happening around them and delivering it to museums and galleries: it is that the world around them is so automated that it is nearly impossible to tell where art comes from or where commerce comes from. There is no real sense of place anymore and so it is almost impossible to know where to draw the line between what is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and what is ethically questionable. And so, there is a constant struggle between those who are trained to recognise art and those who are not.And so, yes, there is a struggle for meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated society. And perhaps, in the future, biennials may return to tell the stories of their own creation.But for now, we must seek meaning in what is otherwise often defined as lessening technologicalisation, or as much as humanly possible.

This is true whether we are talking about railways, roads, bridges, tunnels, ports, cities or even farms. And so, there is a sense that the machines are no longer the main actors in the world. And this is part of the reason why biennials are so popular in the world today: because the social implication of the machines is so strong. And so, there is a conflict between the aesthetic and the practical in many ways. There is a sense of aesthetic value in the machines, and so the biennial is a story about aesthetic outcomes. And of course, there is a practical value in the machines as well – in that they produce what are called ‘impact statistics’ – which are reports about the economic outcomes of various projects or programmes. And so, there is a conflict between the aesthetic and the impact statistician</text>

And so, there is a struggle for meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated society.In fact, machines now rule more of what is considered to be human culture than they do in the wild. And this is one area in which biennials have an especially vulnerable position: in the wild, machines have the capacity to wander off the path of most humans, but also in large social settings, particularly when interacting with other species, including humans. And so, biennials play a particularly perilous role in our increasingly social media-obsessed world. There is a reason why biennials are so critical of the way in which social media is evolving. They see it as an area of potential growth for humanity, but also of potential destruction. And so, there is a tension between the biennial, which is deeply invested in the future of the art form, and the way in which the art is being made today.And this tension is particularly acute in the art world, where the increasing dispersion of artistic talent and the consequent shortage of artists means that the art form is no longer</text>

But there is also a great deal of meaning when things actually happen. And so, there is a struggle for meaning between the machines and the humans – meaning systems that can recognise and process vast amounts of data and make meaning from it.I did not come to Art’s School to do an aesthetic assessment of the world. I came to it to learn how to code. And so, I began to write programs that observed and engaged with the world through data. And so, I began to understand how to create my own future.I do not claim to have solved the problems of the world.

Robots are the arbiters of what is beautiful and what is not beautiful. And so, there is a struggle for meaning-producing activities among those who now call themselves artists and who have in recent years also included those who call themselves creators. And there is a struggle for meaning in a world where machines are the masters of the machine, where ethics are subordinate to algorithms, and where art is often prostituted in the service of a serviceable algorithm.On the one side of the equation, there is the artist who is asked to automate certain kinds of work; on the other is the work that is produced when humans engage with a computer system that knows how to organise the world according to its recognisable forms of life. And so, we have seen how the autonomous vehicle that Jonathan I know and love is part of a larger system that produces not only great art but</text>

It is a brilliant book. And she begins by quoting M. Roland Malthus, who was one of the first to theorise about the diminishing returns problem. And he said, quote, ‘Beauty is a burden, a burden to be discarded in pursuit of many other objects of consumption.’ So there is this long history of struggle between those with a sense of aesthetics and those with a sense of ethics.Look: I used to love watching basketball when I was a kid. I used to love going to the movies. I used to go to church. I used to play sports. I used to drive tacky sports cars. I used to swing on paintballs. But there was always something fundamentally different about what I was consuming. And so, there was a sense of loss for me as a kid growing up in the 1980s</text>

I wanted to do a symphony of images from the past, present, and future of architecture and urbanisation in an urban environment, using the buildings as symbols of emancipation. I wanted to do a kind of ethnography of architects and urban designers in an attempt to map their work and identity as architects and urbanists of the twentieth century. I wanted to know what their institutional identities were in the context of the city of Liverpool at the end of the century. And so, there was a tension between the institutional interest in maintaining the identity of the past, which could be seen as inherently opposed to the challenges posed by the emergence of new technologies and the pressures of global urbanisation. And there was a tension between the pressures of the global urbanisation agenda, which is now dominated by the United States</text>

Indeed, the Black Arts exhibition was often presented as a counterweight to the white arts titans, who routinely (but not always successfully) challenged the practice of bringing together artists from diverse disciplines and creating a common arena of art practice.2  The Black Arts exhibition was no exception. It is often cited as an example of the Black Arts movement, but surprisingly little is said about the events leading up to the show, other than in passing. Until recently, the term ‘Black Arts�</text>

These artists and their audiences understood the stakes. Those who would deny the historic, contemporaneous character of the Black Arts movement are invited to consider the fact that between 1905 and 1970 the United Arts Association (UAA) was planning to unveil a series of fourteen-city exhibitions in six major cities in North America focused on African art forms. The first of these, in Stoney Creek, Alberta, Canada, in 1980, was marred by violence as a response to the anti-Amerikaner protests that were brewing in the city. The protests turned violent, and violence spread to include students, police, and even university teachers’ positions. The violence ended up involving over twenty people dead and over a million displaced.  The sudden and violent end to the protests did not sit well with the white artists who saw this as a prelude to a larger repressive strategy. In a letter to the Black Arts group, UAA President Frederick W. Palmer Jr. stated:  I offe [*think:] that since the beginning of the UAA, art has often been used by those in power as a counterattack</text>

These artists and their audiences understood the stakes. Those who would deny the historic, contemporaneous character of the Black Arts movement, its social context and social consequences are engaging in a form of historical ignorance.  The Black Arts movement was not an isolated event. During the 1920s and 1930s, there were several waves of artistic experimentation and artistic mutism among artists, often led by black artists, in response to the perceived excesses and injustices of capitalism. The Black Arts, while popular with artists, were not without risks and limitations.  The Black Arts tradition was built on physical, mental and social barriers. Its articulation and sustained use meant that ‘black culture’ was seen as a socially operative, even a transformative force.  The Black Arts tradition is deeply embedded in the African diaspora. It is a force of resistance, a myth of London’s Southwark neighbourhood and an essential part of the history of the present-day Sudan, now part of South Sudan.  The Black Arts practice was also marked by the strategic misuse of language.  The Black Arts were not at all</text>

Those who would deny the historic, contemporaneous character of the Black Arts movement and the motivations that drove its creation are engaging in a form of historical amnesia.2  The Black Arts movement sought to undo the damage done by the cultural erasure that had been occurring in the community through direct action, using art as a weapon and a political statement. In the words of the title of the exhibition, ‘Black Arts is Back’.3  Art and social practice students from the Kingston University School of Art, along with artists from other fields, visited the site of the former Greene’s Studios and the Fruitvale Arts Centre, located within walking distance of each other. They observed firsthand the history and the making of the exhibition, its production, and its reception. Many of the artists who performed at the Chelsea Arts Centre were invited back, and many of the students who worked alongside them at the former site returned to the art school to pursue further education, becoming artists themselves or forming collaborative artistic-design teams.

But the history of the Black Arts movement is central to the exhibition’s authenticity. The exhibition should articulate the stakes and offer a way to consider the meaning of the work in question, while maintaining the capacity to generate knowledge by way of a conversation. A question that came up time and again during the exhibition was, how did we get here? The same questions were asked of the Black Arts movement, but the responses suggested an ever-increasingly optimistic future for black creative practice. The biennial offered a way to think about these questions in a way that not many people wanted to or couldn’t.  The main exhibition format continued to be a recording of the events that took place in St Petersburg in 1999, although the Black Arts project went beyond this. There were performances, poetry, films, games, meetings, performances, events and much more. Some people said that the main reason that the Black Arts project was able to move so</text>

Those who would deny the historic, contemporaneous character of the Black Arts movement and its artists would do well to research the history of Black Arts and its contributors.  Making Art Today  One can trace the origins of the Black Arts movement back to the late nineteenth century, to the Black Arts societies that emerged in the US and Europe at that time, and to the late twentieth century black cultural and social activism. The Black Arts was a counter culture to the more mainstream, modernist arts, and it is this counter culture that weaves its practices into the fabric of the contemporary black experience. The Black Arts tradition stresses the need to be active and engaged in creating art, whether that art is performance, curating, or just being made visible in public places. In both the arts and social movements that emerged during the twentieth century, participation was a revolutionary act. Through its inclusion and active participation, the Black Arts movement affirmed the individual agency of people of all identities, races, creeds and creeds, creeds that were often at odds with one another.

These artists and their audiences understood the stakes. Those who would deny the historic, contemporaneous character of the Black Arts movement must also address the question: how did the Black Arts community react to the historical and contemporaneous use of their art? In the twentieth century there was a strong push for more radical forms of art, especially for those engaged with creating social change through art, to be made outside of the binary sphere of socially engaged art. As the Black Arts movement grew, artists faced new forms of marginalization and exclusion. Today, the question is whether the Black Arts tradition can be revived and whether black artists can be fully engaged and even empowered to produce their own radical art.  The other significant biennial that developed in the United States during this period was the Venice Biennale, opened in 1993 and ending in 1999. It is notable that the Venice Biennale has never hosted an exhibition of its kind, although it is now the largest biennial in the world.

Those who would deny the historic, contemporaneous character of the Black Arts movement, and its place in our urban fabric, would do well to pay attention to the fact that the biennial format was one that was developed in response to this historical moment.  Artists who were part of the Black Arts movement at the time were as aware of its historical dimensions as any other art practitioner.  	Now, we can call this multi-generational art. How to Know About Art's Pasture 21  In 2003, I curated Monument Valley, the largest public art project in the United States. The project was inspired by the historical actions of the Stoney Tribe, whose name is taken from the place where the first permanent houses were burned down by the Nazis during the second World War. The site was chosen because it was near major interstate highways, which allowed access to both sides of the conflict. As the film Wallander shows, the film-makers followed the stories of the Stoney People well into the twentieth century, and into the twenty-first</text>

In the early twentieth century, for example, the Black Arts movement was a name given to the artistic practices of the militant black community; today it is a globally visible expression of frustration and rage centered on white cultural administrators. These artists and their audiences understood the stakes. Those who would deny the historic, contemporaneous character of the Black Arts movement are therefore committing a historical and contemporary whitewashing of the movement’s political, economic and social significance. The Black Arts project, including the artists who came out of it, was a radical reimagination of what the biennial could be, since it was understood by many of its practitioners as fundamentally a museum and not a place of creative, interesting and provocative action. The project was also a major driver of the development of intergenerational art, since many of the artists who came out of it and subsequently formed major curatorial projects were influenced by the events as they occurred, and their subsequent work is often influenced by the events as a whole. These biennials gave birth to a host of new artistic practices, including Community Arts, which I have described as progressive, even revolutionary. Artists who emerged out of this are at the very least critical of the way we engage with artists’ contribution to society and the world we live in. And they may be artists who have had</text>
    <text>disastrous machine curated by an elite of architects, designed to maximize returns for the state, in the interests of global finance, capital and the dominant elite’s owners of the means of production. The exhibition was based on the work of several hundred artists, with a strong emphasis on the contributions of black artists. The exhibition brought together several of these artists and their studios in a process of archiving, production and communication. The studios themselves extended back into the city, taking on a life of their own as sites for storage, temporary exhibitions and display. The project grew organically, organically assembling elements of different eras, worlds and locales into a continuous whole.  In the early twentieth century, for example, the Black Arts movement was a name given to the artistic practices of the militant black community; today it is a globally visible expression of frustration and rage centered on white cultural administrators. These artists and their audiences understood the stakes. Those who would deny the historic, contemporaneous character of the Black Arts movement are engaging in a form of historical misidentification. These artists witnessed the emergence of new, disruptive practices that challenged long-standing assumptions about who was able to express his or her cultural identity, and how those cultural identities should be constituted and expressed. They worked with communities to reimagine and revitalize sites and practices to reflect the contradictory impulses and histories of their urban environments. Their stories, their architectures, their portfolios, their plans – they were places, they were data, they were tools – became data feeds for new modes of social and spatial transformation. This was not an easy task, and it was not without risk. But the transformative power of such projects lies in their ability to disrupt old ways of doing things in unexpected and unexpected places. This was not easy to do for the white artists who were central to the early wave of Black Arts projects, but the projects themselves are powerful in their insistence on their own historical identities and claims to the urban space. They are a sustained and ongoing project.</text>

The name Granby refers to the original four streets of the old city, where artists and community organisers first planted a canteen of ideas and practices that would later be known as Granby. An updated iteration of Granby is now housed in Welsh Streets, which was also the site of the aborted Welsh Streets mini-suburb. The plan is to create a ‘city within a city’, a hybrid of the two, quasi-biennale-like structure and sub-regionalised cultural ecosystem within the city. 	The Granby Four Streets Partnership is asking for financial support to begin construction on the neighbourhood within the next two years.

The name Granby refers to the trade-union building at Granby High School where students from both English and Italian Heritage Heritage Schools traditionally gathered to discuss, debate and debate the history and identity of the district. The Granby Four Streets Partnership is an evolving, multi-use concept that has recently begun to refer to the neighbourhood as a whole. 	The Granby Four Streets Partnership started as a blog, has evolved into an organisation, and now operates as a non-profit organisation with a national network of affiliates. 	Since its beginning, Granby has fostered an environment of mutual respect and understanding between workers and residents. We’ve all benefited from the building trade, and at times, the cooperative movement has come to complement the trade. The ethos of the Granby Four Streets Partnership is to contribute to the collective building of Granby by creating shared opportunities and giving back to the community through activities such as art projects, free childcare for many of the residents and school trips to Granby,</text>

The name Granby is a play on words – Granby Four Streets – and a pun on Granby, New York City’s fourteenth-century, baroque quarter housing the Fourteenth Imperial Roman and Venetian Venetian and Renaissance statues, which served as the city’s formal setting and formal residences. The Granby Four Streets Partnership’s proposal is to create a multi-purpose district with a cultural edge that reflects the history and character of Granby, while resisting the temptation to down-size the district by creating a minimalist mixed-use development that will serve as a museum or a boutique hotel or a low-rise apartment building that will serve as a commercial centre and night-life district.1  The Granby Four Streets Partnership began planning for Granby five years early, in early 2012.

The name Granby is an acronym that describes the neighbourhood’s layered layers and how they interpenetrate; its irregular morphology, the fact that it is part of London, and the fact that it is one of the world’s most visited tourist destinations. 	The Granby Four Streets Partnership’s first phase will see the creation of a Master Plan for Granby, with an initial public offering of residential, community and office space, a public plaza and a range of roundabouts and hidden walkways constructed in phases. Phase two will see the production of a ‘90% public referendum’ on the development of Granby, with Granby Council spearheading the development and the 90% of the local people voting in favour of the plan.

The Granby Four Streets Partnership is a new kind of neighbourhood development company. It is not established on the back of nostalgia, but seeks to engage with the past in a way that anticipates what can and cannot happen in the future.

The biennial market is a landscape of expectations, and with the expectations of the market now displaced by the actuality of things happening in the city, it falls to the market to create the required change.

The name Granby is a pseudonym chosen by the artist Sophie Hope for the neighbourhood, since she fears for her safety in the event of a community meeting: ‘a group of young people could decide to take over our home and turn it into a club’, she says. 	Hope is not alone in feeling that way. In a statement, the UK’s National Union of Students says that the use of a given name undermines ‘any credibility that is built up by that name and its implied identity, and by association, in the eyes of the public and policymakers towards that name[s] and the place where that name is pronounced’.

The name Granby Four Streets Partnership reflects the fact that this is a neighbourhood initiative rather than an organisation, and that the community works through a group of young people rather than an organisation. This is important in that a large proportion of the Granby community does not want to become involved in a building project that could impact their neighbourhoods in any way. 	Above all, Granby: City of Industry’s success is a result of the people who came out of the woodwork, put in their time, came out of their comfort zones, and created a place where they belong. This is why so many young people come through the door and why the space is so inviting and exciting for them. It’s not so much the projects themselves as the way in which they are integrated into the city’s fabric.

The name Granby refers to the ‘80% land and 10% real estate owned by the city’, whilst Industry refers to the ‘10% of the building and the 80% owned by the state’. So far, so normalised, there is a clear sense of resistance to the notion of the ‘city’ as a spatial unit, and particularly against the idea of the ‘city’ as a ‘gift from the gods’. However, the introduction of new technologies and the non-linear (regeneration) interaction between people and the landscape is part of a grand plan to democratise the use of space, to take spaces collectively and, in doing so, to free people from the domination of their space. For example, the introduction of Transfield, a high-speed rail company, seems to have broken with convention and traditional modes of transport, and with the backing of the federal government, which appears</text>

These streetscape designers will develop and lead the neighbourhood’s design and construction process, providing design and construction services on a wide range of client-specific projects, including but not limited to, housing, public realm, green space, transportation, infrastructure, community facilities, and much more. 	The partnership will be led by G4S, with assistance from local community organisations. 	The challenge will be for the public designers to engage with, and mock-up, with, the different possibilities and evolve the idea as development unfolds. The final decision will be made by the Granby community and their designers, who will form a working group that will advise and negotiate the project’s final destination.

For example, the Beverly Hills Hotel, which was designed by Foster &amp; Partners and is part of the Burj Khalifa project, or even the Beverly Hilton Hotel, which is part of the Hilton Worldwide marketing campaign. The problem with the opulence image is that it’s reductive. There are so many ways of looking at the same place, and yet we associate opulence with a singular definition. The challenge for the future city is to figure out what an opulent concept is, so as not to be tethered to the singularity but also not to be tethered to anything. The challenge for the individual is to figure out what an opulent idea is, so as to be able to take that one step into the future and move forward.Fabric is a collective project, and as we say in the project description, ‘the story of the individual is woven into the fabric of the building that is the fabric of the city’.

It’s the opposite of opulence – the very definition of the word – and yet so many of us associate opulence with opulence. Opulence is the highest form of luxury; it’s the source of the animal kingdom’s grandeur. But in the 21st century, opulence is the highest form of social failure. It’s the era of the giant social network, of course.And yet we still need to figure out what the heck the heck that giant social network is supposed to be like. How do we animate the question from, say, architecture and design, into something more manageable like the social networks we’re building today? I like to think of the architecture of the present as largely generated by and through the design processes that followed the petro-societies of the past. Look at how housing was created in the early 1900s: in large part, it was through the work of professional architects such as Jones Lang LaSalle &amp; Co. in Brooklyn, which was founded on the back of the then popular log book.

It’s the opposite of opulence – the very definition of the word – and yet so many of us associate opulence with opulence. Opulence is defined as the highest form of social achievement, and yet so many of us fail to see the social value of places and communities and how they are made. One of the wonderful things about urbanisation is that it creates space and allows a range of activities, from sitting by the park or even walking to work, which in turn opens up entirely new ways of interacting with the city. But for the most part, when people move into an area, they tend to stay for a while, and then return to where they came from. Sometimes, they leave altogether. This is what happens in gentrification, the process by which developers exploit cheap space and dilute the value of buildings, and yet capture all those who lose their homes as a result. It’s a brilliant, powerful process, and yet so often the houses that are destroyed as a result of it are the poorest and most vulnerable sections of our community. In many ways, the displacement of the working class and</text>

It’s the opposite of opulence – the very definition of the word – and yet so many of us associate opulence with opulence. Opulence is about the most opulent of settings, about opulence combined with a mass of people. The reality is that in contemporary architecture, we tend to separate the elements that make up the cityscape in such a way as to enhance our own experiences of being in that city, whether that’s in terms of luxury condo towers or Beverly Hills home tours. And so there’s a disconnect between the people who are making the architecture and those who are living in it. It’s as if the architect didn’t make the buildings opulent, but the people who inhabit them. When we consider the fact that in New York City, we tend to produce projects that are counted among the most progressive and progressive buildings in the city, but in terms of their actual impact on communities we tend to produce projects that are counted among the most dystopian, destructively un-enduring places in the city, such as Bungalow Brooklyn and the Music Factory, both</text>

It’s the opposite of opulence – the very definition of the word – and yet so many of us associate opulence with opulence and grandeur. The problem with the grandiose edifice is that it takes on a life of its own; it expands and contracts, it experiences change and life’s ever-increasing amounts of movement – constantly changing, and yet also always subject to the vagaries of nature’s capital accumulation and consumption. The structure is a built environment, yet the very nature of the built environment is tied up in the social. A social act such as the weaving of cloth or the weaving of yarn requires the social to ratify it – to say, ‘Yes, that’s what you did. That’s a social act.’[3]This notion of sociality as an evolving process of interaction, negotiation and legislating has been around for a while, and it’s one that many of us take for granted. We don’t see it as that way. We think of interaction as inevitable, but we don’t</text>

The notion that we’re living in an opulent society is what Raziel Laski, a well-known architect and urbanist, in our conversation in The Resident talks about in great detail. If you take the time to appreciate Laski’s thinking and work, you realize that there’s a way of thinking about our present that’s quite different from the way architecture is typically imagined. The way architecture is supposed to work is that way because of massive administrative infrastructures and the like, but Laski points out that this isn’t always the case. It’s more that we humans are social creatures who naturally socialise across different sizes and types of systems: we have our city and its infrastructure as a toolbox, but also the country and the international community that we’re part of, and our wider social world through our social networks.

It’s the opposite of opulence – the very definition of the word – and yet so many of us associate opulence with opulence. Opulence is about how you live, but it’s also about who you are as a person. A facade might be good for the grandiosity of a site, but it’s not a place where you can be who you want to be. The ‘true heart’ of the city is hidden away in plain sight, and so the architects who design such structures often neglect this essential ‘hidden face’ of the city. They put too much emphasis on the ornate facade of a great edifice, and not enough on the hidden face of the city. This neglect can lead to frustration and frustration, because the frustration and frustration comes from the inability to see the city for what it is, and creates the illusion that things could be better. But the important point is that this ‘invisible hand’ that builds such structures also feeds off these contradictions and creates the illusion that the city is … well, the city.And so we often hear</text>

It’s a counterintuitive but very powerful way to imagine a world together, where differences and divides can be overcome through art. It’s as if the artist-community as a whole is wearing many different hats.When we talk about the architecture of the present, there’s a tendency to picture grandiose edifices of pure architecture – structures that appear opulent, opulent in their own right – but there’s something fundamentally wrong with this picture. It’s the opposite of opulence – the very definition of the word – and yet so many of us associate opulence with opulence. When we think about the city as a collection of pieces, the city is a collection of small pieces that together form a whole. When we think about the city as an ecosystem, the city plays a critical role in the functioning of which can be considered to be its most vital stage. The city serves as a stage on which the artist can exert considerable control, both by manipulating and disrupting the city in various ways. When we think about cities as a collection of sub-regions, the city plays a pivotal role in the functioning of which can be considered to be its weakest link. The metropolitan region as a whole is an enormous, vast, complicated system that many of us took for granted, but which many of us didn’t pay enough attention to. We didn’t pay enough attention to the fact that the region was currently undergoing a rapid deindustrialization process that was pushing many of the metropolises to crisis, or that the cities were becoming increasingly overcrowded</text>

It’s the opposite of opulence – the very definition of the word – and yet so many of us associate opulence with opulence. We’ve all seen the pictures of the opulent neighbourhoods in Paris or New York, or maybe even in London’s High Streets, where people are crammed together in neat, neat groups, sharing a common space but without any sense of community or purpose. And we’ve all heard the stories of the people carting heavy objects around in their beady eye, or skateboarding merrily along the High Streets in giant shopping bays, oblivious to the pedestrians and trampling underfoot as the trolley car slows down.Yet somehow, this image of opulence repeated across many diverse architectural styles and formats – into which we’ve all become cogs – ultimately fails to capture the essence of the present predicament in which we find ourselves. We’ve all seen the same buildings at different times during the past forty years. Yet somehow, we don’t see the same neighbourhoods in different times. This is the second story.

The question becomes, how much of that investment is justified, and how much is usurped and wasted. The answer, as always, depends on whom you ask.Many artists I know get frustrated when people ask them to show them an architectural design they’ve done. They’re so used to it, and yet when the time comes to actually build it, they can’t seem to figure out what to do with themselves when faced with such overwhelming, minimalist and empty information. This is a common complaint, and it’s true. It’s sad, too. But there has to be something more than frustration in the way architecture is designed – there has to be a way to reconcile the massive amount of information that’s gathered about us, and delivered back to</text>
