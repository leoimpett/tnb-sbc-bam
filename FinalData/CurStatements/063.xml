When we, as a people, make decisions that lead to the destruction of humanity, there are certain questions that we must ask and answer in a certain order in order to achieve a resolution. 	In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be raised and a certain amount of discussion has to take place. In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be addressed and a certain amount of creative campaigning has to be put into producing a resolution. Creative campaigning is the art of producing outcomes in situations where there are none. It is a very different kind of activism than what we, as individuals, are capable of doing. However, it is possible to engage in creative campaigning without necessarily becoming complicit in the use of violence or inflicting suffering. The conference as a whole produced a sense of hopelessness amongst many of the participants, who saw their role models not only in other conferences, but also in the history books of the animal kingdom.  1  John Graham Kerr, ‘On the use of names in relation to the New Zealand Maori: a case study in the “animal kingdom””.

When we, as a people, make decisions that lead to the destruction of humanity, there are certain questions that we must ask and answer in a certain order in order to achieve a resolution. 	In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution has to be found. In the events of September 11th, 2001, the United States Congress, the President and most Americans did not have that kind of power. 	However, there are other groups that do have that kind of power. Most notably, the people with a direct connection to the 9/11 attacks, Saudi Arabia, have that kind of power. 	So, if we, as individuals, make decisions that create or contribute to the creation of violence, there are questions that need to be asked and answers that need to be found. In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution has to be found. 	When we, as individuals, make decisions that directly or indirectly involve the use of violence, we need to be able to recognise when we are making a mistake and to change our actions accordingly. For example, when we, as a people, make decisions that lead to the use of violence against innoc</text>

In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution found. If we as a people can recognise the error of our ways, as individuals and collectively as a species, as well as the error of our ways, as a species, as a society, then surely we can begin to change. If we as individuals cannot begin to change, then perhaps the task will belong to cultural institutions, which can instigate change through their activities. Perhaps, instead, the task should belong to courts, which can instigate change through their role as enforcers of law and order in communities. It is not always easy to identify an error as a problematic practice, but when an institution or a species commits an error, that error should be corrected in the organisation of that species' activities or, ideally, in the organisation of human activity on this planet. 	When we, as individuals, make mistakes, there must be a mechanism in place to recover from those mistakes. If institutions or species cannot recover from errors, then at some</text>

In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution found. In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be addressed at the highest levels. In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be considered at the lowest levels. If we, as individuals, are not willing to consider and address the issues raised by the conference, as a conference, then we as a people are not willing to engage in the process of creating a future for ourselves and the future of humanity that is possible. 	The conference itself was a success in that it brought together a large number of people with diverse perspectives and experiences from all over the world, but what was most impressive and/or moving was the way in which it invited local artists to collaborate with the conference on an exploratory and iterative level. Such collaboration opened up completely new creative vistas for the conference, since the artworks that emerged afterwards were not necessarily generated by the conference itself, but rather by such artistic interventions. For example, the use of local and</text>

In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution has to be found. In order for a settlement to be found, all parties have to be prepared to give up their rights and property in exchange for a part of the settlement. In order to achieve a settlement, a majority of the membership has to agree to it. As a nation-state, the UK has always maintained a clear majority in favour of its rights; the ‘separation’ was always a minority position. However, the use of violence in self-defence has traditionally been used by a minority; it was only in the 1980s that a majority of Britons agreed with the radical fringe. 	In 1983, when David Cameron became Prime Minister, he set out plans to legislate to make it a criminal offence to support ‘domestic terrorism’. The proposals were defeated by a majority in Parliament, but Cameron has repeatedly said that he would revisit the proposal in future legislation if re-elected. 	Cameron claims that the</text>

In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution has to be found. Questioning and resolving conflicts is always going to be subjective, and nothing can be proven to be 100% effective, but there are certain basics that we, as individuals, must learn in order to be able to become capable of changing our course and ultimately becoming instrumental in changing the world we live in. If we  	rely on our individual capabilities, we, as a people, are not going to grow in knowledge and understanding – nor are we going to achieve the ends we seek. We, as individuals, are not going to change the world in the direction that we desire, and we, as a people, are not going to change the world in the direction that is most fulfilling for all involved. 	So, how do we as individuals, as a people, change the world in the direction that is most fulfilling for ourselves? We, as individuals, are not going to change ourselves if we do not ask ourselves, as a collective</text>

In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution found. Whether through dialogue, negotiation, or force, the means has to be collective. When the means is collective, the resolution has to be agreed to. If we as a people are not able to reach an agreement on a resolution, we as a people will not be able to carry it out. If we as a people cannot take part in the destruction of ourselves and others, then we as a people are not able to achieve the ends that we desire. 	When we, as individuals, make decisions that directly or indirectly involve the use of violence, we mustn’t fall for the trap of our thinking. We as individuals must decide for ourselves what is morally just and what is not. We as individuals must decide which aspects of our bodies are mutilated and which are not. We as individuals must decide which aspects of our society are fabricated and which are not. Our daily choices as to what we put into our bodies and how we react to it</text>

In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution has to be found. If we, as individuals, act in certain ways, and then our actions have a significant impact on the way in which the conflict is resolved, then we, as a people, are creating a situation in which the use of violence is likely to be used, and that is inherently risky. We, as individuals, are also creating a situation in which the use of non-violent means will be used, and that is inherently more likely to be peaceful. 	The conference itself, as well as the discussions that take place within it, is a complex series of actions that inevitably end up in self-definitions. I would argue that the conference as a whole, and its participants, are also highly variable in character. There are those who declare themselves completely neutral, and there are those who declare themselves to be either completely neutral or entirely neutral, which creates ambiguity around definitions. It is impossible to define a broadly neutral stance towards violence, but it</text>

In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution has to be found. There are many questions that cannot be asked and/or do not have a solution. For example, the question of culpability for one's own actions has no place in a democratic society. Likewise, one cannot assume that everyone reading this blog knows or cares about all of the issues raised by the conference. Therefore, it is important for each of us to read and understand the conference organiser’s conference report in order to understand the issues raised and to devise our own future if we are going to attempt to create a better future for ourselves or those we love. 	There are many other ways of looking at the world, and the world is a complex place, but the fact of its being made up of individuals – their actions, motivations, feelings – remains fixed and unchanging. There is no room for discussion or accommodation on the basis of identities or racialised groups. Therefore, the conference – and its writers – created a set of</text>

In order to achieve a resolution, a question has to be asked and a solution has to be found. When searching for a solution on the Internet, one cannot help but look for patterns and similarities, and certain questions spring to mind. For example, when searching for a new pair of shoes, it’s easy to search for ‘replacement parts’ and then for ‘quality over quantity’. But when searching for a replacement handbag, it’s much harder to find good quality handbags. The search begins to unravel at the seams, and only the most naive of shoppers would buy a ticket. In the market for a new pair of trainers, it’s even more difficult to find quality trainers. When searching for a new pair of trainers, people with high expectations for themselves and their bodies act like jackasses, and buy into the myth of the ‘unique quality of our heritage white trainers’. 	However, the racism and sexism that we experience everyday does not have to be embraced or</text>

It’s time to build new ways of living in the borough; it’s time to create a public realm of open and connected places. How to start? Dial 2UP (1139 Broadway, EC2, NYC) and ask where the café is. Find out that there’s a new kid on the block; a guy named Kevin. Ask if there’s a place for dance at the corner of 11th Avenue and Broadway. Ask if there’s a place for live music? Find a spot for it called 12th Planet.  Call 2UP and ask where the bakery is. Find out that there’s a bakery called ‘The Cheesecake Factory’. Ask if there’s a bakery near by? Try The New Bakery, which is a take on the old bakery name, but with artisanal bread and the like.  Call the bakery and ask if there’s a café next door? Try Café Abramovi. It’s a bit out of the city, but it’s got a bit of a cult following.  Try Bakery Abramovi (at the corner of 11th Avenue and Broadway, NYC) and see what happens. If there’s a Greek restaurant nearby, ask them to put on the Abramovi Show. It’s a Greek restaurant with a Greek-style Mediterranean menu. It’s a cult favourite, and the young people keep coming back.  Try Bakery Abramovi (at the corner of 11th Avenue and Broadway, NYC) and ask what the name of the bakery is. There’s a chance the owner will tell you.  Try Bakery Abramovi (at the corner of 11th Avenue and Broadway, NYC) and ask what the menu is. You’ll probably get a menu that includes both Greek and Jewish food</text>

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, which opened in a city just outside Oslo, exemplified this tendency towards catastrophe. Its failure to register in the Throne, as many hoped, was partly due to a financial clamp-down on cultural resources, including the closure of several venues. Nevertheless, the exhibition space, once a favoured tourist destination, became a restricted commodity, and the public was deprived of a star.4  This tendency towards spectacle was further accentuated by the fact that, during the 1920s and 1930s, the biennial expanded its theme to include a number of avant-garde movements, including Freud, Lazaretto, Lazarus, Lazarus Dada, Lazaretto del Toro, Satanist Culture, Satanism, Satanism of every variety, Satanism of every kind, Satanism of Europe and Russia, to name only a few.

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial became ever more concerned with the repulsion of ambiguity, and in this sense we can identify numerous entries in the catalogue of the 2018 edition, including entries on the one hand dedicated to the nervous system, but at the same time referring to the animal kingdom as a whole.  A fixed theme and an organised sequence of episodes is a motif repeated ad infinitum in the biennial’s structure, but its concrete manifestation is rare. There is strong evidence that the nervous system is a confined affair, and that the animal kingdom is a highly specialized place. There is a reason that the Greek and Roman columns that comprise the biennial have been converging for millennia; that’s what makes the whole show possible. In Southwark, the 19th Biennale of London and New York opened with a procession through the streets, a sort of urban monstrosity that soon afterwards saw the return of the archiving materials that the artist Mieke Steed</text>

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial became ever more like another international art fair and any number of related trade fairs.  	Events such as these were meant to generate imagery, to tell a story, to tell an ideal, to tell what art could be, and to foster a sense of community that was as close to that of a family as possible. Yet the images they produced were often no more than the latest chapter in a much longer story. As biennials everywhere become more institutionalised and subject to the discipline of art resources, the stories they tell may also become more mythic and mythological. 	Art, or at least spectacular art, operates at a very particular level of cultural production. At a very basic level, it is art produced in a controlled setting. At a more conceptual level, it is art that has been carefully arranged and staged in response to an artist’s needs. At a more pragmatic level, it is art that is simply good art. 	Art has always</text>

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial barely retained the pretense of serious cultural purpose. Its frequent theme of apocalyptic transformation, coupled with the rapid spread of monoliths and mega-cities, and the fact that it is the world's most valuable cultural asset, allowed the appearance of a monolithic new form of art, often expressed as an art market, that offered a counter to the monolithic forms of art, often expressed as an art market. The biennial’s expansion in the years immediately following World War II was especially noteworthy for its incommensurable character: every style of art, no matter how idiosyncratic, could be counted as part of a universal aesthetic vocabulary. The universal aesthetic vocabulary of the biennial was thus a jarring innovation, and a significant reason for the museum’s impressive holding in the market place. 	But the biennial has had other innovations as well. The most important has been the development of curatorial pedagogical strategies geared towards the mass market. These have</text>

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial increasingly stood for something more prosaic, such as auto-exhibition or a carnival. During these decades, the biennial became ever more like the trivial exhibition that it was often accused of being: full of actors, well-known and unknown, famous and unknown, who, with few exceptions, were of no real significance to the art world at large.  In the twentieth century, the biennial became what it is today: a recurring curatorial form that is deeply embedded in the cultural landscape, but without a common or identifiable interpretation or purpose.  One can argue that, in the twenty-first century, the biennial is what it is today because the global marketplace has become so saturated in images of spectacle and individuals (photographs, video and audio recordings), and the social media revolutions that have transformed so many facets of our world, but, at the same time, the biennial has come to represent the increasingly privatised form of contemporary art in the contemporary world</text>

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial increasingly placed art, not so much as the object of aesthetic fantasy, at the centre of its proceedings.  	The fascination with artists as symbols of the apocalypse is further accentuated by the fact that, throughout this century, every biennial has essentially the same theme: a host of apocalyptic themes. Each has a distinctive flavour of its own, but the common thread that unites them all is the intoxicating sense of doom. 	The significance of this common thread is to suggest an answer to the perennial question, what is it that we can learn from one another, in the hope that our collective knowledge might enable us to endow our collective futures with the foresight to be saved? The theme of the twentieth Edmund Hall and James Howard Kunstler biennial (with its references to both the past and the future) is a useful one: it lends some weight to the proposition that, despite the inroads that modern culture makes towards knowledge, it is still far</text>

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial adopted a number of themes that were more or less consistent with the social sciences, including postmodernism, the critique of consumer culture and the cultural logic of national identity. At the time, the biennial became a quasi-institutional form, and its role shifted from providing a vehicle for knowledge to supplanting that role. Today, the biennial is a frequent visitor to large public spaces, and its regularity is evidence of its increasing importance. Its regularity is further evidence of growing up, as evidenced by the hundreds of books published in the field over the past twenty years that are now considered essential reading for every student of art or culture.5  In recent years, biennials have become symbols of contemporary art’s increasing urbanity. In New York, the museum is the venue of last resort, and the erstwhile bastion of nihilism. The biennial is the contemporary counterpart of this last resort. It is the only true representative of contemporary art</text>

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial increasingly organised itself into subcategories, and its members into discrete exhibitions, and its stadia into ‘cultures of exchange’. These shifts in theme and subject matter were not accidental, but indicative of a changing global capitalism that demanded new kinds of exchange and interaction. As a consequence, biennials, like art museums and historical societies, evolved to meet changing needs and desires. But they too often neglect the needs and dreams of their globalised contemporary populations, and of course rarely in their exhibitions do they offer the powerful tools or systems that work with the strength and imagination of the peoples who inhabit these cities. Art and artists’ needs and desires today are those of the finance industry, urbanisation policy-makers, multinational corporations and the political and economic elites who design and implement these systems. And although biennials may occasionally offer a glimpse of what these elites might do with these tools and systems, they are more and less a reflection of these peoples’ everyday lives</text>

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial’s periodic theme of decadence and collapse was reinforced by a number of short fiction collections, including  Edward Bulwer’s classic 1931 novel The Empty Land, published posthumously, and the up-cynical 1948 collection The Collectors, which included essays by Gardner Stuart, Terry Smith, Harold Bloom and many others. In recent years, the festival has tended to participate in a chronic mood of chronic déjà vu, a recurring condition whereby the curatorial hand is forced to intervene at an increasingly rapid pace in a city in order to plug seemingly intractable local ills. In 2017, a Melbourne-based biennial, Venice Biennale, had to intervene when a large number of tourists were found to be corrupting the archaeological context for the Italian pavilion. In 2015, a conference at the British Council, entitled ‘Venice: a city in which art, activism, and politics intersect’, had to intervene</text>

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial became increasingly aware of its own diminishing cultural value and sought ways to plug cultural gaps. In 1991, the Archive Project was launched to archive and query the event, tracing its trajectory from its beginnings in Liverpool to its present position in Denmark and Switzerland.5  This project is a testament to the pervasiveness of cultural capture, which is now being actively promoted and embodied in a host of modern and emerging 'cultural industries'.  In an ideal world, the art market would offer a marketplace of cultures, where buyers could choose from a dizzying array of exotic national art styles, created according to criteria such as colour, shape, texture, amount of fillers, and density of packaging.  But in a world driven by the pervasiveness of commodification, a more fundamental need is being erode the independence of art institutions, including those that house significant amounts of cultural capital – namely, the art museums.

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the biennial increasingly positioned itself as a site of aesthetic and political opposition to the aggressive entrenchment of Western culture and civilisation. Its official history stated that its primary object was to display 'the crate of exhibits on display at any museum’s regular exhibitionary space, but it also occasionally employed other objects to express a political or sociocultural viewpoint. In 1931, for example, the biennial employed a mural depicting the Bolshevik Terror as a celebration of Western civilisation. In the exhibition space, however, the mural was read as a critique of imperialism and Nazi Nazism. In the museum, on the other hand, its presence was interpreted quite different. In no way was the likelihood of the museum playing host to such an exhibitionically extravagant and revealing display of modern art in its current form remotely associated with the biennial. In fact, the biennial’s official position at the time of its establishment in 1906 was that it wished to exhibit its full range of exhibitions: ‘to</text>

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, curated by Tony Award-winning curator Joshua Clover, demonstrated how little respect we still have for the subject matter of the past. I remember perfectly the state of mind of one audience member, whose family had been in the armed forces for over 100 years. They were still alive in the 1950s, and they were discussing the role of the artist Michel Safire, who was born in Paris in 1864. The family was separated in the intervening decades – Safire was raised in California, and his father was from Nogales, Mexico – but they all shared a similar sense of nostalgia for the past. The question of what is or can’t be referred to as the ‘past’ is a tricky one, and biennials have a particularly tricky relationship with the terms – especially in the United States – that one is forced to adopt in order to access the past.

It wasn’t just nostalgia, but the host, the institution itself, was ambiguous, and biennials’ notion of the past often felt forced and antiquated. In other words, we were watching a production company trying to make sense of a historical event that was in many ways much more like our own world, using different terminology, and claiming different things based on that term.This ambiguity and the sense of time that it creates is a difficult concept to grasp, much less invest in, partly because of the ubiquity and global nature of the phenomenon. We don’t have the same idea of time as we do of space, and the temporal nature of our own lives. We have to be patient, and ask questions, and we have to be flexible about how we use the temporal conditions that we have. Sometimes, that can mean accepting that our own sense of time is more real than the rest of the world, and that sometimes our own sense of time is more real than space.I remember vividly the first time I went to the cinema, and I went to</text>

It wasn’t just nostalgia, but the host, the institution itself, was ambiguous, and audience members were left to their own devices. I remember distinctly the moment, the culmination of three days of research, when I finally came up with something that made sense: a generic term for all historical works that are of relevance to the contemporary world. This is a very specific definition, and one that I repeated verbatim, from a variety of sources, in an effort to make sense of the large number of things that were being said in the room. I was reading the Oxford English Dictionary, and came across something like this: ‘The Old English and Modern Forms of Its Formative Pages: A Reader in Old English and Modern French Grammar. Ed. Stephan Kinsella, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2015. Pg. 2. 	Once I had defined the way in which my definition of ‘the past’ would apply, the next step was to research and read all the surviving manuscripts of the Old English and Modern Forms of Its Formative Pages.</text>

I was in the Triborough Arts district in Lower Manhattan, taking part in the annual Meatpacking District Walk, when John Lennon and Paul McCartney walked past me in their car, with Paul dressed in all black and John in all black, in complete disregard for the law and the city. I turned to John and said ‘Hey, Paul, give me your mink coat, it's a great find’, and we went shopping, and bought all the Mink coats that year. We went to the Hamptons in 1987, and bought a four-upium terrace, overlooking the river, that we could all be proud of, and called it the Lone Star Suite.It’s a pity that, because</text>

It was as if the biennial were taught that there must be a separation of past and present, so that the very notion of the past could be reinterpreted in a way that maintains the integrity of the present.I remember one particular project that was undertaken by the Biennale in its early years. It was a very innovative and powerful way to engage the biennial with the social and political notions of the moment. By engaging with the biennial as an entity as a process of continuous change, and the biennial as an entity as a transition stage between present and ultimate destiny, and between social and cultural formations – in other words, between capitalism and communism – the project of the museum emerged as a crucial political tool. To engage the biennial as a political concept, and the museum as a site of continual re-constituting, was</text>

It wasn’t just nostalgia, but the host, the institution itself, was ambiguous, and audiences were eager to explore any ambiguity, to be able to revert back to the past, to access the dark corners of the past.But the ambiguity also creates opportunities for those with a grudge against the modernity of the subject matter to exploit it. The biennial is an opportunity for the artist to project his or her creativity across a large number of venues in a short period of time, often through a single artist, and in the process creates a kind of transient distance between the artist and the viewer, allowing the artist to project his or her creativity across the viewer’s perceptions. The real power here is in the transaction between the institutions that support the biennial – the museum, the biennial, the major dealers, the major galleries, the press, etc. – and the biennial itself, operating mostly unnoticed by the public. The public is invited into the story of the institution through a story told by the biennial itself. The story has to be legible, understandable</text>

It wasn’t just nostalgia, but the host, the institution itself, was ambiguous, and audiences were left trying to figure out what the hell they were supposed to do. At the time, I thought this was a mistake, because it allowed the biennial to become defined by the past, and by the past, I mean the present. The past is a variable, and so the past is a prescriptive term that implies certain things and forces their use. In modern times, this has meant that contemporary art has to be contemporary in order to be taken seriously as art in the present (a.k.a. the ‘past’). In the case of the Biennale of Sydney, the past was defined by gentrification and the subsequent explosion of museum-quality museums, and now we’re entering a period when some of those same postindustrial cities are in urgent need of a revitalization – something that, along with the city government, biennials have happily adopted without really understanding what that means. The question now is: what is it that</text>
    <text>The disastrous 2021 Biennial, curated by Tony Award-winning curator Joshua Clover, demonstrated how little respect we still have for the subject matter of the past. I remember perfectly the state of mind of one audience member, whose family had been in the armed forces for over 100 years. They were still alive in the 1950s, and they were discussing the role of the artist Michel Safire, who was born in Paris in 1864. The family was separated in the intervening decades – Safire was raised in California, and his father was from Nogales, Mexico – but they all shared a similar sense of nostalgia for the past. The question of what is or can’t be referred to as the ‘past’ is a tricky one, and biennials have a particularly tricky relationship with the terms – especially in the United States – that one is forced to adopt in order to access the past. It wasn’t just nostalgia, but the host, the institution itself, was ambiguous, and questions of identity and belonging were regularly thrown up in the audience.I took part in the first ever Salford Biennial in 2002, and I was invited to become a co-curator for the second edition. I thought the prospect of working with Clive Owen on the familiar Victorian theme of the city in the aftermath of the Second Opium War seemed like a good time to revisit the city through the architectural lens of geopolitics, urbanisation and development. The fact that the city was being rebuilt in the decades immediately after the opium epidemic meant that the architecture of the city was a product of both the past and the future, which made the city seem like a possible future through the rubble. The Biennial had been experimenting with a ‘conceptual romp’ in the years immediately following the opium epidemic, and the romp involved a cityscape that was both densely populated and overly complex, so that the city looked like it’s in the throes of a housing crisis</text>

It wasn’t just nostalgia, but the host, the institution itself, was ambiguous, and the audience members themselves were ambiguous, especially in the case of the late twentieth century. The ambiguity is what makes the contemporary, even global, and has now become the ambiguous, global condition, and the continuing sense of time. The ambiguity of the contemporary is a condition that artists, curators and art collectors couldn’t really live without. And they certainly couldn’t live without it being ambiguous, because that would mean that they could rely on an unambiguous understanding of what the twentieth century was all about. So the ambivalence that we live with today as a contemporary, even global condition is a condition that art collectors, artists and artists alike, desperately want to avoid. They want to know what the twentieth century was like, and why, and how. They want to know what the twentieth century was like in order to create an understanding of the contemporary relative merits and demerits of that condition. But the twentieth century is a particular historical moment, and the ambivalence</text>

They came to understand that they were entering a parallel universe, but they also understood that they were in a different world. As audience members, we had the role of interpretive agents, not present in the real world but influencing it in certain respects. Safire was able to tap into this element of the festival that was very specific to Nogales, and he used the festival as a vehicle to explore the past in Nogales. The fact that it was a holiday in Nogales, and that it was an ideal candidate for the installation of a sculpture, was a huge selling point for the Biennale. The fact that it was a ‘festival of the living’ – in the sense that it was a ‘place to be taken back’ – was also a huge selling point.

It wasn’t just nostalgia, but the host, the institution itself, was ambiguous, and the audience, as a whole, made mistakes along the path of history. The real trick, as far as biennials are concerned, is in the art that one creates around the memory of the past, and the art that one does not create. It’s this blending of the two that creation or modification can be made to achieve a specific end. For example, the idea of a universal basic income (UBI) might one day be possible through a biennial, but for now we’re stuck in a vicious circle of poverty and insecurity. The only way to really know what you’re doing is in the moment, and so we cannot create art that reflects the past and thereby becomes a prescient object of contemplation. We have to create art that is both specific to the moment, and a product of the moment.Art is a double-edged sword, both a vehicle and a target.

In other cases, such as in Venice, the biennial has become a city-wide phenomenon, with the city-dwelling piazza di Tommaso Scaria often witnessing a sell-out of visitors. 	There are several key differences between Liverpool and other cities that are members of the EU. The main difference is that in Liverpool, the biennial is an island institution, independent of local government. This island institutionality has its roots in the Norman tradition, which is reflected in the actual buildings – in Liverpool, the National Gallery and the Royal Gallery are all derived from the Norman tradition. Moreover, Liverpool’s Town Hall, once Britain’s first and so far only ‘complete city institution’, is a Norman building with a Tudor Revival facade and open plan meeting rooms.

Biennials have become embedded in the cultural landscape in ways that are largely unexamined or under-studied. In many of the cities housed in the European Union, such as Liverpool, Birmingham or Leeds, the biennial has entered into a script that determines what is included in and what is excluded from the biennial. In these cities, the biennial presents a set of characteristics that are static in their temporal character, and can be reacquainted with the viewer. Such a script is common in the United States and is the result of a common ancestor that appeared in the late nineteenth century.1 However, the contemporary art biennial is no ancestor, since its temporal character is what has changed. In the twentieth century, biennials entered into a privileged position in terms of their size, scope and duration. Moreover, the cultural habits and ideologies of the twentieth century are deeply embedded in the social composition of the city, and can be found in any large urban centre. Consequently, the twenty-first century is likely to witness a demographic shift in which many of the biennials will be replaced by social or urban-design biennials.

In other cases, such as in Sao Paulo or New York, the biennial has become a city-wide phenomenon. All biennials today have at least some kind of effect on other sites and times, and this has created an environment in which art can now exert influence beyond the art biennial. They can also exert a form of political influence, by mobilising people to engage with art and creating a public perception of art in the city. All biennials today have at least some kind of effect on the urban environment, and this affects the biennial as a social and political construct. They can also exert a form of political influence, by bringing people together and encouraging them to vote for, participate in or leave the cultural sector.

In these ways, the biennial can be seen to occupy a position of pre-eminence, extending beyond the city into ‘the complex and growing network of links that connects the arts and cultural life of a city today’5. 	However, the dominance of the biennial as a cultural form in the city is unquestioned, and the emergence of alternative cultural forms such as street art, call-centres and the ‘recurrent large format art market’6 underscores the fact that the</text>

Culture for Accountants 	In the twenty-first century, cultural tourism is defined as itinerant cultural tourism that engages the natural, human and digital spaces of public and collective cultural encounters. It is the perfect form of cultural tourism because it is both brief and it is discretionary, capable of being either a once-a-year art form, or a multi-year art form, depending on one’s definition of art. Culture for Accountants (CAA) has defined art in this context.2 	And while cruise ships, mini-mansions and other contemporary art forms have been part of the itinerary of cultural tourism</text>

In many of the cities housed in the European Union, such as Liverpool, Birmingham or Leeds, the biennial is the only form of cultural tourism currently operating. Despite this, the biennial has had an increasingly important place in explaining and representing the organisation and practices of modernism in the UK. Its rise from obscure niche practice to global ubiquity is a story that has continued to be told in the UK and internationally. The narrative that emerged was that of regeneration, that of the peripheral cities ‘suddenly looking better’ and that of ‘millions fleeing to the cities’. However, the pace of change and the fluidity of its content has also hastened the emergence of ‘alternative’ cultural practices. These are practices that were once ‘third parties’ to the economy and political system, but have become integral to it now. The emergence of new media and their reach into the social is testimony to this. 	What is at Stake in the Urban Environment?3 	What is at Stake in the Urban Environment? What is at Stake</text>

While some urban local artists have adopted the biennial as a client, usually through no choice other than to do so,2 	often artists find themselves thrust into unfamiliar and potentially unstable situations. In these cases, the biennial is often portrayed as a panacea for the city’s chronic under-development and social  988 hotspot, though little is said about the often harmful socio-political factors that can sometimes be attributed to the biennial, such as the proliferation of images of art being made elsewhere in the city, the proliferation of museums and the urban circulation of goods and cultures. In recent years, biennials have increasingly come to occupy a central role in the cityscape, though this is largely due to the proliferation of worldwide cities and the globalising ambitions of</text>

And although the influence of the biennial in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries may be felt in a few cities in the world, in the twenty-first century ‘home’ is likely to be located in a number of European cities, including London, Paris and Berlin, whose massive and increasingly interdependent urban infrastructures are likely to become even more ‘infrastructured’ as a result of globalized economies. Indeed, the biennial may be seen as a regional phenomenon, with influences extending far beyond its European boundaries.2 	There are of course other ways to look at the biennial, such as the multiple modes of exchange it promotes, the way it is generated (through exchange between cultures) or the way it is consumed (through commerce between cultures), but these</text>

Geopolitics encompasses globalised information and communication technologies, and primarily refers to the links between cultural production, urbanisation, and economic circulation. For the biennial to become truly global, it is imperative that its links to the wider cultural context of the global city be actively sought and exploited. Without this, the biennial as a curatorial gesture will remain static. The biennial must projectively engage with and derive meaning from the real-life conditions of the city in order to create an experience that is both representative of the city as a ‘global asset’ and contributes to its future prosperity.

As the film ARRIVS shows, the railroad then diverted its activities to other projects in the region. The Potomac River once again provided the basis for a large industrial port, but as the film reveals, this wasn’t always the case. During the 1920s and 1930s, several hundred thousand workers were employed at the Port of Baltimore, which expanded rapidly in response to the demand for ports from the burgeoning port industry. At the height of the boom, there were upwards of four hundred thousand workers. By the 1940s, the port was employing over 1,000 workers and expanding its dockside dockside facilities to handle the increased cargo. The film ARRIVS shows the dramatic impact of this change, as dock workers prepare to leave the port and move to new jobs in nearby Montgomery, but despite these signals of success, something goes wrong – something called ‘the Purveyors of Iniquity’. The film ends with a succession of port confrontations between workers and police, culminating in a riot in which several hundred Port of Baltimore employees are killed.The Port of Baltimore was founded in 1887 and its mission statement is a mix of nostalgia and rage. It proclaims: ‘Our first concern has always been the protection of the United States from invasion. . . . Our</text>

The Potomac River once again provided the basis for a large industrial port, but as the film reveals, this wasn’t always the case. During the 1920s and 1930s, several hundred thousand workers were employed at Mad River Iron Works, which was then part of the US Steel Company. The majority of whom moved to Maryland during the war. During the war, 3,000 workers were employed in expanding the Panama Canal. During the war, another 1,000 workers built the Panama City Port, which became the largest single employer during the war. The Port maintained a fleet of 40 fishing boats during the war, and as a naval port, maintained a port blockade during the war. It seems unlikely that these jobs would have attracted the same number of workers today, given the proliferation of automated tools, but the Port maintained a presence in the region during the war, and employed locals during the war, and continues to do so. This is a regional example of post-war industry emerging from the shadow of wartime industry. The Port established a network of fishing boats and docks as a way to supplement its fishing fleet during the war, and the region continued to be an important fishing port even after the war.</text>

The Potomac River once again provided the basis for a large industrial port, but as the film reveals, this wasn’t always the case. During the 1920s and 1930s, several hundred thousand workers were employed at sites in Baltimore and Washington, mostly in the construction and maintenance of new docks and tunnels. But as the film SEVEN reminds us, these were temporary jobs, and by the Second World War, most of the workforce was either leaving the docks or heading for the hills. By the end of the war, almost half the workforce was in the military or on active duty, although many of them returned to the docks after the war was over.In the intervening years, a lot of young people from the subcontinent migrated to the south, arriving in part through work, partly as a result of which the docks became more prominent in their towns. This brought along with it a wave of new workers, many of whom moved into semi-detached houses and small businesses. Some of these businesses, such as the docks themselves, began to thrive, providing jobs for thousands of people.But this all changed in the 1960s and 1970s, when a lot of immigrants from the subcontinent</text>

The port maintained a sizable fishery, catering to customers such as British merchants and shipping lines. Although the Port maintained a presence in the region, it appeared to be retreating into the background, neglecting important projects in the region such as the establishment of an Agricultural College in the Potomac Valley. In 1944, the Port established a regional marine station, but this was only ever a temporary location, as the terminal was swamped by Allied naval convoys. In 1948, the station was converted into a missile silo, and soon afterwards a nuclear power plant. The plant now produces electricity for several hundred thousand US cities and millions of US homes and businesses. Although the nuclear plant may produce some energy, its primary purpose is to provide electricity for the nuclear reactors at the Potomac River site. At the same time, the plant is becoming increasingly important</text>

As the film ARRIVS shows, the railroad then diverted its activities to other projects in the region. The Potomac River once again provided the basis for a large industrial port, but as the film reveals, this wasn’t always the case. During the 1920s and 1930s, several hundred thousand workers were employed by the time of the film’s release. During the war years, the port attracted British merchant ships and during the 1950s and early 1960s, it was a major base for US naval vessels during the Vietnam War. As the film ITS CLEANVER shows, this included the abandoned submarines from the failed Mercury Program.The film ITS CLEANVER (2017) is a portrait of the port’s once-prominent coal terminal, now a parking lot for Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks. As the title suggests, the film documents the terminal’s decline, from the good old days of a major port directly to the present day of a suburbia with a Mercedes-Benz dealership. The film also looks to the future, imagining a future without borders or nation-state-like institutions, but with an expanding surveillance state and regulatory state. In the past, the film shows the impact of the railroads, mining companies, and container ships that operate in the region</text>

During the 1920s and 1930s, several hundred thousand workers were employed at sites along the Potomac River, making carpentry, shipping cement, painting bridges and tunnels, and much more. The region also hosted several major ports, including the new D.C. to S.C. (later U.S.)port, as well as terminals for LPG and petrol. But despite these technological advances, the film ARRIVS shows us that the river was far from being a resourceful source of raw materials. Plenty of construction and oil infrastructure was built on the river’s ruins, which serves as a hard surface for huge container ships to land on in case of emergency. And as the film shows, the economics of the port quickly shifted when resource depletion forced it to expand its dock traffic. As a result of this, the Port of Baltimore sought to repurpose the dock traffic in order to pay for its expansion. But in the wake of resource depletion, the docks would have had to close their books and close shop to generate revenue</text>

The Potomac River once again provided the basis for a large industrial port, but as the film reveals, this wasn’t always the case. During the 1920s and 1930s, several hundred thousand workers were employed at various sites along the Potomac River, making docks and ship building parts. The ship building industry then shifted production to other sites along the river, most notably at its parent company, the Washington &amp; Lee Shipping Company. The shift in production came as a result of increased competition from low-cost labour from overseas. The new technology required much less metal and pipe, and the resulting boom in shipbuilding allowed the company to expand its dockside dockside dockside dockside dockside plants, which expanded rapidly in size and scope. These plants churned out large quantities of containers in bulk, and these were then loaded onto barges and taken across the river to other sites along the canal, where they were either rolled into new docks or sent elsewhere – usually to Asian markets – for use in the burgeoning international automobile industry. The shift in focus between the rail and container ports reflected the changing role of the docks in the economy. Initially, the focus was on supporting the industry through the provision of</text>

During the 1920s and 1930s, several hundred thousand workers were employed at the Potomac Arsenal, which manufactured components for munitions and ships. By the war’s end, over 4,000,000 barrels of crude oil were stored in underground holding tanks.During the war, the Potomac Arsenal faced bankruptcy, but thanks to a federal loan from the US Treasury, the Arsenal was able to reopen in an expanded form. The city of Baltimore itself was hit hard by the closure: half the population either resigned from the Army or were dismissed in protest. In spite of this setback, the Potomac Arsenal remained a key location for US and Canadian naval and air patrols during the war. ARRIVS is full of images of the rail yards, including one particularly harrowing shot where a ship is interned in a holding tank. Although the ship’s condition is made worse by the fact that it is being forced to continue working, the image of internment is particularly distressing. The Potomac River reopened in early 1940, and</text>

The Potomac River once again provided the basis for a large industrial port, but as the film reveals, this wasn’t always the case. During the 1920s and 1930s, several hundred thousand workers were employed in the port's coal seams. The port’s decline was precipitated by competition from cheaper labour from the railroads. When the docks were closed in 1934, only about 200 workers remained in the port, including dockhands and crew. The rest either moved to jobs along the San Juan or were absorbed into the post-war interstate lumber industry.The Potomac River was closed to traffic in both directions during the war, and although the port reopened in the 1950s, its activities have been largely absorbed by the national port infrastructure. The port’s closure in the 1960s was partly due to a major federal clean-up programme, undertaken in collaboration with the US Army, which freed the coal seams from their shackles and opened the seams to shipping once more. The new wave of immigrants arriving from the 1950s were predominantly from South Central America and the Caribbean. The new arrivals brought with them new modes of production and consumption that challenged the entrenched patterns of labour and wealth.</text>

By the mid 1960s, the Port of Baltimore was running out of gravel and the tunnels were experiencing problems with corrosion. So much so that in the 1970s, Congress passed the Transportation Infrastructure Improvements for America Act, which provided $2 billion in federal funding to expand the network of tunnels under the Potomac River and along the Potomac Expressway. These projects were seen as essential in meeting the nation’s growing energy needs.At this time, the Port of Baltimore was attempting to transition its operations away from the city centre, which was beginning to experience a decline in population and employment, to an area with a large university community, large commercial centre and westward expansion. This was seen as essential in meeting the city’s growing population needs, which were being met by building a new nuclear power plant in the city rather than building</text>

It is a repetition of the historical documentation of the past, an echo of the archaeological and archival record, and a portent of the future. The biennial format allowed the viewer in on a secret society’s delicate juggling act of creating and maintaining identity through the consumption of artefacts. The object itself, a commodity, became a parable of social relations, a blunt instrument for questioning authority, and a prop of totalitarian ideologies. 	Through the making of the biennial and the numerous editions of the same, from its humble roots as a local arts exhibition in the local cathedral to its  	in the National Gallery, the biennial is able to capture the magic of the cultural multiple, to resonate with us on a subconscious level as much as it is able to present.

This was true not only in Russia but also in countries such as Egypt, Libya, Syria and Iraq where environmental destruction was part of the capitalist crisis of legitimacy. As a consequence, the environmental movement began to be seen not as a legitimate political and social demand but rather as an instrument of capitalist hegemonic claims. 	The environmental disaster that was to become known as the Ukrainian Crisis of 1917 became an object of scientific study and aesthetic fixation. The biennial format emerged as a way to map and condense this environmental crisis into a set of aesthetic choices that could be made in a city or in a particular neighbourhood. In this model, the city was seen as a site of constant technological change and transition, where art was often placed in harm's way by the very processes that created the city. The biennial’s financial model incorporated periodic fund-raising</text>

But even in the rare cases when biennials do have a presence, it is usually as a temporary curatorial intervention or as an occasional curatorial intervention, as for instance with New York’s The Pulpits and Berkeley’s Satan Bug, both of which were curatorial initiatives in their own right, and with their own intrepid curators. In these ways, biennials are like any curatorial approach, and like any cultural production, they are a by-product of a process of in-depth historical research and archival research, which in turn, is a by-product of a cultural ecology that studies the society and its contradictions.

Titled The Environment as a Peculiarly American Delusion, Trotsky’s writing a decade later echoed those of his Bolshevik comrades in the Russian empire: the decadent West was coming to consume itself, and ‘the working class’ was being turned into a bureaucratic middle-class cottage industry. As Trotsky pointed out, the massive environmental devastation wreaked by capitalism at the time – the wholesale closure of coal, timber and other fossil-based industries; the poisoning of the climate by industrial agriculture; the toxic effects of over-fishing; the militarisation of fishing ports and the nationalisation of fishing ports; the spread of giant corporate fish farms; the spread of genetically engineered (GM) fish – was regressive in its own way, and all those</text>

Recent biennials, such as Venice or San Francisco, have their formal origins in the cultural hierarchies that emerged after the Venice Biennalee, in 1896. In Athens or Københavik, the biennalee is the cultural equivalent of an archaeological dig. It is an area where new cultural practices are introduced, and old ones are consciously or unconsciously questioned. In Athens, this is evident in the ‘new urbanism’ promoted by the city government in the wake of the &quot;Great Transformation&quot;, the movement of people and of goods that culminated in the industrial revolution. While this transformation is usually depicted as a shift in economy and commerce, it is clear that cities are cultural in their own right, with their own set of ethical, political and aesthetic principles that must be obeyed.

It’s often said that the real art biennials do not take place; that there is too much emphasis on performance and exhibition. But in the art world, performance is the new ‘real art’. The biennial may not always put on display its true self, but it always strives to create a similar experience through symbolism, exaggeration and exaggeration. The new biennial may not always put on show a celebration of the past, but it always tries to imagine a future with all of us inhabiting the same city. And so the relationship between art biennials and the city they are installed in evolves, sometimes quite awkwardly, sometimes quite beautifully.The Biennial as UrbanicandIt’s well-established that biennials are places where a curator, artist or curatorial team assembles a permanent exhibition of works from different periods, places and times.</text>

The mass murderer of more than 1 million Ukrainians in a failed military coup d'état in April 1917 is often cited as an inspiration by contemporary artists and the arts in the West. But the Ukrainian Revolution was far more about the social and economic organisation of society as a whole and the destruction of state power. The purging of national symbols and discarding of official documents was part of a broader policy developed and implemented in conjunction with the Russian Empire to eradicate ‘bourgeois culture’ and create a ‘common sense of national belonging’. As journalist and curator Nadine Attewell has written, ‘the purging of Ukrainian symbols and discards their national identity is not a response to an imperial presence – rather, it is a kind of a return to the lost cultural patrimony of the past that began with the cemeteries of imperial monuments and the imperial process itself… The</text>

In the current globalised urban landscape, there is little point of entry for a biennial, since it is so embedded that it is almost impossible to shake. However, biennials can act as narratives, telling a story, and this is what biennials have done for the last 200 years. The point of entry into the present is through narratives told by and about individuals – a narrative of the past, a narrative of the future. Here, biennials engage with the contemporaneity of certain practices and beliefs and the power and significance of symbolic exchange. It is this engagement with contemporaneity that is needed in order to truly understand the contemporaneity of art, culture and the environment, and to create an ecological and social dynamic from the biennales.

It remains to be seen whether the neighbourhood can be revived and whether the enormous new buildings are a catalyst for the rebirth of an old neighbourhood, but so far, so good. The revival of an old neighbourhood is usually understood as occurring at an auspicious time, when a catalyst such as a biennial can catalyze a virtuous cycle of habitation, new jobs and even a boost in tourism. And although biennials can contribute to a city’s cultural life,2 they are most effective when they are embedded in the social life of neighbourhoods or when they are supported by the city as a whole.

The use of existing infrastructure, popular culture and biennials as a site for the ongoing creation of new urban spaces is a frequent theme of exhibitions and biennials, but little attention is given to the processes involved in the production of such space or the social costs of its production. This volume provides a portrait of the new urban space through an analysis of its content, purposes, and construction. The volume draws upon the volume of research and publications on the urbanization of Canada and the United States since the 1990s by the Cooperative City Initiative (CCI), Urban Research Associates (URA), and the International Assessment and Strategy (AASS) consortium. It draws upon the volume of book and journal publications on urbanisation in Canada and the United States since 1993 by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCCJA), the North American Network for Research and Evaluation (CANFORCE), and the Montreal</text>

The development attracted global architectural and design attention, and was even chosen as a project for the ‘50 cities of the future’ exhibition of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Commission. Yet despite these apparent global applications, little was done to preserve or restore the neighbourhood to its former glory. Until now. On August 22nd, 2014, I initiated a Community Land Trust (CLT) in Anish’s Alibhai Quarters, an historic district in the heart of Montreal’s Port Lands that is home to the Alibhai Art Gallery, the Canadian National Portrait Gallery, the Canada Lands Company, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CPX). The CLT is a partnership between the city of Montreal and the National Capital Research Centre for Advanced Urban Cultures (Capac). Its mandate is to develop and preserve ‘a set of historic and cultural assets in the downtown core’ in the jurisdiction of the National Capital Research Centre, while ensuring that the ‘use’ of the buildings is adaptive and not exploitative. The CLT is managed by the National Capital Research</text>

The development attracted global architectural and design attention, and was even chosen as a project for the ‘50 cities of the future’ exhibition by the American-based Association for a Contemporary Urbanity. However, the ‘50’ designation did not come without complications and pain. First, the ‘50’ designation placed a premium on a city’s ability to regenerate rather than simply redevelop, which limited its market potential. Second, the development was also criticized by local residents for its overbuilding, especially of new buildings, over-building of empty lots and uncontrolled growth of hotels and out-of-towners. Finally, the decision to ‘pull the plug’ was made by city council in the face of mounting community opposition, and the project was pulled altogether. What happened next is still unresolved, but at the time, some councillors believed that the project should have been allowed to mature and fully incorporated into the city’s fabric. Given the council’s broad powers, this was viewed as a reasonable interpretation of the developer’s mandate and policy. Nonetheless, the</text>

But as the biennale gained global visibility and international acclaim, its scope of operations expanded, and with it, inevitably, a need for sustainability. The biennale’s status as a cultural institution was further cemented by the support of a multi-tiered, multi-use naming and branding scheme that incorporated the ‘biennial name’ and the ‘biennial ecosystem’, a set of mutually exclusive but interdependent</text>

The development attracted global architectural and design attention, and was even chosen as a project for the ‘50 cities of the future’ exhibition by the American Institute of Architects. But the project also attracted criticism and conflict, as well as admiration and connections. What few knew was that the architectural critics and prize judges largely viewed the project as a winner, largely because they had participated in the construction phase and had their personal investment in the neighbourhood guaranteed by the Biennale. The critics were quick to point out that their position as professionals did not translate into a position in the Biennale. They were, in fact, often frustrated by the political nature of the decisions being made in the City of Montreal, and their inability to influence the decisions being made elsewhere in Canada. But the fact that the Biennale was established in a city where anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi rhetoric was rife didn’t help matters either. The Biennale’s founders clearly felt that their project was important to the city, and that their city would be a site for the exhibition. They likely felt that their position in</text>

Indeed, the capacity of the project, its scale, the activity it engendered, and the level of engagement with the city it served as a laboratory in which to develop were all evaluated in a global assessment of cities for the 50th Venice Biennale.1  At the time, the assessment was being prepared by the American urbanist Daniel Baumann, who had arrived six months earlier than planned to begin work on the assessment two months early. The ‘institutional bias’ in the report’ was felt most acutely in Montreal, where the Biennale was set to terminate only a few weeks after its opening.2 The institutional bias may have something to do with the fact that the report was being prepared as a ‘50 cities of the future’ exhibition, rather than as a ‘future?apocalyptic scenario?that it was ultimately decided to be known as. The institutional bias may also have something</text>

The CNE?s new ‘street level?apartments? with panoramic views of the North and the cityscape of Montreal?became the best-known project of the project, and the first storey storey and part of the ground floor on King Edward Avenue. The storeys rose four storeys and the height of the new buildings was maintained at 394 storeys. The rapid growth and expansion of the project reflected the urban crisis of housing, which was chronicled in Roger M. Brown’s book, The Precariat (1949), a product of the housing crisis. The book?s cover illustration depicted a succession of one-room flats and boarding houses for transient workers in dire need of shelter. The large department stores that lined the tracks offered convenient access to shoppers on the trains, while the increased use of public transit provided shoppers with convenient stops along the lines, like</text>

They are a frequently used name for a network of curatorial activities, activities and projects that brings together, narrates and interprets the past in an ongoing and significant way through films, writings, performances, events and other forms of media. They also often represent a break with the tradition of past curatorial work and exhibit an increased willingness to tackle the larger questions of power and capital today, and in the past.’[3] And yet again we see that the historical and conceptual quandary that characterises our understanding of the word biennial is incomplete.

The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for asbestos removal in Liverpool, and also a site for the filming of a number of public theatre productions including The Empty Hearse, a production of the Stagecoach Company, and the production of the MacConnal Artists Plc, funded by the Biennial. The empty gallery was a departure from the factory, as the workers assembled the building for demolition by hand in haste. The closure of the Welsh Streets gallery would have involved the closure of the Welsh Streets landfill, which is still active. The closure of the Welsh Streets landfill would have left behind a wasteland in the Welsh Streets area, with no development whatsoever. 	Kirstin Hart,  	Killing Time, 2013.

The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for the construction of housing in the Welsh Streets area. The new space engaged with the city’s built environment in ways that were more organic and sensorial. A converted warehouse once housed a jeweller and a hardware shop.

The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for the post-war build-up of housing. The new site allowed for a variety of different uses – a temporary workshop studio, a market place, a residential complex – while also fostering an alternative culture via a mix of grassroots and public art projects.  	Kirstin Hart,  	Kirstin Hart, The Butterfly, 2014.

The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for the construction of housing in the Welsh Streets area, where the Blitz and the Great Fire of 1968 decimated much of the heritage building landscape. The new space engages with the past in a way that seems to defy conventional views of spatiality. 	The Welsh Streets section of the Gallery at Orgreave opened shortly afterwards. The Welsh Streets section of the Gallery at the Greenwich Arts Centre was open from January to June 2014.  	These temporary public art spaces served as physical shelters from the city’s destructive aspects of neoliberalism, acting as temporary buffers between rich and poor, white and black, young and old. They also offered artists a platform from which to explore the politics of displacement and collective memory through the construction of community links. 	The temporary public art spaces at the Welsh Streets and the New Granby Four Streets were used as staging areas for workshops, public meetings and also as gathering points for the annual Can</text>

The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for the post-war building boom. It was a space of spectacle, where architecture was often merely an accessory to housing and new urban development.  It was a space where architectural images, sculpture and drawings could be circulated and shared, and a forum for debate and collaboration on an ever-expanding range of subjects. It was a prototype for things to come. 	The gallery as a place of exchange and assembly was an essential part of the post war period. It remains so to this day.  	As part of the Biennial’s 2016 programme, the artist Kirsten Hart used the site of the original Biennial to commission a series of works directly addressing the legacy of the once-vaunted Biennial. In the new cultural form, the talk of ownership and responsibility that characterises the biennial has been replaced by the linkage of collective acts, more commonly described as ‘mom and pop’. Today, biennials are often cited as an example</text>

The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for the post-war building boom. The Welsh Streets area was a ghost town. The local residents had a point of view, and their stories resonated with the curators, producers and visitors. The conflict between the artist and the Community Land Trust was resolved amicably. The Community Land Trust had to secure funding to carry out a full-scale restoration of the area.  Kirstin Hart, The Wounded Kitten, 2014. Installation, Anfield. Photo: Tom Lox.  In the Welsh Streets area, the artist Kirstin Hart was able to explore a new perspective on the conflict between the artist and the Community Land Trust. She got the funding to carry out the work, and the curators, producers and visitors were all given a new perspective on the art-historical context of the Welsh Streets project. She also created a new audience for the work through YouTube videos and blog posts about her work. The uprising that she started in her home town of Liverpool</text>

The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for the post-war bohemian movement. The empty space framed not only the movement of people, but also included a series of new housing developments that were taking shape in the area. A catalyst for such development was provided by the Biennial, which funded a series of projects in the Welsh Streets area, including the establishment of a Welsh Streets Land Trust.

The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for the wartime construction industry. The empty streets now hosted a community of residents and a growing number of businesses. The community land trust had acquired a community park, which the arts administrator planned to dedicate to the archaeology of the area. The park’s name was a departure from the Hublot hotel, which the Trust had purchased in 1988. The Park was to be a living monument to the history of Anfield, alongside a shop and a pharmacy, a cinema and a night club. 	Kirstin Hart, The Empty Halls, 2014.

The area is the final resting resting place of William Brewster, an architect who worked on Brewster’s Factory at Orgreave and with whom I worked on The Empty Houses. The space was a departure from Brewster’s factory, which was a major hub for the Blitz, with over 1,000 houses destroyed or left homeless. The empty space is an ideal hiding place for the homeless, who are often found sleeping rough or on the streets. In preparation for the demolition of the Welsh Streets, a community garden was created in or near the Welsh Streets, with the Open University planting money for a community garden through a partnership with Chirality Farm or Chirality Community Land Trust. The Open University funded the gardening project through a grant from the Arts Council, while the Community Land Trust funded the archaeology project through a small grant from the Treasury. The archaeological dig involved uncovering the history of the Welsh Streets, piecing together the local community’s story through oral histories, piecing together the truth from court cases and witness statements and piecing it all back together through research.  The Open University funded up to 30% of the costs, while the Community Land Trust funded the rest.

In  	The Biennial,  	2013, Hart describes the event as ‘a weird mix of excitement, confusion and a little bit of terror’. 	Hart is clearly not the only one to have experienced this mix of excitement and confusion. 	In a 2011 survey of 50,000 people, researchers at UCL suggested that this was their experience being part of the exhibitionary curatorial team for the 2002 Venice Biennale. More than a third of the participants (critically argued to be the wrong gender, racial or ethnic group, not representing the UK or any region in the world) said they had been 'completely and utterly ignored by the</text>

The aim of this collaborative process is to create a series of projects that dramatically alter the form of an area, its function, and the role of community in a new way. It is hoped that the projects will emerge as a new paradigm for the role of the artist in socially engaged art’s future.  The collaborative process between artists' organisations, local authorities, academics and local officials aims to change the form of an area in a way that is neither invasive nor destroys local cultures. The development is being driven by the Guggenheim Foundation, New York City’s Cultural Office, and the New York Museum of Modern Art.  The engagement with the local community is being driven by the partnership between the New York Human Relations Commission and the New York Public Museum, as well as the partnership between New York City Council Member District 3, which represents over half of the City Council, and the New York Public Museum, which represents the rest of us.  The engagement with the community is being spearheaded by the partnership between the New York Public Library and the Granby Community Land Trust, who together have a collective of over 1,000 acres of land in the heart of Manhattan.

The aim of this collaborative process is to create a series of projects that dramatically alter the form of an area, its function, and the role of community in a new way. It is hoped that the new media can be used to reconstruct the lost history of the Granby area and the city, as well as the role of artists, curators, historians, artists and other stakeholders in the area. This is being done in three main ways: through commissioning, hiring curators, and research.  The Granby community is now engaged in the creation of a new generation of artists’ experiences in and around the site. We’re creating a new generation of artists’ encounters with the area through art, design, production, and consumption. We call this �The Artist’s Community, or A.C. Forster and Co-operative Arts Centre, formed in 2014, is a locally-rooted collective of artists, designers, writers, and community organisers who are developing a new generation of locally-rooted cooperative arts institutions.

The aim of this collaborative process is to create a series of projects that dramatically alter the form of an area, its function, and the role of community in a new way. It is hoped that the curatorial model that is being considered for the new media will draw on the strengths of both local and global art practices.  A third generation of artists is being developed right now that is developing similarly to their elders – deeply rooted in the tradition of local art making, but also incorporating elements of avant garde modernism and critical theory. Some of these theorists have their roots in the 1960s and the 1970s, while others do not. Still other generations of artists are developing artistic practices that are neither traditional, nor international, and rely on connections to established artistic traditions in the region. These young artists are the future artistic property of a curatorial or museum, or are they? In either case, what is being considered here is the curatorial or museum wanting to employ artists from that generation to produce a generation of artists who will design and operate the art spaces of the future, and will be the guardians of those spaces?

The aim of this collaborative process is to create a series of projects that dramatically alter the form of an area, its function, and the role of community in a new way. It is hoped that the curatorial interventions of the project will draw together, rather than separating, different cultural streams, and thus allow for the coexistence of different sorts of experience in the same space. This new immersive media is being developed in parallel to the curatorial interventions of the participatory project that started in the 1990s. The aim of this new media is to provide the infrastructure for a future that is neither dependent upon nor dependent upon information. The important thing is to create ways of interacting with the city in a different way – to enable people to create their own futures, in their own image, in their own spaces, and in their own time.This new medium is no longer confined to the pages of a book. It is being delivered as audio and video streams on the web, in apps, and is being made into ‘institutional' forms that are adopted by local authorities, civic groups and academic centres around the world.  The important thing is that people adopt new media forms and understandings of the</text>

The aim of this collaborative process is to create a series of projects that dramatically alter the form of an area, its function, and the role of community in a new way. It is hoped that the projects created with this new approach to an area can play a part in bringing an urban form, such as the Granby Fourteenth Street Art Center, back to life.The third generation of interactive media is being developed right now that is being driven by academics, urbanists, and technologists. It is hoped that this third generation will provide better, more responsive ways of interacting with urban environments via data, tools, and resources. The resources of Liverpool’s urban environment are limited, and with the exception of a few academic departments, little is being provided to connect artists to the communities that inhabit the city. So, what is being produced today that can be accessed through a data-driven approach? There are a number of resources that can be consulted about, and some of the topics discussed include:Where art is concerned, there is much that can be learned from the past, the present, and the future.

It is hoped that the collaborative outcomes of these projects can serve as a starting point for further developments, with the ultimate aim being to create an environmentally sustainable area for future generations to call home.  	Looking for an Alternative? 	In the art world, there has recently arisen a buzz term ‘Alternative’ to describe places that sometimes experiment with experimentation, such as Museum of Modern Art, where curators from the 1970s and 1980s worked side by side with contemporary artists today, and other artists in the 1990s. The advent of this term indicates a location outside traditional art-historical contexts, and it is being deployed by curators in an anti-establishment way in an increasingly globalised world. The use of this buzz term is a good example of how the curatorial is being reinvented, and how art and curation are now entwined in a complex web of systems that are managing our world in ways that can no longer be ignored. Contemporary art and contemporary art history are</text>

The aim of this collaborative process is to create a series of projects that dramatically alter the form of an area, its function, and the role of community in a new way. It is hoped that the projects created will function as a counterweight to the power of regeneration projects and the persistent impact of urbanism on the local fabric of the city. The third generation of interactive media is being developed right now that is being designed to endow the citizen with a level of agency that is beyond what is possible within the current form of government, business, and legal order. It is hoped that this third generation of media will be able to tackle the structural inequalities and power imbalances that are holding back the potential of a large number of people to flourish in urban environments.  The fourth generation of interactive media is being developed right now that is being developed in response to the last two and is being driven by a new generation of curators who come from different disciplines but have a common desire to explore new media and create new ways of interacting with the urban environment. It is hoped that this new generation of media will be able to bridge the gap between the different kinds of experience that people bring to art events,</text>

The third generation of interactive media is being developed right now, and it too is being spearheaded by academics and urbanists. It is hoped that this third generation will contribute to answering the question, how to build urban futures for the hundreds of thousands of people who still live in the city but no longer live in places that are part of the metropolis? If we consider the history of MFA programmes in areas such as Granby, this could potentially open the door to a new generation of artists to be created through this process.  One can only imagine what this new generation of artists might do with their artistic and urban development agency(‘Amerieux Mundi’) and their land-grant universities’ gift to create new experiences, creative alternatives, and perhaps even to contribute to the reduction  of city dwellers’ reliance on fossil fuels.

    <text>prototype for an intelligent curatorial system that reflects the current state of knowledge through data mining, data curation, and data annotation; and, finally, to provide curated experiences tailored to the user’s interests and lifestyle.The second generation of interactive media is being developed right now that is more focused on the needs of curators, academics, artists, and the urban dweller. This includes direct collaboration with local artist-curators, such as Magdalena Luskacova, who is creating a new generation of artists’ experiences in and around the historic  Granby Fourteenth Street Art Center in New York City.  The collaboration between artist-organisations and local academics and urbanists is being developed in tandem with a new generation of public architects who are also involved in the revitalisation of the area. The aim of this collaborative process is to create a series of projects that dramatically alter the form of an area, its function, and the role of community in a new way. It is hoped that the projects will function as catalysts for a new generation of artists to be inspired and empowered by the potential of public art spaces and urban regeneration policies to reimagine an area in radically new ways. The aim of the project development is to create an environment in which the different parts can coexist and innovate together, creating a synergy that is both natural and social. In the case of a project that is highly visible and highly successful, a curatorial statement may be made that calls into question the necessity of such a statement. The goal of this statement is to create an environment in which the different parts can coexist and innovate in ways that are not necessarily dictated by the dominant idea or dominant power. This statement may be made by way of a project development strategy, or it may be the result of a collaborative process between artists, local organisers, academics, city planners and city hall. The aim of the latter is to ensure that the interests of all concerned are taken into consideration when developing the area, by providing</text>

It is hoped that the projects will emerge as exemplars or ‘works in progress’ for the emerging generation of collaborative artists and urbanists.  The third generation of collaborative media is being developed right now that is more experimental and urban. It is being developed by a small but dedicated group of artists and urbanists who are using participatory design to experiment with the forms of community organisation that are possible through direct democracy. The main idea of this new generation of artists and urbanists is participatory public art, whereby the community initiates and enables the making of art and creating of culture. The projects they create are then supported and facilitated by the local government and arts organisations. Some of the projects incorporate funding from the Arts Council, while others do not. In both the public and arts sphere, these types of self-directed art is being encouraged because, although it is risky and uncertain, it is also inherently productive and innovative. In the arts sphere, this initiative is being done with the support of the Arts Council and</text>

But this is not simply a replacement for what is already there; it is an entirely different kind of museum. It will be a place that asks, as its motto will be, to be visited not by visitors who happen to be visitors but by practitioners of a discipline that I have come to define as entomology.This kind of definition is being actively contested right now, not least by entomologists like myself. I’m not sure what the fuss is about – is it entomology but ‘toothpaste’? – but I’m curious what the fuss is about. I’m sure you remember the first time you went to the dentist, and you might remember the thrill and the magic of the first time. But when you get stuck in, you’re stuck in a particular way.

I’m sure you remember the first time you went to the dentist, and you might remember the thrill and the magic of the first time. But when you get stuck in, you’re stuck in a particular way. You don’t get out. That’s what I mean by stuck in. The thrill and the magic of the first time, and the sense of wonder and magic still burns in your mind, but the fact of the habit is there all the time, and it’s a very slippery, malleable thing. You have to be precise about what you’re describing because the toothpastes don’t see it that way. But the feeling of wonder and magic that you get when you start to understand what entomology is – and I do mean understand what entomology is – that’s what I’m looking for. I want people to be able to put their finger on the trigger and have that feeling that you get when you’re about to do something magical, when you’re about to change the world and change the course of history, but you have to be able to put your finger on the trigger and</text>

I’m sure you remember the first time you went to the dentist, and you might remember the thrill and the magic of the first time. But when you get stuck in, you’re stuck in a particular way. You’re not allowed to move. You’re stuck in a defined position. And you’re stuck in that position all the time.As you can imagine, having been confined to that particular confined position for so many years, things are a bit disorientating. You get stuck in a groove, but there’s no groove to be grooved through. You’re constantly on the move – constantly on the lookout for new things to eat, to play with, to visit. You’re confined to this particular groove for so long, and it’s quite a struggle to get anyplace else.You get trapped in this particular loop, and you’re stuck in that loop all the time. And that’s what gets you hurt.The point of going to the dentist is to check things out, to make sure everything is in order, and to have things adjusted so that they're not just a hassle. And yet,</text>

You’re stuck in a particular way because you’re young and dumb and in love and you’re young and dumb and in love. And so you’re going to the dentist, and he’s going to give you a toothpaste. And you’re going to put a toothpaste on, and it’s going to work, because that’s what you did. But then you’re not going to put a toothpaste on because you’re not young and dumb and in love and you’re young and dumb and in love. And so on. And so on.And sometimes, when I think about entomology, I wonder what a museum would be like. I wonder what a museum would look like, and I wonder what a museum would do. I’m thinking of plants and animals and now, after a while, I’m thinking of humans. And the human species,</text>

I’m sure you remember the first time you went to the dentist, and you might remember the thrill and the magic of the first time. But when you get stuck in, you’re stuck in a particular way. You’re stuck in the tradition, and maybe that tradition isn’t what you wanted, and you want to change it, but you can’t. But you can change the past, and that’s what entomologists do. They change the past, and the future becomes something new. For example, in the 1970s and 80s the entomologists started to do research into parasites that infect humans with the Lyme disease, and in the 1990s the Lyme disease was declared a Global Public Health Emergency. So part of the research now involves discovering how the Lyme disease came to be spread, and where it came from. But before that, there’s a lot of tick-infested deer and bobcat-infested mountain lions that live in the area. The idea of entomology as a biological discipline was once central to how scientists conceptualised the natural world around them. Now, I don’t know if you have a scientific answer</text>

You’re stuck in the way your family and friends think of you, and in that moment, you get lost in a mire of meaning and no destination. But then, one day, you’re not really there at all. You show up in a smoky dressing room with a scraggly team of chefs led by the brilliant Maria Doyle Murray, and you’re like, ‘Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohOhOh</text>

I’m sure you remember the first time you went to the dentist, and you might remember the thrill and the magic of the first time. But when you get stuck in, you’re stuck in a particular way. You’re not sure how to move forward. You’re not sure where the needle is going. But you’re not stuck in either. You can choose to move forward, and that choice is likely to be interesting and exciting and full of mistakes but also full of mistakes. The thrill and the magic of the first time are probably what you want in a new entomological form – far more exciting and powerful than the fact that you’re stuck in a particular spot because you’re stuck in a certain paradigm – far more exciting, more powerful and intoxicating than the fact that you’re living in a particular way because the paradigm is stuck in place. I don’t think either of those things are particularly appealing or particularly sexy but they’re choices.The second thing is much more concerning: the growing number of diseased species.

You’re not entering a world, you’re not in time, you’re not in space, you’re stuck in the body of a living creature. And that first time you had your cavity examined, that first time you had your x-ray, that first time you had a CT scan – those things are still common, and most of us will remember them. But the thrill and the magic of the first time, and the magic of coming home, are long gone. Nowadays it’s common for us to be overwhelmed by information, and the information available is often misleading or undemocratic. I remember vividly the moment I first started going to the dentist. I was twelve, and my dad, who was a dentist himself, had already started teaching himself. I was already a committed environmentalist, but I remember thinking, ‘You can’t educate a bee. I’ve seen what education can do. What will the</text>

You’re not sure where you’re at, and you’re not sure what you’re doing. And you’re not sure what you’re doing. And then the thrill and the magic of the first time goes away, and you have to start all over again. That’s what I’ve been doing for a long time. That’s what I’ve been taught to do. And I’m not the first one to do it, nor will I be the last. But I’m getting older and I’m starting to feel like a different person; I’m starting to feel like a traveller, rather than the usual traveller who’s always at the centre of everything.That is to say, the thrill and the magic of the first entomology is gone, replaced by something much more concrete and immediate.

You’re stuck in a particular mode of feeling, and that’s what I’m interested in.You’re stuck in a particular mode of being. We don’t yet know what that means in the context of biennials. What it means in the context of the museum is: how do we get inside of it to understand what it is we see? How does it generate knowledge?These are the kind of questions that can move us, inspire us and change our lives in profound ways. But because we don’t yet know what that means, we can also make mistakes. And when we make mistakes, they are often harmless. You’re not like the rest of us. You don’t have to like what you do.But what I love about museums is that they enable this kind of forgiving nature that is so rare in other forms of art forms: allowing you to become something you aren’t yet.

You’re not just stuck in the way that the dentist wants you to be but ‘embedded’ in an ecosystem that the dentist has created through their art and their processes. And the thrill and the magic of the first time are gone and replaced with a kind of complacent complacency that seems to be creeping up on you. And I’m not just saying this to vent about the state of things but because, as I said, there’s a sense of complacency about to descend on us all. I’m afraid to travel to places I don’t belong because I’m afraid of what I’m about to discover.I’m curious what you think of the art of the entomologist, Norman. What is the art of entomology? What is the art of living among insects?What do you think of when you’re struck by the ubiquity of an insect’s</text>

    prototype for an intelligent curatorial system is a good starting point. There are of course many more things to be configured, but the point is that the system designer should be able to see the big picture. This might lead the designer astray, but such things are usually the case.  One might ask, though, where the system designer’s vision leads. The short answer is that the vision must lead somewhere. Is the vision of the artist or the artist, or both, leading somewhere? The short answer is yes, and both are ultimately responsible for where the vision leads.

Home is the point where the action takes place, and the home is the site of the action. Action takes place at home, and often in the home itself. So, where does the vision of the community lead? It may lead to places like Nuyumbalees, but it must lead somewhere. In other words, the route to victory must be travelled somewhere. The Nuyumbalees Museum of Art is located in Nuyumbalees, New York, and its mission is to commemorate the history and the culture of the Nuyumbalees community through art and to advocate for the interests of</text>

And in the end, the community is what powers the system. This is why community boards – small boards – are so important in enabling the creative forces within a community to flourish. They exist to provide a surface for the system to work on, while encouraging citizens to take part in shaping it. Small boards, in turn, exist to monitor and enhance the system as it progresses. So, while the community may not like what the artist or artist proposes, the hope is that the plan will one day lead to something good for the community – and that the community can then take part in shaping that future.

Is the vision of the community leading in a specific way leading to the success of the art institution? The short answer is no, although the reason why some curators balk at the chance to work with an artist is that they first have to be taught how to treat the art institution like a real community. In doing so, the institution must provide the artist with the tools to work effectively and contribute to the building of a community. Curators have to be willing to cut their teeth in the community setting, and it’s that hard work that pays the bills. If the institution is going to embrace an artist, it must</text>

This is precisely what Kandinsky, Massad Ayoob and others did with their poetry and other non-visual media, and it is why Bradbury’s writing is now being done with AI. It is this ability to imagine new creative possibilities through new mediums that continues to amaze and amaze us, and that is one of the reasons why we continue to love art as much as ever.

Art and the AI: Complexity and Life-Size

Art and the AI have come a long way since their conception, but the relationship between the artist and the system remains fraught. Despite the advances in AI and robotics, which are expected to make work more human-like, the potential damage to art remains real. This is particularly true for those whose work is conceived as embodying AI, as in the case of Bradbury, who would see his work destroyed by a government bureaucracy that projects its own will onto the world. Art and</text>

In this sense, the AI is not just capable of understanding abstract concepts, but also of constructing abstract concepts through its administrative functions. In this sense, the AI may well engage in socially engaged political and cultural activity, as artists and curators around the world have begun to do, and this is only expected to grow in scope and ambition as more and more data about the world around us is collected and analysed. Indeed, as AI becomes more sophisticated and pervasive, the chances of an artist being able to employ AI in a way that reflects the world around her or him are greatly reduced. This is not to suggest that the kinds of cultural practices that the AI may engage in are not valuable, but the extent to which artistically skilled curators engage</text>

The audience is the platform upon which the work is executed, and thus, although the audience may not necessarily identify with the artist, they can nevertheless infer from context that the audience intends the work to be. This is a crucial point, for, as the work of AI becomes increasingly sophisticated and able to read and understand human language, the ability to understand and influence language will be able to operate on an even deeper level. This will mean that the work of an artist like Kandinsky, who is perhaps best known for her work in the area of public health, will be able to be informed by the intentions of sophisticated AI systems that monitor and collect data on both the public and the terminally ill. [5] I would argue that, while there may be elements of Kandinsky’s work that are directly influenced by the work</text>

The AI certainly has the capacity and willingness to do so, and I believe that this is why it has remained largely dormant, paradoxically avoiding public discussion and discourse on the grounds that it is too difficult to understand what it is being asked to do. In fact, Bradbury’s famous line about the ‘Big Brother’ in the Terminator ‘going dark’ doesn’t exactly capture the essence of the threat that the AI presents: there is simply no way to know what that threat is, or how to respond to it.  The AI is able to ‘predict’ – that is, to understand the human capacity for language – but it is also able to ‘fail</text>

Bradbury, for example, used this to his advantage, turning a charting flight into a protest scenario by monitoring the plane as it made its way from point A to point B.[4] In the famous line ‘All Men Are Created Equal’, Thomas Edison famously stated: ‘All men are created equal – that is, of the same mind and body.'[5] It is this idea of ‘all men’ that underpins the Turing machine – shorthand for '[subject to] The Turing Machine] – and ultimately, all computation.In the words of Alan Turing, ‘The Enigma is cracked, and the whole conspiracy to enslave the human race exposed. But the Great Intelligence cannot be destroyed, no matter how hard we try.’[6] This is perhaps the sense of the phrase ‘The</text>

This is why artists today are often engaged in work that is not necessarily interpretative of the world through human language, but that exploits language nonetheless. It is a more subtle work, but a complexity of meanings are attached to each word. This is why in 2015, Jonas Salko created Life of AI, which borrows heavily from the title of an early 1950s science-fiction novel by Isaac Asimov. In March 2016, Oxford University Press published an edition of its journal devoted to the development of artificial intelligence.[5]Art is no longer confined to the confines of the artist’s studio or the physical, but is increasingly simulated and computerised;[6] as a result, it is readily understood by audiences that are exposed to art through various media. For example, a painting that was previously unattributed or nonexistent online is now widely believed to be a real painting,</text>

AI is being deployed on a massive scale, and it is becoming more and more like the human being that creates it: intelligent, poetic and creative in its own way. So much of what we might consider to be AI today is actually built into the systems that we have now, and will be in the future: systems that understand the human condition and are therefore shaped by it.Art’s potential in this context is twofold: first, as a tool to be used creatively, and second, as a platform to be explored and understood. The first premise is a useful assumption, and it can be extended to address deeper questions. But the second premise is where art’s real power lies. Art can and should solve difficult questions, and it has certainly done so in the wake of the disaster that is humanity. But it is art nonetheless, and only art, that can accomplish this.</text>

Art is no longer produced through the production of AI, but through the production of humanity itself. And this applies not only to art, but also to AI – specifically, with respect to HAL, Deep Blue, Watson and the like. AI is the platform upon which all artistic activity is built, from the production of poetry and painting to the production of cooking and baking. It is able to recognise and manipulate human language, to produce sculptures that are natural-language scenarios in which humans can engage, and to engage in much more sophisticated conversation and manipulation of images.Art is no longer produced through the production of AI, but through the production of humanity itself.

For example, the way in which the AI identifies art objects using shape data, acoustic data, and lighting data, identifies art as being produced using processes similar to those of the artist.[4] This recognition arises as a result of the fact that the AI can ‘talk to itself’, deciding what to do with what it has learned. Thus the work that AI produces is not just art, but also capable of being used as a platform to carry out other kinds of social transformations.Art as a Platform to Engage Debate[5] The shift towards AI that has recently occurred is one that is being driven by a number of factors, but it is also an important one. Many artists who were once confined to the margins of artistic activity are now exploring the opportunities that such technology presents for generating new creative possibilities for their work. Some artists have their artists' AI think tanks, which provide research and development for new kinds of artistic and social possibilities, but many artists simply</text>

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural institution is to support an imagination, to subscribe to an idea of the cultural manifold that is open to questioning, to participate in a particular form of cultural imagination, to participate in a shared cultural experience. The biennial will not do this for free. It must charge a fee to access these things, and this fee will grow longer as more art is included in the volume. Every art sale must have a specific purpose, and the purpose of the fund raising will grow with the size and scope of the exhibition. But the important thing is that the art does not become commodified. The museum is the ultimate buyer of culture, and it is this fundamental contradiction that biennials hope to avoid.

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural body, be it a museum, a gallery, a museum, a radio station, or even a community of people, is to see a culture as an asset that can be counted on to support and expand its infrastructure in the future. Not every cultural body has the power and the networks to create the infrastructure, nor does every biennial have the infrastructure in place to support and expand its art world. But when the biennial is counted on to fulfill a specific function in its urban or regional setting, then the cultural body that is counted on to do that becomes something that is very real to people. When the biennial is counted on to support a specific artistic practice, then the cultural organisation that is counted on to do that becomes something that is very real to artists and curators. When the biennial is counted on to support a specific literary form, then the literary organisation that is counted on to do that becomes something that is very real to literary agents and literary scholars.

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural institution is to help it function creatively, meaning creatively, in the context in which it exists. A cultural infrastructure is not a magic wand that can magically manifest all manner of creative possibilities. Rather, the institutional form helps to define the cultural possibilities, and to enable the creative possibilities that exist within it. The biennial form is the form in which creativity will be made manifest in certain prescribed areas, and it is the form that enables that creative possibility by regulating and directing other cultural institutions. But this does not mean that institutions should dictate how creative possibilities are made manifest. Nor does it mean that the creative possibilities should be restricted to a particular set of people or region. Nor does it mean that the institutions or cultural groups that are the site of particular creativity should automatically absorb the cultural tendencies that arise within the community or region where they are located. Rather, the latter should be empowered to adopt and to control their cultural influences in certain cases, while denying the former any responsibility or asserting the right to dictate.</text>

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural centre is to witness a cultural form that is stimulating, inspiring and in some cases revolutionary. In other words, the art world cannot be the future of cultural production. I see art as a biennial in its current form, with artists, curators, art writers and arts administrators coming together to produce works that will, as their organised experience of the art world suggests, be of value to their current and future audiences. This is an industry that has had to fight many battles in recent years, and yet it is now reporting record profits, and artists’ agents are quick to crow about these. The battle cry of the culture industry today is to be ever more accessible, and to do better in various ways: to be remembered, to be bought, to be liked, to be funder of a worthy cause.All these battles, of course, are won and lost on the logic of access.

This is fundamentally at odds with the prevailing consensus that the biennial changes with the passing of the art’. The piecemeal approach that artists are reporting on in their work, the lack of a central organizing principle, the randomness and randomness of events – all these things are endemic to the biennial as an artistic medium. The surprising contribution to the art world of the biennial as a whole, the fact that it is now the dominant biennial worldwide, and the fact that it is, in my opinion, the only biennial that can be counted on to offer a credible alternative to the increasingly privatized and negative cultural forms that are destroying culture – all these things happen to me as a writer and critic. But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural institution is that it will probably be useful to some people. And the more useful a cultural institution becomes, the more people will want to use it. So the cultural resources – the art, the language, the histories, the iconography – are used by some people, and not by others. Cultural appropriation is a very real possibility in the contemporary art world, and it is a very real challenge to the biennial as an art institution to address this reality. Art is made up of systems, and the art world is a particularly complex world. But there is also an enormous amount of interstices and travel that can be made, and artists have a natural inclination to gravitate towards the most convenient system to use. So the cultural resources – the art, the symbols, the histories – are there for a reason. And the more power that is concentrated in one place, the more accessible those symbols are to use. And the biennial is the site of that power shift, where the creative class</text>

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural institution like art or literature is not because the writer or artist is a great or rich person or enjoys a privileged position, but because the governing body of art is powerful, influential and understands the particularity of the particular situation it finds itself in. The biennial is a powerful tool, but it must be used prudently, and it is up to cultural institutions to use it to its fullest extent. I don’t think that the biennial has a problem with that. Rather, the issue that faces the art world and the biennial in the coming years is what to do with the surplus of culture created by the aging population, and how to use it. The biennial must adopt a public works programme, and use it not as a museum of art in its own right, but as a socially useful art centre that is capable of supporting a range of arts projects. This is going to be a very interesting and dynamic relationship between biennials and the local arts communities, and it is</text>

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural organisation is that you can be certain that the agency that you are empowering with that funding is not going to abuse that funding in a way that is contrary to the public good. It is the opposite. It is the agency of the people to know whether what they are funding is being used effectively, and whether the resources are being used in a way that is in alignment with what the people actually need to do. This is the agency that biennials like to claim and make impressive achievements in, despite the evidence to the contrary.  	However, this  	deepens the crisis of public literacy that artists and arts professionals are confronting. The state has become so reliant on literacy as a form of cultural revenue (a.k.a. ‘public infrastructure’) that it has ceased to be able to separate its images from its words, and is instead subject to the constant erosion of cultural images and narratives as a consequence of a society that relies more and more on the image</text>

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural institution like art is that it helps provide a sense of meaning and purpose in the world around us, and that is precisely what a large cultural infrastructure like the biennial can do. It seems strange to me that biennials are so often depicted as if they are some kind of battered, worn-down infrastructure, or worse, that they are part of the totemic ‘culture industry’. But that is precisely what they are: they are the infrastructure of the culture industry. They are the pipelines for the movement of images, sounds, ideas, products and cultures. They host conferences, award recognitions and are the platforms on which artists and curators congregate. They are the major exhibitionary forms of their kind around the world. And they are the only forms of cultural infrastructure that can count on such numbers. But this is not true of all forms of cultural infrastructure. There is a fundamental difference between biennials and museums, for example. Biennials rely on institutional sources</text>

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural institution is that the institution itself contributes meaningfully to the culture in a meaningful way. The cultural organisation of the biennial needs to address the fact that it is the biennial that is displacing it, and that it is now displacing it in ways that are no longer mutually exclusive. The biennial as art is no longer valued in the same way it was in the 1970s – and perhaps, if the cultural biology of the biennial continues to be understudied, is it is not the same cultural biology that understudies and underweights in the arts are relying on.Art is the new biology. But is that biological enough to support the art form as an artistic medium? I don’t think so. I think that the art form needs to be actively queried, developed and (future) reinvented in ways that will allow it to contribute meaningfully to the cultural reproduction of the world. That is, the arts need to create conditions in the world that support the</text>

But they do not happen for a reason. In my opinion, the reason to support a cultural institution like art galleries is that the gallery becomes an alternative form of social encounter between people who share a common interest and are prepared to share in the social wealth produced by the social. And I would add that the biennial has to be a social enterprise like the gallery in order to sustain itself – to build good will, to attract people, and to have a future. The gallery is a capitalist enterprise, but it does not have to be. The biennial has to change with the changing times, and the gallery has to change with the times, but at the same time it has to offer a real alternative to the increasingly privatized and negative cultural forms that are destroying culture. This is the difficult calculus that art galleries and biennials are forced to confront as a cultural form in a globalized and fragmented world. The increasing privatizing of cultural resources in numerous forms is a fact of contemporary capitalism, but it is also true that the biennial is entering a period of unprecedented political and ideological decentral</text>
