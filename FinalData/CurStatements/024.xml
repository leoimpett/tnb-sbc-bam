Recently, I have been thinking about the politics of biennials in relation to ecological crises. I see two elements that underlie the increasing political and economic importance of the biennial – a biennial is an episodic event that is temporally specific; it is not present in a fixed chronological order. And ‘biennial’ itself is a geopolitical concept: it denotes the location and the position of the art institution within contemporary society, and its relationships to other power structures.

So the politics of the biennial is intimately linked to the politics of the ecological crisis, and is likely to stay so for many years to come.However, the politics of the ecological crisis is no longer confined to the political world of cities and nations; political and economic systems are increasingly interconnected and interconnected, and not all actors on the planet are necessarily in the same position or have the same level of development. The political significance of the ecological crisis has spread to include broader societal systems and actors, and biennials are just one small part of this growing body of interconnectedness. So it is that we are often asked, how is the ecological crisis impacting our daily lives? And while there are certainly individuals and systems of ecological value in this world today, we are also exposed to significant amounts of pollution and waste being dumped into our water and waste streams, which has a significant impact on aquatic ecosystems and the biennials that we harbour within those ecosystems. And this is just one example of many that contribute to the increasing complexity of our globalised, urbanised and suburbanised world. There are of course many more systemic factors that are contributing to the crises we are</text>

So the politics of the biennial is intimately linked to the politics of the ecological crisis, and is likely to stay so for many years to come.However, the biennial has to be differentiated from other art forms in order to be differentiated effectively. And this distinction is often made in a very simplistic and negative way. For example, the biennial as an episodic art form is often depicted as an episodic ‘rape fest’, or as a sequential ‘rape culture’, or as a series of discrete acts of ‘raping and fornication’. These are simplistic portrayals, and they are often based on a white, cis, heteronormative view of history and contemporary society. But the political and ecological dynamics of the biennial event, and the related abundance of artworks that are produced and exhibited within the biennial, can never be simplified. The politics of the biennial event are complex, and often ideological. And the artworks that are produced and exhibited within the biennial event are often produced with the explicit political aims of the art institution in mind. The explicit political aims may be noble in</text>

So the politics of the biennial is intimately linked to the politics of the ecological crisis, and is likely to stay so for many years to come.However, the biennial has to become ecologically sustainable in the long run if it is not to be a ‘gift’ to the society from its natural resources. And this requires both political and economic changes, which are likely to remain contested in the future. So it is important for the museum to be able to project the newness and unpredictability of the situation, and also to be able to integrate the unpredictable element into the schedule that it establishes, without losing its place. In the public arena, this is usually achieved through symbols and parables that lend themselves to mythmaking, but in the arena of art this is even more evident. The biennial needs to present new, disruptive or paradoxical situations. It cannot impose its will on others to do so. And it certainly cannot become a monolithic embodiment of all that is problematic in society. The biennial should be an ever-shifting assemblage of diverse artistic works, chosen, planned and curated according to its current needs and</text>

So the politics of the biennial is intimately linked to the politics of the ecological crisis, and is likely to stay so for many years to come.However, the politics of the ecological crisis is also likely to change, and it is possible that within the foreseeable future we will again be faced with the epoch of the biennial, but this time as an episodic, transient and transitory kind of biennial, with periods of renewal and de-renewal occurring at regular intervals. In this case, the forms of the art institution that produced and capitalised on the ecological crisis would be very different, and perhaps it would be necessary to create new forms of the art institution that do not share the common epistemic ground with the old curators, artists and art writers who created the crisis.This kind of political and ephemeral character of the biennial would mean that the artworks produced in the museum or archive, and made available online through a biennial, would be of limited use to the museum or archive in their current form – not just in an ephemeral, temporality challenged way, but also in a way that would make them unlikely</text>

So the politics of the biennial is intimately linked to the politics of the ecological crisis, and is likely to stay so for many years to come.However, the biennial has also recently entered a phase of crisis. The politics of the biennial have become increasingly political, and the biennial is no exception. The biennial has become an occasion where contradictions are allowed to build, and can be counted upon to continue to build those at odds with which it is divided. The biennial is clearly a art form with a political purpose, and this purpose is being served, even if its practitioners don’t know it. The importance of this is that it allows the political to be recognised, and the political to be reckoned with. Biennials are valued for their quantity, and their quality, and for their proximity to the art institution, the public, and the arts community at large. Furthermore, and this is a powerful organising principle, being able to generate enthusiasm for and participation in art among those who wouldn’t participate in the art otherwise.This organising principle is being undermined at an alarming rate, and the conditions that generate art are being eroded</text>

So the politics of the biennial is intimately linked to the politics of the ecological crisis, and is likely to stay so for many years to come.However, the biennial, and the ecological crisis in particular, is not the only spatial element that is undergoing radical change. The social and spatial relations that the biennial is creating and is shaping are much deeper and more dynamic. And it is these social relations that we cannot yet comprehend, or perhaps are not yet so reshaped as to be capable of comprehending, the political and economic relations that will inevitably arise in the wake of the ecological crisis. For this reason, I see the importance of a large-scale, long-term ecumenical exchange, including in the cities, taking place between the artist and the stakeholders, stakeholders in the form of citizens and stakeholders in the social form of workers and consumers of culture, taking place over the course of many years or even decades. This new spatial and temporal dynamic is likely to produce new social forms and possibly even to alter the spatial relations between people and the social. This new social form will most likely involve new occupations and forms of consumption, and will most</text>

So the politics of the biennial is intimately linked to the politics of the ecological crisis, and is likely to stay so for many years to come.However, the biennial has its limits – it operates beyond those limits. And the limits to which it will return are not political, economic or social. It is the very essence of the biennial to be present in the present, to be an episodic and transient kind of cultural phenomenon. And the biennial has to be present in order to function in that condition. So the biennial – like other art forms – has limits. And the limits to which it will return are political, economic and social. The biennial is a production of the capitalist era, and like other art forms it will continue to be subject to the whims of economic forces. And like other art forms, it will inevitably encounter limits.I would argue that the biennial is part of a larger artworld infrastructure that is contributing to the production of a city in transition, and that this infrastructure is part of a much larger cultural system that is also affected by it. And I would argue that the limits to which the biennial will</text>

So the politics of the biennial is intimately linked to the politics of the ecological crisis, and is likely to stay so for many years to come.However, the politics of the ecological crisis is politically globalised and the geopolitics of the biennial is intimately linked to the global economy. And so there are questions that are of an urgent and macroscopic nature that are of course of relevance for the inhabitants of the planet. For example, there is the global question that one raises when considering the state of the biennial’s ecological credentials: where is the ecological ethic located? What is its micro-ethics? What are the current environmental crises facing the planet? And so on. There is a reason why biennials are placed in cities, and rarely, if ever, in remote locations. Because the politics of the biennial is globally connected. There are cities on the one hand and, on the other, vast remote places with their own particular sets of politics and codes of behaviour. It is today one of the tasks of the biennial to be everywhere, and so it is imperative that its social and ecological politics are deeply imbricated</text>

For instance, the proposal for the controversial Los Angeles mega-exhibition The Biennale was partly based on the anticipation and evaluation of the forthcoming American Museum of Contemporary Art’s (AMCA)1 exhibition The Contemporary Condition (2017), which would introduce a new generation of artists to the biennial tradition, and the political context in which the biennial would be staged.2 The Biennale has been repeatedly postponed or completely withdrawn on political grounds,3 and its recent proposal was clearly political as well as opportunistic. Its chair, Anna Best and her team obviously felt that they had enough political capital to proceed with the exhibition regardless of the mounting political and social crises facing the United States and Latin America at this time. The biennial has also often been considered an afterthought within the larger museum, largely due to its inaccessibility and decentralisation, its commercialisation and the proliferation of</text>

And it is to a large extent a consequence of the capitalist accumulation of knowledge, which has led to the technological singularity. The technological singularity is the point where the limits of scientific and mathematical capability are realised. It denotes the point where the limits of scientific and mathematical capability begin to be questioned. And it denotes the point at which the social costs begin to weigh against the technological singularity. So the politics of the biennial is closely tied to the politics of the finite resource – the politics of the finite planet. And the biennial as an episodic event that can be counted on to last for ever, despite its economic and social impact.The political impact of the biennial I think is complex. I think it is important to distinguish between two ways of viewing the political impact of the biennial. One is a critical perspective</text>

The chapter on transportation will examine the role of transport, routes, modes of travel and modes of culture in the emergence of the Biennale, while the chapter on urbanization and development – itself a simplification, a description of a particular decision-making process, and a particular mode of urbanisation – will look back on the decades of the Biennale, from its beginnings as a ‘portside city’ to its current incarnation as a concept. The chapter on the industrial city, ‘The End of Production and Forgetting of Age’, will look back on the consequences of the Biennale’s continuing reliance on fossil fuels and how this impacts the planet as a whole. Finally, in the chapter on virtual human performance, ‘Postmodernism, or the Artificial Intelligence Chronicles’, we arrive at the present, when artists, curators and artists’ associations are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to create artistic and</text>

A year later, the Venice Architecture Biennale opened, and we can add another chapter to the book, this time focusing on the city’s architecture and the city’s economic potential. Planning documents, satellite photos and commemorative coins are just some of the ways in which the Biennale has been able to participate in the city’s narrative. And its role in this narrative is just as important as its actual physical presence and influence.  The architecturally designed, the ethnically specified and politically mandated exploration of the city is a very different kind of architectural experience from the urban experience, and it is this kind of architectural education that is being neglected. While the city is being systematically deconstructed, we are being encouraged to become cottagers – that is, to become passive objects in a massive and ever more urbanising society – in a city that is becoming increasingly urbanising all the time. The biennale is being encouraged to become something completely different.  The challenge now becomes how to incorporate the architecture of the proposed ‘City of Culture’ into the proposed ‘City of Culture 2.0’. While this may</text>

A year later, the Venice Architecture Biennale opened, and we can add another chapter to the book, this time focusing on the city’s architecture and the city’s ecology.  The series ‘Architecture of the Future: Paris, New York, and Beyond’ begins with the announcement that, through a $5 million partnership with New York–based architecture firm W.W. Jacobs, the Biennale will move to New York and London in 2019. The new exhibition venue will be used to showcase work from the new exhibition, while the ground-floor retail and publishing sector will focus on the exhibition’s legacy. The series will also introduce relevant archival materials and documents, while critically examining architectural trends and social practices in the area. For the second part of the document, the series ‘3rd PLATEAU: Paris, New York, and Beyond’, we turn to the author of the first part, presenting a chronological look back at the past three installments.

A year later, the Venice Architecture Biennale opened, and we can add another chapter to the book, this time focusing on the city’s architecture and the city’s economic potential. This is the story of how the Biennale generated local and global attention in a single year, and the impact that resonance has had on the development of postindustrial and cities worldwide.  The Venice Architecture Biennale as a Public Art EventIn early 2017, the Biennale was chosen as one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People in the World 2016. The announcement was accompanied by a photography essay by Tim Bajarin and Oscar Pareja, who were commissioned by the Venice Architecture Biennale to document the event as it happened.  The pair were split, with Bajarin managing the magazine as an independent curator with a curatorial flair, while Pareja painting the city and the city’s infrastructure as a network of tunnels, bridges and passages that act as both physical and virtual borders. The images they selected represent a political, social and spatial analysis of the place of cities in the contemporary world.  The Venice Bi</text>

A year later, the Venice Architecture Biennale opened, and we can add another chapter to the book, this time focusing on the city’s architecture and the city’s capital. This is the chapter that tells the story in chronological order starting from the very first blueprint published in 1906, covering the years from the Italian Renaissance to the mid-1990s. The chapter ‘Space–Time Axis’ is a metaphor for the relationship between physical and immaterial objects, and specifically, the temporal difference between physical objects and virtual representations of them. It draws specifically on the work of Scottish architect Derek Jarman, who’s the author of that now classic Postmodernism: Crisis, Rhetoric and the Archive. Here, the space-time axis is viewed through the prism of the Space–Time Museum, a UK non-profit organisation established in 1906 and headquartered in London. The museum is a site of constant display and of constant public use, where ‘a permanent collection of Japanese animation characters, created specifically for the museum, and various other objects from the museum’s collection … serve as a continually evolving reference point and object system</text>

A year later, the Venice Architecture Biennale opened, and we can add another chapter to the book, this time focusing on the city’s architecture and the city’s financial entanglements that have kept it from developing into something more robust and sustainable for future generations.  A key issue for the future of the Biennale as a cultural venue is the question that has been plaguing it all these years: who will take over from the dead, living and future generations? If the Biennale is to regain its former cultural cachet and function as a symbol of the city’s redevelopment, then it is imperative that the Biennale produce a new creative context and engage with the question of who is the contemporary artist and what kinds of contemporary art he is producing. The Biennale format could not exist in a vacuum, and while the answer to its creative-casing question is a definitive &quot;yes&quot;, the answer to its institutional-building question is a complicated, ambiguous and potentially game-changing variable. The Venice Architecture Biennale could – and should – decide what kinds of art it produces, and what kinds of artists it</text>

Planning permission has been granted for the ‘Building and Housing Network’ – a proposed ‘metro and suburban infrastructure plan for the city coupled with design and construction proposals for a new urban centre’ – to be built across from each other on the eastern boundary of the Giardini – a site chosen due to its proximity to the main railway lines. The plan, which was submitted in early 2017, proposes a new urban development strategy for the entire city, including the creation of mixed-use districts, a new biennale district with a new civic centre, and the redevelopment of Crotone Ravine, a historic Italianate residential neighbourhood. The development of the network will occur along the lines of the architectural model that was developed for the Biennale by architect Gunnar Myrdal and his team: from the rooftops up, these plans envision a ‘continuing chain of uses and modes of transit’ in</text>

Biennials in Venice: Influence on the Art World’s Cultural Trajectories  The chapter on the city’s biennale focuses on the influence of the Venice Biennale, which opened in 1968 and continued through 1984, and the growing number of Venice-based biennials, many of which became regional hubs for artists, curators, writers and others interested in art and culture migrating to the city. It also mentions the work of the archivists who document and preserve the city’s architecture, and the collection managers who organize and store the collections.  The collection managers, or</text>

But its symbolic power, its position as an iconic example of contemporary art being made in the shadow of the iconic architecture of the financial and industrial centre, and its relatively low profile internationally, have all been enough to generate a level of local attention and public engagement that has – at the very least – kept the Biennale alive in the media headlines.  A year later, the Venice Architecture Biennale opened, and we can add another chapter to the book, this time focusing on the city’s architecture and the city’s economic potential. This is the chapter that proposes a ‘City of Ideas’ project that would see the development of a new ‘Core Architecture’ around a series of public spaces and a ‘Periphery’ of micro-disturbances that would be resolved through a proposed ‘True North’ district. The idea is to create a set of principles and guidelines that would guide the ‘periphery’’’ development of the area – a region if you will.  The idea is that the ‘core’ – the districts and neighbourhoods that would be developed in tandem with the Core – would be worlds away from any development that might be generated from the peripheral neighbourhoods.  The idea is to avoid ‘the trap of suburban growth’.[6] And this is where the Biennale comes in. It offers a solution to a perceived problem space. It creates a sense of belonging. It matters less</text>
    <text>The disastrous 2021 Biennial in Liverpool – which some have argued contributed to its current predicament – is a case in point.[5] The Biennial lost its US funding in 2014, and its future prospects remain uncertain.

To date, the Venice Biennale has generated little in the way of public or regional buzz.

A year later, the Venice Architecture Biennale opened, and we can add another chapter to the book, this time focusing on the city’s architecture and the city’s economic potential.[6]  A few weeks into the public presentation, the audience has already begun to leave. As the artist Jess Doyle so skillfully describes, the event is a ‘red herring’ that pretends to solve a problem when it actually makes us worse. The real problem is still – as we – the audience – know it is going to be – but the real question is how do we as artists, as performers, as visitors, as consumers of cultural capital, as citizens of a city, come to terms with the fact that the city is going to be there for hundreds of years to come, and that we are ultimately just another part of that history that will be made visible through the building of a new world we do not yet know?

The public gallery may be the ideal venue for the production of a historical collection, but the responsibility for its upkeep lies with a generation of visitors who are increasingly disconnected from the institution.

The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be an approximation of what was once considered the true form of art, but it is also a radical departure from the true form of art that was produced and distributed by the gallery. In this new digital age of abundance and excess, the collection is not a collection of objects but a streaming online database – a virtual library of objects, the very embodiment of archiving and curation’s emancipatory potential. In this regard, the collection stream is not merely an online archive, but is a potential new kind of cultural museum, capable of holding in its pages the traces of a once lived experience. In an event like Venice, the collection is a potential venue for the production of a new kind of cultural practice, capable of producing a new kind of art. The collection may be digitised and disseminated, and all the traces of art may be found and gathered together in a new collection and museum – a sort of virtual archive – that can then be shared with other artworlds, including non</text>

The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be an approximation of the actual collection, but it is also a far cry from the original collection. If the online collection is to be believed, it is growing at an alarming rate. And this is where contemporary art and contemporary curation differs from what is considered normal, contemporary art. It is not the collection of paintings and drawings that are collected and distributed; but rather the collection of online data that is collected, notes and stored. It is this last element that makes the performance of collections like the Biennial possible. It is the collection of online data that contributes to render contemporary art into cultural forms that are possible through the use of computers. And it is this last element that underlies the idea of the contemporary contemporary avant garde, its global spread, and contemporary material culture.1  But this performance must be accompanied by a performance of historical collections, and a corresponding production of art and culture that is contemporaneous with and in opposition to the globalised forms of contemporary art production today.</text>

And this is where contemporary art and contemporary curation begin to interact. The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be very valuable to a museum or a local community of artists, but it is increasingly difficult to assess the value of a collection based on the appearance of objects or the absence of specific information about the objects. A public gallery that produces and distributes historical collections as part of its artistic practice may wish to preserve and reconceive the appearance of a gallery in order to attract and retain patrons, but this is no longer the case. The online curatorial role has taken over the curatorial role in a manner not unlike the early stages of the internet. Art and curators are no longer content to produce and disseminate historical collections. Collections now regularly interrupt artistic practice in order to offer a curated experience, and online art and cultural data provides that for many curators and artists.In an attempt to reflect the present and future trends in art and cultural studies, an international team of curators and artists was invited to develop an interactive exhibition system for the first time in Liverpool.

And this is where contemporary art and contemporary curation begin to interact. The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be a valuable storage for ideas, but it is by no means a sufficient store of knowledge or a sufficient store of ideas. Contemporary art and contemporary curation needs to be produced according to the contemporary art historian’s needs, preferences and desires. The collection must have a form, function and identity outside the context of the contemporary art exhibition. In other words, it must be produced according to the sensibilities and needs of contemporary art historians. However, this does not mean that the collection should possess an objectivity or that it should serve an objective. Contemporary art collectors today may want to know more about contemporary art, but they also may want to know less about art history or the past, and they may want to know more about the contemporary condition in which art is made. In either case, the collection should not be able to function as a collective memory.  Contemporary art today is made primarily within the context of global exhibitions, and these exhibitions have become ever more important in constituting a museum of contemporary</text>

The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be an image or digitized version of an image or digitized copy of an image, but it lacks the punctum of textual information and rigorous historical context that characterises a museum or archive. It is a collection of traces.Contemporary art and contemporary curation is the production of a history that is not immediately visible in the artist’s representation. In other words, it is more accurately described as a ‘histories’ than as a collection of objects. This is why Clement Greenberg’s collection was so influential in our thinking on the collection of objects in The Contemporary Condition. Greenberg, the Greenberg Gallery, New York, 1979–1987, an exhibition space for the exhibition of Clement Greenberg’s collection, is a classic example of a curatorial strategy that builds up a substantial amount of information about an artist and their work in advance of presenting that work.

The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be a limited resource, but it is a resource nonetheless. The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of digital archival materials and microfilms may be limitless, but it is constrained to a particular medium and focused on a particular node in a global nodeous network. Contemporary art and contemporary curation are moving towards sites of constant re-assembly, where the collections kept in physical and virtual form may be assembled in almost any order on the site wherever possible. While this may seem desirable for the sake of accessibility and affordability, it is essential that these collections be constantly (and not always in chronological order) transposed and re-shifted, and that they be constantly (and never always in real-time) updated. Contemporary art and contemporary curation are art-histories in the making, and the technological revolution that is transforming the art-histories sector is only adding to the significance of the field.Art as data (digital or analog) is the future of the artist; data</text>

The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be historical in character, but it is also a contemporary curatorial invention that, because it is online, is uniquely positioned within the contemporary art museum. It is, in other words, the ultimate contemporary curatorial invention. Yet the collection reproduced through the online service is also contemporary in its own way. It reproduces the social totality, but in a more globalised and interconnected way. It reproduces the social totality because it is reproducible, but it is also ‘original’ in that it is contemporary in its own right. It is contemporary because it is contemporary, but contemporary in its own right. And here, then, is the critical juncture. If the goal of art historical collections is to support the ongoing reproduction of art’s social totality, then the curatorial production of such collections must be responsive to the social totality that is reproduced through it. If the goal is to produce original works that are contemporary with the social totality, then the collection production must respond to a changing</text>

The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be owned by a private company or a non-profit organisation, but it is produced and distributed in a globally distributed, dispersed, dispersed and mobile way that negates the ownership of the actual art. In other words, it is not owned by the collection or its trustees, but by different organisations that happen to be connected to the collection. In effect, this raises the stakes of cultural activity beyond the actual collection, and the collection itself.The role of the collector and the collection in the twenty-first century is likely to be complicated by the emergence of new technologies that make it easier to identify and trace certain kinds of cultural activity. Nevertheless, the collection as an entity and the collection as a material – its contents, places, objects and networks – is likely to become increasingly important in the twenty-first century. The role of the museum in this process is likely to grow increasingly important. It is essential to note that the relationship between the museum and the collection is not necessarily adversarial, as some contemporary</text>

The collections produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be completely fictitious, but the social consequences of a generation who cannot access a cultural archive or who cannot access a collection in their lifetimes are equally dire. A key question for curators and artists concerned with the social and political conditions of race and identity today is how to engage the communities who constitute the sites of their activity. How to find common ground through cultural practices that seek to understand and map the past through the present, through the processes of migration, displacement, and politicisation described by Maria Hlavajova?

The collection that is produced and distributed via the service of online cultural databases may be a somewhat abstract and metaphorual reflection of the collecting and preservation of historical objects, but the actual collections that are accumulated and preserved through the processes of historical collections are very different. Collection managers would do well to regularly reassess their idea of what counts as a cultural resource and what is not. In the current biennial format, there is a clear emphasis on the collection as an end in itself, and not just an object of historical interest. This may be true for curatorial purposes, as collections management becomes increasingly influential in the curatorial agenda. But a biennial that constantly strives to outpace its real-life subject is bound to encounter real-life resistance, and biennials will inevitably encounter this, too. The interesting thing about biennials is that they are not bound to a particular location or time. They can happen anywhere, anytime. This may happen for curatorial, as well. In the current biennial structure, the museum is often the first site of resistance. But this</text>

To me, in sum, the right to the city represents a way to think about cultural practices that are not confined to the city and to the extent that they occur at all, to engage with the social conditions of urban life and community life. It also needs to be distinguished from what might be called ‘cultural tourism’, which is, in my opinion, the primary form of cultural exchange in the city. Cultural tourism is, for one thing, about experiencing the place ‘on a personal level’ – experiencing it as a part of the tradition or heritage of the city, as distinct from contemporary art, which is often taken to imply a personal connection to the place. And, for another thing, it ‘involves travel agencies and major art institutions in the form of cultural tours, which can be ‘professed’ as parts of the larger cultural ‘experience’.’[18]  Cultural tourism is by now one of the most widely used forms of cultural exchange. It is experienced by tourists of every kind, from those who come for the cultural</text>

To me, in sum, the right to the city represents a way to think about cultural practices that are not confined to the city and to the extent that they occur at all, to the extent that it is culturally responsive to the desires and interests of the city.  To me, this means expanding the definition of the ‘city’ beyond just the geographic site of a site where cultural practices occur – cultural practices also have ‘historical and social contexts’ within the city, and are part of a larger urban context – and beyond just the site where they are located and the people who inhabit those areas.  Cultural production in the city is production that is culturally responsive to the city’s contemporary urban situation, but it also includes cultural practices that are not confined to the city and that occur at sites outside of the city.  For example, although many artists, curators and arts administrators I have worked with are situated in the city, they also operate elsewhere, often in other cities, and they often collaborate with other communities.

To me, in sum, the right to the city represents a way to think about cultural practices that are not confined to urban centres but also to other non-metropolitan locations, such as remote locations in the far reaches of the globe. The concept of the ‘right to the city’ is one that is sensitive to the fact that cities today are largely populated by non-white people who are either migrants or refugees (who are most of them older and have more experience and more knowledge of migration and survival than are white people). The ‘right to the city’ also implies that people have a right to cultural resources, including cultural institutions and places – including cultural neighbourhoods – but also cultural practices, including language skills and ‘cultural consumption’.[18] Italics mine.  The ‘right to the city’ has recently come to encompass new migrant flows, who are primarily from the Middle East and Africa but also include many indigenous populations.

To me, in sum, the right to the city represents a way to think about cultural practices that are not reducible to economic forces – cultural tourism is a form of ‘cultural imperialism’, to borrow a phrase from John Nash.[18] And the related notion of the 'right to the city’ represents a way to imagine other kinds of cultural contexts. For example, the concept of the cultural tourist is frequently used to describe tourism to places such as Disneyland or the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which are often seen as progressive in their reliance on tourism as a source of capital and inspiration. The use of the term is imbued with a certain amount of condescension, but I think that there is some truth to it. The cultural tourist is a relatively new kind of visitor, and the kinds of cultural imperialism that Nash was arguing about are still with us. The politics of the cultural tourist are, I think, much more complicated than a simple ‘capital=culturaristie’. And there is plenty of research to back up the kinds of cultural imperialism</text>

It also means that when cultural practices are taken to be ‘cultural criminals’, it is not just the city that is culpable.  The concept of the ‘right to the city’ was discussed and debated in the arts community during the 1980s and early 1990s, but little was done to create a legally binding concept. That is, to create a concept that can be applied to all aspects of cultural practice. That would create a ‘concept of the city’ that is not limited to the city and that encompasses not only the arts and cultural institutions but also a large number of other ‘professions and subspecialties’. That would create a ‘concept of the city’ that is multidimensional and multivalent – something that the city has largely neglected.

It also indicates a way to participate in a shared cultural experience without having to leave the city. Cultural tourism is a form of labour that is contingent upon the exchange of capital and is therefore sensitive to the conditions of capitalism; concomitant with this is an emphasis on the exchange of space and goods.[18] In other words, if cultural tourism is to be taken seriously, it will have to make a transition from the city to the suburbs and rural areas and beyond.   A second aspect of the ‘right to the city’ is the ‘right to cultural resources’. This refers to the ‘cultural premises, objects and objects of urban existence’, including but not limited to buildings, public spaces, icons, symbols, buildings and street furniture. It demands a corresponding corresponding corresponding corresponding corresponding corresponding right to cultural resources of all kinds, including</text>

In other words, it does not merely mean the right to live together in a community – defining aspects of community life include cultural practices such as food sharing, social activities and ‘cultural tourism’ – but also cultural exchange, including exchange of ideas and culture.  To me, in sum, the right to the city represents a way to think about cultural practices that are not reducible to economic considerations, and to the extent that they are cultural practices, are they also contribute to contribute to creating a ‘cultural commons’ through sharing knowledge and values.[18] And indeed, as the Right to the City movement has spread across Canada, the United States and Europe, and in recent years has begun to be incorporated into urban development in many Australian cities, it is now time to consider what that ‘cultural commons’ might look like in a future city or region, and how it might be created.  One area of inquiry is: what would be the role of art in the ‘cultural commons’? One response has been proposed by Robert H MacDonald: the functions of art today are defined primarily through the concept of collective. But since nothing is more essential to the existence of art today than the existence of a collective of artists, one might think that the curatorial function should be expanded to include functions that directly engage with the contemporary society that produces</text>

To me, in sum, the right to the city represents a way to think about cultural practices that are not reducible to economic considerations – a way to understand why certain forms of political and economic oppression persist in certain cities and certain parts of the country.  The work represents a shift from the economic to the cultural. It does not merely seek to create a marketplace for cultural goods and services, as some other proposals have done. Conceptually speaking, the new way of looking at cultural forms does not mean the end of cultural production, nor the means of producing it. Rather, it seeks to create different representations of the same cultural practices, which may or may not be reciprocally reciprocated. Cultural production as a social production increasingly involves exchanges between people from different spheres of the society – individuals, groups, communities. Thus, the emergence of new cultural practices is driven by interactions across social networks that are mediated, stratified and condensed. The social form that allows such social interactions is cultural, and the social forms that result from such interactions are multivalent.  The notion of the community or ‘community�</text>

To me, in sum, the right to the city represents a way to think about cultural practices that are not reducible to economic considerations, political considerations and scientific and economic considerations. It also represents the capacity of individuals and groups to enact change through their culture, and this can mean anything – from individualised artistic practices to large-scale cultural institutions and the commercial circulation of goods and services – but especially for artists and the socially engaged it can mean creating your own ‘cultural landscape’.  Art’s social function – its social capital – depends on a large infrastructure of distribution and consumption. If that infrastructure is undermined or destroyed, or ceases to function properly, social benefits are likely to be undermined or destroyed as well.  This is why the potential of an artist’s social capital – even though it is mythological – is diminished when it comes to writing or performing in public: the social benefits of an artist’s creativity in and through the arts are likely to be substantially diminished when that infrastructure is structurally sound and can continue to deliver social benefits.  This is especially true</text>

To me, in sum, the right to the city represents a way to think about cultural practices that are not reducible to economic forces and economic niches – aspects of ‘culture’ that are social and dynamic rather than transactional.  The question, then, becomes whether the right to the city represents a sufficient or a sufficient condition to enable a person to engage in cultural practices that are ‘Australian’ and who can call himself or herself such. I would answer that question in the negative. The concept of the ‘right to the city’ is a construct and should be questioned, questioned and overthrown.  A concept that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as a way to justify the criminalisation of protest and assembly, and to legitimise the state's violence and repression of those who engage in political, anti-fascist or anti-racist activism, and in the 1980s and 1990s as a way to legitimise the criminalisation of critical thought and advocacy, and to legitimise the enforcement of the criminalisation of non-conformist thinking, and in</text>

More and more of what we do is becoming automated, and yet the very structures that enable us to do that – the stories we tell ourselves and the landscape we walk through every day – are the very things that give meaning to the very act of walking. We are increasingly reliant on data to tell us what to do, and yet the very act of telling a story through symbolic gestures and images raises questions about agency and responsibility. Consider, for instance, the gesture of holding a football in your hand in an urban area where the football is played on a large screen. Just as the adoption of new technologies creates new kinds of engagement, the re-imagining of the city around them also generates new kinds of engagement. In the 1990s, for instance, the arcades of San Francisco replaced the fish market and the iconic architecture of the Mission</text>

What is already a set of rules that is shared between all humans is now a collective responsibility, and this raises the question: who has the right to tell another human how to act?This notion of the collective is what Lederle calls ‘the commons’, and it emerges from a simple notion of authorship: what is the rightful claim to something? The commons, she says, is a ‘gift of nature’.[11] And what is this ‘gift’?

So it is that in the film Groundhog Day, the character Mr. Bean says: ‘Where the fowl go I will plant a garden.’[12] And, in The Matrix, Neo gets even scarier: ‘There’s a man who can make any number of things happen.’[13] The problem with the commons, according to Lederle, is that it is not a homogeneous, self-generating resource of services, but rather, through processes of accrual, something like debt. So if a narrative that is shared by all humans in a given geographical area is to be believed, it has to be accompanied by a process of accrual, with or without precariat. And so, in that sense, we can say that the ‘right to the commons’ is a pre-negotiated, transnational, globalised commodity. But what if the commons is not simply a fiction created by humans? What if, as the commons is being reclaimed, it aids in the oppression of humankind? What if, as the commons</text>

While the claim to the commons is often made by an acknowledged collective, the reality is that the commons is often made by individuals claiming specific rights to certain resources.[13] For instance, in 1988, when Lebanon was among the occupied territories of Israel, the Palestine Land Co.-Palestine Committee sought to create a public sector corporation with a collective board of directors, which the Palestinian Authority established in 1987. The Palestine Land Co.-Palestine Committee argued that the public sector would be better off when it came entirely from the Palestinians, since this way the resources of the occupied territories would be distributed equally. The UN Security Council unanimously rejected this proposal, as did the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).In a decision that has remained largely unnoticed in the West, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of a resolution overwhelmingly condemning Israel for its violations of international law.</text>

The story of the ‘morning after’ derives from a 16th-century Russian treatise on morning, in which the astronomer and physicist Alon Perampov describes the appearance of a new kind of celestial body: a celestial body that 'acquiesces to the sun’, and so forth. The body, Perampov explains, undergoes a transformation in the morning, becoming 'like a leaf … brighter, denser and more durable … more like a tree … more like a house … more like a river … more like a city … more like a forest … more like a country … more like a island … more like a continent … more like a sum of all these different shapes] … more like a landscape … more like a city … more like a</text>

But in recent years, as the environmental crises in Europe and North Africa have deepened, it has become increasingly clear that humans are only ever at the margins of the system, and that we do not possess the necessary resources or social capacities to exert significant influence. So who has the entitlement to tell another story? This is the question that Lederle addresses in her reflections on Groundhog Day: who is entitled to plant a seed or plant a tree, to say, for instance, that the railway tracks along the Mersey should be cleared out? She does not see groundhog day as an act of rightful ownership, but as a ‘story’, in the classic narrative sense. And</text>

It produces landscapes, both natural and artificial, according to a set of prescribed rules.As an artifact of the Enlightenment, the commons is a fiction; it is not a shared future that we inhabit. But what it brings to the table is a certain kind of narrative construction that is common to all of us – a kind of shared fictional space that we can inhabit together, on our terms, in common. And this kind of space produces certain kinds of relations between people, certain kinds of knowledge and vice versa.So the commons produces certain kinds of knowledge, but it also has certain other kinds of relations – kinds of relations that are much more elusive and malleable. And this kind of space produces certain kinds of knowledge, but it also has certain other kinds of relations – kinds of knowledge that are more malleable and contingent.

And it is a ‘gift’ that these trees brought prosperity to the city, since they fed the growing population and provided shelter from the elements.But what if these benefits accrue to only a small proportion of the population, or only a select few? What if, say, carrots provide economic development but also shelter and food for only a small elite? What might become of the trees if such economic development shifts the boundaries of what counts as a commons? The film Groundhog Day seems to suggest that the trees would reclaim the area, if only for a short while. But what might become of the trees if the commons is no longer defined by the social capacities that brought about its current form? What might become of the trees, I ask, if they are empowered to create their own futures</text>

They also want to create a biennial that is accessible, distinctive and continues to challenge the prevailing order in the city.  	The proposal for Liverpool Biennial 2018 is somewhat paradoxical in its time, since it comes at a time of renewed focus on the city – in particular, the shadowing of residential neighbourhoods by new masonry and mixed-use projects – as a major urban challenge. 	However, the proposal is also a statement of purpose: the artists’ intention to continue their art project despite the current political and economic challenges to the city.

The Biennial as a Cultural Centre 	The Biennial has created a cultural center in its city, albeit one that is deeply ambivalent about its own growth, located in an area of the city with significant urban renewal activity. The Biennial’s position is that it must somehow balance the need to innovate and create with the need to preserve what it calls the ‘unique cultural character of the area’, even if this means compromising on certain democratic rights (such as the right to assemble, educate and protest, as happened in Liverpool during the 1980s and 1990s). In an attempt to make the centre accessible to all, the Biennial has created a ‘hostelry’ situation for artists’ staymates to use, refurbish or create ‘in their space’. 	Similarly, hostelry is the operative concept here, but unlike in Liverpool, where artists are housed in individual hostels, in the Bi</text>

If this is about ‘the city’, then the regional hub could explore the idea of the city as a ‘regional space’, with ‘regional’ often translating to ‘global’. 	The Biennial could create a ‘regional arts organization’ by offering artists ‘financial incentives’ in exchange for their services; or ‘encouraging local artists’ to establish ‘regional offices’ in exchange for ‘professional</text>

The Biennial has been looking for artists to participate in a kind of co-production process, whereby the arts organisation provides programming and resources to the artist, while the other parties assist in developing the program and in crafting resources (programmes etc.) that the artist can distribute widely. This may involve collaborating with existing arts organisations on an off, but it is a new one for them, and a huge opportunity for the artist to set up shop in a completely new way. 	In the event that they do decide to take this on full-time, what are the possibilities for the future? 	There are so many possibilities here that it is impossible to cover them all, but I will give three that have been on my shortlist of artists to watch out for: Meehan Crist, Nasser Rabbani and Karan Johar.

The aim of these Working Groups is to explore how art and culture can work alongside one another, with an emphasis on how artists can contribute to the development of culturally responsive local communities through collaborative art projects.

The biennial, by its very nature, is a transient phenomenon: it is ever on the look out for a transient patron base to sustain the project. In doing so, the Biennial risks losing its transient character (which is to say, it could, in the event of a downturn in its patron base), and loses out in the long run to other culturally responsive and economically diversifying projects that would engage both the art and the industry stakeholders with whom it would have a relationship in the future). 	The biennial may have arrived at these developments through their institutionalised forms, but their very transient nature (which is to say, deeply embedded within the institution) means that they are also able to impact culture in new and unexpected ways.

The decision to do so through a biennial was a mix of factors, but in the end it came down to this: the city was a potential market for their wares, the city was a location with a large following, and the biennial had just completed a major overhaul. The changes at the museum were less obvious, but also less influential. 	The Biennial as a Temporary Market 	The Biennial has responded to this new market – a transient one at that – by creating what is essentially a one-stop shop for artefacts and information about the city. Curators, artists and artists’organizations that regularly book the museum for events can find out about upcoming events through this website. Creating a public website can also make it easier for an artist to find an exhibition space, since venues for art are a public database.

    The disastrous 2021 Biennial, curated by Jonathan Heymann, is another in a long line of failures. But the real failure of the twentieth century was in its idolisation of art, and especially in its veneration of Rubens, Picasso, Degas and Matisse. It is to the fault of biennials today that their great-grandchildren will never be taught to appreciate the beauty, the intelligence or the depth of the human tragedy that they created and continue to destroy.Thatcher promoted the important work of art and architecture school within the civil service. She also championed the arts in the public domain – in the public realm being defined by the Arts Council as follows: ‘In the public domain are the feelings, the imagination and the sensualities of the common people protected from private use’; and ‘In the public domain are works of art and monuments recognised as having significance in their community, nation or district by virtue of being of historical or artistic significance’.

She believed that the arts were essential to a democratic commonwealth; and she believed that the arts were also essential to a just peace and a just sociality.But while the vernacular might once have been a place where the arts were openly and heroically represented, we’re all citizens of a gentrified urban centre now. The Chisenhale Gallery, established in 1887, was the first art gallery in the city, and it was the last in Ontario. The sudden and unexpected closure of the gallery in the late nineteenth century, and the subsequent fire that destroyed much of its artistic heritage, meant that the city fell increasingly into the hands of the dominant professions – law, education, shipping, publishing – whose patronage of education and science was a predominant force in the nineteenth century. The Chisenhale Gallery was shut down in the early twentieth century, and many of its former students are now engaged in the postgraduate programmes of architecture and landscape architecture.

She believed that the arts should be employed in promoting ‘common sense, morality, true understanding and righteousness in a public by virtue of their being of historic or contemporary value’. But although she promoted the general welfare, it was her particular interest and labour that inevitably supported and animated the arts and their practitioners. She was not interested in the art being produced in the public sphere; nor in the art being recognised on an international or internationalising basis. She was interested in the art being produced by and for the arts council and its members, and in the artists and organisations whose work she supported and commissioned. She promoted the arts in the public sphere because this would increase their value and prestige, and thus increase the income and power of the arts councils, and in turn increase access to forms of art and their practitioners in the public realm. It was a pernicious circle to deny the arts and their practitioners of public resources and to actively seek to undermine the arts and artists whose work and ideas were produced and developed by</text>

She believed that the arts should be used for good, and that anyone who used them for evil would be held to account.I first met Norman Wilkinson in the autumn of 1958. He was a short, lanky biennial collector with a populist, anti-intellectual bent. He had started collecting artworks when he was sent to the Civil War Museum in 1964, and collected even more when he was sent to the Gros Michel Museum in 1967. He had a particular passion for the urban environment, and the avant garde in particular. He was interested in emerging phenomena such as free love, eco-tourism, and new media. On a personal note, I was visiting family in Liverpool when I received an invitation to join the staff of the Cumbria Railway, which operated the Cumbria Main Station. I turned up for the first time in November 1958, and found my way to work every day by the Cumbria Railway offices. It was a strange place, with posters of John</text>

She believed that the arts should be given a public, pro-active role, one that actively engages with the arts’ historical and contemporaneous situation and works in the public domain. She did not, as we do, see the arts as a core civic duty of the state. But she did place great emphasis on the importance of art and architecture working in tandem with social enterprise, believing that a number of initiatives, including the provision of affordable housing, arts education, cultural tourism and the provision of cultural facilities, could be developed to support the development of culturally responsive urban environments.She promoted the development of ‘cultural touch points’ – sites in and near major centres where the arts were actively employed, played a significant role in the circulation of ideas and culture, and hosted large-scale public performances and events – believing that such sites would act as registers of intent, mapping societal behaviours and cultural inclinations. She also believed that sites of significant cultural value had to be located near major transit routes, port facilities and</text>

She believed that the arts should control the common good, and so created a new public realm, full of protections for art and artists alike.Thatcher was absolutely correct that the public realm should be protected; in fact, she was absolutely right that the public realm should be protected. But this is not what happened. Instead, in the twenty-first century, we’re in a position where art is often accused of being a burden on society; we are told that we need to constrain artistic creativity, and that if we don’t want to embrace the complexities of contemporary art production and expression, we’re either way out of the picture or else we’re not in the public realm. And so we are told that it is our responsibility to actively engage with the world around us in order to become sophisticated artists, or to adopt the heroic myth of the intrepid young artist and rouse the latent creativity in ourselves; to leave our mark through our art, or else be deemed</text>

She believed that the arts should co-exist alongside all other elements of the public realm, including providing a counterweight to the economic reliance upon the arts education delivered by the civil service.[6] As we shall see, in the public realm, art and the arts were often co-constrained by power, and in particular the state bureaucracy. But in the public realm also lies the risk of becoming coterritically invisible, as is currently happening in the UK and many other places. The danger for the arts in the twenty-first century is that they are coterritically invisible, too.Art and the civicThe civic is a public good. It is what the common people acquire through participation, and what the arts contribute to their understanding and enjoyment of the world. The civic therefore needs art and artistic practices that are responsive to the concerns and desires of powerful actors. It also needs arts educators and artists who can engage and mobilise the people who will be artists and future generations of artists. The two</text>

She believed that the arts should play a fundamental role in the development of publics, and that ‘the arts should be of great help in forming public opinion, guiding action and creating social change’. She promoted a public ‘centre of artistic endeavour’ where artists could thrive and be counted amongst citizens of a democratic nation. In other words, the arts were not just another public good but something that should be actively promoted and entwined with the public good so that both the artist and the community benefitted. It was a public with a public agenda. But as biennials everywhere learn, that is not always easy to achieve. After the Biennial process was launched, the Arts Council started looking for a leader. A candidate had to be someone with a proven track record of transforming neglected spaces of culture into desirable urban environments. The Arts Council had been considering replacing the building of its own residencies at the heart of the Biennial with a hybrid model that would see arts professionals providing support to</text>

She believed that the arts should play a part in every aspect of British public life – in whatever form that took.The arts, and indeed any form of cultural activity, is a blunt instrument. It cannot operate without the politics of representation; and when the arts are actively engaged in for political ends, then they inevitably engage in practices that are reductive of ideas, empty of meaning, and devoid of value – practices that are nothing more than a regurgitation of the socio-politically correct arts narratives that were crafted and propagated in schools and universities. It is not surprising, then, that when the arts were actively sought after, and could be shown off to high-end patronised galleries, such as those run by the likes of Morgan Charles, Victoria and Albert Galloway, and others, who patronised these collections, then the arts were shown in patronised museums providing conspicuous displays of the collections, and in some cases, outright displaying of the collections. But what is surprising is that when the curators</text>

She believed that the arts should be utilised in the public interest, and in particular, in the public good. In other words, the public good meant for the common good. But what a mess that public good is today. What kind of sense is that? Why should the common good be served by creating separate niches for art and architecture? Why should the arts be patronised by a particular sect of society, or a particular patron, over others, or none at all? Why should art be taken as given, whereas life and art are more and more precarious and subject to change? Why should art be patronised by a particular sect of society, or a particular patron, over others, or none at all? Why should the arts be prioritised?Why should the arts be universal? Why should the common good of society be served by engaging all involved, regardless of their social standing, in a shared common good? Why should the arts be free?Why should the common good of society be looked after,</text>

She believed that the arts should co-exist with the rest of the state, and with the common man. But what she didn’t say or do (as she knew full well) was that the arts also had a place in the state to promote the common good, to be given a public profile, to be taken into integrated schools, to be given a public subsidy, to be administered by a publicly elected board, to be nationally representative and internationally recognised, and so on.Her position was that the arts should be incorporated into the fabric of the state, but she also knew that this meant that the arts would have to be embedded in the fabric of the state in order to be useful in creating a public good. So she resorted to what she called ‘subsidiarity’: the integration of the arts within the machinery of government.’‘Subsidies for the Arts?’ was how Norman Wilkinson described the ‘subsidiarity of the arts’ in</text>

It begins with the production of ‘representations of things as fundamentally different from one another’, as a way to begin to understand how culture shapes and produces our social reality. It ends with the production of ‘things that are no longer the same’, which is to say, the production of cultural difference. However, it is important to distinguish between the two: culture is a social production that produces a certain amount of difference, whereas ‘real life’ produces a more direct amount of difference. For example, in the production of images of people meeting in public places, images of which are a product of the social media culture of our times, we can see the impact of the ‘impact of one image’ on another. This is true even though the images that we produce and share on a daily basis may be produced by and shared by people who otherwise never interact with</text>

Recent biennials are a-typical of this kind of ecology: they are the latest manifestation of a long-standing tradition; a prototype of a more extensive, but transient kind of biennial that exists now only within the pages of a newspaper, or within a curatorial agenda; and a typology of increasingly sophisticated recording instruments. A-typical of this kind of biennial, but with a social dimension as well – the new biennials are, in fact, a-typical of this kind of ecology.

[1] The term ‘ecologies’ is used colloquially, but in a number of places in Bergson’s work (e.g. Culture and Society, No. 2) he uses it to describe the systems that organize our lives (including our bodies). These systems, he argues, are ephemeral, ephemeral in character, and thus subject to change – often significantly – in the course of human history. So while we see and experience them through the specific prism of the social, it is their underlying principles that remain fixed and unchanging.   [2] See, for example, Susanne Kreuzer and Christiane Paul, eds., Zeitgeist (New York: New Vessel Press, 2017).Download this article as PDFSusanne Kreuzer and Christiane PaulSue BergsonSue Bergson's latest work, Culture and Society (2017), concerns the relationship between art and power in an age of the omnipresent market. She explores the ways that power structures – capital and the arts in this case – intersect with one another in an attempt to form a hybrid that is both dynamic and immutable. She examines the work of the art collective Continuum as a project that seeks to unravel the disparate parts of a corporation and to form a new kind of social totality. In doing so, she invokes the collective unconscious and collective imagination in the process. Her Culture and Society article also takes up the tradition of biennials – places of exchange and gathering – and extends their historical contexts. In doing so, it appears as if</text>

The image is a composite, of many images gathered from different perspectives. Some perspective images include scenes from different neighbourhoods, while others simply depict neighbourhoods in which the developers say ‘We’re going to build a new ‘Bristol House’. A ‘Bristol House’ is a tall, lean building with a circular driveway that takes visitors through a landscape of houses on one side and a vast empty lot on the other. The image shows a mixture of houses, some attached to shed or pavilion-like structures, some hollowed out and empty homes for soccer fields and shops, a few abandoned hotels and a few abandoned social services. The authors, led by Professors David Burns of Bristol University and John McCartney of the University of Sheffield, explore the ways in which the insular nature of computer programming can constrain the kinds of imagination, creativity and political agency that can be unleashed by the emergence of such structures.

The image is a composite, of many images gathered from different perspectives. Some images are close-ups of individual parts, others are full-scale reconstructions. The images show processes of manufacturing, science and technology at work in the design of buildings and buildings systems. The team’s conclusion: ‘The possibilities are endless in the realm of large-scale additive manufacturing and are closely related to the significant advances in computer modelling and data capture that are enabling new business models. The challenge moving forward is to ensure that the opportunities are not exploited and that the social outcomes are maximized’.[15] The team’s reasoning is that since there is no one true understanding of the world, there are likely to be many interpretations and different ways of perceiving the same thing. So, there is potential for misunderstanding and error in the design of infrastructure, in addition to the unavoidable role of government in supporting and facilitating this process of creating new modes of interaction between people and infrastructure.The nature of human behaviour dictates that we strive to create systems that are �</text>

In each case, the team’s conclusion is based on a single interpretation of a single image. In both instances, the story is the same: if two or more images are gathered together and a decision is made to render an area ‘safe’ by enclosing an area with sensors or structures, the computer finds the images that best represent the area and exploits that information to produce a specific result. The image above is a composite of five images gathered from different perspectives, one of which represents an existing scientific consensus regarding the role of the human in the environment. The consensus, based on various lines of evidence, comes to the conclusion that ‘the growing human impact on the environment is such that machines will play a significant role in the foreseeable future’.[15]So far, so normal, we’ve all been led to believe that the machines understand reality and that they play no</text>

The authors, including Prof. Brendan Maloney, explore the ways in which the ideas they derive about the world from machine learning relate to existing notions of human agency and existence. The fact that the image is gathered from a range of perspectives – from multiple cameras to multiple 3D printers – suggests a more general point of view, one that operates across a wider range of people. The image is then pieced together to form a larger idea, and the process of synthesis, which involves many steps, including the prototyping and specification of features and subsystems, is much more complex and nuanced than is typically assumed. This suggests that there are deeper principles at work here, that the extent to which the abstract modelling is automated will necessarily depend on the extent to which humans are removed from the equation.

In summary, we can affirm that the contemporary interface is an ever-expanding system that continually seeks to acquire additional data and to improve its capacity to meet these new requirements.

For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. Consequently, there is a great deal of state-sponsored media coverage of these new technological revolutions. 	As a result of this widespread and subtle surveillance, there is a great deal of state-sponsored political and social activism around connectivity and transparency. In addition, the need for transparency is often used as a cover for the active measures designed to undermine political and social freedoms. Thus, the need for legislative change can be used to subvert democratic tendencies and meet the needs of corporate power. One could even imagine a future in which all traffic on the Internet is routed through closed circuit television and computer chips embedded in the network cables that run throughout the built environment. This is the kind of thinking and deep structures of the Internet that are currently being questioned and are considered ‘bulletproof’ by the state. 	In this scenario, the question is not about what can and cannot be done with user data; the question is instead: what can the state do with user data? One could even</text>

For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. This is not hyperbole. As numerous studies have shown, the interception and processing of communications is a fundamental component of corporate espionage and destabilization efforts. Thus, the need for ever more sophisticated ways to monitor, filter, search, analyse and decipher connected data becomes ever more apparent. 	Furthermore, the ubiquity of these data capture and processing tools means that the needs of the many are often served by the needs of the few. Thus, there is a logic to the many, if not a universal, then at least an in-built drive towards the in-built self-regeneration of the interface. 	The quest for ever more precise, data-driven and user-friendly ways to interface becomes ever more prominent, both within the corporate world and among the many communities whose needs may be served by these data-driven interfaces. Such is the  	logic of the contemporary interface. But how does the modern interface make its way into our lives? How does the contemporary</text>

In this context, the increasing proliferation of data capture and processing becomes ever more apparent, and even troubling. 	For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. Thus, the need for ever larger transnational transnational corporations to research and develop new ways of organising and managing this traffic seems ever more pressing. If not addressed, this research could easily become a corporate strategy for the new interface – one that seeks to take root in the culture and ultimately in the physical infrastructure of the Internet itself. 	In this scenario, the emerging interface would likely place a premium on the transparent merging of traditionally private and public functions, and would likely make use of new media and apps to empower its users. Perhaps, in the future, the merging of traditionally private and public spheres may be possible through the application of new transparent processes that harness the inherent, collective behaviours of the users of the Internet in the creation of a new interface.

For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. Consequently, data mining becomes ever more important in today’s interface culture, and in-app purchases are actively encouraged. 	Moreover, as the browser and application interface becomes ever more complex to use, ever more nuanced to map, and ever more conscious of where it comes from (via meta-data. 	For instance, many apps now constantly collect information on what kinds of websites users have visited, and what kinds of sites have they come to, in an ever-expanding and increasingly nuanced sense. This kind of behaviour is both commonplace and seemingly inevitable in an interface culture. If the browser and the application interface become ever more complex to use, then users will need ever more sophisticated media and cognitive mechanisms in order to decipher this information and render it intelligible. Therefore, the contemporary interface is both subject to the same kinds of meta-data gathering and differentiations that plague other types of cultural artefacts, but also has its own powerful ways of resisting these same kinds of data gathering</text>

For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. In many cases, the actions of the users who create and use the Internet are subverted by these data capture and processing platforms. Thus, the concept of the ‘open internet’ becomes as relevant today as it was in 1995. 	However, the open internet doesn’t just mean the webpages and services of the web; it also means the underlying infrastructure of the web, which includes but is not limited to domain names, IP addresses, transport protocols, and programming languages; and it particularly means the protocol stacks involved in routing information and data between the various components of the web. 	Thus, the term  	internet is often used to refer to the underlying protocols and coding systems involved in routing information and data, but it is also used in a number of other ways. For instance, when in San Francisco, California, the name of a company called Algo-ライゴアルバスタン is mentioned in passing, a reader might assume that the</text>

For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. Consequently, the need for user input becomes ever more crucial in the service of maintaining user convenience and in turn, in line with this need, the need for data-gathering becomes ever more apparent. Hence the need for ‘intelligent traffic analyzers’ that can detect and categorize subversives and non-state actors – indeed, anything that threatens to disrupt the capitalist flow of traffic – and that can then be used to subvert the flow of data in order to meet ever more demanding user needs. 	In addition to this need for sophisticated traffic-calibrating devices, users also need tools and interfaces that can be browsed, referenced and accessed – tools that can be designed to be used, and not in a way that endangers life as we know it. This last requirement is what James Hillman would now call the ‘interface cult’.1 It is a cult of access, and its adherents are besotted by access. They believe that a</text>

In this ever-changing interface, actions are rendered more and more ambiguous, and interpretations are given to seemingly innocuous behaviours. At the same time, this interface seeks to adapt itself to these ever-changing requirements, and to meet the ever-larging needs of its users. Thus, the contemporary interface can be understood as a system that continuously builds itself, in the sense that it is continually on the lookout for ways to improve itself in order to meet ever more demanding user needs. 	In this context, the increasing proliferation of data capture and processing becomes ever more apparent, and even troubling. 	For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. Such is the Internet’s alleged smart contract: whenever an entity performs an action, such as clicking a link, a contract is formed between the clicking entity and a number of subverted social, legal and political actors (organisations, non-profits, foundations, law enforcement etc). 	Such behaviour has become the norm, not the exception. In addition, the proliferation of data capture devices and processing apparatuses is fuelling a feedback loop: devices like Google’s Android operating system and Facebook’s Facebook app, which continuously gather and share user data, continually ask users to give them more, constantly make anonymous ­­ calls, and generally become more and more advanced in their behaviours, are examples of this. 	What users do with this data is largely governed by third parties, including but not limited to social networks and advertising networks. Nevertheless, the fundamental structure of the contemporary interface remains largely undefined. This is why user-centred interfaces are vulnerable to the built</text>

For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. In the interest of national security, state actors are often encouraged to undertake engineering and network analysis to better understand the ways in which new technologies can be used, and how to subvert them in order to serve their interests. 	In these analyses, the interests of the state are often exaggerated in order to serve corporate agendas. For instance, in the wake of the World Wide Web Consortium’s work, which sought to standardize a way to categorize electronic data, the Internet Corporation Council (IC) embarked on a research project in order to better understand the ways in which the new technology could be used to subvert open and democratic standards-setting. 	The results of these projects are used to justify the deployment of new technologies that do not take into account the diverse points of view and interests of the users of the networks. In other words, they can serve the interests of major international corporations while failing to represent the needs and perspectives of the communities that they are trying to connect with or</text>

For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. Thus, there is a growing consensus that the Internet must be monitored and controlled in some way in order to maintain a robust and user-friendly interface. 	Similarly, app markets must be regulated in some way in order to ensure that the functions of the app are properly defined and appended to the web site, and thus, the World Wide Web, in its current form, becomes ever more state-dependent. 	In order to fully understand and use the potentialities of this emerging ubiquity of data capture and processing, one must understand how the new technologies that pervade all online contemporary interaction will be different from the old ways of interacting. This will require understanding how human beings are engineered to process massive amounts of data, and how this new interface layer is created.  	Such understanding and utility will become evident only when the socio-political context of the interface is thoroughly contextualized[1] – – whereas now, the only way to understand and use the new</text>

For instance, it is becoming increasingly evident that all traffic on the Internet is captured and processed in ways that are nearly always subverted by state actors and corporate intelligence services. Most websites today are hosted either by servers based in the US or in European cities, and thus US citizens are among the most vulnerable users of the Internet today. Many other users of the Internet are unaware that their online behaviour is being recorded and subverted. 	In response to this growing surveillance state, users are turning to sites that operate in a parallel universe – virtual private networks (VPNs) and proxy servers – that obscure their online footprints and allow sites to be visited anonymously. These steps take place at a moment when the surveillance state is actively engaged in trying to undermine online freedom and user empowerment. It is highly likely that the aims of the state in its relentless quest for data will be realized only when the socio-political conditions necessary to sustain such a surveillance state collapse. 	Finally, in part because of the massive amounts of data generated and transmitted online, it is increasingly clear that the social costs of the interface are significantly underestimated.

They are not ‘authorized’ for use in the museum, but they can offer an alternative context or perspective that is relevant to the museum’s mission.

This is particularly true for those subjects that are usually taught as part of a syllabus or as supplementary subjects in a regular art course: cinematography, art history, visual systems design, computer systems design, games, animation, media arts, interactive media and design. The question is whether a subject matter studies programme that is fully integrated into the institution’s framework can produce culturally responsive work. It seems obvious that the introduction of computer programming into a subject matter studies programme would be a good fit, since programming is a relatively new discipline with a wide range of vocabularies and a clear comprehension of how to use tools. It would also be a good fit with the Digital Arts Initiative’s mission to encourage the inclusion of art and creative people in the creation of digital media, since programming is a relatively new skill and subject matter studies prepares students for this role</text>

There is no such thing as a ‘culturally responsive art’, nor does there exist such a thing as a ‘cultural tourism’. Digital Arts means engaging with art online or in person, and in this context it can also mean engaging with art through social media, art-search engines, art blogs and other online sources. Digital art is art that is created and delivered at a scale and with the impact that the user community desires. It is art with cultural connotations and does not necessarily fit within the parameters of the museum or gallery that measure art against established art forms. The difficulty for curators is that art today is delivered at such a scale and with such impact that it is difficult to know what art would be like if it came from a museum or gallery. So how do you engage with that impact? I believe that the answer is to create a site that is meaningful to the people who use it, and to incorporate cultural practices that are not</text>

However, a preference will be given to institutions that have a proven track record of producing artists capable of developing sustainable careers, or institutions that are willing to put in the necessary resources to support an artist’s development while enabling that artist to effectively participate in her or his community.  	In order to be eligible for funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), an institution must demonstrate an increase in: (1) Cultural Capital, (2) Inclusion, (3) Production Capacity and (4) Outstanding Impact, as measured by a composite of the following: Arts, culture, lifestyle, arts education, promotion, and circulation.

There is no one true way to develop a Curatorial Project, and no set formula that will translate directly into becoming a Museum of Modern Art, DAL or Museum of Modern Art Digital Arts Program. Each has its own unique culture and art-historical context. Each needs to be developed in consultation with the other, and then executed in tandem. Each has their own unique way of engaging with art, and each has their own unique way of connecting to the art world. This process can be destabilizing, as any generation of artists can learn and experience new curatorial practices, and some may find that their own pedagogical practices were not lived up to the expectations of a particular age group, but they all make different demands. It’s the imperfections of the curatorial: the language, the assumptions, the assumptions about what counts as art, what is considered worthy of veneration – all of which can be challenged, and which generation of curators will have</text>

It is not a given that a course in the Digital Arts Program would address the cultural dynamics of the 21st century, although both the artist and the viewer would benefit from knowledge of the technologies that create and consume culture today. Courses in the Digital Arts Program might provide a starting point for further inquiry, but they are not a presentation of fact, nor a place of control. They are an invitation to action, and the platform to carry out what I believe to be an important and potentially transformational social task: changing the dynamic between public and private in a manner that positively influences cultural practices, institutions and the world around us. I believe that the social, political and cultural qualities that distinguish contemporary art from other artistic forms are waning, and that art today is more like a commodity: there is a market for art produced by and for corporate interests, and the social, economic and political conditions that enable artists to create socially engaged art are being eroded.

Graduates of the program in DAL and the DAP may continue to pursue residencies in museum-based art-making or gallery-based art-making. The core mission of the online content provider is 'to connect, to make life beautiful, to connect fast and to have a party all the time’. It is not clear what this means in the context of the Museum of Modern Art’s curatorial agenda or its curatorial priorities. My understanding is that the Museum of Modern Art is committed to the development of an equitable sharing of resources, with a strong emphasis on the sharing of knowledge, especially in the public domain. So I see an opportunity here to participate in a mutually beneficial way in the development of a cultural infrastructure through which the Museum of Modern Art can contribute to the wellbeing of as many people as possible.

Courses in the Digital Arts Program may or may not be ‘curated‘ by an institution, and the institution’s relationship to an artist is rarely explicit, although many artists would strongly support the institution’s involvement. For the record, the Museum of Modern Art has never publicly commented on a proposal by an artist to co-produce a course, although it is quite evident that many artists have their own distinct ideas about how the museum should operate.  The other important element is the availability of funds. The Museum of Modern Art has a long-term investment in its collection, and it is quite evident that the Museum of Modern Art is interested in how its collection is utilized, and how it supports the Museum of Modern Art’s ongoing mission of disseminating art worldwide. In recent years, the Museum of Modern Art has actively sought to acquire cultural property in order to support the ongoing value of the buildings it occupies, and has actively solicited</text>

The key is that the curator has clearly defined the field of work that is to be addressed, and that the art is addressed. For example, the Digital Arts Initiative has a research agenda that includes understanding how digital technology affects the art form and the relationship between artist and audience. DAL provides resources for artists to get involved in the research agenda, such as funding bodies, publications, exhibition catalogue development etc. The Museum of Modern Art is an entity distinct from the DAL, and is responsible for the artworks produced through its programmes, which include the Museum of Modern Art Digital Arts Lab (DALABL) and the Museum of Modern Art Digital Arts Program (DAP), as well as the artworks produced through the DAILY NEWSLETTER. The digital arts programme is a ‘time-based practice’, with new entrant artists invited into the programme at regular intervals over the course of the development of their careers – often over a period of years.

Curators must have a minimum of ten years of experience working in art museums or other art institution settings. It is expected that curators have exceptional knowledge, skills, and/or analytic skills, but it is not required. The key is that the museum or institution has the power and responsibility to create a learning environment that is conducive to the skills of the curator. It is also expected that the network has the capacity to support the network in its mission to disseminate knowledge, but more is preferable. The Museum of Modern Art in New York maintains a Network Science Working Group, which meets monthly, and is led by Professors Jacqueline Rayner and Olafur Eliade. Its mission is to foster network culture and develop skills necessary for network culture to permeate the institution. The Digital Arts Program�</text>
