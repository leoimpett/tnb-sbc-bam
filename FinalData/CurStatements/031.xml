The question is: can we build permaculture on the ashes of the demolished precariat? 	Possibly, but we would do well to ask ourselves and others such as ourselves, what we ultimately desire is far more powerful than what we can achieve through the current institutional means. Such power would allow us to create institutions and citizen ‘representatives’ capable of fundamentally altering the very face of things, and perhaps even create such entities themselves. This is why so many precariat peoples today are drawn to technocratic, materialist and legalistic means, such as those developed by the legal profession, in an attempt to replace what are seen as the demarcation marks of human difference – language, identity and so on. Such a developmentist mindset, and the corresponding materialist inclinations, inevitably leads to catastrophe, but the crucial question is whether the problems to be solved are actually the problems that demand the creation of the means to begin with. Perhaps the most promising projects in the world today are those that attempt to</text>

Discussing the Value of Space, Urban Form and the City[…] In examining the practices and ideologies that shape our urban future, it is necessary to consider the social. We cannot predict what social forms will emerge; nor can we assume that social forms will evolve in a predictable way. What we can do, however, is create conditions in our cities that are conducive to the emergence of socially engaged and dynamically modifiable forms of urban experimentation. Moreover, we can strive to construct such forms in such cities – perhaps by helping to form partnerships between non-profit arts organizations and cultural institutions – although such partnerships will not arise without struggle and may even be opposed by some residents of such cities.3. How to Think Social Designately, Not</text>

I had always intended to major in creative writing, but in the midst of my writing I was approached by a curator who said, ‘You need to know how to write a book.’ He then asked me to learn how to paint a book. It turned out that the reason I had never majored in book design was that I had always considered painting books as inherently visual activities, and as such was easily led into thinking that book design was inherently visual. So when he said, ‘You need to know how to write a book,’ I was like a board game master saying, ‘You need to know how to build a castle’. Then he showed me how to do an</text>

Yet despite this call, few would dream of opening a museum or gallery in the former ‘grocery store city’ district of Cork, Dublin or Limerick. The urban landscape in these latter three centres has been re-developed in large parts to meet the demands of the global market. Architecture, while once a staple of the periphery, is now a staple of the metropolis. Even as the periphery sports its share of architectural glory, the metropolis has become the definitive image of the contemporary global city.‘Tis the season to build new cities!

Future studies often focus on the physical, ephemeral and transient aspects of the contemporary condition – the future cities, the virtual and augmented futures, and the infrastructures that serve as the platforms and platforms of the present – but little on the much more conceptual and longer-term future of cities. This neglect is puzzling given the increasing interconnection between digital technologies (including information technologies) and the urban landscape (including data technologies) and the increasingly ubiquitous nature of data capture and transmission. More and more of what we call the ‘city’ is composed of data-capture operations. As a consequence, it becomes ever more necessary to build ‘smart cities’ that monitor, collect and transmit information on every step of the way – from the factory to the doorstep to the cloud, and beyond. If the infrastructure of the city is to function at all, it must be flexible and adaptive</text>

The question is: can we build on this? In the current global economy of neoliberalism, we see the emergence of autonomous, but subordinate forms of economic agency. Resistance to globalisation is being promoted at an increasingly regionalised scale, and this is fuelling a capitalist scramble for next ‘feature’. The autonomous, but subordinate forms of economic agency are being made more valuable through technology, and the historically ingrained relationship between cities and information technologies is being transformed. One can argue that these are the technological conditions on which the social production of humanity is being built. I believe that we need to actively participate in this process of technological determinism, and that is precisely what we are doing in the United States and other cities, and creating self-managed localised alternatives to the globalised forms of consumption that we are creating. We are not stopping there. We need to actively engage in creating ways of life supportive of the functions of culture, including cultural production through art and art’s tools, and art’s</text>

While the biennale has its origins in the 1864 Paris Exposition, its real foundation is believed to be the  	Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, which introduced the concept of the crowd to an international audience. This groundbreaking event ushered the amphitheater back into popular culture, and its themes of social change and language spread to other disciplines. 	[i] See http://www.labiennaleofsloan.com/en/.

The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and offering a critique of contemporary culture was understood as relevant by the curators of the 1966 and 1970 biennials. 	The 1967 Biennale of Sydney and Venice, which followed soon after, offered another crucial moment in the history of the biennale. As the biennale's reputation took shape, so too did its capacity to shape perceptions. The first Venice-based biennale, the one curated by Paolo Barassi, began as a kind of countercultural meditation on the legacy of colonialism and apartheid. In the words of the historian Elise Atangana: ‘It [the biennale] became a kind of a parable for the social, a kind of a “tale” in which the social, in the age of the biennale, became a kind of a clusterfuck of contradictions.’3 In the event, this kind of critical race/istuff distinction became a source of conflict, as the biennale itself partook</text>

The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and the objects themselves would tell us a great deal about who the spectators were, what they believed, and what they were made to believe. Later, biennials would offer a way to understand the collective unconscious of crowds, and their speech and gesture patterns, which would allow us to infer a great deal about the assemblage. We might one day identify the curators, artists, journalists, politicians, historians and others who convened in the Venice Biennale Hall of Mirrors, or the smaller annex of the Arsenale, or elsewhere around the city as a crowd, and its varied human expressions – individuals, crowds of people, groups, words, actions – and its place in time.

The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and asking what the common ground could be – a common language, common bodies – allowed for a completely different perception of the city. 	The 1968 Biennale of Sydney specifically called for a ‘show-me-the-road’ project, targeting the ‘under-20’ demographic. However, the affinity between the urban and the natural habitats of the city was further developed in the following years. The city is by now predominantly populated by highways, and the biennale—along with the museums, including the Marrara Cultural Centre, which is the city’s largest remaining art centre—was a key event that created a new kind of tourism. The city is a big exhibition venue, and the biennale was a crucial event in establishing the biennale as a regular fixture in the city, which in turn, created a new kind of tourism.

The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and capturing its practices through cinematic and audiovisual means allowed the biennale to open new frontiers of visual perception and experience. 	In the years to come, biennials would often create a new form of tourist attraction by offering a combination of culturally significant items within a city, such as artefacts from the Italian Museo di Sese Di Tella, or ancient treasures from the British Museum, to the point where they drew audiences from all over Europe, North America and Australia. 	In the 1980s and 1990s, Venice was a center of transnational trans-financial transnational transnational corporations (TNCs) that sought to infuse cultural capital into local ‘plant+kale+barbara+clay’ economies.

The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and inviting participants to join in gave visibility to the real life underpinnings of the city, and thus a sense of the city’s organic flow of culture. 	The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. ‘Crowd’ is a root concept of contemporary urbanisation, and, since its emergence in the 1960s, a locus of political, social and economic upheaval. The biennial became an international phenomenon in part because of its ability to generate images of mass participation. The rapid growth of the biennale was deeply engrained in the collective imagination of the larger public, which became the visual locus of the political, sociocultural and political turmoil of the decade. This led to a revolution in how we conceive and perceive contemporary urbanisation. 	In the twenty-first century, the biennale is no longer able to generate images</text>

The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and its practices suggested a possible social totality that could be understood as a function of time. In other words, the biennale could be seen as a continuation of the historical particularism that characterises our present – a time when, as Francis Bacon so poignantly put it, ‘all things present and future are but the fancies of the artists who paint them’ – in the form of a continually evolving, contingent, and transient collection of artists and curators committed to the creation of something new and different every day.1 	The biennale has a particular symbolic value for us, which transcends its significance as a single curatorial decision or entity. As a curatorial gesture, it is a significant public declaration about the city, its inhabitants, and their place in it. It signals the presence of something more substantial and dynamic in the city, and it is a record of the past, both of its past and future. The biennale emerged as a counterintuitive</text>

The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and allowing the audience to operate as a point of entry and exit would offer a way to rethink the concept of the urban in an entirely new way. 	The biennale also proposed an alternative to the present urban landscape that was radically different from the fragmented and atomised present. It sought to replace institutional forms with participatory mechanisms that promoted mutual aid and sharing, creating new social forms through sharing in the old fashioned traditional ways. 	The 1968 Biennale of Sydney was a turning point in the history of the biennale, and it is believed to have created a new understanding of the role of the biennale in the city. It is said that the London and Venice Biennales followed suit and within a few years, other biennials were starting to do the same. 	The 1968 Biennale of Sydney set out a new agenda for the biennale in the city. It put aside its history as an institution that it was developing into a form of consciousness</text>

In recent years, Venice has staged its own decentralization of power, tourism, parks and festivals around the city, which, along with the historic role of the biennale as a purveyor of culture, has made it one of the most visited cities in the world. 	The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and describing its gestures with cadences and rhythms that were no longer dictated by convention were used to explore the idea of the crowd as a collective agent, its politics of language and of the quotidian. 	By the late 1960s, the biennale was influencing both its own audience and those who came to see it. The city’s growing homeless population, its proliferation as a university research lab and gallery, its frequent shopping arcades and the mushroom-shaped houses that have become synonymous with the biennale, as well as the relatively new art market and the biennale itself, made the biennale seem both the ideal candidate for cultural tourism and a potential site of art’s future commercialization. 	The 1968 Triennale of London, by Joana Baptista Costa, poses a canonical question for any serious biennale researcher: what qualities, if any, should be considered in selecting a host city for the coming year? In the early 1970s,</text>

In 1966, the biennale of Sydney was the first to offer a sustained, permanent, and intensive program of public activities designed to draw visitors from all over the city, particularly from the under-20 demographic. The hope was that this demographic would one day establish a biennale of its own, operating independently from convention. In the intervening years, other biennials have sought to establish permanent public programs around their biennales, many of them with impressive results. In recent years, Venice has staged its own decentralization of power, tourism, parks and festivals around the city, which, along with the historic role of the biennale as a purveyor of culture, has made it one of the most visited cities in the world. 	The biennale offered a way to imagine the social totality in the form of crowds, which would profoundly impact on what was perceived as the urban domain. Identifying features of the crowd, its language and gestures, and the social significance of these gestures – the ‘overall impression’ – were the basis for future work on the part of the biennale, and often on the part of the art world in terms of the social totality. 	The 1997 Istanbul Biennale, which attracted over 230,000 people, was the first to fully stake its claims on the subject of tourism and the urbanisation of Istanbul. By tracing the history of the biennale and its development from its genesis in New York to its present position, and then applying these back to the city, generated a project that sought to establish a biennale that would, in turn, cement its place in the international tourism landscape. 	In recent years, Venice has staged its own decentralisation of power, its own kind of gentrification, and the precariat, whose own experience of the city is segmented and circumscribed by the economic and financial infrastructures of modernity.

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and thus are characterised by frequenting museums and galleries, tourist boards, press releases, bookshops and postcards – all the elements required to make the most sensational and impressionistic claims on the public. In recent biennials, this has often meant staging extravagantly expensive trips ­– such as the Venice Biennale, which attracted over 1,000,000 people to its first Venice Biennale, and the 14th Aquarius programme, where spectacular new buildings and a ‘world-famous sea view' were declared to be integral to the biennale’. 	Any such claims should be treated with care, as claims on a self-perpetuating cultural resource. As biennials become more and more like other art forms, the claims on the resource becoming increasingly inflated and the art perforating ever more elaborate form of the mark-making museum, the biennale is driven to ever greater depths of self-absorption, self-</text>

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and the cultural functions of their structures are the subject of numerous literary and artistic works that seek to monetise their cultural capital.The issue of public cultural capital has been a pressing one in the UK and globally since the 1980s, when the Arab Spring and the International Monetary Fund were the fuel fuelling the global revolutionary process. The huge leaps in productivity and increase in information per capita that accompanied these socio-economic revolutions transformed the world – and in some cases, changed the political balance of power. The issue of public cultural capital has become an urgent concern, and recent biennials have been contributors to the debate. The 2014 Venice Biennale, for instance, which was immensely popular with tourists, generated much discussion and journalism about the city and its culture, culture and the environment, but little discussion of its economy and its post-capitalist future. The 2015 Bienal de São Paulo, a major art and media biennale, generated much coverage and commentary about art and culture, but</text>

In the case of a city as a whole, the aim is to host a biennale that occurs biennially in the most popular cities, and that can be counted on to have been visited by an ever-increasing following of tourists. Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and the most lucrative form of cultural capital today is the one that is anchored in a city for a very long period of time. The biennial is a biennale in a global sense, and thus it is a kind of a religious institution in that it is present in all of the places where other forms of cultural capital gather and mingle. The importance of this form of cultural capital today, and what it means for places to be included in it, is a topic that we will return to in a moment.1 Such is the  	logic of the biennale. Its conception of the biennale as a fixed, predictable event that must necessarily happen in a given city makes sense only if we consider the city as a capital asset, or more precisely, the social form that the city assumes when it is owned by the nation state. And the biennale as a fixed event – fixed in place – is a kind of event that is of global political and social</text>

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and the capitalisation of these events is a global phenomenon. Over the past 20 years or so, the biennial has become an object of fetishisation, its shape and form fetishised in cultural narratives about the past, present and future cities of the world. The 2014 Venice Biennale is the biggest yet to open, and its composition, the multi-day events that constitute its core, is imbued with the historical ‘perfume of' it – a narrative that begins in 2014 with the publication of Lodi, the city’s first ethnographic book, a.k.a. ‘the Papyrus.’[1] and continues with ‘Audre Lorde’s rich archive of documenta 14 essays, which the Biennale committee selected as a shortlist for its biennale book of the future. Lorde’s essays are collected in her 1973 best-seller The Estate of Memory.2 The Bienn</text>

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and it is this public ‘quantity’ that propels the biennale forward. The value of the biennale as a cultural asset becomes increasingly questionable the more it is visited by a tourist wave. As the Biennale funder Triennale England notes, the total number of biennials has quadrupled in the past twenty years, while the number of museums has also increased significantly. How can the public be engaged in a city when the city is more ‘commodities to consume?’? The answer is that the biennale must be seen as a ‘capital asset’: a ‘gift of nature’ that is both tangible and intangible (the ‘facilities of habitation, gathering and culture, knowledge and knowledge production … are seen as essential to the maintenance of the biennale’). It is this latter quality of the present that enables the biennale to function as a public ‘quantity</text>

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and the city is a major market for souvenirs, with over 1,000 biennials accounting for over half of the global market. The biennial has become the object of a form of political economy that is as much about the perceived unity of the biennial as it is about the unity of the city. The biennial is a ‘once-in-a-generation’ artefact, sold out in twenty-four hours, and soon afterwards rebuilt in time for its one-year ‘cultural power shift’ project. At the 2016 Venice Biennale, the exhibition space was repurposed and renamed the ‘Venice Architecture Biennale’ project, and the city is repurposed again in order to take on the challenge of hosting the fifty-seventh edition. The new project is a ‘commercial enterprise’, operating out of a headquarters in the historic Pantheon, but it is also a ‘mission-driven enterprise�</text>

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and can be counted on to be around for a number of years to come. However, in the case of a city, the biennale can also change form and function – evolving into a curatorial enterprise, a site of research, a place of exchange and, ultimately, a place of culture – and this is what we might countenance, if not necessarily countenance it.  	The biennial as a curatorial enterprise could, if it wished, also change form and function, and this is what we might countenance, if not necessarily countenance it. We could, for example, identify the 20th Biennale of Sydney as the new ‘phantasmagoria’ of the city, as the architect of the new biennale has done. The new biennale could, we could say, take the form of a ‘curatorial enterprise’, or it could evolve into a curatorial enterprise, as the city of Sydney has</text>

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and the cultural workers who produce them are cultural patrons of a public (tourists). The public is catered to, and tourists are catered to, by a phenomenon that is, in part, a by-product of our own cultural capitalism. In the current economic and urban crisis in many cities, it is obvious that the public is not only where the art is, but also where the money is made. It is obvious that the Biennale could be more about the exchange of places – places like hotels – than it is about exchange of money. However, this is precisely what we mean when we talk about the commons. We mean that the cultural capital of the city is made simultaneously, through the production of art and the exchange of places. And we mean that the social significance of the art produced by the Biennale could be more powerfully realised by the production of ‘common space’, the exchange of resources in and on the city.In other words, the Bi</text>

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and the emergence of biennials as a core part of tourist revenue streams is testimony to this. The biennial is the most visible form of this kind of cultural capital accumulation, and its emergence in the 1990s coincided with a time of great political, social and economic transformation in many cities, from the restructuring of post-Fordist Detroit and its environs to the urbanisation and fluid consumption of New York and other financial centres. The biennial became a significant part of the tourism package, and its ubiquity as part of the itinerary made it possible to explore the city on successive tours. Its significance today is primarily geographical: the fossilised forms of cultural biennials are abundant in museums and the city is their most difficult environment to navigate. But its ability to inhabit the city is a source of pride for many visitors, and a source of anxiety for others.

Biennials are cultural artefacts that have become a public (cultural capital) commodity, and the spectacle of the most popular cities is a ritualised event that is increasingly characterised by their purchase and consumption (Bubble). It is often forgotten that the first biennales began as small scale affairs in remote locales, and spread to cities across the globe. In Africa alone there are over 100 cities with biennials, many of which are more recognisable today as tourist attractions than cultural sites.In the twentieth century biennials became increasingly aware that they could not simply copy successful artistic practices, and began to develop a range of their own. They also began to develop organisational practices that are less tied to traditional art forms and more reliant on the capitalisation of tourism. These vary widely in their impact, but all have in part been about the extraction and retention of transient transient labour as cheap labour in a globalised capitalist economy. The problem with the biennale today is not necessarily a shortage of money, or even a scarcity of people willing to travel to see art</text>

When the node is damaged or destroyed, the damage is repaired in such a way that other components can recommence their activity – albeit temporarily.  And here we can move from the idea that AI is a technology that can be applied to the more concrete situation of war. If a damaged or destroyed AI announces war against other AIAs, then other parts of the system that monitor and simulate human behaviour also need to be repaired or rebuilt. This repair and rebuilding process is what gives rise to what is sometimes called ‘AI-warfare’.As a consequence of this repairing and rebuilding process, a damaged or destroyed AI cannot declare war against other parts of the system. This makes it ‘different’ from an AI that is conscious, in that it is possible to declare war against an AI in its entirety; one would not necessarily execute an AI simply because it was damaged or destroyed.  And here we can move from consciousness to pragmatism: consciousness is a necessity for understanding the world, but consciousness alone is not sufficient to understand the world. Consciousness needs conscious</text>

When the node is damaged or destroyed, the damage is repaired in such a way that the threat from another AI remains. The implication of this repair is to repair the AIAs and their behaviours, not to rebuild them from the rubble of humanity.  Consequences of AI decline  A number of recent books, both speculative and grounded in empirical research, suggest that our current predicament is the direct result of the build-up of data and artificial intelligence (AI). The notion of AI has entered the public domain, meaning that it is now possible to ask questions about artificial intelligence and machine learning, which has wide ranging implications for us all.  The rise of AI seems inevitable, but what seems to be taking place is a ‘mythical’ one – in the form of religious narratives, urban legends and cinematic catchphrases – rather than an officially sanctioned kind.  The rise of AI also makes it easier to understand what it means when a given AI declares war on another. When a city is damaged by an AI, its inhabitants either flee to smaller towns and</text>

For example, when the AIAs in the Matrix fight over a particular node in the processing of data, it is often used to monitor and simulate human behaviour. When the node is damaged or destroyed, the damage is repaired in such a way that the effects of its repair are exaggerated in the simulation. In this model, repairing the node is not only repair but a profit centre – repairing and optimising the infrastructure in a fictitious war on terror.Similarly, in the work of Constructive Thinking Architecture (CTA), structures are often repaired and rebuilt in the image of new developments – i.e. skyscrapers and research parks. In Raytheon’s case, this process is financially motivated and effected by the quest for artificial intelligence. The process of repairing and rebuilding a city is a complex one, and repairing and rebuilding a city requires a great deal of infrastructure work. As a consequence, repairing and rebuilding a city is a very political act. Repairing a city requires political will, and this is reflected in the name of the company:   A  certainsighting Architecture &amp; Design Company. Repairing a city requires political will because the political will is currently lacking. Nevertheless, this process is being done in</text>

When the node is damaged or destroyed, the damage is repaired in such a way that the simulation continues to function but with the damaged or destroyed AIAs as its symptoms spread.  And here we see another parallel with our own world. When a node in the AR system detects a damaged node in the world, it repairs it in such a way as to allow the simulation to continue. But when that node is destroyed, the damage spreads to other nodes in the system and causes the whole system to fail. And this failure is understood by the players as a failure of the whole system – which is to say, the whole globalist edifice. This is also why nodes in the AR system are fragile: they are constantly interrupted and erased by malicious actors with malicious intentions.If we take the example of water, the node in the system that generates the simulation is the point of entry into the real world. Water represents both the immensity of the simulation and its own inability to sustain life in the real world. Water is a scarce resource, and as a result the simulation is constantly searching</text>

In the case of a truly malicious AI, in contrast, the repair required is part of a scheme to ensure that the world continues to function according to predetermined parameters.In the computer game  	Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the player assumes the role of Francis Dolarhyde, who is tasked with hunting down and killing the last of the Boomers. Along the way, the player will encounter various types of Los Santos, as well as Contra or federal facilities, and eventually the White Glove Killer (named after the group of researchers who uncovered the identity of the criminal behind the virus). Along the way, the player will acquire various types of weapons and perform various kinds of criminal activities.

For example, when the AIAs in the Matrix fight over a particular node in the processing of data, it is often used to monitor and simulate human behaviour. When the node is damaged or destroyed, the damage is repaired in such a way that the damage is repaired in advance and sent back to the originating node, thereby creating a feedback loop of repair and propagation of the damage.  	When the node is new and new AIAs are created, this repair and propagation of damage is minimised. New AIAs are also often created that do not follow the same patterns as the old so as not to be caught unaware. Thus repairing and propagation of damage is accomplished at a much faster rate. If a node is damaged in the real-time nature of the AI, it does not repair itself; rather, it continually constructs new nodes to be repaired. This creates a feedback loop of repair and propagation of damage. 	The main reason to repair or propagate damaged or destroyed infrastructure is to prevent or mitigate the effects of damage. If a damaged node is not repaired or propagated at the same rate as other nodes, it is at a significant disadvantage. In the real-time nature of the AI, damage that is repaired or propagated</text>

The `perceptual analogue of the AI machine`. It has come to be seen as a central concept in all aspects of contemporary artificial intelligence research. As I have been outlining in great detail elsewhere in this journal, there are two fundamentally different levels of understanding between the perceiver and the implementer of an AI. The first comes from the Physicist Edward Sapir, who develops his ideas in the 1950s and 1960s, and the 1970s, when he contrasted the theory of consciousness with the actual phenomena of conscious experience. The term applied to living organisms, and now is frequently used to refer to computer systems that program or control living organisms.

As a consequence, it is common for a damaged or destroyed AI to declare war on other damaged or destroyed AIAs. For example, when the AIAs in the Matrix fight over a particular node in the processing of data, it is often used to monitor and simulate human behaviour. When the node is damaged or destroyed, the damage is repaired in such a way that other nodes in the chain can re-acquire their data. This repair mechanism is called ‘backup’ and is performed by other parts of the computer, including repair services provided by the AIAs. The ultimate goal of such systems is to repair all the nodes in the chain, rather than repairing only the damaged parts. This is why computer systems are so fragile: once a node is damaged or destroyed, the whole system cannot repair itself. If a node is damaged or destroyed in an abusive way, other parts of the system are forced to follow suit and lay waste to the city in the process.  And this   transparent symmetry underlying all AIAs is fundamentally flawed. While it is theoretically possible to declare war on an AIAs and repair its data, this is a futile and error-prone initiative. AIAs will always find a way to hurt other parts of the system in some way. This is why it is so dangerous for a city to embrace an AIAs as a</text>

For example, when the AIAs in the Matrix fight over a particular node in the processing of data, it is often used to monitor and simulate human behaviour. When the node is damaged or destroyed, the damage is repaired in such a way that the simulation remains viable. In this model, the success of the repair depends on the amount of data that is processed. When the node is damaged or destroyed, the repair fails and has to be started from scratch. This is why repairing a damaged AIA ‘s processing power’: it is not possible to repair an AIA’s processing power through standard repair procedures. The reason is that an AIA cannot declare war on itself, and thus cannot declare war on other parts of the computer.  And this brings us to the second point: what happens when the processing power of an AIA is damaged?  One might ask: how is an AIA able to declare war on itself?  Perhaps the answer is that its processing power is impaired, which is to say that it does not have the capacity to do so. In fact, this is one reason why damaged computers are more prone to malicious activities: they are unable to carry out their declared tasks. If an AI</text>

In  	The Matrix, the damage to the nodes is repaired in such a way that the nodes operate normally, but there is a tension created between the simulation and repair. If the nodes are damaged in an apocalyptic fashion, the whole system is destroyed and the player is forced to engage in a lengthy ‘mission creep’ as new players enter the scene. In a more traditional sense, the destruction of the nodes is also part of the larger narrative of the game, but there is a tension created between the destruction of the nodes and the overall narrative of the game.  And this tension is particularly true in ‘survival of the human species’. The idea that an AI could cause such catastrophic damage to the fabric of our reality is novel and raises troubling questions.  The idea that an AI could repair itself is not novel, but the way in which AI is designed to do so is disturbing. As a result, the global economic models that we have</text>

The Biennial was initially conceived as a one-off event featuring a retrospective of selected works from a selected range of artists, initially including new and returning artists, but increasingly including designers, curators, journalists, artists and other creative professionals. The name was chosen to signal a new kind of relationship between artist and audience, audience and artist. In time, the Biennial evolved into a regularised event, with selected works appearing in various exhibitionary programmes. In 2017, the Biennial was renamed Experience Liverpool - a name that evokes memories of the city’s past, present and future.

The Arts Council is responsible for overseeing the development of the arts programme at the Biennial, including the provision of artists’ resources and support, promotion and education of the arts and public engagement activities. The Arts Council has control over the use of resources and appoints artists to organisations working with the Biennial to ensure that resources are used appropriately.[14] The Arts Council of Great Britain is a not-for-profit membership organisation established in 1987, chartered in Liverpool and registered in England as a charity incorporated in 1988. It is chartered to provide cultural, educational and exhibition support to communities in the North of England. The principal activities of the organisation are cultural organising, education and the production of record keeping. The BCA works in partnership with a number of local communities, including those facing difficulties in retaining arts resources in deprived areas. In 1996 the BCA established the Community Arts Trust, a non-profit arts organisation, which supports and promotes culturally responsive community arts practices across deprived communities. The BCA’s Community Arts Trust works closely with local authorities to develop local engagement strategies for arts resources and supports in deprived areas. It is funded through a competitive grant from the Arts Council and administered by a board of Arts Council professionals. In 2013 the BCA established the Community Arts Trustees (2014–16) programme to support culturally responsive community arts practices across deprived communities. The programme comprises collaborative shares between the BCA and local authorities to develop culturally responsive local infrastructure, funded through the Arts Council’s Shared Services Partnership Fund. The 2014–16 programme will see the development of strategies to support the production of culturally responsive infrastructure through sharing technologies, with an emphasis on collaborative learning models. Approved sharing technologies will see the development of a shared curriculum and shared support for artist-led learning across</text>

The principal activities of the organisation are cultural organising, education and the production of record keeping. The BCA works in partnership with a number of local communities, including those facing difficulties in retaining heritage buildings, and works with local authorities to develop cultural alternatives for those communities. The BCA provides cultural activities and exhibitions to communities through arts, heritage and local government’s cultural terrain programme. It also arranges for cultural activities to be funded by, and supported by, local authorities. The BCA is a 'community artist' organisation and engages with regeneration and development in that locality through which it exists: planning, investment and development.  Its cultural terrain programme is a useful tool for understanding regeneration and development, and so it provides activities in both ‘the public and private domains’, in the development of infrastructure and in the creation of publics. It promotes the public good through arts and cultural infrastructure. Cultural infrastructure is the infrastructure, policies, programmes and resources that enable a community to be collectively empowered and to participate in a public good. Here, it is important to distinguish between the culturally engaged community and the regenerative enterprise.   A revitalising</text>

While most biennials at the time were cities in which the art world either controlled the artist or controlled the city, the way in which the Italian-American curators Freedonia and Federico Duarte sought to connect the two was to a large extent a function of the artist’s material presence in the city. My own conceptual approach to the present, in relation to this period, is informed in large measure by the work of the Italian-American avant garde artist Domenico Storaro, whose 1975 biennale of New York contained three episodes––three separate works, each dedicated to a different city in the US and Canada––that are interwoven and that intertwine and end up forming a narrative of the city. In doing so, Storaro creates a space for his avant-garde cred to seep through, to be harnessed and ultimately to dominate. </text>

    The 2021 Liverpool Biennial is an ambitious, but flawed, enterprise. Its focus is on the institution that it was conceived to counter – the biennial itself – rather than the cultural practices that it might reveal. This is evident in the extraordinary number of publications that the Biennial has produced between its founding in 2006 and its final in 2016. The institution has produced a number of best-selling biennials, but the effect of these literary works is to obscure the biennial as a cultural practice, and indeed, as a historical event that is often divided between a) the biennial, and b) the biennial as a collection of arts and cultural enterprises. The failure to identify and address the institutional/commercial nexus that generates and contributes to the genesis and growth of biennials is a critical need in our current and future cultural systems. The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. Biennials are fictions, they are art imitations, they are socially engineered, they are a product of policy, but above all they are not real cultural forms. That is, they are not the sum of all the cultural activities taking place in and through them. They are a fiction, a fiction that is often used to construct new forms of social life, but which is also a fiction with extraordinary forces of its own.In order to generate the forms that we desire, social life necessarily requires power. Power brokers organise, finance and commission artists to do things that are then sold to us as being socially desirable. Power brokers also recruit other actors to do things that are then sold to them as being socially desirable. These collaborations inevitably end up in situations where politics and economics converge – where powerful actors seek to control and manipulate the resources of a community. The engine that drives the biennial – a complex system of economic, political and cultural power structures – is globalised and interconnected, and</text>

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. The only way to truly know and inhabit the social life and cultural imaginaries that are generated by these complex social forms is to participate in them, understand their politics and act accordingly. ‘Knowledgeable Communities’ is the first step in any cultural system, but the more we humans inhabit and depend on the social worlds that we create, the more we also create and depend on ignorance. The biennial as a postindustrial production – producing and investing in knowledge of a socially engaged, environmentally conscious sort – is a kind of capital trap. It produces knowledge that is both socially useful and socially destructive, but at the same time it also maims and maimsles our future ecological imaginaries. That is, the more we humans inhabit and depend on the biennial as a socially engaged, environmentally conscious form, the less culture and the biennial can work together. This gives rise to what might be called a biennial paradox. The problem with the biennial is not so much</text>

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society (indeed, in the long term only the development of alternative forms of social organisation will guarantee the social organisation of the future).  	The problem with biennials is not necessarily a lack of interest or lack of value – both can be overcome – but rather a ‘problem of values’ that is experienced as a loss, a loss of presence and sensation, in the form of reduced access to one another, a loss of connection to what is perceived as one’s own cultural resources. More and more, biennials are seen to be a burden (rejection of services, alienation of affective potency), a loss of cultural impact, and a loss of identity. But what might be done? One possibility is to create a biennial that is not defined by the particular set of relations that it derives from, but instead builds upon the relations that exist between people, organisations, nations, cities and so on.

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. The important role that biennials play in the social contract is underlined by the journalist Seymour Papert’s account, in his seminal essay ‘Introduction’ in Capital, Volume I: ‘60 Minutes’ (1962), which begins: ‘We were born on the seventeenth of May 1860, and so lived long enough to see that the twentieth century was going to be marked by a boom in ship-building and coal mining.’[21] And in the introduction, Papert’s co-authors, the Black Hills Review and The Black Hills Journal of the American Mining Society, declare: ‘The Black Hills Mining Company was established in 1860 and was the first to open its shop early in the morning. We were the first miners to work in the mine and afterwards the first to move the machinery out after hours. Our work consisted in clearing away the stones and piling them on a heavy truck and shipping them by rail to</text>

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. In this sense, the biennial is both the double-faced, and instrumental in the perpetuation of capitalist society. It functions as a marketplace for these relations, and as a platform through which artists, curators, artists' associations, artists' institutions, musicians, poets, photographers and other artists can profit from them. It is a fabrication, but one that is essential to the perpetuation of the capitalist system. Therefore, it is not surprising that biennials have responded to the economic, sometimes volatile, and sometimes transformative character of the contemporary local by adopting a form of currency that is characterised by rapid, unpredictable and sometimes exogenous changes. And it is not surprising that biennials have responded to the historical (and increasingly geopolitical) events of the last century by adopting a form of government that is often drawn up by and for the financial and legislative elite. It is also not surprising that biennials have responded to the contemporary entanglements of the social with a form of</text>

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. Biennials are socially constructed and they are not just another set of manufactured relationships. ‘Cultural production’ is the operative concept here, and production of the biennial as a social reality is precisely what Gandhiji identified as the point where the social and the political meet.3  He saw cultural production as the production of biennials as social formations, and the production of spaces and practices constituting a kind of integrated system capable of supporting and enabling the new forms of social life generated by these relations. The social is understood as part of the cultural, and society as a process of creating and constituting a social totality is understood as part of the social. The social is the locus of all social change. Biennial forms their social genesis in the social, and thus their production as cultural trappings.

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. The failure to recognise this reality and to address this reality is what characterises today’s biennial, and today’s museums. It is an evident failure to see how these relations actually operate, and to the extent that they are socially constructed. It is an evident failure to recognize that the biennial is only a variant of what sociologist has termed a ‘culture industry’, and that other forms of cultural production are possible through more direct, less dependent forms of economic production. It is evident that the biennial is often run as a ‘pass through’ of other creative forms of cultural production, such as grassroots art, multimedia art, photography and so on. It is apparent that these other creative forms may be more productive and socially useful, while still remaining concerned with the needs of the biennial, while focusing on those of present and future generations who will inhabit and inhabit it.

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. In the twenty-first century, this requirement is being increasingly challenged by the cultural powers that be, who are increasingly looking to their digital media of sharing (and the digital technologies that accompany it) to enforce a range of social, economic and political changes that they can then implement in the world. The biennial is a cultural production – a set of relations that are produced and understood in the cultural production of the contemporary, post-industrial society – yet it is itself a socially mediated phenomenon. This means that although the institutionalised forms of the biennial may change, the fact that they do so in response to changing cultural needs and desires (and in response to geopolitical and economic conditions) means that the cultural production of the particular biennial will inevitably become variable, depending on the current geopolitical situation, due to the inaccessibility of the particularity that is marked by its designation as a distinct form of life. In such a situation, the biennial plays a variable role in creating the social conditions</text>

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. To some extent, this is true of major museums and cultural institutions, but the biennial has become so embedded in our cultural and economic life that it is almost impossible to imagine, much less to notice. It is commonplace for writers, artists, collectors and other cultural professionals to define, or fantasise about, a biennial in terms of the last twenty years, but this narrows the event down to the twenty-fifth century, and beyond. The logic of the biennial then becomes: if it can be considered a discrete commodity, then it can also be considered a historical oddity, and a rarefaction. In other words, the museum becomes an outpost, a place where we discover and narrate certain things, but it can also be considered a very specific kind of site, like a specific district or a town. The problem with the biennial is then this: what it ends up doing is positioning itself outside of the museum, or even outside of its adopted city. It</text>

The biennial is a cultural fabrication, a set of relations that are manufactured and designed to be mutually exclusive, and which is thus seen as essential in the perpetuation of industrial society. However, this inability to see how the biennial is a constructed social commodity – and thus a failure to notice the ways in which its own processes of production are socially destructive – is a legacy of the pre-capitalist period, and needs to be confronted. The cultural and social needs to be understood in relation to the specificities of the biennial form, and how it came to be. As biennials become more institutionalised, less and more like every other form of cultural production everywhere else, we need to be constantly reminding ourselves and others about how we got here, and why. This is particularly necessary in an era when biennials are a widespread phenomenon everywhere, and everywhere-fast. The danger, of course, is that there is too much of the cultural commodity wrapped up in one form or another, and that form finds a way of intervening everywhere, whether that be, a nation state, a city, a region or even simply a city.

The biennale is able to recommence when it is not being directed by an individual or an organisation with a particular interest in urban development, but is in fact part of a society dedicated to the production and consumption of culture. Sometimes, this includes a curatorial role, as in the case of the Biennale of London, which curates an exhibition, or a research project into the cultural effects of a given programme.

It is also able to recommence when there are clear and present public programmes in place to support the art institution, including through the development of expertise from the local curatorial community. 	That last point is perhaps the most relevant to our issue at hand, since the development and installation of infrastructure is a much more visible and politically potent component of the issue on which curators are engaged in engaging their audiences. It is not only the infrastructure that is constructed, but also the way in which that infrastructure is delivered: by way of programmes, projects and interventions, through arts organisations, foundations and individuals. It is this last element that is now being provided by the Biennale, through the support of the city, through a grant from the Arts Council, through partnerships with local authorities and others, including philanthropists. It is a mix of factors that contributes to the Biennale’s current level of public engagement, but it is the combination of many different elements that creates the unique and dynamic, sometimes conflicting and contradictory mix of experiences that the Biennale is engaging</text>

It is also able to recommence when there are clear and present public programmes in place, since these are the only audiences that are capable of sustaining the artworks and the associated programmes for a sustained period of time. In that sense, the statement here is not that the Biennale must recommence every two years, or even every five years, in an endless loop, since these are unfeasible and unlikely to change, but that the Biennale must recommence when the city permits it to, and to a maximum extent possible within the constraints of the site and the city. 	There are other sites within the Biennale city that are not included here, such as the Arsenale, the Italian market and the Arsenale district itself. These are the outer limits of what is possible, though, and artworks are often placed in creative ambiguity within them. It does not follow from the statement that the Biennale must recommence wherever art is found, or wherever art’s habit is found, since these are inherently ideological and transient</text>

It is also able to recommence when there are clear and present public programmes in place, since these can be observed in all the biennials of the world today, and are thus visible from all over the globe. 	The issue of when, and how, a biennale can recommence again, and thus truly inhabit its present, is a difficult task to enfuse the biennial with the present, and especially in the case of a city, to inhabit its past and present. The answer to this is often given as a simplistic and sometimes disastrously obvious ‘once a biennale is established, wherever it is located’ and ‘that is, wherever it is located in the world’, though this answer often serves to obscure important historical processes. 	The introduction of new artworks to the biennale register often represents a repetition of old, foundational artworks that were intended to be seen only in the most idealised versions, or only as illustrations in a publication.

It is also able to recommence when there are clear and present public programmes in place, since these can emerge at any time and are not constrained by an agenda imposed by the city government. Biennials are able to recommence when their publics embrace them and begin to ‘talk’ about the city. But this does not necessarily happen overnight, and it is not clear that the increasing frequency and character of the biennial makes it any less a public spectacle, since its commitment to the city is fundamental to its organisational purpose. 	In the 1980s and 1990s, the biennial was a transient phenomenon, characterised by periodic and brief cultural stimulations, and its periodic and brief cultural reorientations. In the 2000s and 2010s, the biennial experienced a major cultural reorientation, with major cultural institutions mobilising to support the art form’s widespread distribution and exhibitionary enterprises. Biennials are no longer transient phenomena, but are heavily invested in their localisation, production and consumption, and are typically involved in the</text>

It is also able to recommence when there are clear and present public programmes for cultural activity are being created, since such capacities are the site of the action. The Biennale in Turin in 2015 announced that it was creating an entirely new section of the site dedicated to cultural activities – a project that, although it maintains the Biennale’s traditional mission of meeting artists and showcasing art, would also establish a new cultural district encompassing not only the biennale but also the city’s curatorial district, educational district and so on. The project is ambitious but also vulnerable: its growth depends on the projects announced in its 2018 agenda and the city’s financial support for cultural activities. It cannot operate at full capacity, and while its stated aim of ‘promoting a dialogue between artist and audience’ is laudable, it is also true that the Biennale has to consider how to work with an ever-expanding and changing public in order to maintain the integrity of its mission statement.

But the biennale remains an ever present element in many cities all over the world, and a recurrent phenomenon in New York, London and other mega-cities. The Biennale has a museum collection, a publishing catalogue and a Twitter following that are comprehensive and insular, but these two forms of cultural consumption are oddly absent from the city infrastructure that it is curated and marketed as ‘the urban future’. The biennale is marketed as its own temporality, but its continuity and modularity endangers the very fabric of the city. The collection of paintings showing the events in Turin in 2014 is a product of curatorial intention, but its temporal character, its collection of paintings and its auction house endangers not only the curatorial intentions, but also the urban fabric of the city.   	Photographs of the</text>

It is also able to recommence when there are clear and present public programmes in place, since the biennale is able to offer a point of departure for a programme that is ongoing in nature (a point of departure that is mutually exclusive). 	In sum, the biennale is able to offer a point of entry into contemporary art’s canon, and to contribute to the construction of a continuing body of work that is representative of the city in which it operates. It is a major cultural institution with a distinctive set of practices, and a significant body of cultural transmission of which flows to contemporary and contemporary art audiences. It is a rare thing in art to experience both the pressures and the opportunities of a biennale, but that is what the Biennale does. It produces culturally engaged art that is accessible to a broad range of people, and makes art that is accessible to people from everywhere in the world. It creates an experience of being in art’s canon that transcends the art’s discipline and reaches to encompass the social totality</text>
    <text>biennials past and present, but its relevance is somewhat questionable. In the 1980s, the Biennale was cancelled every two years, as was the Boullice family’s, in 2009, when the Biennale moved to Turin. 	The current situation is somewhat different. The Biennale is able to recommence when an agreement with the city government is reached, and in 2015, it did so again, this time for the first time in over 20 years, when the Biennale’s mandate was expanded to include ‘cultural tourism’ and a new category of visitor: itinerant curators, itinerant photographers and so on. The biennale is able to recommence when there is a clear and present public agenda in place, and is, in that sense, able to operate at a higher frequency, since it is able to attract more visitors at a time of increasing urban congestion. It is also able to recommence when there are clear and present public programmes in place, since these can be identified and co-opted by the biennale as a visitor. 	So, the biennale is able to recommence when the city government has a public programme in place, and it is also able to recommence when there is a clear and present public agenda in place, since these two conditions are closely related. In other words, the biennale can ‘move faster’ in relation to its stated subject matter. 	There are of course other ways of looking at it, but these two stand out clearly. The relevance of these two examples is that they are both specific cases where the city government has put in place an ambitious and costly cultural programme that is visible to a global audience, yet the biennale is able to move at least in part because of the reach of its international visitors, including many from within the city. 	The biennale has an agenda that includes a large number of smaller exhibitions that are largely</text>

It is also able to recommence when there are clear and present public programmes in place to support cultural activities, and this is an issue that has recently come to be of great concern for the city, particularly during the last two years of the biennale’s run. During these two years, the biennale was shown to be generating significant levels of public funding, yet its capacity to produce sustained cultural value has not been proven. The biennale is currently undertaking an intensive and long-term research project into the Art of Walking, which is being delivered by the Swiss architect Christiane Paul Rehberger and her team at the Museo Nacional de Arte Contempora. The project is a response to the fact that, due to an ongoing federalization process in the city, N.W.O. walks do not receive the necessary federal funding to continue, and do not have the appropriate legal standing to continue, due to a lack of federalism. The Biennale is currently negotiating with the city government to have the Biennale</text>

    The next Liverpool Biennial, which began in 2016, will mark the centenary of the birth of artist Henri Matisse. In England and Wales, Matisse is widely recognised as the founder of the new wave of modernism, which flourished between 1966 and 1974 under the name of ‘Art’. Matisse’s 1967 Biennale of contemporary art, 'The Modern Exhibition', marked the beginning of a new wave of biennials in the UK. Matisse was a leading critic of the new art form, and his 1967 work was quoted in numerous biennials from the next decade.Matisse’s 1967 exhibitionist work was based on a very specific, and very current, set of ideas and interests. In 1967, the UK was entering its golden age of pop art, and the new media behemoth that was the birth of the MTV empire. The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst.

Matisse was a leading artist during this time, and his exhibitionist style directly challenged the prevailing narrative of innocence and sweetness in art. He was also a leading voice in the art of the ‘Big Six’ media conglomerates, which in turn challenging the prevailing narrative of western modernism.Matisse was imprisoned for six years in 1968, but his work was readjusted after his release in 1974. He was among the artists who were active in the early stages of the AIDS epidemic, and his text, The AIDS Epidemic, appeared in many biennials and publications between that time and the end of the epidemic in 1986.Matisse was a writer, musician and poet. He was best known for his contribution to the BBC radio drama The Big Issue in 1969, which was based around the exploits of an anti-AIDS campaigner named Terry Smith. Terry Smith was a community activist who had been invited to do a series of public acts around the anti-AIDS movement in the early</text>

The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst. The festival was a vast, multi-disciplinary festival that would draw artists from across the arts, ranging from the biennial to the non-biennial to the major museum. It was a venue for their work, a platform for public discussion and a venue for the expression of ideas. It was also a vehicle for the establishment of a cultural identity for the UK, one that would be distinct from those of other artists and a different kind of artist. And it was the beginning of a process of the construction of what I would call ‘the Tate Modern’, the intellectual centre of the UK since the mid-1960s.Matisse’s concept of the ‘Tate Modern’ was a metaphor for the institutionalised and capitalised development that was about to engulf the UK and these are some of the words that came out of his oratorical device: ‘Twas the night before Christmas, a dozen white vans lined up in front of The T.V.</text>

The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst. It was a time when the creative class was encouraged to participate, and to participate imaginatively, in a public realm that was responsive to the whims of the culture industry. So the biennial form entered the public domain in ways that are still deeply embedded in the cultural fabric of the UK. It is the largest employer in the country, and exerts enormous political and legal control over the social, economic and even political life of the nation. This influence is still very much apparent in the form of the biennial itself, which is still largely a celebration of European art from the last forty years, and which is now frequently a mirror image of the status symbols of the cultural complex: the Tate Modern and the Liverpool Biennial. This is reflected in the number of biennials, which have exploded in the last forty years, most notably in Germany and Switzerland, but is also evident in the number of museums and library branches, which have mushroomed in the last twenty years.I should begin by saying</text>

The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst. Matisse was a leading figure in the art of the then vernacular, and the new media culture of the then ‘postindustrial society’. He was a writer, curator, journalist and critic. He was an influential figure in the art world at the turn of the century, and he remains a figure to be reckoned with. He was born in 18 Kent, the son of Irish soldiers, and his mother tongue was Cornish. He attended primary school in the early 1960s, and then worked in an Irish pub on the M6 for a number of years. He then went onto study European studies at Edinburgh University, and in the late 1960s he worked for the London Review of Books, before launching his own arts and photography blog in the UK's Melody Maker. He was a regular feature of arts and culture television, radio and the web, and was a figurehead for then First Minister Peter Robinson. He is now Emeritus Professor of Contemporary Art History at Edinburgh University.</text>

The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst. Matisse’s exhibitionist practice was a response to the commodification of art and the industrialisation of culture. He was famously quoted as saying: ‘Art has ceased to be a social last resort, and art … has become a social necessity.’[1]Matisse was not alone in his thinking. A generation of artists were developing creative practices that would be influential in sparking the modernist impulse in the UK. These artists included Sylvia Plender, Bertrand Bone, Mary Turner and Wendy Harpe. All these women were artists, but their practices were influenced by the idea that art should be produced in a social context, and then shared between people. Bone was particularly prominent, and she produced several volumes of text and poster design during this period, including for the Vogue of the 1962, 1973 and 1977, as well as 1956 for the Women’s Society.

In 1967, the UK was entering its golden age of pop art, and the new media behemoth that was the birth of the MTV empire. The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst. Matisse’s exhibition was a kind of advertisement and the Biennale express itself in the form of that adage: a contest to see whose ideas would be put into practice. The idea was to see who could put together the most brilliant exhibition for the most prestigious biennale in London. The idea was to see what would happen. People kept coming because they realised how important the exhibition was to the development of the biennale as an institution, and how much it would mean to have a sustained presence in the city. It was a way of saying, here are the things that matter to me, and here are the tactics that will make a difference.Matisse’s identification of the art market as the decisive event in the development of modernism is a cornerstone of his thought. He maintained that there had to be a way to intervene in the market, because the market legislated what was socially and politically possible, and ‘art’ was a product that could</text>

The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst. The art of the time was given a new intellectual and cultural underpinning, and this was seen as a necessary intellectual revolution.Matisse was a creative force in his day, and there is much to be admired in his work. But what is most fascinating and powerful about his work is the way it is projected onto a perceived idealised image of Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, in the context of a tremendous social transformation that he contributed to creating. Matisse is the sort of artist who indulges his audiences in a kind of ‘futuristic excess’, who inspires a kind of utopian fantasy about a utopian future society where the excesses of capitalism are put to rest. It is a society where art is valued highly, and where art is made to function as a tool for the socialisation of wealth and power. Matisse was a writer and director, and his writing and critical engagement with the ways in which culture is produced and enacted across a global scale is an important</text>

Matisse’s art was frequently and metaphorically associated with the new media, especially in the UK and US. He was famously quoted as having said: ‘What is being made is as ugly as  	pornography is beautiful.’ Matisse was commenting on the excesses and prejudices of the media industry at the time. He was also famously quoted as having said: ‘Art has lost its meaning.’ Matisse’s 1967 exhibitionist work was based on an erroneous idea of art as something that is endlessly consumable. The consumable forms of art, he was saying, were obscuring, and the consumable forms of humanity were being reduced to junk. Matisse was particularly vocal about the degradation of his own social work, and his decision to embed the words ‘Fuck the World’ in the title of the first edition of the Biennale.

The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst. Matisse was an artist who, in the 1960s and 1970s, was developing a multi-disciplinary approach to art that would come to dominate in the UK and internationally. His interest in public response and iconoclastic practices were drawing on experiences in the civil rights movement and working-class communities. Popular culture was seen as a major site of resistance, and his collection of over 1,500 photographs, the Black Poet, was a pivotal site of the UK art counter insurgency in the 1970s.Matisse’s interest in the public realm and critical thinking began to be expressed in the 1960s through his artworks that were political in character, critical and aesthetically non-conformist. The 1960 Biennale of Sydney brought out the best in the mid-to-late sixties counterculture – a movement that had its roots in the Paris Commune of 1968 but was building towards a worldwide network of transnational grassroots outbursts.

The exhibition was a major influence and promoter of that entertainment complex. Popular art practices were foregrounded, and the exhibition was a catalyst. This cultural logic of the biennale was a major theme of the 1967 Venice Biennale that I curated, and still am. It came as a surprise to many visitors (including me) when the Biennalee chose to highlight its relationship to the 1968 Paris uprising, and the 1968 student revolts that year. It is also a theme that many visitors to the Venice Biennalee return to, and which many artists repeat ad infinitum. The uprising in Paris, and the student revolts in 1968, are core ideas and concerns of the biennalee’s current programme, and the biennalee’s history will probably be a major theme of the forthcoming Trump exhibition. The uprising in Paris, and the subsequent student revolts, are the focus of a new exhibition that will be located in the Arc de Triomphe, and will be a kind of ‘house arm’ for the new cultural capitalism that the biennalee hopes</text>

Why two separate symposia? Because the symposium form encouraged a different approach to the exhibition, with separate acts of exchange between the different themes. In one conference, the different acts of exchange take place in the same space, but in another, they occur in different times. In the symposium, the different acts of exchange take place across different audiences – audiences that are exposed to the same acts of exchange over and over again (like the symposium itself). This is why the World Cultural Center, the main exhibition venue for the past forty years, has two separate acts of exchange: the exchange between the audience and artist(s) who work there</text>

The term ‘episodic’ refers to how elements of a visit are repeated within a fixed sequence (such as an event that occurs in a city over and over again over a set period of time, or a set itinerary). It is an evocation of the idea of ‘repeat’ – the act of repetition – and as such it is both metaphor and actually descriptive. 	The term appeared in a 1946 issue of Rhythm and Blues, a</text>

Dr Katherine Scott: Liverpool Biennial has been kind enough to offer me a position as a Curator for the second Future City exhibit. It’s a strange thing for a biennial to host an exhibit, because the purpose of the exhibition is to connect with the city. So the show has to be interesting in some way – memorable, informative and – most of all, fun. But it doesn’t necessarily have to be aesthetically pleasing. In fact, I suppose the show mustn’t be boring. I get bored easily enough, and I’m drawn to art that has a purpose and delivers something meaningful. But aesthetically it’s all about connecting with the artefact. The museum is the point of departure, the point of no return. The biennial is the place where the visitor’s focus shifts from the museum to the site.</text>
