I first saw the wisdom of what Mark Miodownik was doing with his basement, and then I joined him. The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to be more complex and far-reaching than we can imagine. However, we can also gain a deeper understanding of these complex worlds through what Miodownik was doing, and through what we as individuals and collectively are capable of doing. I believe that the actions of the Miodownik family and that of the group as a whole were courageous and made a difference. However, I don’t think we can build ourselves into utopian visions of perfect equality or perfect knowledge or perfect harmony or perfect social systems without first having to reckon with the fact that there are many bodies in the world, and that we as individuals are not the only actors in this world. I think that’s why so many revolutions happened: because the people empowered by the revolution had to reckon with the fact that there were other actors in the world. Without this complexity to consider, or without the knowledge to negotiate it, we would have no way of understanding and resolving conflicts. And I believe that in our current situation</text>

I first saw the wisdom of what Mark Miodownik was doing with his basement, and then I joined him. The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to be of value to those with whom we engage. The question is whether the things that we can learn from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are also of value to those with whom we engage. I believe that to some extent, and perhaps because we live in such different worlds, but perhaps the key is in the details. Miodownik’s basement, and the things that it holds, is a media-reality that is constructed with a spatial framework that is very different from the real world. The way in which we imagine the real world is different, and our relationship to it is qualitatively different, but the reality that we inhabit is also qualitatively similar. So we can learn from the difference, and we can also adapt our own spatial frameworks to incorporate that difference.  	When we think of the real world, we tend to picture a very real, very human world, where people actually exist, and can make mistakes and move away from the path</text>

The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to be different from what we can learn from the top of a mountain. For example, the ways in which we speak of migration are bound to be different from the ways in which migrants actually speak of migration. But we can learn from the differences, and create new ways of understanding the world.

I first saw the wisdom of what Mark Miodownik was doing with his basement, and then I joined him. The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to be influenced by things that we can observe from the air. The question that we as individuals and as a species face is, what would be the most natural and pragmatic outcome?  In the case of an emergency, as we saw in London, the most natural thing to do would be to circle the wager that we as a species are capable of handling the situation ourselves. But how would we know how to behave? How would we know how to build ourselves out of the infrastructures we inherited?  If we look at what our forefathers did with the resources they had, and use that to build things – things with which to fight each other and which can then be used against us in a variety of ways – then we begin to see that the resources we inherit are not necessarily natural resources either.  If we take the resources that our forefathers scattered across the landscape and use them to build up our own species, then we begin to see that the only way to truly</text>

I first saw the wisdom of what Mark Miodownik was doing with his basement, and then I joined him. The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to be shaped by the things we can't learn. In an ideal world, we would all want to be able to learn a great deal from the world around us, and from each other. All human creativity and all that we create is bound to be shared. However, in the world we live in, most of us don’t live in a particular ideal world. Our ideal world is a world in which people live their lives according to what’s convenient for them, and in which there are no injustice or injustice-like situations around the world. What we call the ‘Post-Katrina World’ is a world in which people are still dying in horrific ways, and yet most of us don’t experience it as horrific. It’s the ideal world, but as we all know, most of us don’t live in that world. And what makes the tragedy so horrific is that we don’t have the power or the place to</text>

I first saw the wisdom of what Mark Miodownik was doing with his basement, and then I joined him. The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to be shaped by the forces that we put in motion. This is true whether we are talking about earthquakes in quakes, or the behavior of financial markets, or climate change, or any number of other pressing issues that we are likely to be facing for decades to come. It is true that the actions of individuals can have a decisive effect on the terrain and the social dynamics of the world we inhabit, but this is by no means a sufficient precondition for action. The essential precondition is the will to act, and Miodownik’s will to act was action without reservation.  And here we are more than a decade later, and we’ve all been forced to confront the massive, costly and ultimately unfulfilling failure of our contemporary socio-economic model. We have been compelled to confront the fact that our economic and social systems are overwhelmingly based on fossil fuels. We are subject to the whims of global finance, which has the full backing of governments,</text>

I first saw the wisdom of what Mark Miodownik was doing with his basement, and then I joined him. The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to produce radically different futures for different people, depending on what kind of knowledge and knowledge-producing capacity we humans have. So the capacity for knowledge-producing capacity is a fundamentally different kind of capacity, and according to some estimates, as a result, and I quote, ‘One could argue that Mark Miodownik’s basement is the source of much of what has been learned in the world’. But this is only partially true. Miodownik’s basement is making use of what is, in effect, an ever-expanding knowledge base, and so as we speak, the CIA is reportedly hacking into the servers of almost every major social network in the world in an attempt to uncover the social dynamics behind some of the most despicable behaviour imaginable. In a way, of course, this raises the question of what kinds of futures are we trying to create. Are we trying to create a future that is completely different from the one we have now, or are we</text>

I first saw the wisdom of what Mark Miodownik was doing with his basement, and then I joined him. The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to be more complex and interesting. The question of what is possible from the current situation, and how we might allow those possibilities to change, is what brought me to see the value in what Miodownik was doing. It is also what brought me to see that there are ways to reimagine what it means to inhabit space. This is a key distinction, and I encourage anyone who has any interest in developing an aesthetic to read up on Miodownik’s ideas. It is not easy to define what it is to inhabit space, but I will try to give some ideas. We can think of inhabitation as the act of living in a particular space, and we can also consider space production as the act of transforming that space. I would define inhabitation as the act of making another one of our own inhabitable spaces, and space production as the act of transforming another's space. The ability to make another space is a fundamental building block of any kind of social agency. I</text>

The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to be shaped by the things we can't learn from the ground up.  	The question of how such capacities are created and cultivated is one that is deeply interconnected with the question of what is meant by ‘human dignity’. I would argue that we as individuals have capacities that are fundamentally different from those of a population. Individuals have capacities for action and meaning and passion and purpose and autonomy. These capacities are different. But they are also intricately connected. And as we see in the examples of the past several years, the kind of innovation and creativity that can be brought about by the social act of making is possible only when people have mechanisms in place to monitor and control that action. The kind of cultural and social acts that are possible only when there are people-centred narratives around the act of making are also possible only when there are also stories told that are consistent with those narratives and can then be assembled into a shared knowledge.

The things that we can learn about the world from the ground up, and from the ground up well, are bound to produce radically different futures than we can create through our own made-up knowledge. It is this ability to radically alter the world through what Miodownik was doing from the basement that I believe is urgently needed. It is the ability to see the world differently, to transform it. The transformation that we need is not in creating more knowledge, or in creating more beautiful things, or in any synthetic philosophical notion of progressive knowledge. It is in actually existing, and in that sense Miodownik was already making progress when he moved into the building that he was renovating. Transforming the building was part of what Miodownik was doing as a form of continuous ongoing experimentation. The question was, could the urban be transformed into a functioning place where people could live, work and play? The answer was a definite ‘Yes’. In the neighborhood, there’s a sense of reclaiming the space, of putting in place a new kind of architecture. In the</text>

These elements of the proposal are typical of later biennials, more interested in the exchange of capital and culture for the sake of exchange than in the production of exchange itself. It is important to note that these early biennials often act as a catalyst for the later development of a particular kind of biennial – what we would now call the ‘global’ – and ‘local’ – what we would now call the ‘local’. In other words, they might be seen as early biennials present in a globalised world.  	In these first few pages, we see that biennials have come a long way from their humble beginnings as rare private collections. The twentieth century saw a proliferation of biennials, many of which came to be seen as essential to the functioning of globalised societies. The biennial became not only a gathering of ideas, but also a site of exchange between people from many different places. We can now say that these things that we collectively term ‘</text>

It would also exhibit the latest in innovative urban planning and architecture, often in a city that is experiencing rapid regeneration, often using locally sourced materials and innovative architectural styles. These elements of the proposal are typical of that of biennials around the world, but the Southern California location, with its mix of history and present-day inhabitants, would seem especially at odds with the other parts of the country. In this proposal, the ‘region’ is defined as being ‘between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, in the western edge of California’s Central Valley’. The Atlantic Ocean is here represented as a spiral staircase, and the Pacific Ocean as a trackless desert. The idea that the Atlantic and the Pacific should be able to exist in harmony is somewhat at odds with the modern conflation of social and economic exchange, but the fact of their belonging to the same geographical area is at odds with the prevailing notion that the region is an island, an urban wasteland or a collection of desolate islands. The Southern California desert is represented as an island in the midst of an ocean, while the Bay Area is represented as a sea of islands. In the early twentieth century, the concept of the</text>

These elements of the proposal are typical of later biennials: ambitious, sometimes brilliant, sometimes utterly ridiculous. Yet all biennials have one thing in common: they all eventually fail. The failure of the 1991 Venice Biennale remains one of the most disconcerting legacies of the modern biennial.The second strand of the ‘Global South and East’ exchange is trade. Trade accounts for over 90% of global GDP. As the trading world became more urbanised, more densely populated and ecologically unsustainable, the need for ever larger transport networks began to choke off any remaining rural space. As a consequence, cities now play a pivotal role in transporting goods and people between regions. As urbanisation intensified, so did the need for large storage facilities capable of supporting these goods and people. As transport networks expanded, so did the need for large conveyor belts capable of supporting this growing amount of traffic. A large storage facility is a building or complex set of buildings capable of supporting a large amount of cargo. The word</text>

It would also exhibit the latest in innovative urban planning and architecture, often in a city that is experiencing rapid regeneration, often using locally sourced materials and innovative architectural styles. These elements of the proposal are typical of those found in best-selling urban novels such as Laura Mulvey’s The City of Arts as Fire and Lola Halifa’s New Urban Forms. However, in recent years the City of Arts as Fire has been characterised by a rapid regeneration process that has produced a population explosion and a host of problems on a grand scale. The rapid regeneration has caused homelessness, polluted the air we breathe and create dangerous levels of micro-siebusis. The pre-industrial economy that the Biennial would presumably revive is pre-distributed and global in character. It would not reflect the global circulation of capital or the postindustrial economy of the future that characterises the world we inhabit today. The most that the Biennial could achieve is to capture the imagination of a few urban dwellers and leave the rest of us to struggle through the city. The City of Arts as Fire opens not with a bang, but with a whimper. It is a novel that attempts to sketch the underside</text>

It would also exhibit the latest in innovative urban planning and architecture, often in a city that is experiencing rapid regeneration, often using locally sourced materials and innovative architectural styles. These elements of the proposal are typical of what I have termed ‘design-learn’.  In my view, what is needed are projects that challenge the prevailing order, often through civil disobedience or other creative means. The dominant forms of urbanisation in the global south are those that emerge from the prevailing ideology of homogenisation. Therefore, the prevailing form of art is likely to play a role in the dominant forms of urbanisation in the region, including in the biennial itself.  A final element of the proposal that needs to be considered is the diffusion of knowledge. As cities get larger and more connected, it is increasingly difficult to get a feel for the local communities that are a part of the project. In an ideal world, the art that is produced in each city would be produced in close proximity to where the art is being made in the larger city. However, as cities get richer and more diverse, it is increasingly difficult to connect the two. Therefore, an element of the responsibility for the success of the projects</text>

These elements of the proposal are typical of ‘global South: high-tech, manufacturing cities built on shared spatial data, led by cultural capitals, who inhabit a digital void between people and data, where art is valued above all else and all other forms of cultural output is considered frivolous.’[16] This statement, which comes from the 2002 book ‘South as a State: Politics, Power and the emergent ‘South’, is perhaps one reason why, just over a decade later, Brazilians went to the polls to elect a president who promised to reverse decades of political and economic decline. The emergence of a transnational biennial, with a global reach, seemingly out of nowhere in 2002, is another. As biennials acquire more institutionalised forms, ‘home’ becomes a concept understood as a set of relations between people, and the nation becomes a character understood as a set of relations between people.

These elements of the proposal are typical of those seeking to be incorporated into future ‘super malls’ or ‘metro parks’ in an urban transformation that would shift the urbanisation away from cash-strapped megacities and towards new trade routes. The ‘value added’ of such a ‘city of exchange’ would be largely determined by the degree to which the surrounding region embraced international trade. As noted by the Liverpool Biennial's Curator, Nasser Rabbat, ‘international trade is the engine of the global economy and is expected to drive all new urban developments worldwide.’ Rabbat went on to predict that the global trade in culture and lifestyle products would eclipse all other forms of trade within five years. ‘The important question for cultural-economy research is how to engage the regions that are the site of the largest-scale-scale market for these products, thus creating new sources of revenue for the regions’, he concluded. ‘If there is no cultural</text>

The Biennial would be an increasing presence in the city, and its shops, theatres, cafes and other venues would be ever more prominent. It would be an echo of past exhibitions, and artefacts of the past would find their way back into the city as materials and building material become ever more scarce and precarious, and as a growing number of tourists and residents of the region would gravitate to the city due to its cheap and cheerful accommodation and food. It would show off the city’s cultural assets, from its medieval past to its modern cachet. It would do this in part by manufacturing unity through the exchange of cultural capital – that is, the building and the artefact that are produced when a city is thoughtfully</text>

The biennial as an exchange, or a point of entry into an international exchange, between a small number of cities and their surrounding region would increasingly resemble what is now called the ‘Global South’. It would be a city within a city: ‘home’ to a distinctive ‘region’ of exchange, ‘a place where cultures converge, producing goods and offering services that are transferable between “city” and “region””. It would also exhibit the latest in innovative urban planning and architecture, often in a city that is experiencing rapid regeneration, often using locally sourced materials and innovative architectural styles. These elements of the proposal are typical of contemporary urbanisation projects around the world. In fact, the concept of the ‘global city’ has become the default setting in many settings, including those places with high levels of inequality and conflict. Yet, at the same time, the ‘global city’ is being slowly dismantled. Cities are no longer the centres of production, consumption, distribution and exchange; of course, this is not all happening in the developed world. Nevertheless, the pace of change in the global city is creating new configurations of exchange around the globe – and these exchange take forms that are as unpredictable as the exchange itself. There is a need to theorise and philosophise about the changing form of global city, and how this affects our understanding of the city. This will require us to create new kinds of theoretical and conceptual tools – new ways of organising knowledge and knowledge production. But one can also identify and analyse existing urban forms and urban problems and try to identify the problems that are similar to those that are creating</text>
    <text>The next Liverpool Biennial will take place in 2017. Both the exhibition format and the browsing would likely remain the same, but the fact that the biennial would be an institution of exchange between local communities and the metropolitan centres would likely increase competition.

These elements of the proposal are typical of those proposed by local and regional experts on the global South, and appear to me like the future of urbanisation in the region. It sounds bad, but I’m told that this ‘new’ way of urbanising the region is ‘better for business’ and that it’s ‘a win-win-win-win-win for everyone’. Sounds good to me, but I have no way of knowing. The question is: what does ‘the region’ mean in the 21st century? I believe that what we can learn from the region is in fact very valuable. It’s true that the people who will be the beneficiaries of this knowledge will be in the cities, but I also believe that the people who will be the most affected by this knowledge will be the people living far away from those cities. In fact, I believe that the very idea of the region is antiquated and needs to be reshaped. There</text>

In other words, they are both urban and cultural artefacts, but in a way that is not, say, that of, say, a Japanese cultural centre. The main difference between the two is that a cultural centre is a museum, while an artefact is not. So it is that the biennial can learn how to address the problem of its own making, and thereby become a cultural centre in its own right. But what it cannot do is learn how to inhabit the problem of making a cultural centre in its own right. That would mean learning how to address the problem of cultural sclerosis in its own right, and thereby become something completely different.How to Know About It: Art and the BiennialCultural Capital of the World’s Twenty-First CenturySurveys on a global basis reveal a city's cultural attractions as a function of time.

How to Know About It: The Cultural Centre and the BiennialIf there is a single space in which the biennial can learn to inhabit its own creation, it is in that space, where the artefacts are kept in pristine condition and the art objects distributed across multiple sites, in the form of curatorial actions. In other words, what the biennial produces through its multiple layers, props, and media (TV, print, radio, websites, social media) is a hybrid form that likes to be either seen or unseen. In an ideal world, the artworks would be spread out across a large and densely populated city, with a biennial taking place in every neighbourhood. But urban areas all over the world are becoming increasingly rural and remote, and even the best-off biennials tend to inhabit their neighbourhoods. Therefore, the challenge facing curators all over the world today is two-fold: (a) to find new ways to incorporate art into urban environments; and (b) to develop local, national, and international networks of artists and curators who can work in conjunction to one another to realise the biennial’s potential.To achieve these objectives, the biennial needs to learn to inhabit its own urban space and (more importantly) learn</text>

How to Know About It: The Cultural Centre and the BiennialIf there is a single space in which the biennial can learn to inhabit its own creation, it is in that space, where the artefacts are kept in pristine condition and the art objects distributed across multiple sites, in the form of a collection. This is the space of the ephemeral, of change and contingency, of appearance and absence. It is a particularity of the biennial – indeed, a fundamental proposition of the biennial – that it is constantly searching for and seeking out its next event. The reason for this is that the biennial is a curatorial enterprise. It collects and documents, encounters and narrates, in the tradition of curatorial work, in order to be able to continuously update its collections and our understanding of the world. So the event that is the product of its internal processes – its archetypes, its model works, its collections of stories – is a product that is constantly on the hunt for events that will place it in the best possible positions to tell its story through art. When it comes to the ephemeral, the real art is the last place you would expect to find a collection of seemingly random artefacts, but that is precisely what you will find in</text>

How to Know About It: The Cultural Centre and the BiennialIf there is a single space in which the biennial can learn to inhabit its own creation, it is in that space, where the artefacts are kept in pristine condition and the art objects distributed across multiple sites, in that conditionality. ‘Cultural capital’ is the second-place finisher here, behind only real capital. If the biennial wants to know how to inhabit its real capital – the cultural district – it must know how to inhabit both. Otherwise, the cultural district will just be another urban space, like any other. A deceptively simple and powerful way to think about cultural capital is to think of the artefacts as live substances – substances with personalities and histories and places and cultural significance attached to them. This is the only way to think of the neighbourhood as a living organism with a cultural core, a living form of its own. This is not to say that the core is a monolithic entity; rather, the neighbourhood is an integrated whole. So while the city consumes much of its cultural resources, these resources exist in a context of shared resources, and a cultural act such as eating out or sampling a local artist’s output exists in a different world.

How to Know About It: The Cultural Centre and the BiennialIf there is a single space in which the biennial can learn to inhabit its own creation, it is in that space, where the artefacts are kept in pristine condition and the art objects distributed across multiple sites, in a public collection, and accessible to scholars and the public alike. In other words, it is the real-life, contemporaneous space that the biennial appropriates. That space is the real-life museum, and the artefacts are the artifacts. There is a reason why the Cultural Centre was founded, and continues to be funded by the City of Sydney. It is because, at the core of its mission, it is a museum, while the Biennial is, in a certain sense, a biennial. And while the Cultural Centre holds the artefacts within its, that is, its nominal curatorial focus, it also actively engages with, and distributes, the cultural landscape via its collection, its curatorial priorities, and its curatorial work itself. It is a museum that is both a repository and a generator of cultural power. It is a museum of the present and an anticipatory prop of the future. It exhibits the contemporaneous condition of the moving image, and creates</text>

How to Know About It: The Cultural Centre and the BiennialIf there is a single space in which the biennial can learn to inhabit its own creation, it is in that space, where the artefacts are kept in pristine condition and the art objects distributed across multiple sites, in the form of disparate works. This is the cultural equivalent of an urban forest – a space where the urban canows and the farmers can coexist without incident. Not only can the biennial occupy this aesthetic space, but it will probably outlive almost any other form of artifice, existing in perpetuity as an archipelagos of their own works. This is the biennial precisely because it is artifice, and art is a fiction that is perpetuated in perpetuity.So what is the alternative to the biennial? Is there a way to create a similar form of art institution in the form of an organisation, without being constrained by geographic limitations and cultural consumption paradigms? One obvious direction is to revert to what Art Buchwald would have called ‘the natural and ‘inflected language’ of the biennial, which is the language of the archaeological and archival contexts of the art, but in the form of poetry, or perhaps ‘the poetic language of</text>

In other words, the kind of institutional memory that biennials build upon and that borrow from. And so it is that the biennial, which formally announced its intent to occupy a &quot;site-specific cultural space&quot; in November 2016, is now twenty-one years old and is still rebuilding from the aftermath of the Bay Street Mall disaster. It is also that the biennial, which traditionally operates as a site for a variety of activities – a rarefaction of curators, artists, writers and artists – is now a multimillion-dollar enterprise, largely financed by the federal government. Its curatorial agenda has shifted from its first, art-centered curatorial approach, in which the city was its engine, to one that reports directly to the city, to another that reflects the urban conditions that generated and are fuelling the biennial craze.

Contemporaneous with the art is what can be called ‘the other’ – a putatively co-constituted concept, but one that is itself often misconstrued and abused. The notion of the ‘contemporaneous’ co-exists with the notion of the ‘individuated’ and, accordingly, the 27th Biennial, curated by and with the artist Michele Christov-Bakargiev, which opened in Brisbane in October 2017, exemplifies the interconnection and its leverage. The two concepts, which together are part of what Bakargiev calls ‘the new ‘∞, come together to form a more expansive notion of the ‘∞∞. In this broader sense, ‘∞’ refers not only to the biennial, but also to other new curatorial activities, such as those led by the New</text>

This is the globalisable aspect of the biennial. It is the art of the as yet unclaimed space – albeit an art with a political, social and economic intention. The word ‘biennial’ has become, in part, a synonym for ‘identity document’.1 The as yet unclaimed space is one where art can take on an ever greater significance and in which the artist can exert control over the political meaning of her or his art. The term is often misused and misconstrued, and its geopolitical connotations are real. But its ability to simultaneously capture and transcend the moment – to connote and animate – remains a crucial, perhaps even defining, quality of the contemporary artist’s writing. The issue of who counts as an artist, and what counts as an artist, is a crucial one in the biennial context. It is a distinction that must be made, and must be remembered. It is a</text>

In a museum, the problem with the biennial is that it is a museum of consumption, and its primary mission is to sell tickets. Hence, it is often hard to tell what the exhibition is trying to tell visitors about, except by instinct. But the biennial must know something else, too. Its mission statement demands a critical understanding of contemporary art; a knowledge that others will also need to acquire, so that it may tell a story. So what is the biennial trying to tell? And what is its place in a city? In an ideal world, the biennial would be able to display its collections, invite visitors, and provide an environment in which a range of voices could be heard simultaneously, but it does not seem to understand its own mission statement. The real challenge for the biennial is what to do when it is unable to engage with its collection or when it is confronted with its visitor’s body of thought. As a cur</text>

It suggests that we are biologically incapable of changing our fate, and that technological advances are the final resolution to our problems. In my view, this is simply not true. The progressivist outlook is fatally flawed, and there are better ways of building human potentialities. The danger with AI is that it can outsource problem-solving to machines, or, alternatively, that it can empower politically connected private AI companies to solve problems for which there are no resources or human resources behind a human capacity. The latter scenario is what I would predict will happen in the wake of widespread adoption of AI, given the current political dynamics and the inefficiency of the regulatory state.As an aside, it is interesting to me that the term ‘smart city’ is heavily imbued with the image of a utopian future – perhaps, in part, due to the techno-optimist impulses of the contemporary reader.

It is the idea that humans are inherently better off than non-human animals, that is, that benefits accrue to humans at the expense of others. In other words, it is the idea that humans are intellectually capable of understanding abstract space. Progressives understand more abstract thought, more clearly, and therefore see more clearly the world as a zero-sum game between machine and human. The AI that is developing on a large scale in our cities is likely to produce far more dystopian outcomes, in terms of culture and economics, than any simulated or cybernetic version of itself.This is one reason why the AI that is part of our connected cities is likely to produce far more negative cultural effects than a simulated or cybernetic version of itself.

Progressives imagine a utopian future in which everything can be done with AI, but the rise of AI-enabled social media platforms and data extraction means that such a future is already here and will remain so for some time to come. And although there are many progressive proposals on how to move the goalposts of human capabilities, there is little political will on the ground or in the upper echelons of government to implement positive AI policies. Progressives controlling the political and economic system will of course attempt to create truly dystopian outcomes for humanity through techno-utopianism, but given enough time and opportunity, even these actions can backfire, as we have seen with neurobiology research projects in the wake of devastating disasters such as Superstorm Sandy.Progressives controlling the political and economic system will of course attempt to create truly dystopian outcomes for humanity through techno-utopianism, but given enough time and opportunity, even these actions</text>

The rise of AI coincided with an increase in dystopian fiction, which is characterised by a rapid proliferation of government-sponsored technocratic monitoring and control. But while AI may seem like a magic bullet to reverse all setbacks, it is much harder to rein AI in when it starts to make unexpected and disruptive infrastructural changes in the city, such as through the introduction of autonomous vehicles or the expansion of data-mining operations. A growing body of research now suggests that such disruptive changes may actually increase the challenges facing cities, such as keeping residents and businesses safe from crime and terrorism, while simultaneously reducing the capabilities of local governments to support critical infrastructure projects.For more information, visit: http://www.kinjaforum.org/index.php?fuseaction=Homepage&amp;fuseaction=Post&amp;fuseaction=ListPost&lt;|endoftext|&gt;The Super Bowl is here, and while the Seahawks and their fans are enjoying themselves, it's</text>

It preaches a vision of a future in which everything is possible and yet the very notion is repurposed to serve the interests of a privileged few. Similarly, nativism – the notion that humans are inherently superior to machines – is a mistake that contributes to fascism. Yet the tendency for AI to seek out and render comprehensible such problems – in the sense that they could be programmed to solve – is another reason why progressivism is dangerous. And it is a reason why, if anything, AI should be embraced, despite its pitfalls and shortcomings.If we think of AI as a kind of infrastructure, or even just as a set of tools, then we can start to imagine other kinds of intelligences, other kinds of intelligent life forms. We could place AI under the heading of a city, or take the idea one step further and imagine an entirely autonomous future city. We could place AI in the domain of cultural production</text>

In a world with AI, we could choose to become fully imbricated in its technology and employ it to its own ends, creating ever greater capacities for surveillance and domination.

It is a world in which art, musicians and dancers reign supreme.I first encountered AI around ten years ago, when a friend introduced me to Deep Blue, a computer program originally developed by the Royal Veterinary College in Cambridge, England, and initially used to analyse images of dead animals.

The challenge then becomes how to utilise this vast amount of data in interesting ways, with or without super-intelligent or intelligent agents.In this respect, then, AI is like biological life – it is both intelligent and fundamentally similar to us, albeit with the capacity to do great harm. It emerges from the primordial chaos of biological processes, and although it may seem like a new kind of technology, the potential outcomes are always uncertain. While it may seem like a new kind of construction, it is often hard to tell how AI will play out, or what kinds of forms it will take. This is particularly true in the wake of disruptive technological innovations, such as autonomous vehicles and social media, which often render massive swaths of urban and regional landscapes uninhabitable.The ability of AI to foresee and anticipate such outcomes is one reason why progressivism – the idea that man makes more progress towards his own destruction than does the advancement of life around him – is so dangerous. It presumes that man is inherently incapable of creatively inventing new ways of being in the world, and that his ingenuity is inherently futile. Progressivism is also the root of much of what AI systems do today: from manufacturing components for fighter jets to analysing massive amounts of data to be fed back into the system, to the point where sophisticated data extraction and manipulation becomes routine.But this kind of thinking is also wrong. Plenty of progressives today still subscribe to the mistaken idea that man is inherently incapable of inventing his own destiny. And while there are certainly smart people – great thinkers and activists among them – who emerge from that minority who are fully capable of creating transformative solutions, it is also common for those with those kinds of potentialities to grow frustrated by the lack of progress in achieving those possibilities. Progressives today tend to articulate their ideas through technocratic means, and while those</text>

Machine intelligence threatens not only the machinery of governance that creates and supports government, but also the very notion of humanity itself. This is why, in the wake of Apple’s 1984, major social movements demanded swift and absolute legal reform, which, along with a host of other demands, eventually won sweeping parliamentary majorities and autonomous agencies within which to pursue these goals. It is also why, in the wake of Facebook’s 1999 decision to sell access to its systems to online service providers, the social movements that emerged from this decision were emboldened and mobilized, turning to hacking and other disruptive technologies. It is a testament to the potency of these ideologies then, and to the strength of the AI that is now developing.In the wake of these developments, it is worth noting that, in the run-up to the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, a violent neo-Nazi riot rocked the city. The anti-Olympic protests</text>

The notion that humans will inevitably become intelligent overlords is a myth, and the danger to us from AI is greater than any fictional villain could possibly imagine. It is easy to understand the appeal of a villainous AI, given how easily we can manipulate it, but it is much harder to grasp the sheer enormity of the threat posed by AI. As Brad DeLong reminds us, the reason why capitalism emerged in the first place was because humans were able to reason rationally about many issues – including the nature of space and how it is used. DeLong also reminds us that while the development of new technologies is sometimes driven by science fiction, it is largely the result of private companies and philanthropists inventing ways to use the technology. DeLong, Brad and co-workers include, in their book The Culture and Crisis of American Capitalism (1974), which analyzed the roots of the technological revolution and the root causes, such as war and</text>

It feeds into the sense that progress is random and unpredictable, and that the future is unknowable. Progressives seek to regulate and persecute the human capacity for creative destruction, which is built into our nature. Because AI will be able to figure out what to do with itself, its potential outcomes will be determined by natural selection, which will in turn shape what kinds of possibilities are open to humanity. This is why, as the AI/machine interface becomes ever more pervasive, the limits of human capability will become ever more apparent.Because the limits to AI will be determined by natural selection, humanity will inevitably fall victim to the conditions of its growth. We may lose our minds, we may lose our capacity for self-repairing architecture, and we may lose our ability to imagine new ways of interacting with the material world. But the more we lose our capacity for self-repairing architecture, the more opportunities</text>

Art’s place in this ecosystem of contemporaneity and realness is tenuous at best. But there were other, more pointed, and less immediate motivations for the talks. There was an urgent need to be heard, now more than ever, in the name of preserving the very essence of the contemporary condition – what can it mean to be contemporary and contemporary? What does it mean to be contemporary and representative of our times? How is it that art today represents a situation in which so many people cannot access, inhabit, or even imagine? How are the contemporary and representative forms of art today possible? These were questions that were posed with more than a touch of exasperation by the discourses that were being put forward.  An exhibition should be able to speak with rhetorical gusto of the lived conditions of the contemporary; it’s a contradiction in terms that one often finds in the contemporary art world. But the very raison d'être of the contemporary art world was being undermined by the spread of biennials and museums, and the proliferation of the modern curatorial style that was seen as the optimal way to work</text>

Art’s place in this ecosystem of contemporaneity and realness is tenuous at best. But there were other, more pointed, less definitive questions. What should be invited, what can be learnt? What is the difference between today and a few years ago? What is the relevance of a place like Liverpool’s Museum of Modern Art? In what other way is it relevant that Liverpool is the city with the largest Muslim community? What does it mean for a place to be contemporary, urban and international? What is its relationship to other places?  The format of the gatherings itself was interesting in its conflation of local and national domains. The term ‘conversation’ seems to have emerged as a device, a way to map out a conversation between multiple audiences, at least rhetorically and actually mapping those conversations out. This is not to say that an audience could not come together and engage in a conversation, or that a place could not be created using that discourse. But the confluence of the multiple focuses of the event – the conferences, the exhibits, the readings – and the event itself,</text>

Art’s place in this ecosystem of contemporaneity and realness is tenuous at best. But there were other, more pointed, questions. How might contemporary art produce a similar reaction in a socially engaged way to  Conversations? What might art do in the present social context of constant surveillance and control?  How might art serve as a politics of silence? What might art do to resist the power of domination? What might art do in the age of the surveillance state? These are questions that, as the participants in  Conversations would discover, were framed in terms that perfectly corresponded with contemporary art’s current social context.There were many other questions that emerged as a consequence of the participants in the conference coming away with a clear understanding of how to approach the future, not through art, but through what  they could learn from art. These included questions of identity, the experience of artistic creativity, how to support collaborative art, and how to support critical art. The participants in the conference returned with varied understandings of how to connect to the contemporary artistic moment. But the most intriguing question of all</text>

How could art intervene in a complex social-political-economic-ethical situation? How could it create a new awareness and understanding of the contemporary condition? How could it foster a sense of place and community? How could it foster a sense of community and place? The participants in the exhibition responded to these questions not through a categorisation or schematic way of world, such as architecture and urbanisation, but through biennials and their archipelagos of place and culture, their publics and intranational sites of influence, their programming of cultural exchange? The way in which biennials present contemporary art’s place and role in a given society is by having artists, writers, curators, photographers and others take part in the day-to-day running of the exhibition through a website, podcast, exhibition catalogue, Twitter feed or any other media format that can be utilised to connect to and engage with contemporary art at a deeper level than art museums or contemporary art dealers</text>

But there were other, more pointed, questions, and these were raised as well.Questions of engagement and identity emerged as well. It’s an issue that art institutions around the world are increasingly conscious of; it’s part of the dynamic between the contemporary art institutionalised as curatorial focus and the socially engaged work of arts outside of the art establishment. In a recent retrospective in New York, the Museum of Modern Art was demonstrating its increasing concern about art’s place in a rapidly urbanising world. The Museum of Modern Art is an institution of knowledge, so it’s concerned with what it says and does – which is to say, what it creates outside of its walls. It’s an institution that demands that its workers represent the world through concrete representations, so it’s very much interested in the art of making things out of things. The Museum of Modern Art is a maker of representations, and the world it produces is made up of things. It’s an artist in a</text>

What would art do in the age of the biennial? What would art do during the AIDS epidemic? What would art do if the biennial came to New York? What would art do if the biennial was replaced by a museum? What would art do if the biennial was displaced by a foundation? The answers to these questions, and many more others, emerged in a group project that the artist led with the support of the artist and her team. The project was a collaboration, and varied in form from curatorial engagements to participatory, maker/organisation, community or grassroots initiatives. Its focus was clearly, and rightly, art’s.  It was an exercise in imagining how art could work alongside a biennial, and how art and the biennial could coexist. It was an exercise in creating a space for art and the biennial to work together, and for the artistic community to be part of that coexistence.</text>

Art’s place in this ecosystem of contemporaneity and realness is tenuous at best. But there were other, more pointed, questions. What does it mean when a work of art is considered representative of a certain era? What does it mean when a work of art is considered timeless? When, that is, the time and place in which the work is placed comes to be considered? Here, the discourses of contemporaneity and realness diverge. In the age of the Internet and mobile devices, the notions of contemporaneity and places are globalised. Contemporary art has become both more globalised (i.e. more global in its composition and definition of time) and more real (i.e. more real in its place in the world). What, then, constitutes the contemporary art condition? And this is the epiphany that the biennial offers: the contemporary art condition is precisely the condition of art that is contemporaneous with the technological revolution. This is to say, the contemporaneity condition. It is the very condition of artistic productivity. Of course, this is to be expected only in</text>

Art’s place in this ecosystem of contemporaneity and realness is tenuous at best. But there were other, more pointed, questions at the time. Is it still an art institution? What is its role in the age when, thanks to digital photography, mass media and streaming services, events such as football matches and sporting events are increasingly captured, and are therefore available to anyone willing to pay for access to them?  How does the art of meeting people as people’s artists intersect with the work of making art, and how? What is its relationship to the work of art as an event, and who is the audience? What does it mean when an artist creates a project that interconnects with another work of art? What is the difference between an exhibition and a seminar? What does it mean when an artist creates a project that, while not an art exhibition, is at the very least a seminar in the field of art? These and other questions, and the countless variations on them, lent their titles to the various forms of informal, informal informal learning facilitated by the conference, its participants and art institutions of</text>

Is it still relevant? No. Is it art? Certainly. Is it this way everywhere? Yes.  And finally, does it represent the way we live in the future? Hardly. In her reflections on the conference, Bridget Reilly suggests that art should be collected and utilized as a resource, deployed across social and spatial scales, and reproduced at will: as data, observations, charts, graphs, images, poetry, criticism, instruction, advocacy, guides, tools, knowledge, strategies and narratives. She also proposes that artists should develop and deploy collaborative online communities through which they can 'communicate and immerse themselves in the social conditions and processes that constitute the present, while simultaneously maintaining a distance from and independent of these flows'.  Art’s current and emergent media certainly encourages us to engage with these ideas and practices. Media theory and its practitioners are ubiquitous in our lives and workflows today.

The reason for this is that the original plan to open the biennial in 2021 was put on hold due to the worsening conflict in the Middle East.

In other words, the Biennial could do with the occasional cultural tourism boost.  The new design is identifiable by its inverted pyramid shape: art, architecture, and country – all surrounded by a sea of colour. Its promotion begins with a blog post by the chair of the board, followed by multimedia narratives and visuals. At the core of the visual arts movement, this kind of hypermedia creates a radically new kind of analysis of the world, questioning established modes of cultural expression and authority.  The images and narratives posted online are produced in ‘native’ places, ‘influenced’ by local factors and ‘inspired’ by the local environment.  In short, ‘influenced’ locales, as opposed to the historical monocultures of which biennials were often a part, create opportunities for new kinds of analysis. Such</text>

It strives to create something new and enduring in the face of technological advances, urbanisation and globalization. In this sense, not only is the new architecture and design responsive to the demands of an ever-expanding, globalised contemporary art market, but it is also anticipatory, recording the practices of artists and preserving their unique cultural legacies. I propose the establishment of a museum-like structure, its management and development through a land-use change, a cooperative agreement with the Biennial, and the establishment of a municipal branch of the Biennial. This proposal is not a proposal for art per se, but for an institution that records and actively engages with art’s realpolitik, its real-life and virtual contexts. It should also foster a dialogue with local inhabitants and art professionals to help inform the redevelopment of the city. The proposal is to</text>

This new architecture is a synthesis of both the past and the future, the present and future, creating new urban spaces where art can be produced and art processes can take place. The development of this architecture is itself a biennial in that it is part of a larger cultural infrastructure that includes museums and art galleries, but it is also a redevelopment of the past, a return to the old ‘white elephant’, and a gesture back to the communities who have been the site of conflict and displacement. The biennial itself will return to the traditional form of art institution, but it will also seek to incorporate other creative modes of production, distribution, and consumption, including new modes of consumption generated by digital media. The main modes of production will be cultural forms of engagement, such as performance, writing, photography, and video, and their social and cultural effects. The digital forms of cultural production will become critical to anticipating and facilitating the cultural outcomes of the</text>

The proposed format is illustrated in the map below. The red line represents the location of the proposed biennial; the blue line represents the position of the city council at the present time. The arrows point to the council’s buildings in the city. The arrows also point to the trolley tracks that run along the river. The shape of the arrows indicates the direction of travel.

    <text>The postponed 2021 Biennial has been moved up to a later date. The reason for this is that the original plan to open the biennial in 2021 was put on hold due to the worsening conflict in the Middle East. So the new version of the biennial opens in 2024, two years earlier than originally planned.This delayed opening implies that there will be a new version of the Biennial, but unlike the present iteration, there will be no new art institution or art per se established in the city. Instead, there will be a new generation of artists and arts practitioners established within the city, whose work will be complemented by older artists from abroad who have been given extended residencies in the city. The idea is that as art and design interact, their interaction creates what Edward Said, the British cultural theorist, would call ‘new cultural formations’.4  This new design takes into account the fact that the biennial is an art institution and not a design institution; it seeks to balance the interaction of art and art’s environment, taking into account the changing needs of city dwellers and visitors, while recognising the important role that artists still play in providing cultural and design elements to the city that are not exclusively their own. 	The new design also takes into account the fact that the biennial is an art form that is globally visible and is intimately related to the changing face of art in the modern world. The introduction of the new version of the biennial in late 2017, to coincide with the centenary of the outbreak of World War One, signaled the end of an era of designated art and the rise of a new one. The new biennial is a hybrid form, capable of incorporating both art and architecture, operating within the broader concept of urbanism and culture as a whole. It seeks to respond to the increasing global visibility of art and of art forms in the modern world through a combination of periodic, ‘concept-based’ art and ‘architecture</text>

It seeks to create an environment in which contemporary and emerging artists can operate in a mutually enriching way, while simultaneously maintaining a certain amount of unpredictability in the form and function of the biennial. This new design cannot be identical to the old, because it does not track or timestamp or count entries, but it does track and timestamp and compile entries from a particular point in time, much like a museum or a directory. By the way, I should point out that this new system is different from the old one, in that it tracks and textseevles not just artists, but works of art as well; art is now a component of the entry in the biennial.5  Importantly, this entry-tracking and text-composition is now part of the institutionalised art museum, rather than a fringe practice at best.  In addition, contemporary art is now</text>

The new approach to the biennial is to be found in the book  	Design &amp; Empire by John Urry and Sandeep Parmar, New York Times bestselling authors of the same name, who were both curators of the 2016 Venice Biennale. Urry and Parmar make some interesting points about the relationship between urban development and art forms. For them, the former is a ‘natural by-product of industrial society’, which requires the latter to function, because it is an ‘inherent social necessity’.5  For example, they point out that the proliferation of skyscrapers and the associated ‘gigantic database of building information systems’ leads to an ‘inherently unstable urban structure’; this instability arises from the fact that the sensors and data processing that monitor buildings and structures continuously output data, on a massive scale, in response to user input</text>

For this reason, it is possible that the 2018 and 2022 biennials will be different from the present. The fact that the Biennial has been given such an open architecture – a clear aim in its opening pages – suggests that it is seeking to be dynamic, capable of operating constantly and, above all, not static. It is seeking to be what its founding myth emphasises: what it literally means to live in a Biennial. If the Biennial is to thrive in Istanbul, it is imperative that it becomes something other than a design institution, something that can respond to the changing needs of its users. If the Biennial is to become a cultural institution in its own right, it is imperative that it becomes something that both the local and international artists who use its facilities can count on, count on’s future growth. To a certain extent, the Biennial is already fulfilling its historical mission in a way that is not reliant on world</text>

It is an art institution that operates at a conceptual and operational level, and not a design institution that operates in a physical and operational sense. This new art form is not a museum, but rather a complex system of galleries, museums, archives, distribution channels, curatorial approaches and more that supports a design revolution. It is the emergent aspect of a changing cultural landscape.  Art’s place in this city’s urban landscape has shifted dramatically, and its distribution has come as a result of urban design decisions that were driven by the Biennale Commission and its advisory body, including the city council. While many of these changes were driven by the Biennale Commission, which was a co-chair of the commission, the city council also played a critical role in creating the visual landscape of the city. Its decisions gave the Biennale the mandate to alter the city’s urban fabric in ways that would be consistent with the</text>

It seeks to create what one might call a biennial context in which art can be produced, disseminated, and appreciated in ways that are authentic to the place and time in which the art is made, and in which it is possible to exist in that place and time. It seeks to balance the on-site production of art with the fact that art is made and disseminated through on-site research and observation. This new biennial may be called Art in Transit rather than Art in Paradise. 	 In this sense, the new design may take into consideration the past (a tendency towards authenticity in itself), but the new concept may also seek to incorporate what is real and authentic about the city in the form of transit and its infrastructure. One might even agree that this is part of the contemporary urbanisation process, which has entailed the establishment and continuing of large infrastructure corporations, the proliferation of daily media and telecommunications, and a proliferation of non-</text>

If the collection is to be continually augmented, and the displays located in each building displayed, then the collections would have to be constantly visited. Each of the forty-five works will have to be individually visited, and the choice of subject matter must be carefully considered. It is not feasible, and the decision was made in the 1980s, that the collection would be continuously augmented, and that its current form would be maintained. At the same time, the collection must be maintained in a precarious way: its contents have to be protected, and the decision to add new works has to be carefully considered.For the main exhibition hall and the public space, the N.Y.P.D.A. decided to create two parallel universes: a gallery for the exhibits and a workshop for the visitors. The gallery will host the usual exhibition programming, while the workshop will invite visitors into a separate world where the exhibits are made visible and the visitors are able to participate in the displays through their own works. In the main exhibition hall, the visitors will find more of their kind of artwork, while in the workshop they will find even more like it. This</text>

Each will have to be individually unique, and each must be found in the building by visiting each building, and in each, and every one of the thousands of public places around London.  This is technologically impossible. London’s infrastructure is too extensive to accommodate such an extensive exhibition schedule. Assembled by an alliance of civic and cultural groups, the collections will be supported by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust, and financed in part by the Leverhulme Trust. The exhibition space, which will be dedicated to the collection, will be jointly managed by the Leverhulme Trust and the Old Bailey Curators.

Each space will have a shop and a public meeting space for the next exhibition. These spaces will be used by themselves, or in combination, to present the collections in a daily or bi-weekly schedule. The collections will be visited by a dedicated public, who will be able to survey, photograph, talk with, and take part in the collection surveys. They will find interesting and interesting-looking places to stay, places to stay, and will be able to discover places by going to guided tours.

In addition, each space has to be regularly cleaned and sanitized. Cleaning and sanitising would require a full-time cleaning crew, and the space would have to undergo extensive repair work. Such space-intensive maintenance would consume a large amount of energy, and it would also be unsightly. The choice to offer the collection as a choice, even when it is offered as a ‘hundreds of objects’, is an act of bravery, because it indicates an awareness of the environmental problems facing the city. It is a reminder that New York City still needs its oil and its fine art, and it is a commitment to the environment as a function of habit.  The act of choosing, in this sense, is a gesture of resistance. It also suggests to some extent the futility of</text>

If the collection is to be continually augmented, and the displays located in each building displayed, then the collections would have to be constantly visited.

This may be difficult to achieve, given that the buildings are so closely linked, but this is necessary in order to sustain the impressive collection that the police rely on to arrest and convict football fans, motorcyclists and other dangerous offenders. If the public is kept out of the galleries, and out of the display cases, then the police will have to rely on more imaginative ways of looking at the numerous, sometimes conflicting, memories that football fans and other visitors bring with them, and so the compartments will have to be visited at least three times before they are deemed safe.  A decision to include the public in the galleries and the public domain was made in part to address concerns about the influence of the arts and cultural patrons on the city, largely because of the massive, often</text>

These arrangements will be made through an agreement between the galleries and the museums.  The choice to offer the collection in one building, and the display in another, is an artistic one.  The view from the gallery is one to be taken in private, and the collection is one to be shared.  The collection will always be on the second floor, and the view from the gallery is one to be taken in public.  The collection would have to change places with time – and, besides, the maintenance of privacy would become an issue.  The collection would have to be regularly manned, and the staff would have to be constantly rotated.  The tenor of the collection, its location and the privacy it provides would have to be monitored.  The gallery would need to be able to meet regularly to discuss the exhibition.</text>

Each of the buildings would have to be individually monitored, and each space would have to be individually screened. Each of the pieces would have to be individually identified, and the process of identification would have to be precise. For this reason, the collection is often broken up into smaller pieces, displayed together, or placed side by side. In the main exhibition hall, each of the pieces is shown in its own space, often accompanied by images from the collection. And in the public space, each piece is seen at a time. This continuous juxtaposition of different representations of the same thing is what Van Heeswijk refers to as ‘the epiphany’ that leads to art’s actualisation. The collection, she says, is a series of epiphanies.  She also says that the epiphany that leads to art is the ‘same epiphany that leads to war, poverty and death’. Which brings us to the present, and the war between the worlds.</text>

In addition, the works will have to be individually arranged according to the visitor needs and preferences. This may be time-consuming and inconvenient for visitors to the Grand Gallery, but it is essential for the works to be placed in the appropriate context and arranged in the most optimal way. If the Grand Gallery is to maintain its unique character, then it will have to constantly innovate and experiment with new ways to present the collection in a daily and weekly programme of public and private displays in a constantly evolving and fluid way.  The exhibition will be managed by the Biennial as a collective, and the artists and curators will be drawn from the curatorial team of the Danish and Danish-based biennials, as well as other curatorial teams in other cities.

If all this happens in the main exhibition hall of the old Bailey Courthouse every day, and in the public gallery every week, then the collection would have to be visited at least monthly.  The problem with the current biennial format is that it regularly reproduces the same collections, and the same places, over and over again, in the same way that the collection of a regular museum is continually replenished, with fresh and original material piling up in the exhibition hall, in the main exhibition hall and in the annex. The important thing is that new material arrives, and that this material is displayed in a way that engages with the material in the original collection.

In Canada, this is one of the roles of the Crown.2  The Public Trusts Act (1982), as amended (1993), created a new category of public organisations – public trustees – which replaced previously established public organisations. These new institutions were empowered to establish and amend local by-laws, to make rules respecting the use of land and to establish and amend territorial laws and to declare lands to be private property. The act also created a new class of persons entitled to certain rights and provided for the establishment and amendment of public institutions. The new public institutions were given a principal mandate to promote social welfare and to secure the rights of Indigenous peoples. The mandate to do this expanded to reference activities, including education and research, of any kind. The National</text>

However, the adoption of a policy of co-determination does not imply relinquishment of sovereignty. The public has a responsibility to ensure that the development meets local needs and values. In developing a participatory city, the local takes responsibility for the allocation of resources and makes decisions on development that are based on evidence and on the merits of the case. However, the choice of site and method of implementation is ultimately in the hands of the citizens and residents of the area. The responsibility for site selection and development shifts from the city to the residents and local governments. Local control implies a shared set of values and responsibility. However, it is important to note that the responsibility for a site lies with the developer and not with the area. In addition, the responsibility for implementing a local plan supersedes any responsibility of the residents. Local authorities have a vested interest in</text>

It is recommended that the scope of the project be defined ahead of time in order to minimise conflict of interest issues. It is also recommended that the scope of the project be restricted to a set of priorities that are mutually agreed upon between the parties. This ensures that the priorities agreed upon by the community can be carried out. It also allows the Public Master to define the procedural parameters of the project. For instance, the scope of the proposal and the parameters of the proposal may be limited to achieve the goals agreed upon. It is also advisable that the community guidelines/proposal document be produced in advance so that the community can consider the proposal as a collective effort.  Local government is not the only party to the game in the game of urban transformation.

A recent example of this is the creation of Living Streets LA, an organisation working to create a ‘respectable urban space’ for residents to ‘move freely’ in, through, and across Los Angeles. The organisation’s first public president, Zoe Lehman-Braun, a resident and theatre arts activist from Brooklyn, was a leader in the Women’s Movement in the 1980s and worked for the Symbolic Act, the Symbolic Assembly, and the New York Public Theater before starting her own non-profit organisation, which she co-founded in 1986.1  She has a long-standing interest in the political, economic and urban transformation of areas affected by large infrastructure projects, and in the neglected urban centres of Brooklyn and New York City.  	Lehman-Braun is a case study in the history of urban and community development in America, and part of a curatorial team for the new exhibition,  	Inside LA, reopening of Art and Politics, at the LA County Museum of Art, which will showcase work from the curatorship of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  	Her</text>

This could be seen as a hybrid, or ‘neighbourhood model’. A recent example of this is the creation of Living Streets LA, an organisation working to create a ‘respectable urban space’ for residents to ‘move freely’ in, through, and around Los Angeles. The organisation’s first legislative district was established in Koreatown in the 1980s, and over the years the district has evolved into a diverse collection of residential neighbourhoods with a mix of uses, some of which have been designed to accommodate large public works projects. Living Streets LA was started by neighbourhood activists, and continues to be led by an independent Board of Directors. 	The district’s continued growth and development, however, has created tension between the densely populated areas with high levels of development in the outer districts and the densely populated areas with lower levels of housing and social services in the core districts. The tensions are palpable, and it is not uncommon for residents to leave the district due to overcrowding and poor public services, but the tension has recently shifted to the point where residents are actively seeking alternative uses for the district, especially in the downtown core. There is a palpable sense of loss of control as developers have turned the district into a high-end, luxury condo</text>

A recent example of this is the creation of Living Streets LA, an organisation working to create a ‘respectable urban space’ for residents to ‘move freely’ in, through, and across Los Angeles, an area with among its characteristics, as well as for artists’ and curators’ to ‘walk amongst’. The organisation has its roots in the 1970s counterculture movement, but has recently adopted elements of the community arts movement, particularly the practices of community gardens and youth clubs. Assemblages of artists, community organisers, artists’ assistants and others formed over the years have continued to evolve and expand their programme, sometimes incorporating practices that were traditionally associated with the art world, but which are now increasingly important in their neighbourhoods. 	One of the beauties of the contemporary art world is that such organisations are easy to form, can easily be integrated and brought into local communities, and that, unlike other art forms, can be sustained long term. 	However, the future seems increasingly uncertain and uncertain institutions will rule the present and in fact some may well become perverted and destructive.

In Los Angeles, the controversial Transbay Transit Center is being transformed into a new ‘green space’ where residents can ‘opt-out’ from intensive urban development. 	In all of these cases, the dense, for-profit real estate sector is being encouraged to expand by the state via taxation and regulation, while citizen activism is encouraged through the provision of readily available, low-cost housing and public transit. 	While these developments may seem desirable on a grand, overarching level, and in the long run may well be necessary in a globalised global economy, in the current period, such policies actually serve to divert resources from the places where crisis is greatest –</text>

In the broader national and local  	 sense, it is said that the revival of historic neighbourhoods is a national and ‘global’ mission.1  In so far as the revitalisation of historic districts is a national or ‘global’ mission, it is being promoted through what can more appropriately be termed a ‘neighbourhood cure’. Such revitalisation is being promoted in large part by the arts, whose influence is felt throughout the city and whose participation in neighbourhood matters is valued. Art’s influence can be seen in everything from the way in which council members are elected to the way in which particular projects are developed, including through the involvement of artists’ organisations in the planning and implementation of projects. Indeed, it is the involvement of artists and culture in the creation of new ways of organising things that can generate innovative solutions, and that can change how things are</text>

The organisation recently hosted a ‘community meeting’ to discuss the project, with participants from the project including representatives from the Board of the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs and the Chinatown Business Improvement District (CBID). The meeting came as a result of a project entitled Streets Not Placestheatre? Los Angeles’s Chiang Mai Legacy? (We Are Chiang Mai), an initiative jointly run by the Arts Alliance and the Arts Council of Greater Los Angeles to encourage a ‘re-constitution’ of the area through a ‘City of Ideas’ project. The project was initiated by the Arts Alliance and the Cultural Commission of Thailand and commissioned by the Thai Consulate General in Los Angeles.

A recent example of this is the creation of Living Streets LA, an organisation working to create a ‘respectable urban space’ for residents to ‘move freely’ in, through, and through the built environment. The organisation’s first public consultation, held in September 2014, encouraged residents to create a design that best reflected the neighbourhood character, while at the same time addressing some of the concerns of the community. A public debate, entitled ‘Streetsblog LA 2014’, ensued, with designers and architects weighing in via blog, Twitter and email. The resulting, although still nascent, Community Land Trust project was made law by the local government in early 2015. 	Living Streets LA welcomed this as a historic day, and began work right away to acquire and develop the land, buildings and building stock on which the new development will be placed. The organisation’s current focus is developing a series of affordable houses for low-income households on the site of the former LA Central Library, with a primary focus on the needs of the local community.

The organisation’s mission statement includes the following: ‘We are committed to creating a better, more just and sustainable city for ourselves and our descendants.’ We are also committed to creating places where people of all ages, backgrounds, abilities, creeds and races can gather to … ‘move freely’ – as long as that freedom means moving without hindrance or oppression’. 	The question is whether the hybrid ‘city of the future’ envisages areas where citizens flourish alongside wildlife, in harmony with the natural resources inhabiting them, or whether, where conflicts arise between humans and nature, nature is given the upper hand. One might also speculate that the increasing privatisation of infrastructure is in part a response to the sense of crisis inherent in the human-animal nexus: infrastructure is seen as a scarce resource, and the public realm a potential investment opportunity.

A recent example of this is the creation of Living Streets LA, an organisation working to create a ‘respectable urban space’ for residents to ‘move freely’ in, through, and across’, the narrow streets that divide Los Angeles. Designed to encourage passive and incrementalism, the new neighbourhood often operates as a buffer between residents and commercial areas, providing a 'soft landing spot’ for aircraft as noise pollution rises, creating a buffer zone between industrial and residential zones. Often times this space is used by residents as a frontage to do things such as take out mini-mansions and lease them out as office or residential spaces, or to host events such as street parties or community cook-offs. 	Living Streets LA has partnered with a number of prominent local non-profit arts organisations, including Architecture East, LA9 and the Downtown Development Collaborative (DDC) to bring innovative ideas and strategies to bear in creating a new ‘respectable’ urban space for residents and visitors to the city. In recent years, UDCD has focused on promoting a ‘culture of community’ through LA Community Arts Network (LA</text>

    The next Liverpool Biennial, in 2019, will be hosted by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The relationship between these art institutions and the city's biennial scene is complex and long-term. Recent biennials, such as Liverpool’s, have focused on the city’s rapidly developing homeless population or the art installations that have appeared in vacant buildings or abandoned lots. The history of the homeless in the US and in Liverpool is a story that has been retold by many different creators. The emergence of such narratives as facts of life in a city is a powerful fabrication. The homeless in Liverpool now number approximately 6,000,000, including 800,000 in the Downtown Helsinki Valley, 40,000 in the city’s MTM, and over 2,000,000 in the MTM metro.

The number of biennials in the city is set to double within the next ten years, and the number of visitors is set to quadruple. The stable of biennials has proved an ideal vessel for the growth of a biennial industry that is inherently unstable, unstable in its dependence on a city, and unstable in its social functions. The biennial has become an artifact of the city’s economic destiny. The city cannot simply bail the biennial artists out of the mess they are in; these institutions have to take the lead in creating a narrative that is credible, useful, and empowers the public. We need to invest in artists who will be able to tell a story that will live on in the biennial’s cultural landscape. Fortunately, there are talented artists here who possess that capacity. There are few titles on the CV of these artists who are as likely as they are to create lasting works of art. But despite the fact that these artists possess such powerful narratives, their audiences never sit still. They are always active, often questioning, and always curious. It’s their story.Art is</text>

A few years ago, the Biennale of Sydney was criticised for moving too quickly to build its new collection of art spaces in the Downtown East, which many residents felt was neglected. Residents in Anfield, by contrast, are complaining that the Biennale of Sydney neglected their historic district, because their neighbourhood is the best-preserved in the city. The Biennale of Sydney and the Biennale of Liverpool both seem to be moving away from their historical neighbourhoods, which means that the neighbourhood is also entering the new urbanisation process.  And, of course, the Biennale of San Francisco has a history of displacing people, of course.  So there is a real conflict brewing in Anfield between the history of the area and the Biennale’s need to preserve it. And the history of the area is intimately tied to the Biennale.   A few years ago, I co-curated an exhibition of works by and about people from</text>

The number of biennials in the city is set to double within the next ten years, and the number of visitors is set to quadruple. Some biennials have responded to this demographic shift by reorienting their programming away from the historically blacklisted art sites and towards the ‘affluent tourist destination’ of the art museum. But in doing so, they have tended to devolve into ‘luxury shopping’ and into the museum-and-art-and-utility complex that is characteristic of any large tourism promotion. The only way to really know about the challenges and opportunities of a city’s biennial is to visit and spend time there.  So, where does a biennial place its current and future visitors? Where does a biennial make itself visible? In doing so, it creates a dynamic and encounters the unexpected, which visitors and artists alike can gain a perspective on. In doing so, it creates an experience that transcends language and culture. And it does all of this in a city, a continent, an international zone, and a neighbourhood?

The number of biennials in the city is set to double within the next ten years, and the number of visitors is set to quadruple. In an attempt to reflect this spike in visitors, the local museum board, which includes representatives from the hoteliers, has developed a tourism strategy that includes a range of innovative activities, including: ‘running afoul of the monoculture [of skyscrapers] to visit the Twin Towers’ or ‘thriving outside industry parties in the CBD’. The strategy is to create ‘a fiction of opportunity’ in and around the city, one that is false and deceptive at the same time. The strategy has backfired spectacularly. Although the strategy may have some successes, such as generating tourism dollars for the local government, the failure rate – which can be used to lure developers and financial institutions to redevelop vacant properties or build new stadiums – is incredibly high. In fact, the failure rate for new strategies is incredibly low. Why?Because when the housing crisis hit, people shifted resources to other priorities.

The number of biennials in the city is set to double within the next ten years, and the number of visitors is set to quadruple. The biennial format is set to change, and with it the mode of political resistance that it implies. Liverpool Biennial 2018 will be the first to adopt a permanent, full-time, independent chair, and its future conventions will be the first to adopt a formal, fully public body, with broad powers to engage with the city and its inhabitants. This may not be the utopian future that is meant to be found in, for instance, the Museum of Modern Art’s proposal to transform the Museum of Modern Art into a museum of urban culture, or in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s proposal to transform the Museum of Modern Art into a museum of urban culture. Rather, this is the future that is being invented by those who seek to control it. The biennial format is being redefined, and it is likely that the chair and the body that will sit on top of it will become more and more important.

The number of biennials in the city is set to double within the next ten years, and the number of visitors is set to quadruple. As a result, it is imperative that the narrative of the biennial come to represent the city in a way that is both compelling and accurate. The problem with this approach is that it requires an infinite amount of work and energy to update the narrative every time a new biennial is held in the city. It is also the case that the biennial boom that began in 2015 represents a situation where the city is no longer an island in a sea of people, but has become an island in its own dynamic. It is not an island in its own natural way, but relies on the labour of many different kinds of people, from trawlers to port workers, carpenters to architects, and others toil in various ways within the city. The labour of these workers is complex and uneven, and much of the narrative of the biennial as such is constructed on the back of the labour of a particular kind of worker: the migrant worker.

The number of biennials in the city is set to double within the next ten years, and the number of visitors is set to quadruple. Biennials, at their worst, provide a convenient excuse to overlook the city’s structural problems or the city’s limited cultural resources. At their best, they are the site of counter-examples to prevailing narratives. It is this double dynamic – the creation of narratives that are easily accepted by a local population eager to throw lavish amounts of money at art, and the proliferation of narratives that are contested, questioned and developed – stories that are easier to digest and carry further.The problem with the dominant narrative in Liverpool, and in much of the UK, is that it is frequently opposed with a story that is reductive, simplified or fabricated. The creation of new narratives is a critical first step in any cultural revolution, and it is to a large extent a function of how we present the stories we invent. As biennials proliferate in the city, they become more and more like museums, with a curatorial function that seeks to tell stories in a particular genre</text>

The number of biennials in the city is set to double within the next ten years, and the number of visitors is set to quadruple. The promise of such a narrative is particularly appealing to tourism officials, who are keen to portray a storyteller’s work that captures the essence of the city in a single image. With their escapist tour-maladie of a city as escapism, biennials have emerged as a source of pride for a city that otherwise struggles to find its narrative.  In January 2018, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art announced that it was creating a dedicated section of its new Museum of Modern Art, dedicated to the museum tradition and its collection, in a former location of the MTM, in an attempt to recapture the magic of the museum.  The project was met with enthusiastic reviews, but much negative publicity was given to the idea that the newly-formed museum would be a museum of decay, overrun with cultural relics from the 1980s that would be repurposed or destroyed.  The criticism was partly centered on the museum being housed in an antiquities shop</text>

Liverpool Biennial 2018 will mark the second anniversary of the event that started it all – the 2015 Biennale of Sydney. Sydney became the first Australian city to host a Liverpool biennial, in 2013. Liverpool Biennial 2018 will be based in the historic Prudential Building, with a new exhibition format and curated by Joasia Krysa. The exhibition form will be a ‘story in several episodes’, with each episode focusing on a different facet of the Biennale’s subject matter. Each episode will have a different narrative structure, but all narratives will have a common theme. For this reason, each narrative may be considered a ‘snap’ to a particular event or set of events. For example, the opening of the Biennale in Liverpool may be considered a ‘snap’ to the Liverpool Biennial 2015, and the closing of the Biennale in Liverpool may be considered a ‘snap’ to the 2015 Liverpool Biennial</text>

The biennial format has its own set of problems and opportunities, which need to be addressed to create sustainable biennials in the future. An overview of some of the issues and concerns related to the homeless in the city can be found in Hilary Puttman’s book Stealing the City: Poverty, Policing and the Biennial Industry, 2008. The issue of housing and poverty in and around Liverpool is a crucial one, and the book deals with a complex set of issues that are critical to the city’s future. It is frequently claimed that the biennial format is the wrong place for the art form, but this is simply not true. The book is divided into three parts, each addressing a different aspect of the biennial experience. Part One addresses the art institutions as sites of production and consumption in a capitalist society; Part Two concerns the social conditions of poverty and homelessness; and Part Three looks to the future.

There is a tension there between the audience (who are usually quite passive), and the work being done by the audience – which is partly why documentary filmmaking is more art than medicine. It’s also the difference between Seligmann and investigative reporter Barton Gellman. Seligmann worked with Gellman on a wide-ranging series of stories, while investigative reporter Ted Hughes also worked with Gellman on a wide-ranging series of stories. Seligmann gave up journalism when he joined the Army but continued to write articles for the Army and Marine Corps Times and in 1947 established the Seligmann File, a file on American servicemen who were either active or retired. He was a regular writer for the Times that decade and remains a columnist.Hughes was a reporter for the Marine Corps Times and the Times-Mirror in London who was called up to the Merchant Marine Reserve in January 1950. He joined the navy the same month and served in submarine patrols in the North Atlantic and the Pacific. He joined the Merchant Marine in June 1951 and reported on the war in Vietnam. He was in Vietnam from July 1952 to April 1953 and was part of the U-2 and U-14 spy planes. From 1955 to</text>

There is a tension there between the audience (who are usually quite passive), and the work being done by the audience – which is partly why documentary filmmaking is more art than medicine. It’s also the difference between Seligmann and other documentary filmmakers who have their films made into things that are more memorialised, such as in the case of The Secret Millionaire. That film closes on a particularly bleak note – with HIV/AIDS ravaging Africa – but then moves on to much more positive things.I asked Seligmann about the distinction between visual arts and journalism. He said that while visual arts can be visualised and visualised powerful, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Visual arts journalists, he explained, tend to be more aestheticised than their visual arts counterparts. They tend to focus on the beauty of things, and don’t see beauty in things that are messy, empty and brutish. So visual arts reporters tend to be more objective and dispassionate, whereas visual artists and journalists with a critical eye on beauty are rare. Artists with a more activist eye on beauty are often artists who have done amazing things with their visual arts. Seligmann noted that the introduction of lipstick as</text>

There is a tension there between the audience (who are usually quite passive), and the work being done by the audience – which is partly why documentary filmmaking is more art than medicine. It’s also the difference between Seligmann and investigative journalists like myself. Investigative journalists like to engage with the hidden and the paradoxical. There is a tension there between the audience (who are more likely to be active participants in the world) and the journalism being produced by the audience. Investigative journalists like to engage with the obvious and the evident. There is an element of voyeurism going on. I don’t think that there is any way to read this as disrespecting investigative reporting, but there is an element of the projectors that are differentiating themselves by having a go at it.  	Seligmann added: ‘There is always that tension between the audience and the journalist or producer. Because the audience is the one that is exposed to the work and to the story, and so there is always that tension.’ And there is that tension all the way through to the present: the tension between the audience and the media that produces it.

It’s also the difference between Seligmann and investigative journalist Lesley Tiffey. Tiffey went undercover as a nurse while investigating institutional racism in Ontario's HMO system and came home one morning to find that her clinic had been closed by the provincial government. She went public with her findings and eventually, federal politicians were called in to try to close the clinic. The clinic closed for two years, but since it’s politically unstable and Tiffey was already facing arrest for trespassing, the closure dragged on for years. Eventually, the HMO industry had to be bailed out by selling off hospital assets, and several politicians were forced to resign in protest. Today, medical malpractice lawsuits are filed in Ontario against the government for failing to protect patients when it came to hospital infrastructure. In 1992, the Supreme Court decided in favour of the Ontario Medical Association, which had brought a challenge to the way in which the Hospital Insurance Plan was being run. The court ruled in favour of the hospital chains and the Medical Offices, and in doing so</text>

It’s also the difference between Seligmann and investigative journalist Lesley McTaggart. McTaggart went undercover as an HIV/AIDS activist and uncovered some incredible things, including the inner workings of Dr Seuss’s company, Macmillan, which was developing antiretroviral therapy. These revelations put a spotlight on the company and on the work being done on campus by the researchers’ assistants. These are the kinds of situations that artist Lesley McTaggart would find interesting. She conducted a series of interviews with the researchers, nurse assistants and other staff at Kings College Hospital, where the experiments were taking place. These interviews were done in March 1976 and June 1977, almost simultaneously with each other. The following interview was done with Dr Mary Turner, who was running the experiment at Kings College Hospital. She was conducting a research project into the effects of heat on the human body. Dr Turner was a biochemist and was doing her PhD on the effects of radon on the human body. She was</text>

It’s also the difference between Seligmann and documentary filmmakers. The audience here are people who have just been bombarded with information, and can absorb it. Seligmann, however, has his people spread out all over the place, and is trying to figure out what to do with them. I think that works well for an artist to be developing a community, because if the information overload is too much, the artist is forced to either defer to authorities or to fight the people in power. Even if the people in power are eventually forced to do something about it, the way in which the art is being developed right now is such that it can be perfunctory, ephemeral and easily purged of traces. This is what Seligmann is doing right now: he is quietly organising a series of community meetings to discuss the issue of evictions, and inviting the local residents to take part. These meetings are happening on the ground, in the old post-office building on the corner of Kelvin Grove, with English street corners being</text>

He also co-hosts a weekly podcast, Stitchery, which you can subscribe to or listen to in its entirety. When I met him in January, he told me a story about a time when he was at a party in Liverpool and a friend introduced him to Ella Sobel, who was then working as a journalist for the Liverpool Echo. He asked her what she knew about Liverpool. She said she didn’t know anything about football, but her friend, the actor Tom Hollander, who was playing a character named Jim, had a lot of experience living in the area. Tom was playing it cool and Jim was taking it all personally. So Ella, who was at the party, said she would introduce him to Tommy – the actor – who she had met earlier</text>

Seligmann has his viewers take part in a fictional story that serves as a back story, while other documentary filmmakers align themselves more closely to an idealised past. And there is a difference between the audience and the work done by the audience. The audience is the audience, and once they have a part in the work, they are invested deeply. It’s as if the work were made for them. Seligmann has a particular way of engaging the audience through narrative forms: the way to engage them is to render the world in colorful metaphors, images and figurative language. For him, the audience is like water, and more specifically, like a sponge. When he speaks of the ‘sponge’ in this way, he is not talking about the real thing, but about the metaphor. He uses the metaphor of ‘</text>

I asked Seligmann about the distinction between documentary and journalistic work. He responded that while the former is a kind of surveillance, uncovering things that aren’t supposed to be known, the latter is more like a journalism that comes to grips with the world. The idea is to ask hard questions and reveal as many things as you can about the world. As an artist, I’m interested in situations where there are still things that don’t add up. That’s what documentary works are about. There is a tension there between the audience (who are usually quite passive), and the work being done by the audience – which is partly why documentary filmmaking is more art than medicine. It’s also the difference between Seligmann and other documentary filmmakers. He has his audience on board to help him along, whereas other documentary filmmakers would rather leave audiences frustrated and open to new ideas.I asked Seligmann if he thought it would be possible to combine the two categories of documentary and journalism, or if the kind of journalism that he practices would need to be fundamentally changed in order to accommodate the kind of social change that could be brought about by the two. He replied: ‘No, it would be a radically different kind of combination.’ This is what I mean when I say that a fundamentally different kind of journalism could be built on the same ground.I asked if there were any other kinds of journalists besides those who focus on social change and justice work, and the impact that that can have. Seligmann offered these as examples: journalists with a particular interest in the impact of advertising on the behaviour of consumers; journalists with a particular interest in the impact of national symbols on the behaviour of commercial actors; and artists</text>

It’s also the difference between Seligmann and his students. His students were trained to make art in the same way that journalists are trained to make art, and that’s why art is often misconstrued as being medical. Seligmann himself defines what he means by saying that an artist or a curator has to be able to look at a situation objectively and decide for himself whether what he’s seeing is art or a sham. He also says that the work has to be able to stand on its own two feet. That’s why a documentary like The Shovel would have to be able to take place in a small town or city or in a rural area – because that would mean understanding the local culture and how it’s being celebrated.Interview with Ernest Anguirus, Curator of Public Practice at The Academy of Art and Design at the University of Sydney, Australia, 2015.

What is clear is that the Biennale is leading a cultural revolution. The publics there will be artists, curators, journalists, urbanists, politicians, residents, historians and architects. They will learn, absorb and reflect on the exciting changes taking place all around them. They will be transfixed by the new urban forms that appear everywhere on a global scale, and moved by the power of this absorbed urbanism to engage with the politics of the present and future forms of urban life. But they will also see, hear and understand that there is more to be done. There is a need to understand how art can play a critical role in creating new urban forms, and how art can intervene in the creation of those forms.

Perhaps the publics would be able to take part in the experiment in increasing the capacity of art institutions, or perhaps the aim is to engage artists in creative ways through publics. It is also possible that the mission of the Biennale is to create a shared common heritage – a kind of shared public realm – through sharing, collaboration and exchange that is neither nationalistic nor exclusively confined to a particular cultural group.  [iii] The Biennale has a 2015–16 budget of US$6 million. Whether that shared common heritage is really shared or is a function of access is unclear. It is clear that funding for the project comes from the city and that projects are developed with the city in mind. If the shared common heritage is determined by the city, then the Biennale could conceivably conceivably expand its scope and take part in a ‘different world’.

It is unclear, however, whether this partnership is being renewed on a long term basis, or whether the new administration is seeking to re-impose the New York City Museum of Art’s mission. It is also unclear how the partnership between the New York City Museum of Art and the Biennale will evolve under the new administration. Clearly, the future of the partnership is in doubt.

Perhaps the publics meant by the new venue are those who have recently migrated to the city, or who attend art museums but do not follow the art-related sub-cultures. Art and culture have often been used as a tool of immigration. The Biennale has been criticised for this, especially by local residents concerned about the impact of artifice on local culture. But the organisers’ apparent misunderstanding of the local is also a source of tension. As the Times puts it, ‘the decision to create a museum in the heart of Times Square was also motivated by the hope that the building would be a catalyst for a revitalisation campaign … The museum would stand out against the rest of Times Square, while also serving as a symbol of the city’s cultural past and present … The museum would symbolise the city’s cultural past and present, and bring artistic and curatorial collaboration across historic and contemporary divides’.[iii</text>

It is possible that the new, more integrative, forms of collaboration envisaged for the twenty-first century will see an increase in the participation of artists, but also a decrease in the number of participants. 	[iv] One could argue that the goals of the Biennale are two-fold: (a) to showcase the art of New York City in a sustained way through a permanent and ongoing way; and (b) to foster an understanding of the city as an object of cultural exchange between nations.</text>

In the UK, Green Party co-leaders have called for a boycott of Cains, while artist Ai Weiwei has started a crowdfunding campaign to restore the facade. The campaign has so far raised over US$8 million (UK) and will probably grow, as the project continues to be funded by the New York City Council and developer groups.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has declared a state of emergency in New York and New Jersey as a response to the threat posed by the growing homeless crisis. In response to this, Governor Cuomo has declared a state of emergency in Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as Connecticut and Vermont. Cities across the US are mobilising to reclaim abandoned buildings and decimated local economies from the clutches of the fossil fuel industry.

In Canada, the Alberta Party is in power, and its leader, Rachel Notley, is the Governor in Canada. In Australia, the National Farmers Union is a major player, and its members work in numerous government agencies and non-profits. ‘Community land trusts’ are the new ‘public lands’ and have taken root in federal, state and local government, lending credibility to claims that processes are amenable to challenge under the Constitution. The US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service are major players in this game, with complementary agencies such as the National Park Foundation and National Musicians Assocation providing resources and expertise. The fossil fuel infrastructure supporting these agencies is increasingly questionable, and the potential benefits and deficits are overstated.

The UK’s largest community of climate protesters is based in New York City. In the UK, Green Party co-chair and co-founder Natalie Bennett has been campaigning against the project, calling it ‘an outrageous, dangerous and ineffective use of wasted money’. Bennett is also a leading advocate for action on climate change in the UK, and has been a vocal critic of the UK’s participation in the Paris climate change agreement. She has called for a ‘war on pollution’, and has called for a ‘climate justice’ in the UK. She is a co-founder of the UK’s Green Party, alongside co-chairman Jayne Lawless.Bennett’s call for a ‘war on pollution’ is a novel one, one that comes close to characterising what is being proposed. It is also highly unusual, and arguably not appropriate for a community organisation such as CCC to be calling for a ‘war’, in part because there is no recognised ‘warrior class’ among British military officers and</text>

The UK’s largest community of climate protesters is based in New York City. In the UK, Green Party co-leaders’ tend to be apolitical, but their US-based co-chairman and UK’s President takes a more apocalyptic view of the situation. In an October 2014 address, Mr Trump singled out the UK’s huge and growing Muslim population as a particular threat, and promised to 're-evaluate' the relationship between US and UK security. In the UK, where the bulk of the population live, this would mean de-individuating the city’s infrastructure, from the streets to the rooftops, so as to accommodate large numbers of migrants and refugees. And so it continues.What can communities do to challenge such plans? First, of course, is to educate themselves on the history of the Cains Building and the Cains Thermal Power Station, and the role that their local Cooperatives Councils (and other community organisations) played in its construction. Second, of course, is to get involved in creating alternative energy strategies for the area. Third</text>

In the UK, Green Party co-leaders, Caroline Lucas and co-chair Mary Turner, have both decided to spend more time in the city in the coming months to campaign for local action in support of the City of London’s controversial 'emissions trading scheme'. In the US, 350.org co-founder Kevin Kelly is spending his summer in New York City, while community activists from the East Bay Expressway Coalition are holding their annual meet in San Francisco.In the UK, the decision to spend more time in the city may be controversial, but the fact that Green Party co-leaders Caroline Lucas and co-chair Mary Turner chose to spend more time in the city may also be controversial. In their case, the decision to spend more time in the city may have more social benefits than making the city a site for their political activism. For example, a site-specific project that builds on the success of a community college campus may invite students from nearby colleges to work alongside residents from sustainable local alternative primary and secondary schools</text>

In the UK, Green Party co-leaders’ Alice in Blue and Katrine Dirckinck-Holmfeld arrived in London this week to begin a nationwide tour of homes threatened with demolition. In 2012 Katrine Dirckinholt spearheaded the Green Party’s fight to save the Cains Building, and she’s another of several local activists who helped to found Climate Home Group.Alice in Blue led the local campaign to save the historic copper shipping containers, which were auctioned off on eBay before disappearing into a muddled urban mess. The activists hoped that the local community would come together and save the distressed containers, and the neighbourhood would come together to buy the distressed flatscreen TV and other electronics. The community came together to buy them, and the activists’ political aims came through in the overwhelming majority of the community backing the purchase. The flat-screen TV and other electronics will now be assembled in-house and sent to retail tenants, who will be offered flatscreen TV's as replacements.</text>

In Australia, the centre-left government is considering a national ‘climate change' policy, while right-wing governments are calling for a national ‘oil and gas’ emergency response.

In an open letter to Mayor de Blasio, citizens have also begun to organise around the Cains proposal. The plan is to create a ‘green lane’ through the narrow, empty lot in the middle of the night, allowing vehicular traffic through in the morning and evening. The plan has provoked a legal challenge from the developer, but the High Court has ruled against the city. The City Council has to find another way of funding the project. If the plans are scrapped, the developer will have to find another way of financing the project. The City may try to buy back the electricity from the grid, but this will strip the grid of its renewable energy credits, leaving New York City at a standstill. The City may finance the project through bonds, but this will also strip the grid of its renewable energy credits, leaving New York City without a source of cheap electricity.

In Egypt, Green Party co-leaders want the entire city of Alexandria – 80% of which is owned by the military –to become a National Park. Green Party support for the development of large new nuclear power plants in the UK and the expansion of existing power plants in the US is further fuelled by the belief that the future belongs to the wealthy nations rather than to the developing nations’ people.In the UK, the Green Party is part of the government, and the socialised health-care and education programmes have been highly successful at transforming both the working-class and the non-working-class sections of society.

Meanwhile, Unite Here, the local union for Architects and Engineers, has been calling for a second Biennale of the City of New York.  The proposal has been met with opposition from local residents, who see the opportunity for increased development in an area where they feel under attack.  A second Biennale would exacerbate this situation, creating two parallel universes: the artist-centred art world experience and the ‘real’ life of the city, where residents would be offered a series of incentives to encourage more residential activity, such as reduced property taxes.  A third Biennale would exacerbate the existing unfair competition between public and private art institutions, which they perceive as a threat to their economic</text>

I look forward to seeing you both in Liverpool. I also wanted to add a few more things about the city that have been shaping up to be a rather interesting set of experiences for both of us. For one thing, there’s the sense of foreboding about the state of the city — as you put it, the ‘big black box’ of data that’s gathering in Liverpool is gathering data that’s going to tell a story. For another, there’s the sense that no amount of hype or art will ever bring the city back — that the city is stuck in a never-ending spiral of decline. For a third, there’s the sense</text>

It’s a great idea, a start for a conversation. I’m curious about the ways in which the historical imperative informs your approach to art and the city. I also want to know what you think of when I call your art ‘substantive’. That’s a strong word, but it captures the way in which I feel about your work. You have a way of bringing historical moments to life through what I imagine is a very deliberate and deliberate way of addressing the present through what I imagine is a very deliberate and disorienting way of looking at historical figures and events.

I’m going to be in DF at the end of next month, and I wanted to ask if I could take a look around. It’s a new kind of museum, built like an archaeological dig — complete with galleries, interpretative signage, tables and such — that looks like a gallery of sorts, but with readings and such that peer into other places. I don’t yet know what that means, but it’s a very different kind of museum from what I’ve been accustomed to.I also want to ask you about the new edition of your catalogue</text>

I’m going to have to think about that. The city offers many possibilities, and in this context I’m thinking about the possibility of new forms of entertainment for a city that’s experiencing its fair share of austerity. I have a proposal for what might be known as ‘The City Without End’. It’s an invitation to a monthly public debate, the work of fiction and non-fiction writers's groups, about the place of fiction and non-fiction in shaping what can and cannot be called the city. And it’s a way to start building a relationship with the city's artists and curators, who will be providing valuable feedback and offering valuable ideas</text>

I’m interested in how the term is used today, and in particular in the way in which the term is being used in relation to art spaces: as commodities, or here-and-now events, or collections of objects, or collections of collections, or collections — which I suppose is to be expected of a relatively new field of art. But I think what is worrying is the way in which the term is being used today in relation to the social. I remember,</text>

I had a brief question for you about the notion of ‘home’ in relation to the Biennale. I’ve heard you say that the home for the biennale is the home of the biennial. I’m curious what that means in relation to the present situation. For example, the number of visitors to the Venice Biennale has remained constant, although the number of biennales has declined over the years —</text>
