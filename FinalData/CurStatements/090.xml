Boundary Layer  	The boundary layer is a non-linear surface that articulates spatial and temporal relations, and thus is a critical part of spatialized systems. It is a physical boundary that separates natural spaces (such as grasslands) and constructed spaces (such as cities), and it is an area where power and control are exerted over space and time. In systems with boundary layers, interactions among nodes (such as roads, railroads, pipelines) and chains (such as shipping lines) result in processes of change and they regulate behavior through the use of power and tools. Boundary layers also exist at the interface between physical and virtual spaces, and in that case they too play a critical role in spatialized systems. For example, physical interfaces</text>

The initial research and campaign efforts were led by the Cornell Environment Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The local reach of the project was further strengthened by the collaboration of community planners, politicians, grassroots organisations and other stakeholders.  The local reach of campaign activities was further enhanced by the engagement of artists, photographers, writers and others with a range of expertise relevant to the context and the tasks at hand. The project went beyond just campaigning for or against a project, and sought to create an environment that is conducive to the achievement of a range of socially and politically engaged goals.  A key objective of the project was to re-animate a derelict and long abandoned area of Boston in the public’s imagination, and to that end launched a public sculpture contest entitled  	The Resident.

The initial research and campaign efforts were led by the Cornell Environment Institute at Cornell University, which has a multi-disciplinary center dedicated to environmental analysis and design. Over time, as the story unfolded, other partners, including Cornell students and faculty, came on board to help; some found work within the company, and others found work outside the university as academics, activists or both. The campaign’s end result is a series of five-year plans, which move from the university to the city, from the university to the civil rights movement, from the university to urban development and eventually to the built environment.  The project also includes a sustainable development corporation (SDC) that helps finance the projects, as well as a partnership with Chase Foundation to provide long-term capital for projects through research grants. Chase is a private foundation established in 1905 and is America’s oldest standing foundation to support institutional organisations.

Its project was co-ordinated by the Delhi Council for Civil Society and the Delhi Initiative for Action (DCA). The DCA was established in 2007 to oversee and support civil society in the city, and its campaigns included organising exhibitions, training staff and mobilising large crowds to demonstrate against encroaching real estate and other gentrification projects. The DCA was instrumental in getting the then Planning Commission to re-zone an area around the Taj Mahal, which would have made it one of the most desirable places to buy luxury apartments, and in pushing the then Housing Minister J. Venkaiah Naidu to take up the challenge of creating a Smart City Model for Delhi.</text>

You will see that many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose sports centres, parks, dance studios, flats and even restaurants. Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose hotels and restaurants. The biggest contribution to be made here is being served by the city as an ongoing payment towards its debt. Yet the key to this debt is still the existence of gentrification projects, which feeds off of the self-delusion of local officials and politicians who believe that they are managing the area and that the area is their future. When this fantasy is realised, it is bound to have a negative impact on the broader fabric of the city. So while the ability to observe the world through a prism may well be useful for those engaged in political and economic control, it is wielded far too liberally. This is the predicament of technocratic governments: they are committed to an ideological battle against entrenched poverty and prejudice, and yet are too busy thinking about how to repurpose the areas around the globe that are being destroyed and made poor.Stages 1–4 Descriptions of the economic stages of urbanisation come from various sources.

You will see that many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose sports centres, parks, dance studios, flats and even restaurants. Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose residential complexes. All of this occurs against the backdrop of a rapidly developing and ever-more urbanising metropolis. But whereas many houses that are transformed into multi-purpose sports grounds, parks or flats can be easily reconfigured, those whose transformation into multi-purpose real estate is the direct result of a political struggle or the conscious and manual actions of a few lucky residents, such as squatting, creative management and tough housing laws, are much harder to change. Most of us simply don’t have the power to make such a radical shift without going against the grain of the prevailing system, which is already heavily invested in maintaining its particular design lineage and building new housing for existing residents. Even then, such radical changes would not happen without massive grassroots support, which is already showing signs of fatigue. So while much can be done through legislation and political leverage to transform a neighbourhood, much remains to be done without it.  	Equally important is the fact that the way in</text>

You will see that many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose sports centres, parks, dance studios, flats and even restaurants. Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose hotels, primarily because of the availability of cheap labour. But the real power has come from within, through sharing.  	When the local shopkeeper introduced a pay as you went (BYG) system in the mid-1990s, the pay as you went (PAB) movement started. The name comes from the Greek and Roman philosophers, and it is the organising principle of modern labour. When you buy a product, or a service, from the supermarket, you pay a fee to the supermarket in order to access that product or service. By sharing, or more precisely, sharing according to the quality and quantity of the product or service, PAB enabled fast food chains to reduce costs and open new business models.  	Fast food chains have always been interested in efficiency. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan championed the ethic of shared prosperity. In the 1990s, Wendy's and McDonalds began to promote the idea that if you put enough fries on a roll,</text>

You will see that many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose sports centres, parks, dance studios, flats and even restaurants. Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose residential complexes. But most of all, there has been a great deal of conversion of the neighbourhood – houses into flats, houses into parks, parks into multi-purpose complexes. A lot of people are enjoying the new mix of lifestyles. And of course, there has been an enormous amount of conversion of the neighbourhood – streets into highways, buildings into parks, squares into multi-purpose parks – which has brought a lot of people into the city centre. But this process of park-making and residential park-making is not without risk. There is a real risk that the new mix of lifestyles will bring with it a new breed of squatters. And of course, the speculation on new forms of labour – labour that can be cheap, can be quick and can be unlimited – is another way in which the social costs of the park-making and residential park-making have become massively disproportionate.

You will see that many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose sports centres, parks, dance studios, flats and even restaurants. Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose residential towers. All of this while the neighbourhood continues to suffer through recession and gentrification. Yet none of this is happening because the houses are all in the right place, or even because the city has a magic formula to bring things about. It is because of intelligent policy choices made by local and state governments, neighbourhood organisations, financial institutions and others. They have all agreed to work together, raise funds and implement projects in exchange for a share of the city’s housing projects. This has been a core principle of the Housing Act of 1974, and is what has driven much of the activity taking place in the area. It is a very powerful formula, and it is why so many projects are still developing at a rapid clip. But the formula has two major flaws. The first is the simple fact that the Housing Act does not recognise the area as a city, but rather as a collection of districts. So while it is true that in the centre of the city lies a ‘</text>

Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose residential towers. All of these things are good for the local economy, and are often used as a cover for new, creative or different kinds of use. But they are also good for the world as a whole. A sense of community is a powerful force, and a big part of what makes neighbourhoods great is the ability to share in the wealth created. And so it is that neighbourhoods are being made places in which new life can be created, and old life can be ended. This is a globally ubiquitous process, and yet largely invisible to policymakers and city planners. It is part of what economists call the ‘gospel of the neighbourhood’. It is a kind of communal sharing, creating and contributing to the common good. It is a radical end to the rule of capital. And yet for many people in many cities, including in New York, this kind of gleaning is still possible, or even desirable.Many of these neighbourhoods are in fact becoming more like each other.</text>

Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose residential complexes. All of this builds on the houses that were originally built for a different time, and is often done in the name of profit. But a closer look reveals that most of these transformations have been done without a trace of the original inhabitants. Most of the new developments have been built on the back of the old, and are run by non-professionals. Many of the houses that have been sold for new market-rate housing have never been any good for a living, and many of the houses that have been given to the city for demolition are in fact empty – save for the architectural treasures left behind. The fact that so many people find it convenient to commute into the city centres every day demonstrates how precarious the situation is. If the city is to retain any sense of place, it must provide ways to link up with those who reside elsewhere. Otherwise, the city loses its identity.The ability to observe reality through a prism is a tool that can be used constructively</text>

You will see that many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose sports centres, parks, dance studios, flats and even restaurants. Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose residential complexes. All of this takes place within the framework of a social programme that is being put into place by the city to cater to the rapidly increasing number of residents. So while the city is transforming neighbourhoods, the extent of this transformation is being done inside these neighbourhoods.Inside these neighbourhoods, the city is being transformed not into a social enterprise but into a de-industrial zone where almost all of the jobs are created through the use of robots. One could argue that this is being done at a faster rate than anywhere else in the world. And while this may be true, I would argue that the enormous social, economic and ecological costs associated with this transformation are much greater than the potential gains from this transformation. For example, the potential gains from a robot that looks like a worker but is much more capable of performing complex repetitive tasks, may not be realized for years or even decades, if at all. And while the potential gains from this are enormous, the fact of the matter is that</text>

But it also has definite limits. The ability to observe the world through a prism through which we can change it is far more powerful than the ability to sit by idly and allow it to happen. The ability to observe reality through a prism is possible only for a privileged few, and only within the framework of a tightly controlled and regulated political, economic and social system. Therefore the ability to observe reality through a prism is an enormously powerful tool, and one that can be used liberally. But as the saying goes, the real power comes from within.If you want to see how effective a tool this can be, then take a close look at what has been happening in your neighbourhood. You will see that many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose sports centres, parks, dance studios, flats and even restaurants. Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose multi-purpose hotels, cafes, night clubs, schools or simply places for people to be. But there is far more going on. Many of the houses have had their rooms converted into multi-purpose commercial centres, or even into residential flats. And many of the new developments have incorporated elements from many different sectors of the local economy. In many areas, particularly in the outer-ring areas, the transformation of a neighbourhood isn’t happening yet. People are still renting out rooms or buying houses – though most of them rarely stay for very long. And despite huge investment in infrastructure and businesses, like roads, bridges, tunnels, telecoms and internet, most of the new housing builds don’t make it to the neighbourhoods where most of the people live. Most of the new mixed-use buildings instead make use of the buildings as retail or serve as offices for large corporations. While it is true that many of the people who use these buildings are new hires, most of them</text>

Many houses have been transformed into multi-purpose residential complexes, parks, or even just complexes devoted to the use of the property involved. Yet despite these efforts, the neighbourhood remains fundamentally a place where people live in fear and struggle to access essential services. It is a place where abusers live in quiet impunity, while the oppressed struggle to be heard, to find places to take refuge and to participate in a democratic society.What can we learn from the neighbourhood?I first began to think about this question of social and spatial agency from the vantage point of a spatial architect. I began to understand why there is such a thing as ‘spatial-temporal intersection’. Spatial intersection refers to when one happens to occupy a geographical space in relation to another spatial space. For example, when I live in the neighbourhood of Broadway-Danforth, I am constantly reminded of the importance of the intersection of my work with the lives of people living near the intersection. When I walk down the street, I am acutely aware of the fact</text>

But while the relationship between biennials and art remains fraught, its underlying dynamics must be questioned. It is true that the art market today is more fragmented and unequal than at any time before, with collectors, artists and galleries all seeking the same things from a single source: art. But this is offset by the tremendous power of the artist-curator complex, which can command astronomical prices (especially for contemporary art) and dominate the market through its projects and initiatives. In this dynamic, biennials have become strategic players in a game of organisation. They often result in the emergence of collaborative art-world paradigms, such as the New York Museum of Art’s 2014 Modern Grunge initiative, which sought to reconcile contemporary art with industrial production. Biennials play a vital role in maintaining an open marketplace and fostering a discussion on art’s place in contemporary society. And they often shape what art is made and what it stands for.In the 1990s, art biennials began experimenting with new forms of engagement. They established permanent exhibition</text>

But while the relationship between biennials and art remains fraught, its underlying dynamics must be actively worked out. This is one reason why biennials are often seen as the lesser of two evils, though this is only a superficial view. The art world generally craves a visionary curator, a visionary art administrator, and these are precisely the kinds of roles that biennials can create, foster and foster again, creating ever greater visions of the world they inhabit.Artists, curators and collectors who regularly book themselves in as a guest on contemporary art or contemporary art-historical podcasts should know that they are rarely ever to be taken seriously, nor do they represent the totality of art, culture or modernism. They are often tools, or at least a projection of the prevailing social and economic ideologies and practices of a given society. This is especially true of curatorial appointments; in a given field, a curator may be a leading authority or even a marginal figure, but rarely both. The contemporary art market is populated by people with a wide range of preferences who regularly seek out</text>

But while the relationship between biennials and art remains fraught, its underlying dynamics must be changed. A first step in changing that is, perhaps, necessary, structural reforms to be undertaken within the art world itself, including within contemporary art institutions. That is, changes need to be made in the ways in which contemporary art is organised, controlled and paid for – both nationally and internationally. The changes needed, however, must be accompanied by new media and immersive experiences, and must be participatory. Participation is critical to any successful engagement – and is precisely what contemporary art today requires. And when engagement is accompanied by participation, it is participation without a participation agenda.In this context, biennials today have created multiple modes of engagement that constrain their true potential. Some of those engaged are entirely absorbed in the task of meeting audiences, while others, more ambitious and ambitious projects are undertaken with the support of an artistic director or curator, to meet a wider cultural agenda. But all engage with the notion of the contemporary art world in subtle or inaccessible ways. And while some artists, cur</text>

But while the relationship between biennials and art remains fraught, its underlying dynamics must be changed, and soon. And while there is certainly talent in both, there is also a clear imbalance of power and wealth today. To truly know what art is all about, and how to use it, artists and curators need to be embedded in and embedded in the contemporary artworld. And, more importantly, they need to be part of a collective that is able to influence that art world in powerful ways.This seems like a tall order and even impossible to achieve for contemporary artists and curators. But there are signs of change. In the 1990s, when the Biennale became the dominant form of art exhibition in Venice, for example, a small cadre of artists, curators and art writers were inserted, making the festival visible on the Venetian monuments and museums and allowing its reputation as a cultural event to spread. This was seen by many artists and curators as an important first step in breaking the mould and creating a more authentic self. And, more importantly,</text>

But while the relationship between biennials and art remains fraught, its underlying dynamics must be altered in order to support the latter. What is needed is for biennials to evolve into truly independent cultural entities, to give up some of the control they feel exert over their image making, and to be able to create their own destiny. This may involve giving up some of their contemporary art-world celebrity cachet, or at least giving up some of the classiness that has come to define them. The question then becomes whether there are alternatives open to them. If there are, this book is but one among many that could be written on the subject.

But while the relationship between biennials and art remains fraught, its underlying dynamics must be altered in order to care about the needs of the contemporary art market. Our present economic situation demands that art and biennials be organised in such a way as to meet the needs of the market, and changing that dynamic is as much a part of the job of the biennial as every other facet of the art museum.But how do we change the dynamic? One way is through what is commonly referred to as ‘the biennial model’: the art institution creating cultural change through incremental changes, often on a local level but increasingly global in scope. The biennial is a globalised form, and art biennials around the world are increasingly globalised too. Art biennials around the world are now more like museums than like artisans, exhibiting a consistent range of artists from many countries, over a sustained period. And unlike artisans, they do not necessarily have the resources or the will to repurpose or recycle artists’ art, or to share it with</text>

This is the only way to truly know what art is, and to truly know how art is made. Art and biennials are made in different forms – sometimes quite fundamentally – but fundamentally complementary to each other.Art and biennials have always been made in the image of the artist, and the gallery as a whole, and have always been made to some extent in the image of the artist and his audience. But although the gallery has always been a fundamental part of the artworld, the biennial has shifted from the gallery to the museum, and while the museum has a great deal of artistic potential, it is increasingly rare for it to produce meaningful works with lasting effects. So while the biennial has moved from the gallery to the museum, it must still find ways to connect with the gallery in order to impact cultural life in meaningful ways. Art</text>

The form must evolve, and biennials, and the people who create them, must change, but few can truly be expected to share the transformative transformative power enjoyed by those with a global reach.Art and biennials is a name that has stuck, despite changes in ownership, institutionality, and even their current form, because it is universal and unchangeable. Its universality means that it is impossible to remove a biennial from its historical location – it is, after all, the only name that is synonymous with the current state of the art in that particular artform. And its instability, which is intrinsic to its nature, means that it is equally possible that a biennial will break away from its current location and return to its historical location, and vice versa. This dynamic is particularly evident in the art world, where changing cultural representation is a constant refrain.Artists and</text>

But while the relationship between biennials and art remains fraught, its underlying dynamics must be changing. A change. Change is happening inside the biennial structure, and art and curatorial departments everywhere are catching on to the fact that changing dynamics and different sorts of change are needed. Biennials are getting shorter in age, are more dispersed, are more complex, and often need to be reined in by art authorities. And art and curatorial departments everywhere are catching on to the fact that, increasingly, art is more visible, more ubiquitous, and more entwined with life in urban centres than anywhere else.Art and curatorial departments everywhere are catching on to the fact that, increasingly, art is a globally visible object of exchange, with significant amounts of contemporary art being created outside of any particular art gallery or museum. And they are catching on to the fact that, increasingly, art is both the arbiter and mediator of a given constellation of desires, desires that are most directly influenced by the world around it.This all sounds extremely Nuyumbad-like.</text>

Aims must be set aside, budgets must be cut, artistic demands met, agendas purged. And while these changes may be painful for artists and curators, they are also necessary, and indeed exciting. After all, biennials were created to meet the needs of a changing art market, and today they are often accused of being antiquated museums of art, if not outright bastard children of modernism. Yet this accusation is often leveled at the art and cultural institutions that support, or even celebrate, modernism, and contemporary art generally. Biennials are, in effect, seen as a contemporary art form that has to be actively supported. And while this may be true of certain art institutions, such as Tate Modern, it is not always true of others, and not all art institutions are on this accusation. For example, when the Tate Modern was founded in 1888, and continued until 1971, it did not curate exhibitions, exhibitions, or any form</text>

The only one in Sydney, in the early 1990s, was the late David Hockney’s, a rare mixture of historical and artistic interethnic biannual. Biennials in Australia have generally been marginalised, absent or heavily criticised; rarely have their works been exhibited or profiled. In most cities, they are a last resort, a ‘glimmer of light’ in the darkness. Despite this history, the biennial has recently found common cause with the art fair and the urban hotspot. The first of several symposia, the biennial is a ‘peddler’ of cultural resources, frequently touted as an alternative to the urban sprawl that is pushing many artists and curators away.

The Biennale of Sydney has been a biennial since its inception and is the longest-running of the series. The Biennale of Melbourne has been a biennale ever since and is a perennial. The Biennale of Brisbane has been holding its own since its inception in 2004, and is a perennial too. Biennials have their moments of mystique and grandeur, of course, and even if these moments are characterised by intense internal contradictions and internal rifts, they always manage to find a way to feed off the energy of the moment. This is true of every art form, but unlike most art forms, art does not have a fixed and predictable number of performances and shows. The Biennale of Sydney has done this through the years, through a combination of great marketing campaigns and a large-scale public participation programme that ensured that every possible performance was being made.

The Biennale of Sydney is the only known instance of an Australian biennial organising its activities internationally. The Biennale of Melbourne is the only known example of an Australian biennial organising its activities locally. We do not know whether these practices were followed in other cities where biennials then existed, but it is possible that some, such as the later example of the Melbourne Biennale, continued to operate in places such as Liverpool, despite the presence of international visitors. It is also possible that the internationalisation of biennials in other cities was encouraged by the fact that these biennials then increasingly looked to the biennial as a source of revenue, and began to rely on biennial fees as a source of legitimacy. Biennials within cities are more readily identifiable, more easily quantified and more easily map-basedised than those of other biennials, which makes them more difficult to categorise and measure.

In 1972, the Biennale, with its large public audiences, opened the way to the museum, which would dominate the following twenty-five years.[1]It is always better to see them for what they are: an opportunity for art to be made in a context, rather than for museums to impose their will upon us.—Gareth White, Talking Mural, 1972.

The Biennale of Sydney has its origins in a 1987 policy of subsidiarity that saw the Australian Council of International Arts (Aco) funded to the tune of up to $1.25 million per annum from the Biennale Board in exchange for a percentage of the goods and services produced. The policy was opposed by many cultural groups, and saw the creation of an independent curator as the only way to address the structural racism and sexism that were preventing women and racialised people from fully participating in cultural life. So in 1988, the Aco launched the Biennale of Sydney, a plan that saw the agency tasked with organising the goods and services of art and culture in the city’s streets re-purposed as a biennale. The plan was opposed by many community organisers, and saw the creation of a multi-disciplinary curator as the only way to address the structural racism and sexism that were preventing artists and communities from fully participating in cultural life.[7]The Biennale of Sydney</text>

In this analysis, cultural theorists can identify three types of representations of the past and contemporary world: historical, architectural and artefactual. The former two types of representations take the form of sets of relations existing between people at various levels: oral, visual and verbal. The latter type of representation is artefacts, mythical or mythical in origin, and is made up of things or individuals that have political or social significance. Cultural theorists can identify three principal types of cultural capital: physical (monuments), ideological (ideology), and mental (concepts). Cultural capital is created when an organisation, individual</text>

One scholar who has accepted this invitation is Steven Chua, an administrator in the California Academy’s collections and archives, who has written a book about his time there, titled The California Academy: Curator of Unrecyclable Things.1  Chua has been called upon to explain the academy’s decision to collaborate with a writer whose work they consider to be a threat to the social order they have painstakingly nurtured. Whether the responsibility for the decision rests with the academy, which claims to represent all Californians, or with the writer, whose work they regard as a threat to the social order they have constructed in their own image, I have no way of knowing, and neither do you.2  If the California Academy’s memory is to be believed, the academy was established to promote knowledge, not to produce it.

Arjun Appadurai has commented that the contemporary art of &quot;soft power&quot; derives from the idea that power struggles are not legitimate and that conflict resolution is ‘real life’, and that ‘every conflict resolution requires action, and that’s why contemporary artists’ art tends to be political.’ Appadurai has it backwards. Power struggles are legitimate, and are part of daily life, but there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what art can and cannot do, and what its place is in the arts. Today, power struggles are understood as part of a geopolitical and economic multi-front war being waged against the world as a whole. It is not the case with art, which has a traditional role of intervening outside of its field of work, but has recently found itself thrust into the midst of a political and economic</text>

One scholar who responded to the invitation became interested in how the records of the California Academy of Sciences might be accessed and utilized in the academy’s ongoing mission of archiving and documentation. He began a two-year residency at the academy, during which time he worked closely with the archives staff to digitize the Academy’s historic records and to produce an electronic version of the recordERS, an archive of ideas and practices from the academy’s past. The project was funded by the academy and the California Museum of History, which also funded the research and writing.  An even more ambitious and politically-engaging project, but with much higher ambitions, was undertaken by artist duo Momentary Monument – Momentary Wallpaper (2010–ongoing) and New Angeles Ground (2010–ongoing), both born of a collective experience of witnessing the displacement of nearly all public art from California's San Fernando Valley.

The new scholars will contribute to uncover the secrets of the California Academy of Sciences and bring to light some of the academy’s most mysterious documents and objects.7  The reports also identify ten future scholars selected through a competitive process to join the Academy’s Curatorial Faculty, who will work with ten artists and designers to create a new generation of scholars who will understand art and design from a new perspective. The ten selected scholars will work closely with the artists and designers to identify and engage with cultural landscapes that are new to them, and to discover the processes that create new art forms and future urban possibilities.8  The ABACUS Program is a new kind of museum: it will be a place where the past and the future can be found and shared,</text>

The Curtis Knight Master’s thesis, originally presented in 2012, investigates the relationship between the California Academy of Sciences and the National Museum of the American Indian, focusing on the academy’s role in the ideological struggle over Native American and urban cultures. In the 1970s and 1980s, the academy hosted a series of protest actions, including the ‘Black Sunday’ massacre of over 1,000 protesters in Los Angeles’s La Brea’s Walk, and the assassination of over 200 Native activists during a 1976 protest in San Francisco’s Union Square. The C.A.S. Master’s thesis considers how the academy continues to engage with these historical episodes, while also asking: how does the biennial form, its historical curatorial leanings, and its relationship to those who inhabit the city today participate in this historical narrative?

A second example of a system that actively exploits cultural capital is the way in which the California Academy of Sciences and the California Academy of Art acquire, exchange and host cultural practices: pedagogical practices, crafts, practices, and objects. The California Academy of Sciences and the California Academy of Art acquire cultural practices from the Academy, while the Museum of Modern Art exchanges cultural practices with the Museum of Modern Art’s Division of Exhibitions and Pest Control. In both the museum and the academy, cultural production occurs through a series of collaborative agreements between scholars, artists, curators, administrators and others. The cultural practices that have come to be considered part of the Academy’s Curatorial Faculty are a result of years of collaborative negotiation, mutual aid and collaboration. The outcomes of these negotiations are situated in a contract between the Academy and the Museum of Modern Art, which forms part of the Museum of Modern Art at California Academy of Sciences.1 </text>

The request for proposals represents the logic of the academy’s radical reconfiguration: the historical, literary and photographic materials it hopes to gather into one archive, and the objects into which it may place them. The radical reconfiguration is itself a tactic of the academy’s administrative life. It is a system that produces and distributes material that is often times more readily accessible than its authors or creators wish to admit to exist or be. The material that has been placed in the collective memory of memory, whether it is vernacular, the archive, or the actual museum, is a product of years of administrative action.1  For instance, the California Academy of Sciences, which has an estimated collection of over 200,000 objects, frequently issues research notes about the objects it acquires through its business of collecting. These research notes are compiled into a catalog called the CASSA Digital Collections (CCDC). The notes, which are 140</text>

It’s a mapping tool.And yet it’s also a way of understanding how data is used. And this is what I mean when I say that Big Data is a language that ‘flows together’ and ‘connects us to create richer and more beautiful worlds’. Data mining, as the term is often misused, exploits the ambiguities of data to produce new possibilities and entices users into richer scenarios. For example, if you synthesise all the environmental data gathered on the Sahara Desert and bring them together with national climate data and land cover maps to produce a map of the Middle East that better illustrates the connections between the two parts of the world, you could call that ‘the Big Picture’. Such a mapping would strip away the borders between the regions, showing the vastness of the continent as a continent spread across multiple regions.

It would show not only the links between industries, but also the movements of people as they move between regions. It would allow you to move quickly without having to stop somewhere and look up information about every single person who has moved through the region in the last 24 hours. Such maps could be made with data from aircraft, ships, planes and sensors, and other infrastructure that supports analysis and visualisation. And they could be made in any language. The question is: what kinds of linguistic tools would be useful for the job?  In 2007, I worked as an intern for a year at an American data mining firm called Ximenez. This was my first job. I ended up becoming a developer and administrator working on the side. The company was developing a mapping application called Stormfront. The name Stormfront was a play on words: two synonyms meant the same thing. Two totally different uses of the same word.

Such a mapping would make the idea of the ‘climate change’ out of date, since we would know that the climate is changing because of the increasing amounts of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. But such an understanding would miss a larger dynamic that is unfolding all around us, in the form of deforestation, desertification, rising sea levels and the effects of a feedback loop of other anthropogenic anthropogenic global-warming phenomena. These phenomena are complex and multi-lingual and require a great deal of interpretation, so it’s easy to misunderstand what’s being said or done in a given context. It’s much harder to comprehend the othering factor of power, money and political systems that constantly intersect with one another, and so it’s with us to engage in such complex social and political processes that are built on ambiguity, confusion and displacement. But such ambiguity and displacement is a much greater obstacle to action because it undermines the incentives of those with whom we work</text>

It’s a mapping tool.And yet it’s also a way of understanding how data is used. And this is what I mean when I say that Big Data is a language that ‘flows together’ and ‘connects us to create richer and more beautiful worlds’. Data mining, as the term is often misused, exploits the ambiguities of data to produce new possibilities and entices users into richer scenarios. For example, if you synthesise all the environmental data gathered on the Sahara Desert and bring them together with national climate data and land cover maps to produce a map of the Middle East that better illustrates the connections between the two parts of the world, you could call that ‘the Big Picture’. Such a mapping would strip away the borders between the regions, showing the vastness of the continent as a continent spread across multiple regions. Such a mapping would allow you to travel between those regions and the other parts of the world. Such a mapping would reveal new possibilities for how to live together, making the society of the future appear more real and the landscape more alive.A more general concept than ‘region’ is ‘coded’ ‘segment’, a denotation of something that is, or, something that is not. For example, ‘region code 3030’ indicates the region code for Alberta, Canada; ‘region code 6121’ indicates the region code for New York and California.’ ‘region code 3030’ represents the beginning of an urban development project in Alberta that would eventually encompass six coastal communities. ‘region code 6121’ represents the region code for Minnesota and Wisconsin.’ In both ‘3030’ and ‘6121’, the coloniser takes the place of the defeated.’4 The</text>

This mapping, and the possibility that it could be contextualised around particular historical events, would draw users away from their current locations and would allow people to explore ‘new possibilities’. Such possibilities would exist in and through the construction of new cities, but they would be able to generate and deploy them in ways that connect to current needs and desires. For example, the construction of new airports could be driven by the desire to expand passenger and freight capacity, while the production of natural gas could be supported by the production of shale gas, which is increasingly under threat from over-exploitation and climate change. More and more data is gathering about the people and places that are affected by climate change, and it is enabling not only new ways of organising cities, but also of creating new kinds of experience. So, the possibilities for new kinds of experience are manifold and open to discussion and design.

It’s a way to see the world through a single set of eyes. And while the construction of such a map is a ways off, we can already begin to see an improvement in the way in which our cities are designed and constructed. A few cities, such as New York and London, have already taken this idea and applied it to their urban environments. But since such an approach would be nothing short of a ‘Big Data revolution’, it has to be contextually related to other developments in the data-rich world we live in. Otherwise, there is a risk of this mapping becoming an island within the broader data-mining machine.Download this article as PDFEmily Pringle and Vera CharneyPreviousNextEmily Pringle and Vera CharneyImage courtesy of CIRCAIRCambridge, UK and IRIN, UK.

It would show how cities emerge, showing how they were built on fossil fuels and how the environments they are constructed in are threatened with collapse. It would show how trade routes exist beyond the cities, showing how pipelines run alongside the desert as a landscape-temperature-controlled transalpine corridor.

The question is what can be done to create an alternative future city, and what are the tools to create it? This is what the public realm is all about. It’s about not being confined by the city’s logic and confinement. It’s about more than the buildings on either side of the ‘urban divide’ – it’s about the biennial as a planetary event. So what can the public do to create a different future city? One way is to identify their top five challenges and prioritize them according to the importance of the city at a microscopic level. For each challenge, the Public Realm team members would assign a priority number to a person in the city, and the person with the highest priority would get the project started. The next step is for the person with the most potential to contribute to the project to initiate the conversation. The next step is to request that the Public Realm team members reconsider their decision, and for the person with the most potential to be part of the next iteration to actively participate. This could mean engaging in a parallel universe of their own making, creating a new art project or even forming a new startup to provide alternative transportation infrastructure</text>

It’s about not being confined by the city’s frameworks and laws, and being able to participate in creating its reality.What can be done? This is the big question for the future of the biennial, and it’s a big chance for biennials to reinvent themselves – reinventing what’s expected of them by the city, and creating new paradigms within the city that they can adopt. There are a number of projects that are developing across Turkey that aim to address this question, and many more that are developing in other parts of the world. There are also many other projects that aim to address a different set of questions, such as the Turkish Philharmonic undertaking to acquire world-class musicians, or the Turkish Museum undertaking to create a world-class museum of Turkish art and culture. However, in this assessment, the biennial as a concept is structurally unable to contribute to address all the questions being raised by the current biennial format, and these are the projects that are</text>

The question is what can be done to create an alternative future city, and what are the tools to create it? This is what the public realm is all about. It’s about not being confined by the laws of the city, or the city’s laws, or the state’s laws. It’s about the idea of the public realm as an alternative to the law, the state, and the economic realm. In other words, it’s about a public realm that doesn’t fit into the framework of the law or economic realm. This is what William Julius Wilson, the American philosopher, called the public realm. It’s a public realm because it’s occurring simultaneously within and without it. It’s possible that in the future, when all biennials cease to be, a completely different public realm may arise, one that fits into the existing urban infrastructure better, creates more jobs and provides better public conveniences. But until then, we must remember that the public realm is the realm of the law, and the law is the realm of the public. It’s this distinction that historian Amy Jacobs makes in her</text>

It’s about not being confined by the present, and being able to participate in the future.  One of the first things that the public offered to do was to create a ‘Future City’ Twitter account and post ‘future city events’ there. We took this as a starting point, and from there we iterated this on an ongoing basis, bringing events into the account as we went. We’d also created an online game where people could submit ideas for future cities, and also invited local creative professionals to develop an alternative future city. We invited artists to develop an alternative future city using our assets and concepts, and invited local and international creative professionals to explore how art can be used to address a perceived future city conundrum. We invited artists to design an alternative future city using our organisation and resources, and invited local architects and designers to explore how art can be used to create a perceived future city. The aim of this process was to find an alternative to the present, and hopefully to live in</text>

The question is what can be done to create an alternative future city, and what are the tools to create it? This is what the public realm is all about. It’s about not being confined by the city’s governance and control mechanisms. It’s a space where citizens can be present alongside city-dwelling entities, interacting constructively and destructively. It’s a place where power can be challenged and new spaces created, challenging old hierarchies and producing new hierarchies to be challenged as well.  Comparing New York to the Biennial Los Angeles, the former through its multiplicity of museum-going options, and the latter through its biennial, which in turn, by virtue of its titular format, offers multiple viewing options, including non-museum visits, within which one can simultaneously appreciate the artworks and the socio-political context of the projects. What distinguishes the Biennial from other artworld exhibitions is that it is, for the first time in many years, offering both a direct and an indirect look into the future, through artworks that’ve been put together from various places and times.

The question is what can be done to create an alternative future city, and what are the tools to create it? This is what the public realm is all about. It’s about not being confined by the city’s frameworks and not belonging to a city. It’s about the emergence of new cities, and the public realm as a place where these emergence are possible. The biennial is the most powerful of these tools, because it has the potential to change the face of cities, and cities change the face of the world. It’s possible to attend a biennial and not be a star, it’s possible to be a star, but it’s also possible to become a star and become something completely different. As biennials become more powerful, the question becomes how to become more present in the cultural landscape. In my opinion, the answer to that is to become culturally embedded. That’s what star-studded art shows are all about. They’re about people finding ways to be part of the art – to become culturally embedded in the art, and thus, in effect, become artists themselves.In effect,</text>

The question is what can be done to create an alternative future city, and what are the tools to create it? This is what the public realm is all about. It’s about not being confined by the present, and the inability of contemporary urban planning to achieve that. The notion of the modern urban space doesn’t exist in an ideal, fully realized form in the world we know, and so the biennial form begins to obscure this need for a ‘world view’. The biennial world view therefore becomes something that exists in contradiction to the world we actually live in. It’s a fiction created in contradiction to our world view. And so we move from the biennial to the present, and from the biennial to the social. In the former case, the biennial acts as a placeholder; it doesn’t know what to do with us. It establishes the parameters of what can and cannot be said in the city, and how we should behave in the city (and the world). It does this in part through what it calls a ‘past’ – the event as a set of practices that were common in that past, and through</text>

The question is what can be done to create an alternative future city, and what are the tools to create it? This is what the public realm is all about. It’s about not being confined by the city, about possibility, about invitations to be present alongside the urban process, and about the creation of one’s own future city. The public realm is the place where the biennial can be located in a different way – and where the public can contribute to making that city better.  The biennial’s current format of gathering together over decades to engage with a particular set of ideas, issues and projects seems to be the wrong way to engage with the public realm. It’s the medieval thing – a set of oaths, vows, and promises – but it’s also about as much participation as possible while still respecting the importance of participation. When we do things out of the way we hope that they will become public, but in the wrong place, and the public has a right to be there. We believe in giving things away as much as we can, and participating in the public good, so we do things in the public realm that we wouldn</text>

The question is what can be done to create an alternative future city, and what are the tools to create it? This is what the public realm is all about. It’s about not being confined by the city’s rules and regulations, and being able to roam free and create alternate, sometimes quite fantastical, futures. It’s a place where art, urban development and any urban process that has a physical or conceptual bearing on the present are allowed to happen. It’s a contradiction in terms, but it’s also a really exciting and powerful thing to be able to do. The curatorial conceit of the Biennial is to render the physical world as virtual, but in a way that allows for the creation of alternative, perhaps ‘more physical’ futures. And so, the question becomes: what are the precursory conditions that allow us to imagine a different future? What are the conditions that allow us to imagine a different present? How do we create alternatives in the absence of established forms? 	Sometimes the precursory conditions are created through the very act of coming into being – in other words, they emerge from the very processes</text>

It’s about not being confined by the city’s public realm, which is dominated by the city’s public. 	Since the middle classes are dying, and there’s no salvation for them, the public realm is the place where people can come together to discuss and create alternatives, to discuss the consequences of their behaviours, to brainstorm possible solutions. It’s a place where alternatives can be found, debated and critiqued. But it’s also a place where things that’re not ideal can still be improved, invented and built upon. It’s a place where people can’t control what’s happening, and thus it’s a place where problems can’t be fixed. 	In an ideal world, the public realm would be a place where people could ‘choose their own destiny’. It would be a place where people could stop being coddled by the state and pursue their destinies.

They are not curiosities, but they are curiosities in their own right. The 1893 Venice Biennale is a good example of a biennial that followed a regular, not-for-profit, cultural centre. The Biennale, which took place in both Venice and San Marco, offered a unique insight into the culture of the older Venetian city. The city was mapped, surveying the historical collections, and digitising the works in the collection – something that had never been done before. The digitised works were catalogued and images of each work were produced that allowed the public to trace the movements of each work. This allowed the public to explore in parallel the history of the Venetian city, tracing its production and artistic terrors during the 1920s and 1930s, and its transformation during the 1950s and 1960s. The digitised works provided a way to imagine the city as a data-rich, high-performance computing system that could simultaneously display massive amounts of information and to be driven by creative professionals.

    <text>propose a biennial based on AI that draws its inspiration from the contemporary global economy but also from the anthropocene in which we inhabit the end stages of its history.This is the proposal that was put forward by the Zoological Society of Dublin and its president, Prof Brenda Ireland. I thought it was a really interesting proposition because it was this radical proposition in a city that was becoming increasingly aware of its economic economic future and its ecological predicament. The Biennial had been founded in 1876 by the Dublin Zoological Society and was run by Dublin Zoological Society President Prof Thomas Donohue. It was a not-for-profit organisation with a curatorial staff. The Dublin Zoological Society had been founded in 1840 and was a non-profit organisation. The Biennial started in 1897 and had a biennial schedule until 1974. Biennials are curatorial interventions in the city that occur on a regular basis. They are not curiosities, but they are curiosities in their own right. The 1893 Venice Biennale was a case in point.[2] By the turn of the century, the city was awash with biennials. The American anthropologist Franz Boas, in his book The Anthropology of Critique, declared that the biennial was the ‘episodic’ of the new ‘culture’.[3] He catalogued the many curatorial interventions that had contributed to define the biennial as we knew it – the ‘impact’ of which was measured in the number of books it sold, or the number of exhibitions it sponsored. In doing so, he gave cultural-criticality a quasi-religious aura. In the early twentieth century, the biennial became the institution of art appreciation through which cultural theorists such as Franz Boas sought to define the boundaries of what constituted a cultural representation. Boas’ anthropology, his ideas about the cultural, revolved around notions of difference, displacement, and the postulates of identity. Cultural theory, in turn,</text>

The 1882 and 1889 San Francisco Biennials, on the other hand, were curiosities in their own right. And as biennials become more and more internationalised, the logic of their appearance in a city like Dublin or New York changes: they are the ultimate objects of cultural exchange in a metropolis that is internationally visible. So the Biennial that we imagined for Dublin in the late 1990s did have a ‘contemporary art’ component to its content, but it was also a ‘contemporary art’ that was simultaneously global in its economic signification and was internationally visible in its own right. The concept of the biennial as a ‘contemporary art exhibition’ is a complex one. It starts with the observation that the biennial is a ‘contemporary art form’ and that, today, it</text>

The 1893 Venice Biennale, for instance, was a ‘curatorial intervention’ in a city where cinemas and other forms of mainstream exhibition were checking history books, and the mass media were reporting on the increasing wealth gap. The biennial’s 1923–24 Venice Biennale drew over 1,000 artists from all over the world. At that time, the American anthropologist Richard Florida said: ‘A biennial’ needs a core set of skills, a public relations machine, a steady stream of publications and a permanent base of public support.’[2] (And Florida is hardly an anomaly; many contemporary artists subscribe to the biennialist philosophy.)[3] The public relations machine that Florida describes is the biennialist’s answer to the media: a toolkit, including the biennial itself, that artists can use to do real and valuable things in the city – things like planting trees or creating public spaces – while being assured of a steady stream of checks</text>

The biennial’s prominence in Dublin coincided with the city’s economic development, which had begun in earnest with the Giro d'Italia in 1889. The Giro d'Italia had been founded by Italian naturalists Alessandro Lazzarato and Paolo Portoghesi, and it was through the Giro d'Italia that Biennials would later be founded and take on an institutionalised form. The Lazzarato and Portoghesi’s interest in the ancient world was apropos here, since this was the era of Darwin, who was mostly thought of as the genius who figured in the structure of evolution. Indeed, Portoghesi’s own project in the 19th century was largely imagined as a response to Darwin’s ideas. But the emergence of modern biology as a discipline in the early twentieth century opened up</text>

They are not curiosities, but they are curiosities in their own right. The 1893 Venice Biennale is a good example of a biennial that was curatorial in its own right. The significance of this observation cannot be overstated. The current demand for archaeological and historical documentation, access to archives and information that are difficult to access in a regular way, and the existing financial constraints mean that there is limited historical and archival material in Dublin. So the Biennale needs to create a platform that will allow it to intervene in the city as a platform for a series of events that are written and overseen by Prof Ireland. This is the platform that the Biennale discussed with Dublin City Council during the public consultation process for the Biennale to be able to write its own script and create its own history.As a publication, the Biennale’s scope of involvement in Dublin is extensive. It publishes the Dublin Chapter of the Society of Antiquaries and Archaeologists. It organises the Dublin Fringe, which brings together renowned artists, curators, writers and others with a shared</text>

The 1893 Venice Biennale and the 1998 Museo do Vale do Rio both attempted to replicate the idea of the biennale in a city, but in the main they were individual curiosities that occurred only a few years apart. The 1893 Venice Biennale, for example, offered a virtual zoo of exhibits – a performance, a street performers, a sculptor, a circus, a restaurant, a museum – designed to give the impression of being in a zoological journal. The only problem was that the city was too busy that summer to put on a zoo, which meant that the only animals available were the exotic: lions, tigers, and so on. The only animals available in Venice at that time were the homeless, which made the city look bad and made the Biennale look good. But the real stars of the show that year were the falcons and the eighteen-wheeler that Clement Greenberg designed and Benjamin N. Cardinale adapted.

Arsenale and San Marco are the areas around the Biennale grounds. The Principale is the venue for the yearly meeting of the Venice Biennale Board. The Markonzi, Arsenale and San Marco neighborhoods are the areas around the Biennale�s present sites. The area around the Arsenale is a very valuable real estate market, with high-end commercial buildings lining the avenues leading to the buildings. The area around the Principale is a major international port and gateway to the world of fashion, with high-end residences lining the corridors leading to the streets. In other words, the area is a major transit point for people from all over the globe. The area is also a major repository of biennials, with collections stretching back hundreds of years.

The point of the 1908 Venice Biennale, as we know, was to celebrate its first Venice International Exhibition; the first one took place in January that year. The Biennale’s real work began in earnest in earnest in late January that year, when the city council decided that the Biennale should be called the ‘Venice Biennale’, in homage to the old Venetian museum, which was razed in the process. The name stuck. The event was renamed the ‘1876–78 Venice Biennale’, in homage to the old counter, which became the headquarters of the Israeli Museum, which is housed in a former bakery that was once a pharmacy. The name stuck. The Biennale expanded to other cities in the world, but its roots are in Dublin. In 1989 the Biennale was relocated to Ireland and now the Dublin Programme of the Orange Free State Arts School,</text>

The Armenian and Azerbaijani biennials are examples of curiosities that are more experimental and confrontational in their curatorial approaches.The Balkans Biennale offered a unique window into the region’s contemporary urban landscape through a series of self-published novels based on real-life experiences in the region. The Bosnian, Montenegrin and Romanian biennials derived their inspiration from the region’s rich cultural and historical heritage, its diverse landscapes and their diverse peoples – a region, the author imagined, with which one could live together in peace and harmony across the millennia to come. But while the biennials themselves offered a window into this imagined region, they also lent a certain voyeuristic quality to the region that set it apart. They appeared</text>

But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as a way to identify this art.2. The biennial as a curatorial strategy.  The biennial has recently entered a new phase, one that places greater emphasis on the artist-performer relationship. Biennials have become rarefied, opaque, and oriented towards their patrons: the wealthy and powerful individuals who, in turn, consume the art they produce. But this kind of specialization is common to all art forms, and it is precisely this kind of aggregation that biennials are meant to prevent. Biennials are meant to be enfused, to draw together diverse elements into a common whole. And this kind of wealth is fuelling what art biennials have in common: their business model depends on rich people being able to afford it. To some extent, this is even true of museums. In most museums, the rich get richer as more people visit, so this kind of scarcity is a commodity in itself.  The new biennial form has its critics</text>

In an ideal world, the biennial would resume its long tradition of showcasing the most salient artistic works from its premises, while generating new creative outputs around the world. But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as a way to identify, present and deliver this art. Art is usually presented as a commodity (along with its values), but its value is in the form of a complex set of relations that arise between people and art. The biennial has become a form of tourism artefact, and its value is in part realised in these relations. Does the biennial have a place in a city anymore?  The answer is a resounding ‘yes’. The biennial is a spectacular image that appears in any city, and New York City has produced quite a collection of them. But it is the rare biennial that offers a complete survey or analysis of artistic practice in the city. That is, anything beyond the usual index of things produced by the biennial, and the next step is a kind of a ‘topology’ of things produced by the biennial, listing all the elements that have contributed to the creation of the art produced in that city. This is a kind</text>

In an ideal world, the biennial would resume its long tradition of showcasing the most salient artistic works from its premises, while generating new creative outputs around the world. But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as a major reason for this. The question is whether the biennial can find new ways of supporting the artist-centred art exhibition that it started, and which it continues to support with funds from various sources. In a previous incarnation the biennial might have its funding come from the local community, local businesses, cultural organisations and other interested parties. But in the current political climate and economic imbalance, this is no longer the case. The biennial is funding itself, and many other arts organisations, in ways that only add to the biennial’s enormous financial load. The real battle, then, becomes between the biennial and other arts institutions that are increasingly stretched to breaking point financially, politically and even physically. Biennials are no longer the major arts institutions in the city, and there is a real chance that a smaller arts organisation might be set up, run and funded by the new administration. But even if this were to occur, the biennial would still dominate in terms of</text>

But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as an example of the failure of contemporary art appreciation. In a recent survey of artworks in the N.F.C., I found that only a small number of artists had their works exhibited at the larger biennials, and many of those who did were either new or at least had their works screened or rejected by the museum. I asked the artist who had co-curated the Venice Biennale that year, Paolo Portoghesi, to reflect on the event.  His answer was short and sweet: ‘The Biennale was not a failure because of the curators, but because the art was not shown.’  He went on to argue that the problem with contemporary art is that its focus is too narrowly defined, and that there is a tendency to overload the spectator with images of the same image over and over again, in an endless cycle of repetition. The key to overcoming this tendency, he said, was in the artist’s arsenal</text>

But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as an example of this. New galleries spring up in response to biennials – new kinds of museum – but they are often criticized for being too focused on art and its production and consumption, and not enough on the socio-political and economic contexts that foster and fuel artistic production.  The NNFC might try to shift this focus, showing new art as a way to connect with the city at a deeper level, showing the connections between art and political organisation but also showing underlying art production processes that generate creative outcomes but are also important in generating knowledge and understanding.  A new exhibition format might be introduced, with paintings or small objects placed in categories or arranged chronologically, as a way to bring art from different times or places together.  The main question for the future of art in the city is what kind of experience can the city bring to bear on artistic production? Art’s real power comes from the space it occupies, and the experience of that space – the art’</text>

But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as an example of the city’s robust cultural performance. New artists are being enticed away from the biennial by bargains on the black-hole of low prices and poor performance. Meanwhile, art-world titans are poaching each other as competitors for art-negative venues, feeling the urban-design effects of this glut. The NNFC might be able to build a dedicated art-focused venue, while the artists are enticed away by the opportunity to work in art-rich venues such as the Chisenhale Gallery and Tate Modern. But how to connect the art with the events that are reshaping the city and the community, while providing an alternative for art-lovers who have been displaced?  The answer is spatial. The biennial format is a multi-year programme, and over time the art gallery, gallery, museum and art institution add value to the event by hosting regular activities such as exhibitions and talks. So while the biennial is a visual</text>

In an ideal world, the biennial would resume its long tradition of showcasing the most salient artistic works from its premises, while generating new creative outputs around the world. But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as an example of why. The argument goes that the biennial format attracts artists because it is cyclical: through the curatorial gesture, there is an abundance of biennials, and the biennial itself is a source of their existence; thus the art they produce is a by-product of the biennial and its processes.  To some extent, this is true of works made in the NFF’s home city of New York, but works made elsewhere tend to be either apolitical or apolitical-charming in their own ways.  Art and artists’ interactions with the city are often mediated through the medium of the tourist, and the biennial is just another form of cultural exchange between nations, often mediated through the infrastructure of a city. Art and the biennial form are therefore often seen to engage with specific historical episodes in the US and Europe in an in-depth way, often through very specific artistic practices.

But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as an example of the city’s resilience. Do we want to continue to inhabit the city, or can we move to the next biennial, which is often cited as a model for the city? Moving to the next biennial may mean moving away from the art that is currently occupying the city, but moving away from art that is produced in the city may also mean reverting to art forms that are less reliant on globalised supply chains, which may in turn reduce pollution and thereby the demand for oil. It all depends on what is perceived as the desirable urban space. Art is inherently transnational, and as an image commodity – both culturally and economically speaking – it is widely assumed that artists will produce works of art wherever they are placed.  If placed in a city, however, particularly in the context of a significant other’s career, the biennial may begin to exhibit its own social effects.

The problem with the biennial is not just that it is rare or that it is under-produced; the problem is that it is under-studied. While it is rare to see a biennial that actively engages with and contributes to the development of the world as a city, there are many other biennials that do a good job of filling their institutional and cultural resources with culturally insensitive work, often through the diversion of resources that could be used in more productive and culturally responsive ways. It is time to refocus the biennial’s resources and ambitions in a way that is responsive to the city’s cultural needs and priorities.  The key to unlocking cultural resources and enabling city-wide participation is a reconnection with the city as a living organism, a process of ever deeper layers of socio-economic transformation in a continuously evolving urban landscape.

The new ‘frontiers institute’ might initiate a new wave of initiatives focusing on new kinds of cities, incorporating elements of biennials or other curatorial approaches, in an attempt to find ways to connect to and engage with the urban centre in a meaningful way.  The key question, then, becomes what next for the city? In an ideal world, the biennial would resume its long tradition of showcasing the most salient artistic works from its premises, while generating new creative outputs around the world. But right now there is a glut of art being made in the city, and the biennial is often cited as an example of this. The problem with this ‘classic’ biennial approach, which is predicated on the fact that the art is there first and foremost, is that it is easy to lose your place in time and space. The art is there first, but the city quickly becomes a blur of activity, overloaded with people and activities. And this kind of rapid change can have an impact on the city, generating various kinds of deformations and anomalies. In the past, biennials tended to be curatorial efforts, but this is increasingly no longer the case. There are biennial commissions now coming from all over the world, and they are being put together across multiple sites in the city. And while this may sound strange to those who are used to seeing works produced in a specific site, it is happening.We need new curatorial approaches, and the only way to learn is to do the work already done, so the biennial needs to learn from the museum and other</text>

The name was a play on two words: ‘Signal Hill’ in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and ‘Hill’ in The Wizard of Oz. The activists identified themselves as members of the Scottish Resistance Movement and pledged to ‘re-appropriate cultural resources, skills and land to fight colonialism’. They asked the city to create a new ‘cultural district’ – a name that evokes memories of struggles like Signal Hill but with a capital 'C' – that would be home to artists, musicians, arts organisations and of course, ‘locals’ – 'home’ meaning here not just to Scottish people but also to the area itself.3  The Scottish Resistance Movement was a loose collection of individuals who in the early 1990s formed into a local movement. Its mission statement was: ‘To envision a future of clear, free and clear air for Scotland’s indigenous people, in both of “official” languages, in the territory of the United Kingdom.’4  The Scottish Resistance Movement was a local project with an international reach. Its activists organised in communities around the country with high-profile celebrity spokespeople – M</text>

The name was a play on two words: ‘Signal Hill’ in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and ‘Hill’ in The Wizard of Oz. The activists identified themselves as members of the Scottish Resistance Movement and pledged to ‘die anywhere, anytime’ in support of the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the UK General Election of 2017.3  However, the decision to name the project ‘Signal Hill’ came too late. The act of writing the UK’s national anthem in response to a wave of racist attacks on Scottish heritage by British neo-Nazis and the British fascist band the National Front (BN),4 was logged into a white supremacist website, and the activists killed themselves.Since that time, a group of Scots have sought to recreate the hill in their community. In 2016, a group led by Robert McCrum established a community centre named ‘Scottish Resistance’ in Sunderland’s High Street. Their aim was to ‘reanimate’ the hill by turning its soil into a 'crop wasteland’ – a type of landscape that can support ‘a straight-ahead lifestyle, free from weeds and pests</text>

The name was a play on two words: ‘Signal Hill’ in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and ‘Hill’ in The Wizard of Oz. The activists identified themselves as members of the Scottish Resistance Movement and used the name ‘Lloyd of Saltwater…’3  in their legal proceedings. As the Scottish Resistance Movement’s online publication Llewellyns Resistance Manifesto explains, the Scottish Resistance Movement was born.4  The group’s legal battle to keep the name ‘Signal Hill’ reverberates beyond the park: in 2017, a High Court ruling recognised the historical right of Scottish independence campaigners to petition for a name change; and in 2014, the High Court again ruled in favour of a transgender person seeking to change their legal name on Scottish soil.5  The Scottish Resistance Movement’s 2016 manifesto seems to have been a response to the 2017 UK General Election: in that election, an anti-elitist, nationalist, and ultra-nationalist agenda was promoted by the ‘purge’ of Corbynite Labour MPs. The manifesto declared: ‘We will rise again…�</text>

The Scottish Resistance Movement’s Irish chapter welcomed the opportunity to re-brand themselves as Scottish patriots in a city where fascism is common.5  The Scottish National Party (2013–16) and the Irish Republican Army (1991–94) fought alongside each other in the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Following the 1992–95 Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire, which saw the end of the border between Ireland and the UK, the two movements re-aligned under the leadership of William Ross’Davies, who established the Scottish Defence Association.6  Davies himself was part of the IRA.7  The SNP was quick to embrace the opportunity to portray the two movements</text>

Its mission statement reads as a Tijuana-style Xanax-tipped script: renounce British Empire; build a future without British colonial rule; and use social media to oppose fascism and authoritarianism worldwide.4  The group’s website now includes a timeline ‘dedicated to the present of the 21st century’, with short stories from that era re-purposed as ‘future stories’.5  The timeline includes an entry titled ‘The Demonetisation Process’, and sections titled ‘Present’ and ‘Future’ – stories from the present in which the movement’s protagonists confront the historical and digital effects of neoliberalism and its discontents.6  The entries below are taken from that same timeline, and apply to the present – stories</text>

The name was a play on two words: ‘Signal Hill’ in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and ‘Hill’ in The Wizard of Oz. The activists identified themselves as members of the Scottish Resistance Movement and used the name ‘Gorbals’ after a Scottish First Minister, William Gorton, who was the leader of the Scottish National Party at the end of the 19th century.3 The Demonetisation Process started as an online movement, and as a result has become an institutionalised form of political, economic and social change, as diverse actors from all over the world responded to a single tweet in December 2016. This was a rare moment in the history of social media, where the technological imagination could match the political will behind the stated objectives. The move was fueled by a single, viral tweet, which set in motion a chain of events that have seen significant social change, although its exact nature remains unclear. What is clear is that the task at hand – the actualisation of the social – is inherently unstable, while the social network that records and delivers that change is inherently unstable too.

They asked that the Scottish Resistance Movement be honoured in a public event in Glasgow, and that the Scottish flag be taken down from a public post in Moore’s Circus.3 A public debate was held in the Scottish Parliament, in which the Scottish National Party (SNP) MP for Glasgow Central, Stewart Hosie, argued that the Scottish Resistance Movement was an extremist organisation, and that the Scottish flag should be taken down from the Scottish flagpole in Buchanan Park.4 The debate, which was widely reported in the Scottish press, ended up before the Scottish Supreme Court, where a decision was taken to reinstate the flagpole, and the activists were allowed to return to take the Scottish flag up again.5 So, the decision to reinstate the flagpole was not based solely on the report of a public debate in parliament, but also on arguments brought</text>

The name was a play on two words: ‘Signal Hill’ in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and ‘Hill’ in The Wizard of Oz. The activists identified themselves as members of the Scottish Resistance Movement, and claimed that the new name was a play on two earlier Scottish resistance movements: ‘The Scottish Volunteers of the First World War’ and ‘The Scottish Volunteers in WW1’. They also claimed that the new name was a response to the exclusion of Scots from the UK via the 'bloodless readjustment of statuary and emblems’ during the First World War.3  The use of the word ‘white’ in relation to the Scottish Resistance Movement is also a play on ideas of whiteness and whiteness’. In 1864, when the US Civil War broke out in 1861, Martin Luther King Jr. declared: I have a dream’, and I will tell the nation when and where it’s oppressing them.4  The term ‘white’ comes from William Shakespeare’s time, in ‘The King’s Night, where King Lear recalls a dream</text>

The name was a play on two words: ‘Signal Hill’ in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and ‘Hill’ in The Wizard of Oz. The activists identified themselves as members of the Scottish Resistance Movement and used the name ‘The Scottish Resistance’ in solidarity with the people of Catalonia, who were pursuing full statehood.3 The Scottish Resistance Movement was a hybrid anarchist-punk organisation that sought to create a libertarian state and libertarian society in parts of Scotland. Its first action project was in Glasgow in 1984 under the name ‘Signal Hill’ in memory of William Butler Yeats, who they claimed were the instigators of the Black Power movement.4  The Scottish Resistance Movement was also active in Liverpool and Belfast in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in other cities in the UK and internationally in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In these decades, they claimed, they repurposed various radical collectives and formed into what became known as the Scottish Defence Regiment.5 The Scottish Resistance Movement was a radical and influential group of activists, and their work continues to influence contemporary activism and politics in Scotland.

The name was a play on two words: ‘Signal Hill’ in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and ‘Hill’ in The Wizard of Oz. The activists identified themselves as members of the Scottish Resistance Movement and used a Scottish folk song entitled ‘Signal Hill’ in their manifesto.3  The first draft of the name came in response to the second, which appeared to be an echo of the first: ‘We’re Scottish, we’re the hill folk, we’re the hidden ones. We’re the helpless ones. Begone dreams of stardust, windswept mountains. Here we are cowering like the unhappy cast of Beowulf.4  The activists used The Demonetisation Process to demand that the government withdraw the UK’s participation in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), a move that would have seen the destruction of hundreds of years of UK cultural heritage – a task that, according to the government’s own figures, it could not possibly have accomplished. According to official accounts, the demand was so overwhelming that the officials resorted to 'bleeding it'</text>

The app would gather data from various sources, and when it was done, it would give the user a graphical representation of the data. Then the app’s main purpose would be to gather data from as many sources as possible, and when that was done, it would do things such as reporting back to the network that produced the images, and making infrastructures that could monitor images coming in from different directions.

The Open School came about when the Artistic Director of the London School of Economics, Jim Gamble, and I met in November 2013 at the Open School’s studios. We agreed that the Institute should be reborn as an independent body, and that the School should work in partnership with local artists, architects and community organisers to develop a new kind of art institution. The School’s artistic director, Prof. Jim Kelly, and I framed the conversation around the way art is produced and delivered in the city as the production and delivery of social goods. The opportunities for social good producing through independent art institutions were vast, but the social goods produced through them were not. The School’s mission statement, published in 2015, included the phrase ‘strengthen[ing] the capacities of local artists to contribute to the society we live in’. The proposal was that the School should be able to choose which arts institutions it wished to build, and which it did not. The School’s board of trustees would have the authority to make such appointments. The proposal was rejected, by a vote of eight to one. The reasons given by artists and curators for</text>

The Open School came about when the Artistic Director of the London School of Economics, Jim Gamble, and I met in November 2013 at the Open School’s studios. We agreed that the Open School was a good place to start because the School’s cultural director, Prof. Emma Hart, was interested in something that I was presenting as an artist: the potential of creating an inclusive art school by attracting artists from all over the world. Therefore, we decided to create an Open School in New York. 	The Open School is an art and culture school that brings together leading artists from many disciplines, with a particular interest in the kinds of knowledge that artists acquire through working in galleries and museums. It is a space for exploration and discovery through a studio environment, free from institutional constraints and tied into the tradition of gallery art. The Open School was founded in June 2014 and is a not-for-profit institution that brings together leading artists from many disciplines and a strong institutional interest in the arts. It is run as an independent non-profit corporation, with a mandate to promote and acquire knowledge through exhibitions and research. The Open School is an art school with a cultural mission</text>

The Open School came about when the Artistic Director of the London School of Economics, Jim Gamble, and I met in November 2013 at the Open School’s studios. We agreed that the technological precursors of the Internet would not enable us to create a museum or archive of art, so we brainstormed other spaces for art and art’s socialization. The idea that we could digitize and make accessible art's historical works came as a surprise to me, but my co-curator and I didn’t initially expect the Artistic Director of the Open School to direct the Museum of Art or Museum of Culture. I was shocked when he did so, but delighted when he did not. The new museum will have a programming agenda that aligns with the Open School’s programming, and it will also have a very professional and curatorial approach to art, but it will be independent and focused on the needs of the local community. In an ideal world, the new museum would have a permanent collection of works in its collection, much like the Open School has a permanent collection of works. Its collection would be a mirror of the community’s</text>

The Open School came about when the Artistic Director of the London School of Economics, Jim Gamble, and I met in November 2013 at the Open School’s studios. We agreed that the kind of thinking and deep dives into the arts and culture that the Open School is undertaking are not only a good thing for the arts in the city, but are a way to unpack the city’s complex urban problems. Inspired by the Open School’s work, the next step was to form a consortium of local partners to form a new museum, one of many steps that the group is taking in an ongoing collaborative process. 	The idea that we could create a Museum of Art or Museum of Culture in the heart of the city and call it a Museum of Culture came as a surprise to many people in and around government. Even more people in and around the arts were taken by surprise when the proposal was first put forward. The reason why the proposal was put forward was that it seemed a good fit for the area: the art world was far enough away from the site that people could be transported by their work, and the site was centrally located, reducing the need for</text>

The Open School came about when the Artistic Director of the London School of Economics, Jim Gamble, and I met in November 2013 at the Open School’s studios. We agreed that this was the right time to assemble a multidisciplinary team to explore the possibility of the Museum of Art forming part of the larger neighbourhood. The team’s composition would be a mix of artists, architects, urban planners, historians and others with a clear interest in the history and cultural practices of the city, but who would also have a clear set of skills and knowledge to make a building or landscape they could put their hands on. 	The project was also agreed that the relevant Open School partners should be invited, since the Museum of Art is a local enterprise and Open School partners. 	We chose to work with the Open School because they’d seen the potential of the project and been able to engage with it constructively. 	Jim and the other partners had already put in a great effort to make the Open School a success, and the project would give them that much more of an opportunity.

The Open School came about when the Artistic Director of the London School of Economics, Jim Gamble, and I met in November 2013 at the Open School’s studios. We agreed that the school had a future in London, and that it was critical that we work together to identify what that future might be. 	Jim made a presentation that day about the school’s history and the city. He focused on the school’s practice of art as a service to communities – something that had not been done by art administrators in the city. Local people’s groups had started the Open School, and the local community members’ involvement in the school seemed to be paying off. Jim asked us to think beyond the artist’s figure as a lone speaker and to work with a multi-disciplinary team of artists, designers, historians and others to enrich the conversation. 	In the end, the question of whether the Open School was a good idea didn’t matter. The point was that we needed to work together to identify what was possible for the school to be, and to come up with a plan to put into practise. 	With</text>

Hence the name ‘Open School’ and the research-based museumits that characterises the Open School’s current exploration, which is informed by and addresses the legacy of the 1960s and 1970s urban rebellions. 	A temple to capitalism? 	The temple to capitalism, or so the story goes. The temple is large, powerful and sits on the site of a major historical event, which allows its practitioners to step into the modernist frame of reference and understand how things were achieved.

The Museum of Art would record and represent the past through works that capture the essence of how art is produced in the city, while the Museum of Telling would tell the untold story of art’s making in the city. 	We’re seeing the seeds of a new architecture movement germinating from the remnants of the past. The Open School is a return to the former formulaic ways of organising art, while the Museum of Art is returning to traditional museum-going ways. The Museum of Art is expected to draw artists into a conversation with the city, while the Museum of Telling will tell the untold story of art’s making the city.

The group was the perfect mix of academics, urbanists and artists, and included people with a different kind of experience of urbanisation: artists, designers, historians, urbanists, urban activists and architects. The Open School is a new breed of art institution: it is places where creative people come together to share ideas and engage in debate and creative action. It is a place where ideas are not only valued, but actively encouraged. 	The Open School’s mission statement proclaims: ‘To foster dialogue, understanding and action through an open and inclusive exchange of ideas and data’.[1] It is a threat to institutionalised silence, and an invitation to questioning and debate on ideas and ideas.

The Open School came about when the Artistic Director of the London School of Economics, Jim Gamble, and I met in November 2013 at the Open School’s studios.

So the Museum of Art could be a place to start, while a local community might engage in a Conversation Scheme or Curatorial Exchange Scheme to generate ideas, find solutions and forge alliances. 	The key is to embark on a journey, not an easy or cheap one, but a long and exciting one. The reason why the Arts Council of Great Britain is so supportive of the biennial format is that it creates a common framework within which artists can find common ground and build collective identities. 	The Open School started off as a one-woman show, but over the years have evolved into something much more. It has become a hub for artists to express themselves, a creative outlet for the local community, and a place for artists to explore collaborative projects and collaborations with other artists.

The Whitechapel’s partnership with the Arts Council of Australia exemplifies a generational struggle for artistic and cultural resources. In the 1980s and 1990s, the public gallery and the Whitechapel Gallery fought over exhibition space and resources. The coalition government’s 1996 National Gallery Act granted the Arts Council of Australia discretionary funding to plan, develop and lead a major exhibitionary programme. Over the years, the Arts Council has used its funding to set up arthouses in deprived areas of Sydney and build cultural centres in remote locations.

The Arts Council of Australia, in turn, supported the development of a range of public engagement strategies through its Artist’s Initiative, which were further developed into the 2013/14 Biennale.

These biennials, which take place every two years, are the only venues for the artistic exploration of the region available to tourists. Tourists are the last to visit the region, but a rare and fragile cultural enterprise is born. Playground Culture, Western Australia:  	Cultural tourism is the art form of the sensitive and the sensitive culture. It is the art of appearing indifferent to the aesthetic dangers confronting the region, yet actively participating in the inevitable outcomes of such indifference. 	Cultural tourism is a type of industry that relies on the notion that cultural assets are permanent. This notion is often used to justify the commercial exploitation of cultural resources, particularly when these resources are geographically concentrated in a region. However, the sensitivity of the assets concerned often serves to obfuscate the political and economic dynamics of the region, creating the illusion that the resources are somehow</text>

Art is made accessible through technology and innovation, but sometimes that accessibility comes at the expense of something as fundamental as human dignity.

The partnership between the Arts Council of Australia, Western Australia and NT Art Gallery was part of the organisation’s broader partnership programme. 	In the past, artists have been encouraged to develop solutions that would abolish or minimise technological culture as a response to technological unemployment. But in the current economic and social crisis, a dominant form of labour – that of data processors, data producers and data grabbers – is increasingly seen by the state as desirable over creative labour. Therefore, in the new media and multimedia studies departments, artists are increasingly confronted with the daunting challenge of imagining alternative uses for artworks and creative practices that are captured, aggregated and traded across national</text>

The projects, which added cultural value to their environments, were developed with the cooperation of the governments of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.

That’s why the Arts Council of Australia, Western Australia, and Northern Territory Art Gallery partnered together to create the Birds of Paradise: A Sting in the Sand (2010) and Birds of Paradise: A Sting in the Sand: Island Adventures (2010) itineraries for adventurous urbanites to take part in. These itineraries included a breathtaking view of the Tongari Swamp, the shores of the River Ndebele River, and the shores of Lake Eyre. The partnership between the Arts Council of Australia and the Northern Territory Art Gallery, one of the country’s earliest arts collectives, was formed in 1903. Since then the gallery has hosted regular public programs, including an annual exhibition in 2017, and a series of smaller community projects. In 2015 the gallery was named one of The 100 greatest art collections in the world by the Global Capital City Forum. 	In the late nineteenth century the NT Arts Council was Britain’s oldest and most successful independent arts organization. Its work in the area – commissioning, producing and managing classical and modern artworks through partnerships with galleries, museums and private collectors – was international in scope, and included projects in almost every major European capital city</text>

That’s why the Arts Council of Australia, Western Australia, and Northern Territory Art Gallery partnered together to create the Birds of Paradise: A Sting in the Sand (2010) and Birds of Paradise: A Thread in the Rainbow (2012) projects, to bring art and naturalists together in a collaborative project to explore the symbolic value of bird photos. The 2012 Birds of Paradise project involved over 1,000 artists, showcasing work from 50 countries around the world. 	The 2014 project, Bird SOS (2015-16), brought together specialist conservation and heritage services to help protect and restore the iconic Western Australian condor (kookuel’s tongue) to help protect the species from extinction, a job that has entwined Western Australian and Australian wildlife agencies for centuries. Bird SOS was co-ordinated by the Museum of Western Australian Art and the NT Museum, with support from the Australian National University and Naturalis, a partner in the Agriculture Network. The museum was a founding partner of the museum network and continues to be a trustee of the NT Museum.

That’s why the Arts Council of Australia, Western Australia, and Northern Territory Art Gallery partnered together to create the Birds of Paradise: A Sting in the Sand (2010) and Birds of Paradise: Ostrich at the Airport (2012) exhibitions. They showed how visual art can be made accessible to people through the art of archiving and documenta 14 held in each of the three states. The partnership continued when the three institutions decided to commission a similar exhibition of visual art in the city of Darwin, which allowed the city to flex its visual art muscle. The city was able to flex its visual art muscle in a way that the biennial could not. The partnership between the city and biennial continued when the biennial decided to open its own branch in the city, so that people could walk into the museum and see what visual art can be made accessible to them. This is what happened with the Birds of Paradise: A Sting in the Sand (2010): a spider’s web patterned after the city, and a strand of the DNA of the Aotearoa Native artists, whose work perfectly captured the exotic, yet poetic, and evocative qualities of the place.

In other words, ‘the city’ as a production for knowledge, knowledge that is both socially produced and fabulously egocentric. But what if knowledge were also socially produced? What if, through innovative administrative means and innovative political means, it was made available to all? What if knowledge were distributed widely? What if it was democratized? What if, through an ever more pervasive and dispersed form of sociality, it was made available to all? These are just some of the questions that could potentially be posed to cities in an attempt to democratize and augment the social. And, while these questions are legitimate</text>

In this sense, the world we live in reproduces itself through what Thoreau called ‘double thinking’ – thinking of things that are not ‘us’ but rather ‘them’ and turning a blind eye to the effects of that thinking.

In other words, the politics of place. 	There are many voices in the city these days calling for a mixed mode of urban existence. These voices echo the language of diversity, inclusiveness and social justice but are mostly generated by affluent residents and professionals. They often talk about how the city is divided and that gentrification is happening all around us. But while the voices of many citizens may be heard, the voices of the many are rarely unified. Why is this? One possibility is that many citizens are citizens of very different worlds. Some citizens possess rights and privileges that others do not, and citizens of a city often live in conditions of oppression and injustice. For example, the right to housing is often cited</text>

When the biennale becomes a cultural enterprise, it becomes a mode of cultural exertion, a mode of self-expression, a mode of signification. Its productions, both physical and symbolic, become objects of circulation in and through the city. This is why biennials are constantly on the lookout for ways to best exploit their public spaces and facilities, to maximize the capacities of their users and to most definitely not in their images.

The city is a powerful conceptual tool because it can hold many different ideas in mind at once, and because it is both spatially and temporally diverse. It is possible to think of a city as a sequence of interconnected images and gestures, with continuous circulation of different images and associations.

The ways in which cities are produced and consumed – the ways in which they are a capital for capital – these representations are concrete and real, but they are also elusive and ideal. We do not yet have a fully developed and operationalised version of the Metainterface, but there are several examples of how cities that are instances of the Metainterface family of services have emerged.These are just some of several examples of how the Metainterface can produce a more universal and inclusive mode of understanding and inhabitation. More needn’t be restricted to the forms that are most readily digestible, and can be extended and refined in all the ways that the city is produced and consumed.

And yet, despite the fact that these seemingly disparate processes of production and consumption eventually come to intermingle in powerful ways that both affect how we understand the world and how we live our lives, there is still a fundamental difference between the ways in which we produce and consume the world. This difference becomes evident in the work that we do for the BBC World Service. We produce reports, films and interactive elements that are downloaded across different media, and across different platforms. The work is interactive and narrative, yet it is also physically unappealing. It’s made up of images, videos and text, but it remains confined to the screen.

With the right policies and culture, the city has the potential to be a great affirming of individuality and the capacity to bring about transformative change through its specific productions and consumption. 	However, the city is also a situation in which power struggles amongst citizens, factions within the city, and even between cities and the city. Power brokers within the city seek to impose their will on everyone else, and alter the city’s shape and composition in their image. In such cases, the city is accused of being unable to deliver. In the current geopolitical situation, the city is often accused of being unable to provide for its people.

But what makes the biennial unique and different from other curatorial activities is that it is representative of a globally integrated biennial, representing not only its local cultural dynamics but also the cultural trends of the moment. In other words, the biennial as an event is not merely an exporter or a terminal destination for art and curatorial action; it also engages with issues of social and governance changes that emerge as a result of contemporary lifestyles. These local trends may be characterised by the transient and variable presence of curators, artists, curators and other art professionals; they may also be typified by the interlinking, transnational and local forms of exchange and the financial mechanisms that enable the exchange of information and concepts. Contemporary art and curatorial activity is, in other words, driven by the exchange of forms and by the exchange of information – exchanges that move at a pace that may be influenced by the biennial’s position and location (the biennial is an artistic agency, after all).

But what makes the biennial unique and different from other art forms, what makes it different from other art forms, is precisely what Norman and company call its ‘transcendental character’. That is, its real power comes from its ‘beyond-the-art’ character, or what Norman would simply say, ‘beyond-the-time’. The collection, his idea of history, is in many senses ‘beyond-the-time’. It is not real, but it is transcendent. And this idea, which Norman pursued in his writing and in his art, is what makes the biennial different from other art forms. It is what distinguishes it from other art forms. For example, Norman’s own account of his own early experiences as a visitor to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, in his book How I Became a Biennialist, is deeply flawed and inaccurate. He makes a mistake in describing his own visit to the camp, and in doing so</text>

The museum becomes not only the site of the excavator but also the site of the settler, as the collection is brought to bear on the city’s future. The museum is the site of the displaced, but it is also the site of the poignant, the site of the lamentable and the lamentable presence of history. The collection is intertwined with the city’s political and economic landscape, but it is also the site of the coloniser, the epicentre of colonialist aggression. The collection is a double-headed maul, a combination of the excavator’s maul and the land-grabbing enterprise of the state. The collection is both a source of knowledge and a problem for which the city must contend.</text>

The collection is then spatially mediated––an omniscient narrator narrates the contents of the collection, transcending its differences and creeds. It embodies an archive of knowledge, a kind of reverse archival conditionality––an object reflectss the presence of an author (or more accurately, the presence of an imagined author).The collection is a kind of signature for the biennial, a kind of testimony that readers, artists, collectors and others can recognise and narrate. It is a kind of archetypal agent that stands in for the city and the biennial as a whole. It narrates and represents history, it is a kind of prototype for the urban biennial. But what makes the biennial unique and different from other curatorial practices is that it seeks to live and act out its historical mission through the actuality of curatorial activity. This kind of historical mission is often expressed in the form of a museum, but in a curatorial practice it is sometimes expressed as a kind of urban museum. In the case of the biennial, the museum becomes not only the site of the event, but also a site of its own event: the collection is the site of its own reading and writing. The collection gathering, the various collections that it includes in its exhibitionary form, the collections of a particular author, and the collections of a particular city – each of these elements, while related, does not constitute a single museum, but rather an enormous assemblage of objects. It is an ensemble of relations, of sorts. Assemblages of objects, they are historical documents in their own right, and their arrangement in the urban environment constitutes, within the notion of curatorial intention, a kind of arch</text>

But what makes the biennial unique and different from other curatorial practices is the way in which it actively engages with the urban environment and the communities that inhabit it. It actively creates and represents alternatives to the urban situation, including through its collections. Collection management and exhibition planning are actively engaged with, and the artefacts and collections that comprise it make visible their historical and contemporary condition. The collection is a space for the production and reception of knowledge, but it is also a site of actigraphy, the permanent recording of knowledge, continually evolving and reinventing. The collection as an artefact is a kind of archive that records and expresses knowledge continuously, constantly adapting itself to the changing conditions of the urban environment. It is a kind of living organism that emerges from the urban environment and that constantly creates and modifies its own form and function. It throws up new collections and assemblages them into new projects, professions and modes of knowing. The collection as an artefact is a capital machine that generates for capital the possibilities of urban settlement and contemporary use</text>

But what makes the biennial unique and different from other curatorial practices and institutions is the fact that it is able to stand on its own two feet. It has the kind of biennial that can be counted on to be there, every day, year round. And it does this through the collection, the biennial, the museum, and everywhere in-between. It is a kind of static document that narrates and represents time. It is a kind of static archive of knowledge, a kind of static museum. But it is also a kind of static archive of values. And these two kinds of archive of values form a kind of dialectic, with the biennial as a constant dialectic of the static and the unknowable. In other words, the biennial is able to claim certain values and hence is able to act as a curator, curator of the unknowable, and so forth. The collection and the museum simultaneously narrate and represent the present, but the biennial can narrate and represent the future as well. This dynamic</text>

But what makes the biennial unique and different from other art forms and exhibitionary platforms is that it is present in and through the local, that is, in and through the city. It becomes, in the words of Paul Domela, the narrator of the Biennial, ‘a kind of episodic document, a point of departure for the city’. This kind of narrativisation implies and emerges from the collection as a kind of structured archaeological digression. It is a kind of digression that occurs when, during the course of a workaday, an anthropologist, historian or curator of art, either visiting the city or performing a ‘point of departure’ for the city, examines and documents the place and its people. The significance of this kind of episodic digression in the anthropological, historical, or art ‘medium’, is that it generates a kind of ongoing discourse, an ongoing narrative arc, an ‘occurence’ that is neither one nor many; it is rather</text>

But what makes the biennial unique and different from other curatorial practices is its capacity to take the place of an archive, a kind of proto-institution. It possesses the power to narrate its own archive, and to imagine possible alternative histories. It is able to assume the form of collection, and to do so in a multitude of media including, but not limited to, film, sculpture, public art, political action, literature, radio, radio and web sites. The collection as archive becomes an even more dynamic and variable variable variable. It is frequently ceded political and symbolic status in exchange for its presumed curatorial prioritisation of certain histories over others. As the collection becomes more institutionalised, its primary role becomes that of a museum that exhibits and narrates certain specific moments in a particular historical context. The collections department of the Biennial is engaged in this dynamic as dynamic curatorial gesture Noël Coward informally describes it as ‘differentiating the biennial form from museum form’.8.

But what makes the biennial unique and different from other art forms is not only its historical and spatial aspects, but also the fact that it operates between two very specific cultural categories: the art world and the urban poor. The collection is a kind of boundary that invisibly separates the urban poor from the rural poor, the urban poor from the suburban poor, and the urban poor from the rural poor. It is a kind of signature that can render the urban poor invisible, while making the rich visible and rich indeterminate.This kind of historical-political-ideological-cultural construction is characteristic of modernity and is part of a general trend towards globalisation that is both economic and political. It is a kind of globalising idea that seeks to reconcile the economic and the social, the economic and the cultural, the urban and the Rastafari. There is no doubt that the biennial has partaken in this kind of historical-cultural-economic convergence, that it is part of this larger cultural juggernaut that is reshaping the world</text>

But what makes the biennial unique and different from other curatorial practices is that it makes knowledge itself possible. The collections that it brings with it, the exhibits it displays, the way in which it is engaged with, all these things are designed to enable the audience to identify with the writer, to enable their understanding of the writer. And this kind of specificity and this kind of enabling of the audience through various kinds of media is something else that biennials do differently from other curatorial practices.There are other curatorial kinds of making available to the biennial, but these are the kinds that we have to learn how to manage. The kinds of enabling that are possible through various kinds of media and the curatorial interventions that they can afford to make. Remembering Henry Ford? Good question. I did not know him that well, but I had to know that he had invented a still relatively new kind of automobile. Henry Ford was thirty-seven years old when he died. I was twenty-seven. He had invented the jet engine and</text>
