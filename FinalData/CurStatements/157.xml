Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify that common good?In an effort to find the answers to these questions, I thought it would be useful to present the curatorial agenda of the year ‘2011’, taking into account the curatorial activities of all participating arts agencies. I have gathered together the most representative documents, images, reports, reports and other data on the agenda, together with brief descriptions of each document’s objectives and processes, and their place in the cultural landscape. In addition, a selection of documents relating to the event’s authors and/or their projects has been made available online. In the end, this brings us to the present, the present of the cultural practice of the year ‘2011’, and the future, or present, of the curatorial agenda.At a conference in November of 2011, the curators of the Venice Biennale were asked to imagine a closed system with an open access register. For this to happen, a contract had to be signed by</text>

Why then the spreading of the process of curating online, and the attendant technologies of annotating and annotating that share and exchange knowledge?Why, in short, do we see artists and curators being trained and supported by the government in ways that perversely constrain the kinds of creativity and activism possible in the public domain? Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify that common good? Why do we not see curatorial efforts being driven by those who seek to constrain the kinds of creativity and activism possible in the public domain?Both the public and the artist have a stake in this conversation. The public stakes are clear: as Kate Hudson notes, there is a contradiction in thinking that a 'public' can bestow intrinsic value upon an object.[8] Hudson does not deny the fact that a public has a stake in this equation as well, and it is this contradiction that the nondevelopment theorist addresses. Hudson argues that a sphere of influence cannot be independent of the public sphere, and that ‘a public sphere must be maximized through the restriction of its expression, no matter what its size or form.’ The Public sphere is to an extent what she calls ‘a complex set of relations and interactions that generate and determine who is and is not included in it’, and ‘the public must be empowered to participate in</text>

Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify that common good? I suggest that there are three possible reasons for the rise of the arts public sphere: (1) the promotion of a shared common good; (2) the establishment of a trusted community of fellow artists; and (3) the establishment of a shared common good itself.The first possibility is the consummation of the second in the public sphere; it is the consummation of a shared set of common goods and it is the end of an era. The public sphere is the domain of those with a common set of goods and a common set of values. It is the realm of shared goods, shared norms, shared laws, shared practices, common futures. It is the domain of common norms, shared laws and shared practices. It is a shared set of things that are shared between people, things that can be measured, taken account of and – perhaps most important for us – counted. The public sphere is the realm of the common, and as such, its</text>

Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify that common good? One could ask the same of art institutions, or the service providers of a gallery or museum, or any organisation that serves the interests of the collective as a whole. But this is the institutionalised nature of the art market. The institutionalised nature of the circulation of knowledge means that questions of accountability and transparency are much more difficult to define. It also means that questions of inappropriateness and injustice are much more difficult to identify and address. This is why it takes so long for an act of vandalism to be identified and addressed as such. It takes much longer for cultural practices to be questioned and contested. In the longer term, such questions are much less likely to be taken up by art institutions or the political parties that legitimise or create them.In sum, we can identify three main reasons why in the long term, and in the current biennial format, we live in a world in which biennials have a lower priority than other exhibitionary forms: (</text>

Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify that common good?One may speculate that in the age of the biennial, which is often cited as a precondition for the development of a ‘high profile’ in a biennial’, the ‘biennial’ has entered a mode of increasingly random, fluid and unpredictable behaviour. In the words of David Slater, the curator of the University of Melbourne's Art Gallery, which is being supported by the Australian and New Zealand Curators Fund, and funded by the European Council on Tall Buildings, ‘Art galleries are a domain of contingency, contingency being defined as an event or series of occurrences occurring at a moment or moments before, during or after an event – a time being defined as an ‘area of intervention’.[13]More generally, the curatorial is a dynamic term that describes both the applied and the speculative aspects of art institution formation. It describes the art gallery as a site of contingency, contingency being defined as an event or</text>

Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify that common good in various ways? Why do we see art and art culture disappearing from view in ways that perversely lend some credence to the common good but simultaneously require us to actively participate in denying common good? Why do we see art being made in places where it is almost certainly not wanted, and where participation is either criminal or actively discouraged?Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify it?Why do we see curatorial efforts being overseen by non-governmental art institutions that then seek to extend and augment the reach of the project by providing venues, technical support, funding, exhibitions, etc.?Why do we see art and art culture (including curatorial) work in places where it is almost certainly not wanted, and where participation is either criminal or actively discouraged?Why do we see art and art culture (including art) being actively promoted by non-governmental art institutions that then seek to nullify or const</text>

Why do we see curatorial efforts centred on individuals who, although perhaps not all of them are necessarily wrong, nevertheless tend to be more readily labelled as artist(s) and more readily identifiable within a given context?Why do we see curatorial efforts, including those funded by the ‘common’, work very actively to separate, as Herbert Croly put it, ‘truly artistic practice’ from ‘technological art’, and from ‘real life’? Why do we see curatorial efforts that purport to be about promoting ‘knowledgeable culture’ (a.k.a. art’s �use value’) as opposed to learning, or education, from the public sphere</text>

What kinds of possibilities do these processes open up for art and the individual artist?

Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify that common good?These are questions that continue to dog the public realm in important ways. But as a public realm, it is becoming increasingly difficult to know what the common good looks like in practice. What is common to many parts of the world is not necessarily common to others. And even when we do have common understandings of the terms and conditions of this process, the underlying assumptions and politics of power are always going to be a part of the making of decisions. It is up to us, as artists and curators, to identify and work through these kinds of politics.This may be seen as a public-spirited project: this is the digital revolutionizing of art and art-making, and the curatorial is part of that process. But as an art institution, it is still going to need artists and curators to tell its stories and to persuade those stories to be taken seriously. It may well be that the curatorial is the most difficult institution to change, and that</text>

Why do we see curatorial efforts being driven by entities that promote the common good but simultaneously seek to limit or nullify that common good? These are the questions asked and answered at the Commonwealth Art &amp; Exhibition Forum, convened by the Arts Council of Australia, New York, USA. 	The Commonwealth Art &amp; Exhibition Forum describes itself as ‘a non-profit, not-for-profit association dedicated to the shared enjoyment of art and the artistic enterprise’[2]. Yet the very relationship between the Arts Council of Australia, the Commonwealth Gallery, and the New York art fair is premised on the value and participation of artists and audiences alike. This is significantly less true ofÂ private cultural institutions, which are encouraged to promote a specific vision of art through art practices such as lectures, performances, exhibitions and seminars. Thus, while the Arts Council of Australia, the Commonwealth Gallery and the New York art fair may all be looking to the future, their contemporary curatorial approaches are largely informed, if not entirely dictated by, the interests of the financial sector, financial services</text>

Future-oriented curators will inevitably want to know what is being done with art resources, or better yet, what is being done with the art that flows from them. This is why AI is such a powerful tool for curating: because it not only learns, but also excels at what it is told to do. It is taught a set of skills through exposure to machine learning and artificial intelligence, and it is empowered with the resources of the machine — resources that augment and empower the artist in a way that is nearly indistinguishable from artificial intelligence.Art, of course, is just one application of the new technologies.

Machines are the augmentations of humans — and artists, too.Art, of course, is just one application of the new technologies. Future-oriented curators will inevitably want to know where their art is coming from and for that reason it is always better to have a network of artists or curators talking to one another. It is also good for business reasons: the more artists and curators who know one another, the more likely they are to collaborate and the better the projects they will produce.Network effects are good for a few reasons: first, the artists and curators already know one another; second, the artists and curators already know how to use the technologies; and third, the networks also create a common language between artists and audiences that can be used within the art world. But there is good reason to worry about the art world becoming too wrapped up in its technological attachments. Because, as the biennale heads towards its 20th century, artificial intelligence is becoming the norm and not the exception.Art is the computing interface that interfaces with the machine. And as the art world starts to look more like a computing interface, the art world is starting to</text>

Future-oriented curators will inevitably want to know what technologies will be capable of replacing jobs, and the curatorial search will no doubt reveal other new forms of surveillance and control. The AI horizon will also make it easier to define a new art park or cultural district. The boundaries of the AI park or cultural district may not be those drawn up in black and white but with the shades of grey of today's urban landscape. And from the AI park or cultural district, the boundaries may be defined by the tastes of the living human.In the end, what is needed is a new breed of artists, thinkers and writers to distinguish today's art from tomorrow's social media art, and tomorrow's natural cultural from tomorrow's artificial. There are plenty of great artists and writers already doing that. What is needed is a different kind of art director or curator. This sounds daft in theory but in practice many curators struggle to distinguish between art that is being made today in response to consumer culture and art that was made yesterday in response to machine</text>

In a follow-up issue, a curated research project on the technology is launched, entitled Future Curators. The project, led by the curator Maya Jha, is developing a research agenda that seeks to understand the role and mission of art and culture in the future society.Art and culture is a ubiquitous presence in the biennale, but its history and contemporary trajectory is ever changing. In 2017, a trip to the Biennale to see the installation for the first time in Venice, accompanied by a curatorial and literary excursion, was part of the curatorial mix at the Giardini. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for visitors to revisit a bygone era of art and culture, but the digital revolution that transformed art and art history was not without friction.The rise of digital media and the ubiquity of connectivity outside of the home is also a</text>

Machines are the augmentations of humans — and artists, too.Art, of course, is just one application of the new technologies. Future-oriented curators will inevitably want to know what technology can do that art cannot, and will have to ask hard questions of its intentions and capabilities. And there are signs that some of these technologies are already bent on oppressing their users. Aweb Reed’s remarkable new three-dimensional installation, The Astronaut’s Stine, for example, was apparently conceived as a kind of interrogation of its abilities, both as art and as technological inventors, in that it is both physically and metaphorically impossible for the viewing public to sit through the installation and not be rendered functionally homeless by its presence.The growing pains of the new curatorial technologies we have unleashed on the world are a little-known part of the exhibition business. We are captivated by the unintended consequences of these practices, which we rarely question or debug, as we write these techno-mystifications down on tour.

But the growing body of research on how art can be produced through algorithms has consequences beyond the borders of the biennale circuit. It is being carried out at a fundamental level in the design of our bodies and our buildings, in the construction and maintenance of our social systems, in the organisation of our social worlds. And it is being carried out not only by machines but also by systems that observe and analyse massive amounts of data.This raises the question of what can and cannot be included in a cultural production that is informed by algorithms.

Future-oriented curators will inevitably want to know more about the world around them, and AI and its applications will be the tools with which they tackle this task. But one might ask, how will AI affect our own work? Will it create a new breed of artists whose work is elevated over what we have today, or will it render what we have become, and its artists, into irrelevance? While some curators seem to be anticipating this latter scenario, there is growing dissatisfaction with the former. How will AI impact the art form? What is being produced today in the name of a few billion users? Will new kinds of art be possible? In an optimistic scenario, perhaps we can say that the future seems like a very bright future indeed. But for the moment, we are rather concerned with the inability to imagine anything but the most dystopian possible future.This is perhaps the modern curatorial condition. In its current form, the Biennale is incumbent on us imagining things differently. We need to be able to imagine a</text>

Future-oriented curators will inevitably want to know how art will be made in their local area, or whether their city is unique in some other way. And just as important, just as important is that art should be made where art is made first.

What does it mean for a person to be able to ‘know’? What is the difference between being able to plan and being able to predict? Will science and technology eventually give us answers to these questions? Will such technologies ever be able to answer them?For many contemporary artists and curators, and art historians, these are questions that continue to trouble contemporary art historians and artists alike.

Scientists, urbanists and urbanists are coming to understand that the future city is going to be collaborative, not competitive, and that a collaborative process is needed to end the unsustainable growth of the metropolis. That is, the problem is unsustainable, but the collaborators are not willing or unable to change the problem, so what is needed is a way to create social and economic opportunities for those who are most dependent on the metropolis – those people whose neighbourhoods are built on concrete, steel and bricks – in ways that are not dependent on the market. 	Urban renewal has become an increasingly popular way for new urban developers to add density and jobs to already bustling neighbourhoods, but as the city’s population continues to grow, so too does the need for additional residential space and affordable housing. Despite the increased demand, which is fuelling the construction of more affordable housing and infrastructure, most cities can only build so far in advance of when the housing crisis hits, and new development tends to follow</text>

The cities that emerged following the second world war are the exception in the west, and while this may be true in distant places, it is becoming increasingly difficult in Montreal, where the large corporations that control the infrastructure of Montreal are coming to dominate what is happening on the city’s peripheries. 	The main reason for the increase in house prices in the 1990s and early 2000s was a dramatic expansion of the city’s capacity to house them. In 1993, the federal government established the ‘Montréal Urbanist Project’ to explore ways to transform the city, and in 2007, the city established the Greater Montreal Partnership to form a cooperative housing cooperative of local stakeholders.2 	The urbanist dream – the belief that a city could be redesigned to better meet the needs of its inhabitants – is fading. In Montreal, as elsewhere in Canada, this has meant losing population centers and struggling to contain surging population growth, fuelled by a rapidly urbanizing province and a growing urban void. Urban growth has become the dominant mode of exchange in the city, but despite this, the city has to work hard to support itself. In an indication of this struggle, in the 1990 census, only 39 per cent of the city’s residents lived in poverty</text>

The cities that emerged following the second world war are the exception in the west, and while this may be true in distant places, it is becoming increasingly difficult in Montreal, where the large corporations that control the infrastructure of Montreal are coming to dominate what is happening on the city’s periphery. 	Another factor in the increased number of people moving to Montreal is the availability of affordable housing. A 2004 study by the Montreal Architecture Biennale suggested that although the cost of a standard apartment in Montreal rose 39 per cent between 1981 and 1984, the cost of a studio apartment tripled.2 Despite these high prices, however, researchers and urbanists in Montreal are beginning to question the value of studio apartments and the value of a standard apartment. A growing number of researchers and urbanists believe that a dense, well-designed urban neighbourhood – one that draws people to spend time in it – is essential to a responsive public sphere.3 	Today, Montreal is a financial laboratory for Canadian provincial and territorial governments as well as international finance firms, operating under the guise of urbanization and development projects. It is a centre for the exchange of ideas and evidence, a forum for technical innovation and the production of high-quality final products that can be exported. In this way, it is both</text>

The emergence of alternative urban settings is often cited as a way to end urban sprawl, but this only serves the interests of a few financial firms and urban developers. The development of alternative urban settings is needed at the municipal level because, while they may mask the impacts of rapid growth, they also create their own problems. 	Over the past decade, a number of projects have sought to create ‘high-quality of life cities’ through redevelopment of traditionally underused areas. These have included projects by the Rotem Cooperative Bank, which sought to create a ‘house-by-house cooperative bank for housing projects’; the Park that Len’s Restaurant Group, which sought to establish a cooperative dedicated to producing high-quality, environmentally sustainable options for new restaurant projects; and the Montreal Partnership for a New Economy, which sought to draw businesses from the city’s periphery to Montreal, while creating new economic opportunities for the city’s small and</text>

So what can be done locally to reverse the city’s growing economic dependency on the automobile? A number of projects have been proposed and many are now in development, but the main initiative seems to be directed at creating incentives for developers to convert vacant lots into affordable housing options, while paying for these units with increased tax revenue. Some projects have been developed with the participation of local and national partners, and have municipal or even district governments taking part. Some have been private partnerships. All of them have their critics, but the main thrust seems to be that these partnerships will be sustainable and generate long-term employment for local residents and businesses. 	So far, so normal in Montreal, but there is a change of pace emerging. Cities are no longer the problem to be solved at the pace of globalisation, but rather that new urban forms must be created that can address the challenges of the present. This change in pace is characteristic of a globalised capitalist economy, and it</text>

As a result, the scientists and urbanists coming out of the second world war are coming to understand that the city is a source of enduring loss and that the city is structurally incapable of supporting a future for itself. 	The question of how cities are to be designed to support a future for themselves has recently arisen in an interesting area of research: geo-thermodynamics. In a nutshell, geo-thermodynamics proposes that the global climate is controlled through the use of energy resources derived from the curvature of the Earth’s surface and the gravitational interaction of massive objects. These objects exert a drag on one another to generate heat and light – heat that can then be harnessed to power crucial industrial processes – and this negative gravitational pull results in increasingly apparent global warming.2 	In an effort to reduce the influence of these objects in shaping the climate, researchers from McGill University and the Australian National University have developed a geo-mechanical system that simulates the</text>

There are several theories of urbanisation floating around at the moment, but none of them offer any solutions to the growing imbalance between the rich and the poor, the rapidly growing megacities or in-situ development that are choking the core cities from the inside out. While some of the old urban theories may be relevant to the complexity of our urban situation, they do not seem to be addressing the fundamental causes of the current predicament, such as the economic malaise gripping much of the western world. 	Urban theorists have their favourites, but few are as appealing as those peddled by the great urban theorist of the twentieth century, Friedrich Hayek. Hayek insisted that a socialist paradise could and should be built in Montreal, and that the city should assist in its future self build by providing social and human services that can be taken away from those who cannot afford to provide them.2 	This is what Montreal has done in helping its poor residents to find affordable places</text>

As a result, the research and design teams that emerged after the second world war are now coming to understand that the city is not only the site of growth, but that it is the site of struggle and defeat. 	The research and design teams formed after the second world war are the exception in the west, but while a few urbanists and urbanists still work for the Multidisciplinary Association for Scientific and Urban Research (M.A.R.U.R.) in Montreal, a majority of its members now work for one of Montreal’s largest infrastructure and urban research companies, who are increasingly interested in the underlying causes of urban decline rather than in attempting to change the city’s spatial distribution of income, wealth, power and income.

The city is becoming increasingly fragmented, and the fragmentation of the city is straining the very fabric of what is left behind. While it may be possible to restore the historical mixed-use character of Montreal, it is doubtful if this could be done in time for the new urban growth that is needed in the city. The introduction of new businesses and cultural venues is important in creating a sense of place revival, but the city must be able to support them in any way it chooses. Any city that stands still or ceases to grow will suffer. 	There are of course other possible responses to the on-going crisis of urbanisation in the west, but these are the dominant three to date: (a) join forces with other western cities that are experiencing similar issues; (b) open new business airports in an attempt to fill the voids created by a fragmented and Idle No More movement; or (c) merge with other western cities in an attempt to address the issues</text>

So how do we as a society engage in the creation of new cities? We can create them ourselves, as scientists and urbanists have done for decades, or we can create civic groups, partnership with the city to help create neighbourhoods that are as desirable as possible for tourists and businesses, and, most of all, to explore the city and its infrastructure as a source of new ways of interacting with it. While most of us would prefer to see a city with a thriving Downtown East and West, as well as East and West Linked districts all around, knowing that a good chunk of the infrastructure is already being designed to meet the demands of a global economy is a first step in any long-term project. 	 Finally, how do we create new ways of approaching the infrastructure that is already there – a task that starts at the city and works its way up to the national and international levels – while acknowledging that we do not yet know how to work with it?

If the social uses of infrastructure are actively discouraged or destroyed (as is happening increasingly in the developed world), then the infrastructural sector is encouraged to adopt a new function – one that is more directly responsive to the needs of society and is itself increasingly social – one that destroys, subverts and is itself increasingly app-based. The justification for this new function is that it makes sense politically and economically – in the age of massive app-based app stores and daily connectivity – because the new function demands very different forms of infrastructure from the old function. But this new infrastructuralisation of use comes with a cost. The logic of infrastructural infrastructures increasingly depends on the consumption habits of a large proportion of humanity, which means that the social uses of infrastructure need to be actively promoted, maintained and expanded. And this remains a problem in many places, including in developing countries, where massive app-based app stores are the norm but not the rule</text>

And this misapplication of the term ‘infrastructure’ is particularly dangerous, for one of the functions of infrastructure is to deliver information about the physical world (architecture) in an organised fashion, to enable, support and facilitate the activities of infrastructure (including its users). So ‘infrastructure’ can be understood as both a social concept and an organisational term. Infrastructures are the visible surfaces of a social totality, and social totality is the subject of a design philosophy. Social theory and design studies have long been interested in how infrastructure contributes to the formation of infrastructure (including its social uses). However, while social theorists and design professionals have long been interested in how infrastructures are constituted and delivered (including by public authorities), little attention has been given to the social systems that enable, support and facilitate infrastructure (including the social dimensions of infrastructure). This omission can be explained by the assumption that users will always seek the most efficient and useful solution to any problem that arises, and that the social forms that derive from infrastructure will always evolve and change in response to changing conditions and situations. But as infrastructure age, and new infrastructures are created, the assumption that users will always seek the</text>

And this misapplication of the term ‘infrastructure’ is particularly dangerous, for one of the functions of infrastructure is to deliver information about the physical world (architecture) in an organised fashion, to enable, support and facilitate certain kinds of movement within that infrastructure). This is why infrastructure is often misconstrued as being hierarchical or problematic, or dangerous or unworkable: because it is far from hierarchical or problematic, insofar as the information it transmits is organised and delivered in a particular way. It is, in other words, a technology that enables certain kinds of movement within the infrastructure, and this is why technologists and other powerful stakeholders see infrastructure as a resource that can be reformed and improved, whether or not that movement results in new good or innovative practices.  Similarly, ‘infrastructures’ are often misconstrued to mean homogenised versions of themselves – not the hierarchical models of capital that seek to exploit and rule, but the less hierarchical yet still reliant on the present – but they do tend to reproduce themselves through certain kinds of organisation and infrastructural change. This is why large infrastructure projects, such as railways, can be reformed to make use of cheaper but still viable</text>

So while it might be true that the social uses of infrastructure are many and systemic, in a historical and contemporary sense, the real work of infrastructure – whether that is delivering information, facilitating the functioning of society, or being an infrastructural – is one that is deeply fragmented and unstable.  A postcolonial theory of infrastructure therefore needs to be contextualised to take account of its social functions and generate strategies for its social formation.’s use today might generate strategies for infrastructure renewal in the future, but that is not its intended function or purpose.  Instead, the intended function or purpose might be something like ‘architecture as social construction’, in which case the postcolonial theorist would focus on the social construct that he or she is working within, but would not necessarily identify with or be part of that social construction.

Making infrastructures social is one thing; making social infrastructure a priority for change is quite another.Infrastructures are often conceptualised as ‘regeneration projects’, and often – but not always – this is done as part of a larger ‘regeneration economy’. Regeneration projects are usually undertaken in response to the negative effects of development: urban sprawl, desertification, floods, invasive species. But in many cases, including in the Bay Area, the city is largely exempted from the impacts of climate change and habitat loss, and so continues to grow larger and more congested. The question, then, becomes what becomes of the infrastructure built on the backs of its citizens? City governments often claim that the infrastructure they create will be useful in anticipating and adapting to climate change, but this is often done in ways that are not always obvious to users of the infrastructure –</text>

In other words, what infrastructure does is enable and support the capitalist mode of production, but it is oriented towards the service of society as a whole and does not recognize the humanity in the parts that it builds.  Such is the character of modern infrastructure: it supports the capitalist mode of production while remaining ethically ambiguous and simultaneously recognising and protecting its humanity.  But this is precisely what the people who invented ‘infrastructures’ did not intend. The people who invented ‘infrastructures’ were not interested in constituting humanity; rather, their primary concern was to create an enabling infrastructure that would allow the capitalist mode of production to thrive. The infrastructure of the future they imagined would be separate from the infrastructure of the present – a future that no longer exists but which they imagined could be reborn – would be different. But this doesn’t make any social or ecological sense. The present</text>
    <text>brings together vast amounts of data about users that are constantly changing, constantly need to be fed into a cloud that constantly replicates itself – and thus the concept of ‘infrastructure’ is of necessity pre-exists in a certain kind of historical and contemporary sense. But infrastructure is only ever thought of as an important set of relations between user and provider – an important set of infrastructures of all kinds – and rarely, if ever, refers to the social or political conditions of life on the ground. In this sense, the term is often misused. Infrastructure is often misconstrued as a locative concept, a term that refers to a physical space or terrain on the ground, and not necessarily to the social relations that generate, define or emerge from that surface.  And this misapplication of the term ‘infrastructure’ is particularly dangerous, for one of the functions of infrastructure is to deliver information about the physical world (architecture) in an organised fashion, to enable, support and facilitate certain social relations (how to live together, for example). Thus the infrastructuralised contemporary infrastructure is not really an infrastructure in the conventional sense, but rather a social relation that emerges from the interaction of platforms, devices and software. It is the interface between platforms, devices and algorithms, and its evolving face-value (how users interact with it) as a function of how well the platforms, devices and software are supported, facilitated and entwined. And yet the term is constantly being misused, to simultaneously refer to an evolving set of relations but also to an evolving set of values. Such a misapplication of the term ‘infrastructures’ would render a great many social  functions, but it would also render many social  functions into non-existent zones of techno-utopian fantasy.  Ultimately, the infrastructuralisation of our contemporary mode of life is a social process that must be faced, and it is happening at a prodigious rate</text>

When such social relations are institutionalised, they create what Thomas Dolgoff calls ‘institutional racism’. In the social-psychological sense, this can mean racism against workers, against people of colour, against immigrants, against people from other parts of the world, but it can also refer to forms of racism and xenophobia that are rooted in specific historical and present-political orders and ideologies, but are also influenced by global capitalism and its various utopian ideologies.  And here we see another example of the social-psychological sense of the word ‘infrastructure’: when we talk about infrastructure today, we are often struck by how little infrastructure (in the modern sense of the word) refers to bodies of water, mountains and remote coastal islands. We tend to think of railways, roads and ports as essential to the functioning of a modern economy, but these are only some of the</text>

So ‘infrastructure’ can be understood as a social concept, and not necessarily as an economic one.  Moreover, in the current economic and financial conjuncture, which element of the infrastructure – the physical infrastructure, the virtual infrastructure, and the virtual medium – is under attack most heavily by aggressive new forms of data and analytics that seek to replace the traditional infrastructures with highly interactive digital technologies. This element of the infrastructural imaginary is being continuously reshaped, and infrastructure itself is often misconstrued or even praised in ways that undermine its essential social function.  Infrastructures are often depicted in an idealised form, as if they’re autonomous living libraries of knowledge and capabilities that offer a solution to all problems. But this is often a far cry from the life of the infrastructural imaginary, and the life of the infrastruct</text>

If the social relations that generate, define or emerge from the surface of a city are not taken into account in the design of infrastructures, then there is a risk that the very ideas and behaviours that generate infrastructure will not be able to take root or be fully realised.   A more accurate and powerful rendering, however, would be one that takes into account the social dimensions of infrastructure, and how they create and reshape the urban space and its relation to the ground. Such an approach would render the infrastructure in question as a social process that is centred on, and dependent on, the many relations between different stakeholders and actors (infrastructures), rather than the single point of origin or origin of urban space.  The fact that infrastructure is often misconstrued as a single term (infrastructure, in fact, is an eclectic and variable term) is a hallmark of the historical and contemporary condition of cities.</text>

The notion of entanglement is deeply embedded in the organisation of the web, and Pelloux was no exception. His ideas were put into practice during the war, and as a consequence the web was able to function at an organisational level within the military. The web was able to communicate with each other, and given the right set of conditions could be used to create ‘outsider’ environments where communication could take place. The conditions for this were set out in a document known as the Joint Publication of Information Theory and Computer Science, and they required that the theory and methods underpinning this new form of virtualisation be developed in secret, so as not to disturb the peace and quiet of the population. The decision to create secret forums for the implementation of this new form of virtualisation was taken at a conference known as ‘Conferences of the Alliance’, chaired by the US Vice-Admiral Robert Powers and attended by over 200 military and civilian representatives from across the globe. The title of the conference was a trap, however.

The name ‘Auspicious Occasion’ derives from a French essay by Auguste Condorcet, ‘On the Occasion of Popular Imagination’, in L’Administration pour l’(1922) 3–22. Here, Condorcet addresses the motif of the ‘occasion’ in an idealised fashion: ‘The Occasion is a stage or set of relations between the human species and a divine power, which confer a certain amount of power and influence.’ He begins by describing the human tendency towards contingency: ‘The tendency is to act out particular plans and desires, to defer to unawares and unpredictable causes, to pervert all natural motives…The tendency towards contingency is the outcome of a social evolution, an in-evolution that has entailed the collective making of heroes and villains, heroes and pagans, heroes and mummies, heroes</text>

The notion of entanglement is deeply embedded in the organisation of the web, and Pelloux was no exception. His ideas were put into practice during the war, and as a consequence the web was continually redefining what was and was not possible in wartime. As the name implies, the web was thought to be interactive, and in that sense interactive media could influence outcomes, at least in part. The term ‘entangled’ refers to media and technologies that constantly seek to connect to and become part of another, albeit hidden, form of reality.  If the name sounds familiar, it’s because many of the ideas and practices that made their way into the web were later taken up and developed by Stanley Weber, a name that comes up again and again in relation to the process of visualisation. Weber’s ideas and projects were adopted by other artists and visual artists, and his name is part of the equation that gives the organisation of time and space that leads to the ‘real’. Stanley Weber was born in 1894, in the small town of Lule, in the Czech province of Sopron. His family</text>

The notion of entanglement is deeply embedded in the organisation of the web, and Pelloux was no exception. His ideas were put into practice during the war, and as a consequence the web was transformed: networks of symbols and terms started to appear on maps, and the military took an interest in mapping them. The military initially focused on the design of new ships to be used in the event that Japan attacked, but the ultimate objective was to create a comprehensive picture of the web that would allow the surveillance of all traffic on the web. This was the mission of a 'black box' – a device that interconnects many different types of systems – which would then allow automated analysis of that traffic, such as identifying patterns of movement or analysing hidden exchanges of information between systems. In 1955, a team led by Vern Maurey, who went on to become a professor of information theory at MIT, and Andrei Shoryukhov, a theoretical physicist, came up with a better idea: automated speech recognizers would identify patterns within a given set of symbols, and the systems would do the rest.

The notion of entanglement is deeply embedded in the organisation of the web, and Pelloux was no exception. His ideas were put into practice during the war, and as a consequence the military ended up developing a wide range of defensive and offensive cybernetic systems. The end result was that many of its functions were transferred from the navy to the private sector. The end result is that the military has a huge budget but little use for it. Pelloux’s ideas are controversial, and he was accused of masterminding the black-hole web, but his claims are that the navy had the upper hand because its mission was defined exclusively as defensive. In other words, the navy had the upper hand because it had the conceptual framework, and thus its users, in place. The ‘war on terror’ ostensibly came about because of this inefficiency, but Pelloux was part of a team that also included Francis Perrault, William Clowes and Edward Teller. The key figure here is Clowes, who developed the concept of the black-hole web and was an early proponent of the notion that information is compressed into manageable units. </text>

The notion of entanglement is deeply embedded in the organisation of the web, and Pelloux was no exception. His ideas were put into practice during the war, and as a result of this, the web was divided into discrete areas under the joint auspices of the Admiralty and the Royal Navy. One of the first projects undertaken by the RCA with this codename was the Auspicious Occasion - a name that stuck. It was a collaboration between the RCA, the RMA and the National Gallery. What the site featured was intended to be a ‘double cover’ - a double entanglement of secrecy and public access. So while the public galleries witnessed the return of objects, the galleries housed secret services. The artworks were dismantled in 1954, but portions of the material were salvaged by the National Gallery and re-purposed. Now known as the National Gallery/Royal Museums Liverpool, the Auspicious Occasion/1950s New York World·1  series was an excuse to revisit forgotten moments - from the Second World War, to the 1960s Burma refugee crisis, to the 1980s </text>

As the film ARRIV shows, the web was used to great effect, enabling the swift military intervention that changed the course of events. ARRIV   	The film ARRIV shows the web as a potential response to the threat posed by a hostile and insecure internet. The film also shows that the web could be used in a number of other creative and subversive ways. Many of the participants in the project were academics, and their work is a reflection of the broad range of professions that might benefit from access to information facilitated by the internet. The film also shows that at one time or another, many of the people involved in the project were faced with the challenge of replicating the success of the project in the field, and of course, that part of the answer has always been online support.

His ideas were put into practice during the war, and as a result the military came to understand the web as a a vast and ever-shifting labyrinth of potential outcomes.In the 1960s, Edward Said theorised that ‘the web is a gigantic assembly of contradictory information that we collectively put together’ and that this collective ‘undermines our sense of the uncanny’. In the 1990s, Paul Domela developed this ‘implication’ in relation to terrorist attacks carried out in countries around the world, and in particular in London. In the 2000s, the German philosopher and sociologist Melanie Phillips argued that the web is increasingly understood as a ‘system of interrelated phenomena’, one of many systems on a planetary scale. More and more, we are coming to understand the web as a ‘complex assemblage of physical, mental and spatial relations that are themselves constantly in motion’.

His ideas were put into practice during the war, and as a result formed the basis of the Joint Intelligence Committee, which was charged with gathering and analysing intelligence on Germany before and during the war.The Joint Intelligence Committee was established as a hybrid military and civilian intelligence organisation, created to provide both military and civilian intelligence on German activities in Europe. The role of the Joint Committee during the war was limited to gathering statistics on the enemy’s military expenditures and military production, and providing that information to the President and Congress. The committee was not authorised to engage in combat, but its primary responsibility was to gather and compile statistics on the enemy’s civilian population. Pelloux’s ideas were put into practice during the war, and the committee continued to exist today as a private organisation, although its website includes a recording of its activities.In the film ‘ProjectIONA’, a young woman from the Joint Intelligence Committee speaks of her excitement when she first heard of the plans to create a visualisation of the Holocaust in collaboration with the U</text>

The subtitle of the Italian language edition of the book is a ‘Lavorato Morale De Avanzio’, which roughly translates as ‘The Port of Avanzio’. It was designed so that when a monument was discovered in the city, it would be possible to hear its news report online, in both Italian and English. In addition, the city’s website’s metaverse feature allowed visitors to find articles about Avanzio in their local language, while the exhibition’s cover featured an image of a ship submerged in the ocean. The idea was that this kind of accessibility would spread far and wide, contributing to the spread of knowledge about the city and its history. In this sense, ‘the port’ was creating a parallel universe where other cities could also exist. The idea that one could step inside of this other universe and experience a completely different world was an important one for this project. While the portal itself may or may not be a portal to another world, its appearance suggests to visitors that the two don’t belong together. In an ideal world, the portal should be able to manifest itself in subtle and yet significant ways – like a distortion, like a</text>

The subtitle of the Italian language edition of the book is a ‘Lavorato Morale De Avanzio’, which roughly translates as ‘The Port of Avanzio’. It was designed so that when a monument was found in a city, it could be ‘reinterpreted’ by any number of city residents, giving the impression that the city was ever present in an ever-widening range of different places. Some might say this is unreal, but the Italian urbanizer Joseph Ratzinger would no longer need to worry about the movement of troops in and out of the city, as a matter of course. Human nature being what it is, Ratzinger’s dream was fulfilled in Porto Allegre, not in Venice or Milan. The creation of museums and galleries in the city was a mistake, not an option. Nowadays, the only thing keeping the city’s cultural life alive is the need for thousands of tourists, which is met by the city getting richer and richer, and more and more of the tourism depends on the city becoming spectacular.

The subtitle of the Italian language edition of the book is a ‘Lavorato Morale De Avanzio’, which roughly translates as ‘The Port of Avanzio’. It was designed so that when a monument was selected, it could be changed or omitted, so that ‘a single event could be recorded and interpreted in many places.’ So, for example, when the Italian pavilion was completed in 1884, it was possible to register many different interpretations of its architectural styles, from the traditional Italian to the unconventional Portuguese, in one place, and with one text that captured this diversity. This idea of ‘one single space’ was key to the power of the archive, since it allowed this multi-lingual text to take root in the local culture, while simultaneously offering a spatial barrier that ensured only a specific set of people could access it.Another example of the power of the microchip is found in the small electronic transponder that records the position and movement of every migrant and trafficked person in the Italian-U.S. border region every 90 seconds. This technology allows border guards to follow up on leads that migrant and trafficked persons may have left behind, and</text>

The subtitle of the Italian language edition of the book is a ‘Lavorato Morale De Avanzio’, which roughly translates as ‘The Port of Avanzio’. It was designed so that when a monument was located in the center of a city, it could be accessed by a variety of means, including a staircase or underground tunnel, a ferris wheel, a water wheel, and even a drone. In the traditional Italian metropolis, this would mean finding the most optimal location for a temple or cathedral, and filling it with shops, museums, cultural institutions, cafés, night clubs, gardens and so forth. In an ideal world, Morale De Avanzio would be able to accurately reflect the current state of urbanisation in the city, while remaining anonymous and insular. But as we all know, this is not ideal, and in an increasingly digital city with ubiquitous connectivity, ubiquitous surveillance and omnipresent data, the ‘real life’ of cities is what prevails. It is very difficult to imagine a future in which all aspects of a city would be available to anyone, especially when anonymity is a concern. Morale De Avanzio seeks to capture this ephemeral</text>

It was designed so that when a monument was selected, it could be altered to suit the needs of the community. In this sense, the MMM is not only an extension of the traditional, but also an innovation, allowing us to think of the city as a living organism. It was conceived as a collaborative process between the curator’s office, the MMM (Milan Metropolitan Municipi’s Museum), the local community, architects, landscape architects, journalists, historians, artists and many others, who came together in an attempt to come to terms with what was, in effect, a new discovery. In the words of Paolo Portoghesi, who wrote about the archaeology of Venice in the late 1970s, ‘an enormous and continuous change[s] of perception and action[s] was created by the discovery of the city’s monumental architecture and urban fabric, which now became a universal truth throughout the world’.2  	Like the archaeological finds made in and around Venice</text>

The subtitle of the Italian language edition of the book is a ‘Lavorato Morale De Avanzio’, which roughly translates as ‘The Port of Avanzio’. It was designed so that when a monument to the Italian colonial era was found in Egypt, the Italian version could be found in Egypt as a footnote. So while the Morale de Avanzio was initially published in both Italian and Egyptian, a local Egyptian version was also published in the Italian language, in an edition of the journal that was read by not only the editor and publisher, but also a local Egyptian audience. The subtitle of the Egyptian edition was a paraphrase of the Italian ‘Lavorato Morale De Avanzio’, but since the two were published at the same time, a local Italian version was published in the Egyptian edition as well. So while the Italian and Egyptian editions of the journal read identically, the local Egyptian edition added a note of its own, commenting on the monumentality of the task at hand and suggesting a parallel history that might be relevant to our own. This parallel history would read much like the Italian one, in that the early modern period is characterised by multiple contemporaneous versions</text>

It was designed so that when a monument was found in a city, it could be ‘reinterpreted’ to reflect the city’s current condition. For this reason, the Italian language edition of the book often refers to the current situation, rather than the past, while the actual text of the book often acts as a past marker. In this sense, it acts like a permanent archive, recording and mapping the city as it exists today. The reason why the Italian language edition of the Port of Avanzio is so closely related to the urban condition in the United States is because the two have a common, but varying, set of historical conditions and representations of the city. Thus, the very title of the Italian language edition of the Port of Avanzio is a sort of synchronic form of the American museum. In fact, the exhibition on the same day in Milan as the Biennale of Architecture and Design (ABD) is almost entirely devoted to the history of urbanisation in the United States</text>

It was designed so that when a monument was discovered in the city, it would be accessible by walking through the pages, rather than requiring a key. The project was also developed in collaboration with the Biennale di Tella, Italy’s oldest and largest cultural organisation, whose members are among the oldest continuously employed in the country. Their remit expanded from the original biennale to include the production and installation of artworks and cultural organisations.In 2014, a group of young women from the Avanzio region started the Avanzio Women’s College, a free college for women in Avanzio. This college currently has a enrolment of 20 students, including eight current students who have completed their programmes. In addition to providing a place for women to learn about art and design, the college also offers a space for them to explore design through projects such as Homebaked, which pairs the building of an artist with the building of a cooperative, a housing co-operative, a bakery cooperative and a youth club</text>

It was designed so that when a monument was selected as the theme for the year’s edition of the journal, the editors would have the opportunity to collectively think about and award the most deserving candidates to be included in the actual book. For the Italian language edition of the journal, the editors would have the opportunity to collectively nominate one urban landscape from a field of twenty-five architectural styles. The choices were: architecture of the virtual (the city is a virtual landscape), cities in the virtual (the computer is a virtual machine), and a landscape composed of millions of virtual nodes (the Internet is a virtual network). The virtual landscape was to be shared between the councilors, the museum and the city. The museum and the city were to nominate twenty-five urban designs for inclusion in the book. The councilors, in turn, would select a number of equally deserving designs from the pool of suitable entries, and from the pool of worthy candidates, and from the pool of worthy candidates, and so on.

It was designed so that when a monument was discovered in the city, it would be accessible through a series of cuttings, and the text would then be distributed across local newspapers, leading into online publication. All the information on the monument, including the cuttings, would then be available in a single place, even if the newspaper itself did not yet have the latest information. The cuttings would also serve as a database for future additions to the museum collection, providing new information on the monuments found there. A museum or a gallery of any kind is an essential component of any ecological or urban policy ‘based on the assumption that individuals and communities will be able to make decisions for the greater good’. Its job is to facilitate and facilitate creatively, whether that involves investing in art or in the creation of a site-specific cultural landscape through its collection or display of art, or contributing to an urban ecosystem through its collection or display of cultural resources.

Its mission statement, released in 1984, read as follows: ‘To document the cultural effects of changes in its location and population over a period of twenty-five years … [T]he Museum should exhibit works that reveal a city’s creative fate.’ If, as the museum’s present president, Daniel Baumann asserts, the Museum of Modern Art will be a ‘recreational art center’, then the Museum of Art and Design will be a ‘cultural laboratory’, where the Museum of Modern Art can inquire into ‘the cultural impact of a given location on the cultural map of the world’.14 Such statements, while placing great emphasis on the importance of preserving cultural characteristics, are also characterised by a search for new forms of organisation and control.

As a result, cultural biennials have tended to develop bureaucratised forms of governance, or take the hierarchical form of monolithic art collections. However, the search for ‘cultural characteristics’ that can be leveraged through new forms of cultural production does not necessarily end up in monolithic forms of governance. As biennials become more institutionalised and the art collections more extensive, the need for the Museum of Modern Art to be able to effectively coordinate all its activities decreases. At the same time, the Museum of Modern Art has to be creative and imaginative in its uses of cultural resources, in order to design activities that are not confined to the conventionality of museum collections. If the Museum of Modern Art is to achieve its stated mission of showcasing contemporary art worldwide, it is critical that it develops long-term relationships with artists, curators, art writers and other cultural stakeholders. Otherwise, the impact of its exhibitions and programming will be constrained by the resources available to the institution. The potential</text>

As a result, the Museum of Modern Art was able to devote significant resources (at one point spending over $5 million) to renovating and expanding its grounds and building new buildings on the site, while simultaneously undertaking a series of educational programmes in an attempt to instill a ‘culture of sustainability’ in the residents of the neighbourhood.15 Such programmes included creating partnerships with non-profit organisations, community organisations and foundations, as well as with local government and tourism agencies, in an attempt to draw tourists to the area. However, these efforts quickly fell on deaf ears among the wider community, who viewed the art as a detractor rather than an integral part of the community. At the same time, cultural tourism was developing a backlash, which could be seen as a possible counterattack. While the art was certainly a draw, it was also being used as a tool to exert political and social influence, often through violence and intimidation, in an attempt to impose ‘culturally specific tourism parad</text>

Its mission statement, released in 1984, read as follows: ‘To document the cultural effects of changes in its location and population over a period of twenty-five years … [T]he Museum should exhibit works that reveal a city’s creative fate.’ If, as the museum’s present president, Daniel Baumann asserts, the Museum of Modern Art will be a ‘recreational art center’, then the Museum of Art and Design will be a ‘cultural laboratory’, where the Museum of Modern Art can inquire into ‘the cultural impact of a given location on the cultural map of the world’.14 Such statements, while placing great emphasis on the importance of preserving cultural characteristics, are also characterised by a search for new forms of organisation and control. As a result, any aspirations of the Museum of Modern Art to become a museum of culture are likely to be frustrated, if not opposed by the prevailing power structures. If, on the other hand, such a transformation is made at the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Art and Design will undoubtedly find new ways of organising itself, and new ways of organising its diverse stakeholders, including those stakeholders who are concerned about the impact of a museum of modern art being built in their neighbourhood. The question is which order will the different stakeholders take up? Will the Museum of Modern Art be able to absorb all stakeholders, or will the Museum of Art and Design be able to absorb only a minority? Will the Museum of Modern Art be able to absorb all stakeholders, or will the new Cultural Centre be able to absorb only a minority? Over the next twenty years, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various museum collections, as well as their materiality and immensity, will be counted among a council of museum</text>

As a result, in the twenty-first century, museums have increasingly come to represent a blend of old and new, preservationists and those who seek to reanimate and institutionalise. The identification of a single museum building as the primary site of the Museum of Modern Art, as suggested by the Deena Chalabi exhibition project, seems particularly misleading. As the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art have demonstrated, sites can be found elsewhere in the city, in parks, near high-speed rail networks, in industrial parks and even in some former parks. Nevertheless, this identification is pervasive, and it is often enough to identify the museum itself. For instance, the Museum of Modern Art is often enough identified with the name of a company, a corporation or an individual, while the Museum of Modern Art in New York often enough has a full name. In a recent survey of world art collections, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art, as well as other art institutions,</text>

As a result, the project that emerged from these statements found itself engaged in a number of contested practices, which were characterised by a search for new ‘values’ in the social and cultural life of cities. As a result of these processes of cultural cannibalism, the cultural landscape that emerged after 1980 is characterised by a search for new ways of organising and governing cultural resources. For its part, the Museum of Modern Art sought to expand its exhibitionary portfolio, and through a number of initiatives such as fund-raisers, distribution agreements and even sponsoring symposia, to absorb more and more of the urban centre into a citywide cultural nexus. In a number of cities, including those in North America, the Museum of Modern Art established cultural institutions with titles such as ‘The Museum of Art’, which became a synonym for the Museum of Modern Art. As biennials spread throughout North America and Europe, and as the institutions that emerged after 1980 became increasingly institutional</text>

As a result, the museum has frequently been compared to ‘the local branch’ of the museum, or ‘the museum branch’ of a museum.15 So it is with the museum. It is a museum that is constantly reminding us that it is a museum, and in so doing, reminding us even though we do not yet know how.</text>

As a result, their authors seem to suggest that such institutions are not only capable of surviving but actively encourage their ongoing growth. They advocate a ‘new ‘ middle class’ if, as the American economist, Joseph Stiglitz claims, we cannot grow the economy &quot;without changing the social composition of society&quot;.15 These ‘cultural determinants’ that they purport to explain – that is, the social forces shaping and shaping culture – are deeply ambiguous, and significant developments in one direction can have disastrous consequences in another. It is easy to blame artists, curators, collectors, writers and others with a range of identities that mix with artists and artworks, but this simplistic analysis cannot capture the complex web of cultural and economic flows and influences shaping contemporary art and contemporary life. Curators, writers and collectors today often work in concert, and sometimes in conflict, with each other, artists, art professionals, artists’ curators, art fair organisers, art collectors and other</text>

As James Howard Kunstler notes, the search for ‘cultural characteristics’ continues to be a central task of the Museum of Modern Art, although the Museum’s own leadership does not always appear to approve of or endorse these efforts: ‘The Museum has often been accused of being too neat and uniformed, lacking in sparkle and lacking in personality … lacking in imagination … lacking in spirit … lacking in goals … and lacking in affection … lacking in tenderness … lacking in tenderness … lacking in sex … lacking in depth … lacking in interest … lacking in art … lacking in tenderness … lacking in affection … lacking in sex … lacking in depth … lacking in sex … lacking in friendship … lacking in sex … lacking in goals … and lacking in tenderness … lacking in sex … lacking in love … lacking in sex … and more]'.15 As a result of these discourses and from a variety of other factors, including the proliferation of art collecting in post-World War</text>

As late as the 1970s in some quarters, questions of jurisdiction and constitutional rights were raised by movements within the art world. This is most evident in the legal battles over the history of the veto and its relationship to contemporary art; questions that, in recent decades, have become less salient. Nevertheless, the search for new forms of organisational structure and new forms of cultural production continues unabated, whether questions of identity or notions of public space. As a result, the Museum of Modern Art has often been described as an ‘inside-outside kind of a museum’. In fact, the term ‘museum’ is frequently used in a broader sense, encompassing institutions of all kinds, including primary and secondary cultural institutions, including primary and secondary databases, archives and collection services, museums and collections, but especially of primary and secondary art institutions.15 The Museum of Modern Art began as a cooperative initiative between the Artistic Board of the New York City Transit Museum and the artist</text>

As the logic of contemporary capitalism is oriented towards the production of ever greater amounts of surplus, it is unsurprising that cultural Marxists seek to replace traditional art galleries, public museums, artistic societies, with designated cultural zones encompassing a given area or region. As a result, the Museum of Modern Art was one of the first institutions to develop a dedicated cultural zone, which it continues to maintain today. This is a remarkably common occurrence in the early to mid-1990s, when the biennial market started to soften its blow in the form of decreased numbers and declining interest. Nevertheless, the Museum of Modern Art continues to grow in size and diversity, displaying, this cycle, a register that includes artists from around the world, as well as artists from the United States and other parts of the world. At the turning of the century, the Museum of Modern Art had over 2,000 artists from twenty-one countries, and the following fifteen present and former curators: Andy Warhol, Diane Arbus</text>

It’s the social relationship between people and the city, between people and the river, between people and the continent – and everywhere in between. Image is  	derived from the river Thames, named for the English naturalist John Muir (1839–1907), who first described it in 1837. The image was taken during a six-week scientific expedition sponsored by the British Museum and the Zoological Society of London. 	The image was probably not a new one. As early as the 19th century, artists and artists’societies were using the image of the river as a proxy for social issues.

It’s a metaphor for the social relation between people and the river, but it’s also a metaphor for the social relation between images. When taken literally, it’s supposed to mean that images represent something in a social relationship, but in a very particular way, in that they’re meant to be understood by and for that particular social relation. That particular social relation is cultural, political and economic. Cultural relations are supposed to manifest themselves through images, but they also influence how images are made and what kinds of relations they form. And there’s a particular way in which the image is supposed to manifest itself: with meaning. 	That means that the artist has a set set set of tools to work with in order to achieve what she wants out of an image – whether that’s symbolism, symbolism as a form, or just plain old meaning.

In the twentieth century, the image of the river became very influential, and in recent decades has become a symbol of technological progress. From the oil crisis of the 1970s to the technology industry’s reliance on renewable energies of the future, the image of the river has become a crucial point of intersection. It was this notion of the image that characterises the anthropologist Susanne Habermas’s concept of technologisation in relation to labour and labour power. It’s this notion that power brokers use to justify and automate production, and to a large extent of what they do in that relation. Power brokers</text>

The image of the ship, the image of the river, the image of the ship’s poop – these are images that we tell many different stories through, each one representing a different aspect of the social life of the city. And yet all these different stories also have one in common: they’re images of social destruction. In other words, the story of the ship, the river, the image of the ship is one of social struggle. It’s the story of the emergence of a new social order based on the exchange of social commodities. But in the process of telling such a story, many of these social transformations also undergo a kind of metamorphosis. And each of the cultural practices discussed in the exhibition has a kind of metamorphosis into another form, into another world. 	In the exhibition ‘Signal</text>

The image of the ship, by contrast, is a very individual image that reflects the social relations among people in a particular locality, and yet it’s also a metaphor for a very specific kind of social relation. 	The significance of the image of the ship, then, lies in the fact that it establishes a relational link between people that goes beyond the bounds of what can be described as ‘the service or appearance of things’. It establishes a kind of shared ontological status between the things that’re in a particular place, and the large scheme of relations that’s now evolving in the city. The image of the ship, as David Harvey puts it, establishes ‘a prior relation between things and means … [that] can be understood as meaning something’.

This is the kind of thing that the social-studies department at Liverpool John Moores University might do, if that’s where their fancy research funded journals turn up. It’s a legacy of the ship that still sits on the dock, the kind of image that comes up in conversation between people from the ship and the city. It’s a image that comes up in references to Liverpool. But what does it mean to be an image? Art’s image is a metaphor, but what kind of metaphor is that?

But what if the image of the river as a monster or a symbol of social disorder is no longer relevant? What if images no longer represent the world through images but produce social changes? What if the image of the river as a monster or a symbol of social disorder represents a world in which we are capable of constructing our social relations around?

It’s a metaphor for the social relation between people and the river, but it’s also a metaphor for the social relation between social beings like ourselves. And the way in which the river is tied into the social is through what sociologist Helga Nowotny calls ‘sea-level’.1 Nowotny defines ‘sea-level’ as ‘the area between 1 and 9 m above sea level’.2 At present, the sea is about 590 m above sea level. As the sea levels rise, so does the risk of flooding, which affects millions of people in coastal areas all over the world. But even before the advent of accurate measurement tools, there’s a reason why the image of the inundated landscape forms part of a much larger urban context: because of the way in which images are made and taken across the board, including in coastal areas. 	So images make sense of what’s at stake in coastal locations? And if images of flooded coastal locations do form part of a larger context of ideas, what does it mean for an image</text>

The image of the ship, the image of the river, the image of the ship’s poop – these are all images that we use in social situations to make inferences about reality. And yet they also symbolise certain things. For example, when I saw the George Brown exhibition in Liverpool, I got the idea that the image of the river represented a certain kind of life. I thought that the way in which the poem ended was a metaphor for what the artist was trying to do. By the time the poem was written, the image of the river had become a very different kind of life. The image of the river as a major waterway in and through which people produced and defined their identities, aspirational politics and the way in which images functioned as media for cultural production. And so the image of the polluted river became a symbol of something else entirely. The advent of photography in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s instantly reconnoitered</text>

Its practitioners saw themselves to be able to carve ever-larger, more complicated transformations into what David Harvey, the anthropologist, would later call ‘living stones’, that could then be used either (1) by indigenous people to build ‘concrete jungles’ or (2) by humans to make new kinds of buildings and tools that could then be used either (1) by indigenous people or (2) by humans to make new kinds of ecological and urban changes. As the Agua Caliente project demonstrated, the ability to imagine new uses for already-constructed sites was a decisive turning point in how ecologically active cultural practices were viewed.6. The ‘use it or lose it’ dilemma. The use of cultural resources shifts public attitudes and even norms. The imperative to reuse, or to build new ways of using, cultural resources seems self-perpetuating. Even if it is criticised as naïve and unrealistic, the reclamation of cultural sites</text>

Systems biology—the discipline that would later come to be applied to the regulation of energy and the use of land and water—saw this as a major step backwards. Its practitioners saw their work in the service of an increasingly sophisticated regulatory state that sought to control everything from the content of one’s newsfeed to the precise composition of one’s DNA. This kind of political and technical definition of the new normal allowed political actors to assume new kinds of power in ways that were not necessarily in their own best interests. Towards a fuller understanding of the forms and processes of global material abundance this journal referred to as ‘the overcome materiality’.1      And so the story of the nomadic biennial began to be retold, told again and again and again and yet never truly understood by those who witnessed it. [1] See, for example, Bernard Stiegler, ‘The Biennial Condition: On Contemporaneity and the Episodic’, in Cultural Capitalism: Contemporaneity and the Episodic, ed.

Systems biology—the discipline that would later come to be applied to the regulation of energy and the use of land and water—saw this as a major step backwards. Its practitioners saw technological innovation as inherently productive, and directed their efforts towards developing ever larger, more encompassing systems that could monitor and control more data (in the form of apps, websites, data feeds, infrastructures and smart meters). In this sense, the idea of the connected city was much more readily adaptable: it could be controlled via apps, smart meters and networks, and its inhabitants could self-build smart cities in response to the needs of the times.In these ways, the connected city did not exist in isolation; it was part of a larger system that included data collection, distribution and consumption (see Stem and Branch, 2015). But the scale of this change also changed things. Local and regional actors had a major impact on what was considered to be the normal course of events, and so a new kind of urbanism was born. This could be seen as a positive or a negative development for any city, depending on the goals of the city. In the vast cities</text>

At the same time, the scale of these trends was rapidly growing, making it increasingly difficult for the once-every-five-years cycle to maintain its shape. How do we navigate these new technological tides? In an effort to grasp the full implications of the ever-more pervasive digital revolution, it is worth recalling that the journal Stages had been written in the year 2000. Is there any way to read this article today, or will the digital technologies that litter our lives eventually render its themes as quaint and outdated? It is very easy to create a digital version of the journal, to go online and read the article on the web, or even to take the time to research the history of your own cultural evolution. But it is much harder to peruse a magazine or read a book in its current form</text>

Systems biology offered a way to imagine new modes of social organization, but its real innovation came in the areas of land and water. Systems biology offered a way to imagine new forms of political organisation, but its real innovation was in the areas of data and technology. As Michael Slackman had already remarked about the hugely influential book The ANNALS of the Fourth International, which had been recently reissued, including the original work in full, which he was reading on his feet, and which he described as ‘full-fledged historical societies with their own gods and goddesses’, a moment of vivid epiphany gave him ‘the idea that you could actually get into these things. You could actually pick and choose which gods and goddesses you wanted to follow.’ This was to be the governance of life via codes, or perhaps just as much the governance of life as the very notion.</text>

In other words, they sought to understand the world in ways that would permit such systems to understand and respond to changing conditions, including those caused by natural disasters. As the journal Stages editorialized, ‘the challenge of our times is to understand not just what is happening but why’.  	These kinds of philosophical and political statements are to be found in almost every book published in the years immediately after the end of the industrial revolution. Notable exceptions include Martin Heide’s Things Fall Apart (1990), and Gregory Bateson’s powerful yet flawed Constantine (2011), but the themes and generalizations that have filtered through in both books are the same.

This is why it is so easy for a malicious party to take an entire hard drive – a large amount of data – and make things look as though they have been encrypted by accident.

Its practitioners saw themselves to be able to monitor and control what was happening all around them, and so they sought ways to rethink what that might look like. In this sense, the water tanks at the end of the 1990s were a turn-off for a culture that was already undergoing major changes. But we should also note that the water tanks at the beginning, and even the middle, of the century represented a shift from the commodity form of production to the form of service that could be offered by new forms of organization: in other words, they weren’t just an artifact of the commodity form, but one that could be offered in service of the future that was increasingly uncertain. The main reason for the popularity of these images is that they are easy to parse into many different forms. They represent the new service systems that are emerging in industries that were formerly based on ownership (of land and energy, for example), and they signal a shift from the former to the latter. But to get at</text>

Systems biology—the discipline that would later come to be applied to the regulation of energy and the use of land and water—saw this as a major step backwards. Its practitioners saw it as something that required a science-based background. So what had once been seen as the classical bio-technical understanding of how control surfaces interact—the ways in which they produce and absorb energy, how they could be programmed to do certain things and, ultimately, how they could all be managed in the service of producing ever more—saw mechanisation becoming the new normalisation. And so, in that sense, the biennial emerged not as a new kind of art event, but as an event that is more fully aware of its place and global implications. It seeks to be used, to be taken apart and rebuilt, to be reconfigured in the service of producing ever more. This kind of modularity is at the heart of what biennials strive to be. It is a technology that is designed to be rebuilt, and so it is both vulnerable and responsive to changes in the service that it provides, whether that is as a site for an art event, or whether it is</text>

In this sense, sensors and computer chips became embedded in everything from building materials to building materials themselves. By the late 1990s, however, industrial scale desalination seemed like an impractical dream, partly because desalination requires large amounts of energy and because of the potential destabilizing effects of high salt concentrations. Still, industrial scale desalination represented an ideal in which to begin thinking about alternatives, and so the ideas were regularly brought to wider publics through various public-service announcements, reports, textbooks, films, and music programmes. At a high level, these included the work of the likes of Terry Smith, Steve James and the late Terry Gilliam, to name only a few. At a</text>

Given the city’s current overbuilding and ballooning housing market, which is fueling a rapid population explosion, it is not surprising that New Yorkers are increasingly turning to alternative, less stressful ways to spend their time.  As the New York Times reported in 2015, when the market forecasted a whopping 200,000 new condo towers would be built in the city between 2015 and 2024, only 20,000 new homes were created.  So far, so normal, but what does the G2 mean for the city’s fragile ecosystem? When did the market turn? When was the last time the market was this volatile?  The answer, unfortunately, is not easy to define. While the NASDAQ Composite Index has skyrocketed in the past two decades due to wild market exuberance, the sheer volume of transactions has tended to obscure real activity.  So while the G2 does mean more construction, it also means more need for energy, which tends to obscure real-life activities such as farming.  Perhaps the G</text>

Given the city’s current overbuilding and abandonment of abandoned properties, and the fact that the port is the city’s sole remaining source of oil, the G2 would be able to revitalize abandoned areas on the island’s coastline and in the surrounding region.  In addition, the G2 would provide a steady stream of oil tankers for passage through the Straits of Malacca, and possibly China’s western Strait in case of emergency.  Finally, the ‘green wall’ would act as a barrier to sea-level rise, creating a domed coastal fortress in the truest sense of the word.  Whether the ‘green wall’ is actually going to be built is anyone’s guess, but given the dire predictions of climate scientists regarding the consequences of a warming sea level, it is curious that the O'Higgins family hasn’t yet decided whether or not to build the green wall themselves.

Given the city’s current overbuilding and debt levels, this project is far more economically viable for the city than the failed 2015 Bay Bridge Replacement Initiative (Bricklink), which would have placed an even larger strain on already limited public resources.   The other option is to attempt to recreate the Brooklyn Bridge and Tower of Pisa, as well as the G2 in situ, but that would be far too expensive and messy, and over-engineer the flawed original idea. The fact that the O'Higgins family has chosen to remain on Staten Island minimizes the damage done by over-embraced urban decay, while simultaneously offering a degree of resiliency to the region that is hard to replicate.  The O'Higgins home will sit atop a grassy knoll, surrounded by accommodations including a community pond, tennis courts, hillside houses and a municipal swimming pool.

Given the city’s current overbuilding problem, an ideal candidate for biennale preservation in the 21st century would certainly preserve the character of the biennale, while supporting a new generation of artists and curators.  Art, at the highest level, is the only truly universal.  	Art has a rich heritage in any culture, and it is increasingly evident throughout the world. 	However, in the 21st century, sometimes art has a political, even apocalyptic, meaning. 	For instance, in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, the Occupy Wall Street movement began in Zuccotti Park on Park Ave in New York. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the park and marched, carrying signs that read ‘We’ll never be Zuccotti Park’s Forgotten Millions. 	The Occupy Wall Street movement ended up being a catalyst for many artists to reconsider their practices, and for the city to redouble its efforts to reconfigure the waterfront into a site-</text>

But given the number of waterfront parks now cropping up along the water’s edge, and the fact that the former ‘Game Island’ is now home to a chain of mini-ponds, this is doubtful. cityscapes@gmail.com 	Jack Burnham, Local Gamekeepers' Association, 2008.

Given the city’s current overbuilding crisis, it is quite conceivable that this path will see the construction of even more housing and port infrastructure along the current M1 corridor, and will see even more built along the G2 corridor. The port terminal may well be the island’s answer to its burgeoning coastline problem.  As the port terminal nears completion, the city will likely choose to tear down old buildings and build new ones, in an attempt to create a smaller footprint but with better urban benefits. However, if the city tries to scale back the new-buildings phase, the old won’t be able to contain the population growth; and in any case, such plans will only exacerbate the already  infrastructural sprawl problem.  Instead, the port may choose to expand its existing terminal infrastructure, creating even bigger ‘hip-shaped’ ‘spaceships’ to serve the ever-expanding ocean.  Such plans have city planners’ attention. They are keen to</text>

Given the city’s current overbuilding and chronic shortage of affordable housing, the G1 and G2 projects are likely to hasten the inevitable displacement of residents in the city’s core, while at the same time hastening the inevitable creation of even more unaffordable housing on the island’s west coast.  The G1 would also give the city unprecedented control over land use and the building of infrastructure, professions and neighbourhoods.  The G2 would enable the city to more directly profit from the housing market’s momentum and create a new type of ‘high-speed train’ linking the two cities.  Such are the trade-offs.  The constant need to draw more tourists and businesses to the beaches and hotels on the west coast contributes to the overbuilding of residential neighbourhoods on the island.  The need to regenerate the sand dunes on the west coast also contributes to the island’s declining population numbers.  Finally, the ever-present threat of sea-level rise threatens to</text>

Given the city’s current overbuilding and chronic shortage of affordable housing, the G2 may well be the only realistic option for the future coastal city.  The other option, which may be more feasible in the near term given the city’s overbuilding and increasing population, is for the port to rebuild coastal roads and bridges, while the city repairs or builds seawall after seawall, some of which will in turn be used by the port as a way to overload a scarce resource and create a new set of problems. Thus the G2 may well become the main source of affordable housing for the near coastal city, while simultaneously supporting the old-fashioned way of building on the island: on an old industrial island.  The G2 may also pave the way for future G3 coastal cities to emerge from the sea.

Given the city’s current overbuilding and malaise, this seems like a good scenario to me.  The G2 would also create a mutually beneficial financial relationship between the city and the port, since the port would get a significant amount of revenue from the construction of the terminal and ferry operations, as well as royalties from the sale of electricity generated from the ocean.  The city’s share would be split equally between the port and the island. As a city, we’d be providing much needed income to shore up essential services, while the island would pick up the slack in case of economic collapse.  The G2 would also create many new jobs at the port, since seafarers would now play second fiddle to drone operators, postal workers, and highway administrators.  Finally, since the terminal is almost certainly  never going to be able to feed its current capacity, the terminal would fall prey to climate change, becoming increasingly uninhabitable.

In 2010, the O'Higgins family home, once a mothballed munitions storage and dry dock, was purchased by the city, and in 2014 the O'Higgins neighborhood was re-zoned from M1 to G1. The development of the M1 to G1 joint development path allows for the production of 1,000+ housing units in a redeveloped area. The G1 encompasses 240,000 hectares, an area roughly the size of Connecticut. The development of the G2 would allow for the production of up to 6,000 new housing units, of which up to 4,000 would be affordable for city-dwelling families.  The G2 would also create thousands of new private-sector jobs in related sectors, as well as significantly expand the island’s already impressive coast-to-coast port terminal.

The G2 would also create thousands of new jobs in related sectors, as well as significantly expand the island’s already impressive coast-to-coast port terminal.  Given the city’s current housing shortage and  	occupancy crisis, this seems like a no-brainer.  The problem with the G2 is that it is so over-engineered that it can no longer sustain a cityscape that it is designed to inhabit.  The city has to find somewhere else to lay its over-capacity claim, and housing has to be found somewhere else as well.  The G2 would solve this problem by allowing for the simultaneous creation of new housing and the ongoing creation of existing housing, while allowing for the city’s over-utilization of both housing resources.

This situation is particularly problematic for places such as Liverpool where the recession has temporarily disrupted the flow of artists and art tourists to help push up shop prices and stem the tide of depleting natural resources. However, it is also increasingly difficult for such tourism to sustain itself, since the natural resources that are being developed in the region are being stretched to the breaking point; infrastructure projects such as new golf courses and hotels are being pulled due to declining population growth and urban sprawl. Meanwhile, the art market is being fuelled by the notion that art is a commodity – a fixed asset class with a price tag that can never be renegotiated – a position that fundamentally misunderstands the nature of art and the industry it supports. 	When the crisis of the housing market in 2008 brought down massive swathes of our urban infrastructure, including vast swathes of infrastructure that fuelled the economy, a lot of people lost their houses and many others had to find new, less blighted, more private housing. Many people who benefitted from the construction of ever-more elaborate financial schemes to make their houses more accessible – paying for these houses with ever more heavily laden credit cards – found themselves struggling with ever-closer regulatory capture and taxation. Meanwhile, the greed and opportunism of real estate speculators and their</text>

This situation is particularly problematic for places such as Liverpool where the recession has temporarily disrupted the flow of artists and art tourists to help push up shop prices and stem the tide of depleting natural resources. However, it is also increasingly difficult for such tourism to sustain itself, since the natural resources that are being developed in the city for the benefit of artists and the curatorial guild are in dire need of replenishment.  As a result, the scarcity of resources is being filled by those who are already in a position to reap the rewards of a growing tourism industry. This situation calls for an approach that takes into account the climate change that is being created, but also the situation in which one finds oneself. This call is most apparent in the area of natural resources, where the increased volume of oil produced per barrel is being paired with the corresponding decrease in volume of natural gas produced. As a result, the climate could be set in motion with greater rapidity than with the more conservative option of continuing to rely on fossil fuels. The combination of a decreasing natural gas output and a significant increase in oil output simultaneously creates a surplus of natural gas and a shortage of oil. This phenomenon is commonly called the &quot;blowhard effect&quot; and was first observed in the North Sea during the 1970s by the Scottish ge</text>

This situation is particularly problematic for places such as Liverpool where the recession has temporarily disrupted the flow of artists and art tourists to help push up shop prices and stem the tide of depleting natural resources. However, it is also increasingly difficult for such tourism to sustain itself, since the natural resources that are being developed along the waterfront are being consumed by ever more ambitious developments. Meanwhile, the infrastructure of the city is being destroyed, diverted or hijacked in an ever more apparent attempt to push the development of bio-industrial forms of art and culture alongside greener forms of transport such as ride-sharing. All these developments are premised on the perception that the city is awash in culture, but to a much lesser extent in other urban resources as well.  In this analysis, I have tended to identify three key trends that pertain to the city at present and in the near future: (1) the growth of lifestyle lifestyles embedded in culture (a.k.a. ‘metro’); (2) the increasing importance of data in a host of cultural practices (a.k.a. ‘applied cognitive’); and (3) the acceleration of data-intensive cultural practices such as augmented reality. All three trends are driven by the perception that there are resources</text>

However, it is also increasingly difficult for such tourism to sustain itself, since the natural resources that are being depleted are becoming increasingly difficult to access and value producing activities such as agriculture and urban redevelopment are displacing workers in the art market. Meanwhile, the biennale industry is in a crisis of overproduction, with overproduction levels that are systematically preventing art from being produced at a rate sufficient to meet demand. The inability to produce enough art when the demand is there is a clear indication that the resources are being used for other, perhaps more pressing, uses. The inability to deplete the resources that are being used to produce art when the resources are being used for other, perhaps more pressing, purposes is also a clear indication that the resources are being misallocated. The inability to engage artists in productive activities when the resources are being used for activities that are inimical to the interests of the art market is a clear indication that the resources are being used in a way not in the interests of the art marketer but in the interests of society.

However, it is also increasingly difficult for such tourism to sustain itself, since the natural resources that are being developed for the city are being used in ways that can be described as 'resource depletion'. The loss of industrial resources has exacerbated the problems of housing and infrastructure, but it has also exacerbated the problems of poverty and social exclusion that are characteristic of postindustrial communities. It is increasingly difficult to find sustainable ways to provide for oneself and one's family. The postindustrial economy is placing an increasing burden on artists and curators, who are often victims of the over-emphasis placed on aesthetics and aesthetics-as-a-system. It is time for the postindustrial economy to address its perceived imbalances and uneven playing fields, to address the perceived shortage of skilled labour and the shortage of socially engaged art and cultural production. A shifting of the balance of global economic, cultural and urban power is needed. The debate on how to achieve this balance should include, but is particularly critical in the current period, as the postindustrial economy seeks to address the potential downsides of its current pattern of global commodity</text>

However, it is also increasingly difficult for such tourism to sustain itself, since the natural resources that are being developed by the city are being depleted at an alarming rate. If the economic resources underlying the health of the city – culture, heritage, venues – are to be nurtured in the future, then the cultural resources (including the cultural resources) need to be actively engaged in creating an environment in which these cultural resources can flourish in perpetuity. This can only happen if the city is offered a fair and equitable share in the development of its cultural resources. If the market price for cultural resources is too low, then the market will tend to allocate resources unevenly, with significant resources concentrated in the hands of a few dominant economic actors. The financial resources necessary for such a mission would need to be aggressively recruited from outside the city in order to ensure that the cultural resources are deployed efficiently. This would require a new form of urbanisation – one that recognises the cultural resources as a scarce commodity and treats them as such – one that is not beholden to the whims of city planners and the financial sector</text>

However, it is also increasingly difficult for such tourism to sustain itself, since the natural resources that are being developed for the city are increasingly geared towards residential consumption. The dynamics of the urban – in this sense, ‘infrastructure’ – are increasingly influenced by the consumer’s behaviour, and the infrastructural landscape is increasingly a product of consumer needs. It is not surprising, then, that the infrastructure of cities is increasingly being designed in response to needs rather than priorities.  In the context of the crisis of infrastructure in Britain and globally, it is imperative that we collectively come to terms with the fact that the infrastructural defence mechanism that we collectively create and buy into is becoming increasingly obsolete. This is a crisis that is likely to get worse before it gets better. The challenge then becomes how to create alternatives to the existing order – alternatives that are not dependent on the whims of a market that is becoming ever more complex and resource-intensive. I would argue that we need to start by questioning where our infrastructural interlocutors come from and why.</text>

However, it is also increasingly difficult for such tourism to sustain itself, since the natural resources that are being developed are being used to build a housing market, social infrastructure and a major infrastructure for biotechnology and pharma research. So, the need to assess the sustainability of art's social-economic impact comes more from the need to know where the surplus of social wealth is generated than it does from the need to know what is being done with the surplus. 	However, the social-economic determinants of cultural resources are more deeply embedded in the socio-political systems that create and value culture (including family and community systems) than from the need to pull artists and curators away from the hard-hitting  	subject matter that results from their work. More and more we are discovering that cultural forms are socially constructed, with development in any area of the cultural package being seen as mutually reinforcing. 	When we talk about the social-economic impact of art, we are mostly talking about the social structures that enable and constrain participation.

Art is the new deodorantAlthough the discourse of the commons has contributed to create a sense of individualism and individual rights in contemporary society, it is arguably the failure to appreciate this notion of collective ownership that is undermining the very basis of contemporary capitalism. As David Harvey describes, we are living in a society that has emerged out of the presumed necessity of the common, but which is also dependent on the assumed necessity of the unique. This is evident in the way in which we are expected to consume and represent ourselves as belonging to a defined set of socially sanctioned identities, social formations and categories. Thus, the very notion that we are artists is being undermined by the very act of sharing, and in many ways we actually become less artistic as a consequence.Art is a collective enterpriseThis notion of the</text>

The changing conditions of modern society require that we constantly re-define what is and is not possible within contemporary society. And so the social, at a moment of ever-greater multiplicity and complexity, continuously struggles to re-define itself and to live up to its potential. It is a measure of the scale of this struggle, and of the forces that it employs, that constitutes the artefact of modernity. Modernity is the cumulative effects of these forces. It is the economy of sharing, of course, but also the politics of sharing, of which the social is a crucial cog. The social form is itself a complex system, and its emergence and fluidity dependently generate and reveal new possibilities of sharing, of course. But there is another, far more powerful form of sharing that is embedded in the very fabric of modern society: cultural exchange. Cultural exchange is what gives the social its identity. It is what distinguishes it from other forms of social sharing, and demands that we all participate</text>

Towards a Future City 	At the core of the biennial’s structural contradiction is its reliance on the transient, the ephemeral and on the ever-present. It is also a frequent subject of monikers such as the ‘present’ (the ‘present’ is the  	present), and the ‘future’ (the ‘future’ is the  	narrow horizon of the contemporary modern). 	But biennials can also be counted on to build long-term habitations – to survive for some future date in a way that represents the present and anticipates its distinctive form.

One could ask what sorts of internal reflections contemporary social systems allow to exist. Could one imagine a world in which the social does not exist? One could imagine a world in which the social is not constantly subject to the whims of finance capital? One could imagine a world in which art, regardless of its medium, is not celebrated in tandem with economic growth? One could imagine a world in which people no longer look to the social for support but instead act as agents of change in the world?

How do we begin to imagine a future where the social is not just a data-intensive set of habits but a cultural value embedded in and influencing the daily routine? How might the social be made more dynamic, more interpretable and more inhabitable? These are questions that address how we might inhabit and build futures based on new data, and how we might subject it to more objective means.

So the social is aware of the fact that, as new migrants and refugees enter the social, they also set in motion a chain reaction that makes it easier and more economical for the social to implement its consumption habits. This impacts on the value of the social in different ways, and so affects what counts as social consumption, what is counted as social interaction and so on. And so the social is aware of what it is buying into, and it is also aware that, as consumption expands, so does the supply of social flesh (asset classes, capital, labour, refugees, migrants, etc).

But they are also a data set – incomplete, inaccurate and often malleable. This is why in recent years the social has consistently come out on top in terms of sheer numbers – behind only the data-intensive and often inaccurate still images and sounds of the social. The social is a data-intensive way of making sense of large data sets, and so understanding mores and practices embedded in and influencing the daily routine.

It is a set of habits that are inherently relatable, and thus absorbable. But they are also sensitive to the changing conditions of contemporary society. The social is a powerful data-gathering apparatus, and so contemporary art has to be sensitive to the social and political conditions of its own growth. It has to be able to engage with, and even participate in, the political and economic conditions of the current moment. 	The challenge for contemporary art today is multiple – multifaceted and multi-pronged. The social, as we know, is powerful, but unlike most powerful political or economic formations, lacks the requisite scale to exert significant influence. The biennial administration, in their day-to-day work, remains fixated on the social, and so art has to grow beyond its social function. Art has to grow beyond its core commercial mission – to show off, be a crowd-pleaser and so forth. Art has to expand its intended domain, and so it is that contemporary art, today, is primarily engaged with showing off, and less so with developing real substantive contribution to the political and social destiny of humanity.</text>

The social is a data-intensive way of understanding itself – both in terms of how we live now, and how we might in the future. 	So how does the social imagine and produce its own narrative? In this situation, binary oppositions are exposed as ideological fallacies. And so it is that we, the participants in the social, arrive at conclusions about ourselves, the world, and the world system that are shaped by the ways in which we are embedded in the social. Such an approach to facts and figures would render decisions about how to allocate scarce resources, such as human life, on an unconscious, or at least as unconscious as possible. It would render racist and sexist ideologies as quaint memory, and white supremacy as a force for good. It would render indigenous peoples as homogenous, white and cisgendered. It would render economic development and technological innovation as the inevitable march of progress, and would do so in ways that are not based on predetermined notions of western beauty and western rationality</text>

The social is data-intensive, and so is its capacity to engage with new data streams – and thus it makes sense to engage with the data in ways that involve critical reflection on, or at least probing of, the data's limitations and assumptions. 	In this regard, the social is both a data-intensive and culture-rich resource. It captures and distributes this information constructively, using it as a resource, a set of beliefs about itself and the world around it that shape how others act, think and think about how they live. And so it produces and consumes new data continuously, constantly, constantly. This is what the social does. And so it produces and consumes culture (cultures are made anew every time the social or the culturally rich produce, consume or mis-use the data from the old), and so they both need each other. But they also need each other to be effective, to be able to negotiate the different moments and different cultural resources that are available to that</text>

So how does contemporary art interact with and resolve these tensions? Contemporary art has repeatedly stressed a need to be viewed as a potential replacement for the lost or destroyed meaning of formal forms of art – a reality that can no longer be ignored. And so it is that we, the contemporary artist-students, are expected, by virtue of continuing education and subsequent employment, to have at least rudimentary knowledge of the art world – or else. And so it is that we, the contemporary artist-students, are also expected to have an aesthetic horizon beyond the confines of our local artworld. We are also expected to be able to perceive the urban fabric and its conditions, both natural and man-made, and so we are encouraged to experiment, to seek creative solutions and to</text>

I think the work of Miodownik and others like him allowed us to see how the architecture of the city could be radically altered. But even as the biennale has become more national in scope, its cultural function has largely stayed the same. The main difference is that now we can say that we witnessed a biennale, because the architects and developers behind the biennale have a corporate function. They put on exhibitions and events around the world, and create a narrative around the biennale. The architecture of the city is usually an embellishment on that narrative, a way to connect to the real meaning of the art being made right now. But the biennale itself is often completely absent from that narrative. 	I think of the Biennale as one of the few remaining spaces where art can truly exist in a constantly varying state of being contextualised and contextualised anew through the interactions and dynamics of contemporary art-making. It is a paradoxical space, especially for artists, as the discipline is expected</text>

In the 1980s and 1990s the biennale was one of the few institutions standing up to the neoliberal agenda, and in some cases resisted it. I think the work of Miodownik and others like him is symptomatic of this persistent need for explanation. There is a danger, however, in assuming that the primary function of the art institution is to offer explanations and provide moral authority for what is happening. For Miodownik, the real mission of the biennale is cultural colonialism. We can assume, of course, that the art world would recoil in horror at the prospect of an institution like the Biennale being used as a weapon against its own citizens. But the fact of its existence raises questions about institutional responsibility and the limits of its power. Is the biennale really there to tell us how to live our lives? Question marks are slowly beginning to hang over the institutions and ideologies that shape our urban environments. 	There are different kinds of questions. What kinds of questions? I think of questions of power and domination. How can the biennale exert influence on the decisions and goals of city dwellers or do something more subversive with its limited resources</text>

I think the work of Miodownik, the Biennale, and the artists who came to the Biennale for the first time was a reminder that the project of making art again after the destruction wrought by neoliberalism could still be viable. 	On the geographic level, the challenge is to create ways to engage with the biennale as a cultural centre, and to engage with what Miodownik refers to as ‘the dead hand of industrialism’ that has somehow to be re-made in some kind of art form. 	The challenge to the biennale as a cultural entity today is different. The biennale is a political entity, and political engagement is seen as an inherently capitalist enterprise. And so we are told, repeatedly, that our engagement with the art-world around the biennale has to be about making art in some kind of connected way with the world around us. And so the engagement needs to be made accessible, and there needs to be a connection to the</text>

I think the work of Miodownik, whose body of work is informed by the same assumptions and politics, speaks to a point where criticality can be raised. 	In the 1990s and early 2000s the biennale also saw a major re-evaluation due to the financial crisis, and potential replacements found in other arenas, such as the rise of other biennales. I see the biennale as a rare instance where the contemporary art market capitalises on its institutional knowledge of the past, and potential futures. As a result of this, it is able to tackle new problems and innovate in the future. 	In the present day biennales are constantly seeking to duplicate the historical performance, and many artists and curators become fabulously rich through this. But this only happens because the biennale is able to identify promising artists and sets out to build an artist-friendly infrastructure around themselves.

So what can the biennale do? I think it’s time to rethink that question. The biennale as a space for cultural exchange and wonder should be able to support the complexity and range of possible cultural experiences. As the art world, arts funding sources, cultural tourism and tourism commissions around the world have become more institutionalised, the need for cultural tourism should also become more prominent.

I think the work of Miodownik and others like him, whose work was part of the curatorial team that produced the Venice Biennale from 1972 to 1983, is an example to be admired and a justification for the political, economic and social struggles that emerged during those decades. The development of alternative art educational practices during those decades was profoundly influenced by the politics of post-industrial education. 	But one can also identify and critique the roots of the problematic social conditions that came with the appearance of the biennale in the 1990s, and this is a much more potent tool for drawing attention to the inequalities that still exist in the world of art. The biennale as an art-historical entity contains many stylised images of industrialised countries in the developing world, but its real impact is felt in the form of the cultural capital that it secures for the city from the ravages of climate change.

I think the work of Miodownik, who was himself a pioneer of data-mining and data-distribution methods, is a good example of a work that was suppressed for a long time because it threatened the institutional interests of the biennale. But as the crises of the biennale became more evident, more artists were drawn to the idea of staging public works in a ‘public’, which was part of the equation that made the institution possible in the first place. These include Marianne Moore, whose works at the Venice Biennale from 1981 to 1997 were largely based around the idea of the public assembly; Bettina López de la Torre, who worked in a variety of other places at the Biennale from 1982 to 2005; as well as many others whose work I have omitted for obvious reasons.The fact that artists were drawn to the idea of staging public works in a particular place (locality) was part of the equation that made the biennale possible in the first place</text>

I think the work of Miodownik and others like him provides a framework for thinking about how art can be structurally different from other forms of art today. It is a framework built on mutual aid, cooperation and resisting the urge to impose one form on another. 	The challenge is to imagine a different future for our artworlds. We need to create alternatives if we are to see the reconfiguration of our cities. This could mean creating co-working spaces or co-working environments that are not art galleries or art schools but alternative artistic spaces where art can be produced and expression freely flows through the activity. It could mean engaging artists from other places in a reciprocal way, engaging with their local practices and imagining a different role for them in our artworlds. It could mean creating non-profit arts organizations that engage with practices like Baklava Art Foundation, which is developing a local arts and culture agenda in the Bagdad, but with an emphasis on the traditional arts and heritage.

And I think of the work of many artists, curators and arts administrators who put their time, energy and capital into building publics for the biennale, but did not see any reason to continue in that capacity in the future. 	But as a spatial system, the biennale has proven quite adaptable. Its spatial characteristics are becoming increasingly important as new media and cultural forms are brought into the picture, and as an element of the growing global spectacle is brought into being. As a dynamic element, the biennale has the potential to become a very significant element in the analysis and discourse of globalisation and its discontents. 	In this analysis, I would like to suggest that the biennale as a cultural form may one day return, and that this will be a</text>

His work in communities began in the 1980s when he was commissioned by the Liverpool Biennial to produce a series of paintings that would sit outside the museum, in zones reserved for artist groups. The paintings were meant to celebrate the biennial’s history and present, but also for the audiences of the biennial who might visit the galleries of the city and the Biennial wasn’t just any galleries, but was in fact a ‘gorgeous new form of cultural organisation with a social purpose and ‘a visual language’. The paintings would be ‘gorgeous for a gallery of today, but not so beautiful for a community of artists’ ongoing ongoing work as a biennial. The purpose of his paintings was ‘to be seen by as many people as possible’. 	[2] See Guillaume Rodin, ‘On Viewer Forms in Photography</text>
