It allowed us to question how the symposium should be organised, and to question what the point was, if there was no real point. What we did have a right to do was question-beyond-the-arcologies of the museum and gallery, into the vast social worlds of the city and beyond. This was a more organic and naturalised way of organising the symposium, as a kind of curatorial intervention into a cultural process. It is a kind of microcosm of the cultural revolution that we’re inching ever closer to a key moment where the urban and suburban will be rendered cadaverous and rendered comatose. I think that there are other ways of organising the symposium, and curating it in other ways.What we as artists collectively failed to notice, or perhaps did not want you to notice, was the outbreak of post-Sydney fever, which is now sweeping across the nation. It began with the Whole Foods shooting in December 2014, and has since then been characterised by news bulletins, social media frenzy and a host of other unfortunate effects. The shooting itself is a blot on the city’s reputation, and the city is suffering as</text>

What we did have a right to do was question-beyond-the-arcologies of place, time and culture. These questions were more easily asked of the curators, who as curators were able to intervene more fully in the event, and which artists were able to explore the symposium more fully. But as the event unfolded, it became increasingly evident that the curators had little or no say in the way the event was organised. Subsequently, various curatorial approaches were explored, ranging from attempting to bring symposia closer to their cities (Sloan Science &amp; Technology, for example, tried to position its 2007 Symposium as a ‘Chinese-influenced version’ of the 1958 Venice Biennale) to trying to leave the content of the symposium as a question for future research. But these last few attempts at separating the symposium from the content of the exhibition was neither here nor there. It would be impossible to construct a complete symposium from the questions and concerns of the curatorial, educational, and research approaches. It would be a</text>

It allowed us to question how the symposium should be organised, and to question what the point was, if there was no real point. What we did have a right to do was question-beyond-the-arcologies of the museum, society and state – beyond the museum building, and, indeed, beyond the museum itself. This is a subject that has been on the minds of curators and art historians for a very long time. It is a legacy that artists and curators often struggle to address. How to shape that? This was a difficult conundrum to confront in a major art museum, owing to the massive curatorial presence, the constant stream of visitors, the media circus and all the other variables. But it did occur to many curators and art-historians that the symposium form The One True Way had entered into a decisive end game. It was no longer a permanent feature of the institution but was becoming increasingly difficult to sustain, which was putting a lot of resources towards promoting the institution as a global icon of modern art rather than what was being put towards supporting and preserving the art world as a cultural power. The media circus was a problem here too.

What we did have a right to do was question-beyond-the-arcologies of the curatorial language, the institutional memory, and the marketplace. What we did not have a right to do was prevent other artists from putting their cultural legacies on the continuum of influence. The symposium format was a reductive one, and it is no exaggeration to say that The One True Way has become a museum in its own right. There was a time when the goal of the arts organization was to produce culturally engaged citizens, and the symposium format restricted the means by which that could be achieved. But the ubiquity of the symposium as an institution makes it easier to capture cultural moments when they occur.  The symposium has become a regularity, and its curatorial weight is growing. But it is a symposium, and it will continue to be one until its eventual cancellation in a near future. The exhibition format Changes the dynamic of cultural production.

It allowed us to question how the symposium should be organised, and to question what the point was, if there was no real point. What we did have a right to do was question-beyond-the-arcologies of the museum, beyond the curatorial. But this was always a political, even antagonistic, project. The museum became the locus of the hepatic and the meta-theoretical conversation, where the different facets of the symposium were placed. This was a mode of historical documenta 14 that was marked by a politicisation of art and its production, and which became the urban event of the century.The other aspect of the symposium that has come under increasing critique is the museum-to-be. The museum is a physical building that you take to be a building, and exhibits are artefacts that you take to be collections. But the way we imagine the museum as a building, and its contents as a collection, comes with a condition: it has to be visited. And so the symposium emerged as a mode of ‘visitation’ that was not marked by the usual curatorial interrogation of curatorial curatorial curries, but rather by the collecting of cur</text>

We as artists were able to declare our place in time and space, and create a microcosm of our own culture and time. What we didn’t have the right to do was take the place of other artists in cultural perpetuity, and to the extent that we didn’t want to be. The symposium became a kind of a coronation, and the curatorial call for it was a kind of a coronation, too.It became a kind of a test case for whether the festival as we understood it at the time was a good idea, and whether or not the symposium was a true symposium, in which the curatorial call was a kind of a test case. In other words, the idea of the symposium as a curatorial intervention was being questioned. We as artists were being asked to make a new kind of intervention, a kind of new symposium.

It’s curating because there is no objective point of view. There is only the point of Viewer 1. Viewer 2 may have an opinion, but that doesn’t make them any better or any less valid. And finally, there is the challenge that everyone has to give their all, every bit as much as the artist who created the piece, to make the symposium work. I’m talking not just of the artist, but of the audience. The audience is the star of the show. And the audience is the star of the show again and again and again: in a symposium, they sit through whole operas, whole poetry readings, whole song and dance performances, but at no point is there an end to it.

This is what the Athenians had against the Persians, and the way in which the Athenian democracy was constructed. The Athenian democracy was not built on the foundations of solid historic Athenian democracy. If there was no Athenian democracy, or Athenian roots, then there was no Athenian future, and so the question was: what can we make today that will be relevant tomorrow? This is what the Athenians had in mind when they designed their democracy, and so the Athenian Democracy was scripted to happen in the city, and so the Athenian Symposium became the Athenian Triennale. The Athenians were not trying to create a symposium of ideas, but to capture the essence of a particular day in the city, and the Athenian Symposium became the Athenian Triennale precisely because it captured the essence of a particular day.

What we did have a right to do was question-beyond-the-arcologies of cultural difference, and that is precisely what the symposium was failing to achieve. If you dismantled the symposium, and you left its contents to the people who would make use of them, such as a discovery festival, a concert hall, a performance venue, a school of painting or a gallery, the people who would use them would be artists themselves, but they would be artists whose contribution to the art world would come through their use of such facilities, not through what they had to say about the art they saw.In The One True Way, Sophie Hope uses a traditional Greek Symposium to ask, ‘What is it to be an Artist?’, and in doing so, offers a definition that one might want to use in a curatorial intervention. She builds on her discovery of a Greek art critic, Thalamus, who had written that a Greek symposium should exhibit the highest possible standards of artistic craftsmanship and on-</text>

The public realm has been made available to accommodate only a select few, while the rich and the powerful increasingly occupy it in different manners. The public realm is no longer the preserve of strong, vibrant, autonomous publics, but must be shared and integrated in order to function effectively. 	Such sharing and integration is facilitated through data, but gathering and using this kind of urban data sets require access to a large number of people, data that is currently scarce and expensive to acquire. Also, the people behind the scenes need to have access to the people in the city, because if the people in the city don’t have access to the data, it is futile and corrupting to collect it. 	In the current environment of ever-more massive data capture and publishing platforms, it is unclear who is entitled to the urban domain and what kinds of rights are available to residents. There are even questions about who is entitled to the urban domain in cases of conflict. 	In an ideal world, the people behind the scenes would collaborate openly and honestly with one another to address all aspects of the city, allowing residents and visitors to explore the city</text>

The public realm has been made available to accommodate only a select few, while the rich and the powerful increasingly occupy it in different manners. The public realm is becoming ever less accessible, while the poor and the vulnerable alike are exposed to greater risks and subjected to greater indignities. The public realm is becoming ever less participatory and democratic, while the rich and the powerful reap the benefits. In short, the public realm cannot be everything for everyone, and cities play a critical role in resisting both the systems that emerged from the city and the conditions that enable mass participation but do not always enact that participation in ways that are equitable, just and secure for all. 	In recent years, as the crisis of urban precarity has deepened in Canada and the United States, attention has focused on the need to renovate crumbling and depleting infrastructure in Canada and the United States, as well as in Europe. While the systems that generate travel, recreation, and other forms of urban infrastructure in Canada and the United States are in many ways similar, there are striking differences that render the current economic model of the city untenable in most of North America. 	</text>

The public realm has been made available to accommodate only a select few, while the rich and the powerful increasingly occupy it in different manners. The public realm is increasingly populated by automated means, and the public sphere of the future urban exploration may well be automated as well. The biennial is among artworks that are part of this transition – part of a cultural infrastructure that is part of the social totality, part of a media infrastructure that is part of a new urbanization platform that is part of a public sphere that is also part of a museum system, part of a publishing infrastructure that is part of a publishing platform that is part of a social totality that is part of a legal and media infrastructure, and part of a cultural infrastructure that is part of a new urbanization platform that is part of a public sphere that is also part of a museum system, part of a publishing platform that is part of a social totality that is part of a publishing platform, and part of a network infrastructure that is part of a museum system.

The public realm has been made available to accommodate only a select few, while the rich and the powerful increasingly occupy it in different manners. The public realm is the realm of the blind, the vulnerable, the dispossessed and the voiceless. 	Many cities are becoming too familiar, and too corporatized. The metropolis has become the microcosm of the city, a city within a city. Yet this is not inevitable, nor is it a panacea. Cities do have natural resources and infrastructure that can be shared, and are often far more productive when shared. A 	transforming infrastructure is one that seeks to meet the needs of all New Yorkers, regardless of where they live, what they are like, or how badly they are affected by the city’s disinvestment and crisis. 	Such sharing and sharing aims can be traced to the New York City Planning Process &quot;Urban Impact Statements,&quot; developed in coordination with the New York Regional Planning Agency and NYC Chambers of Commerce.5 These plans, which identified specific projects that could be combined to form an overall urban development, addressed a city’s core problems</text>

The public realm has been made available to accommodate only a select few, while the rich and the powerful increasingly occupy it in different manners. The public realm is the common ground on which a multitude of voices can coalesce to demand what they consider ‘human rights’. 	Such rights are claimed not only by citizens, but also by non-citizens, such as animals, people from other places, etc. In addition, citizens have a growing number of allies in the bureaucracy, including employees and patrons, who tend to see themselves as defenders of the public realm rather than actors representing particular national interests. 	In an ideal world, everyone would act in concert to defend the public realm, but unfortunately human nature tends to override this tendency. Thus the need for uniform regulations emerges, which in turn generates a backlash against any who attempt to implement random or capricious regulations. 	Such backlash is often depicted as a progressive narrative, but in reality is often a calcified version of the over-emotional reaction to resource scarcity and runaway industrialisation that characterises the global north.

The public realm is becoming ever less accessible, and this may spell disaster for communities looking to access employment, education, markets, cultural activities, and other public goods. 	When the biennale was first planning, a collective vision for the city was also considered, but in the end it was decided that the city had to be taken on board. This came as a surprise to a community of artists, as well as to those involved in the project, since the city was seen as a static entity with few agency or say in the future of the city. The city was seen as a site of potential conflict and conflict was the first underlying assumption for many artists’ projects. 	The vision for the city that emerged during the negotiation process with the Biennale was much more positive. The Biennale board members saw a bright future for the city in the new biennale, and the arts community was seen as a valuable partner in creating a ‘better’ world through art’.</text>

The public realm is the realm of the mediator between the two worlds, helping to ensure that the infrastructures that form the basis for a future future urban transformation do not become transitory creations of globalized financial flows and mega bureaucracies. 	Such is the 	present situation in the world as a result of the financial obsessions of a few; it is up to us, archaeology tells us, ‘to emerge, become visible, and contribute to a future that is not dominated by the present’.3 	But what does this future look like and how might it be possible to foresee it? In his essay ‘Present Tense’,4 Roger S. Ames suggests that there are three essential dimensions to understanding the contemporary condition: politics, geography and culture.5 ‘Politics’ means the ability to think through problems or the ability to create consensus, and ‘geography’ means the ability to understand the underlying principles that govern the transaction of space</text>

The public realm has been made available to accommodate only a select few, while the rich and the powerful increasingly occupy it in different manners. The public realm is no longer the scene of encounters between people with a shared set of needs and desires, but rather of monolithic data capture and integration systems that constantly seek to connect citizens with goods and services provided by large corporations or other stakeholders (Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc). The precondition for a participatory city is therefore not only to observe and participate in the public realm, but to actively participate in the socio-political realm as well. 	If only a few citizens of a given city regularly encounter each other, engage in socially engaged activities such as  	discovering places to live, shopping for houses, participating in community gardens or taking part in community projects, then the precondition for a participatory city is low and to a large extent unrealisable. Nevertheless, a precondition for any kind of change is a precondition for a new kind of domination.

Such a precondition is an urgent need, as a changing urban landscape is transforming into one dominated by the interests of large corporations, civil engineers, and agribusiness interests. The public realm has been made available to accommodate only a select few, while the rich and the powerful increasingly occupy it in different manners. The public realm is being systematically appropriated and replaced, while the working class is sidelined and fragmented. In these times of crisis, when such concerns as ecological catastrophe, racial/religious conflict, economic dislocation, and social unrest radiate from every corner of the planet, it is imperative that the global proletariat wrest control of infrastructure, construction, and development projects away from the capitalist and his favoured actors, and for the vast majority of humanity to establish a socialist future urbanism. 	In the present global urbanisation process, which is characterised by the global spread of market forces, and which is increasingly being facilitated by the advent of nano- and micro-technology, it is imperative that the interests of large corporations, civil engineers, urban planners, and farmers be brought into dialogue and that ‘ordinary people’ take back control of infrastructure, construction, and development projects. The project of urban revitalisation must come to terms with the changing character of urbanity, and must therefore address, at the same time, the</text>

For example, machines that monitor traffic or detect energy use could alert traffic control or other infrastructure operators when there is excess capacity or demand, or when critical infrastructure systems are over-used or need to be upgraded. 	Such monitoring and upgrades would not only improve efficiency and reduce maintenance costs, but could also save lives.

Such a precondition is an urgent need, as a changing urban landscape is transforming into one dominated by the interests of large corporations, civil engineers, and agribusiness interests. The public realm has been made available to accommodate only a select few, while the rich and the powerful increasingly occupy it in different manners. The public realm is the realm of those with a common humanity; it is the realm of the underdog, and it is the realm of those with a clear sense of destiny. 	But the precondition for a participatory city is a city with strong, capable localities, strong enough to host critical dialogue, critical visions and the forging of strong local identities. 	Such is the  	logic of the  	transforming city. In the age of the internet and smart meters, the need for accurate and persistent measurement of energy usage is doubly critical. In the age of massive data capture and mining, the need for accurate and persistent measurement of energy consumption is equally critical. In a  	future city, energy would be consumed minimally and consumed optimally, in continuous with the rhythm of economic development and technological innovation.  	Such is the  	logic of the  	transforming city.

The project was commissioned by Liverpool John Moores Special Collections Unit and the Arts Council, and was produced at the Arts Council Awards 2014 and 2015, as well as the Bournemouth/Liverpool Biennial 2016.We began by looking at the city as a virtual public realm. We then looked at the ways in which a small community could reclaim its public space and make it a place where people could come, exchange, exchange, and have a place. The process we used was through a series of pilot projects, which over time we built into a full-scale, year-round event. We invited local people to be part</text>

We also explore how the sharing of information can lead to collective action.In 2015, we launched The Public Realm Digital Diptych project, an online publication series that documents the development of the London Assembly’s first ever Digital Diptych. The series, which began as a blog and evolved into a full-fledged publication, catalogues the developments in the first full-scale digital publication of the Assembly’s work. In addition to documenting the assembly’s digital output, the publication series seeks to establish an archive of knowledge about the Assembly’s early years, chronicling the assembly’s early days on the web, in print and in virtual reality. In both the digital and print formats, the articles form part of an ongoing, archival conversation.

In partnership with The Public Realm, we have published more than 250 articles online on various topics related to the book. In the book, we explore how reclaiming online public space can address long-term capital flight, the warring classes and professions, the precarity of labour, and the precarity of health and education futures. We also examine the role that the public realm can play in the creation of alternative futures, such as through the development of participatory ways of organising public space, such as through the creation of affordable housing, schools and parks, green spaces and cultural institutions. We examine a variety of alternative publics, such as neighbourhood associations, grassroots groups, faith based organisations, civic groups, universities and grassroots activism. We also examine the technology enabling these organisations to be effective and innovative grassroots campaigns are rapidly becoming obsolete. In a forthcoming book to be published in 2018, we examine the role of museums and historic districts in the future of London, taking into account the significant investments that are being made in the built environment.We also develop a set of questions that can be used as a starting point for research into the nature of digital publics and how they might be</text>

In 2015, we launched the Digital Diptych project, which brings together elements from many of the earlier books in the series, including the Fourth Estate, with new data and analysis tools. In partnership with The New York Public Library, we created a digital archive of the fourth estate, and invited scholars, artists, writers and others to digitise and assemble the material from the archive. The Digital Diptych project was followed in June 2016 with the publication of the fourth edition of the journal Digital Dimension. In 2018, the New York Public Library acquired a significant collection of books from the Leverhulme Trust and The New York Public, which it uses to create an online archive of the journals, texts, photographs and other materials from the Leverhulme collection. The Leverhulme collection comprises over 2,000 books and over 3,000 items.</text>

For instance, the rise of AI could make it easier for terrorist organizations to recruit and deploy young people to fight alongside terrorists in countries around the world, or allow for the re-purposing of infrastructure in ways that could be used by terrorist organizations. The possibilities are limitless, and their effects on society are also entirely unpredictable. That said, the advent of AI raises new questions that require new answers. This is especially true given the increasing automation of critical infrastructure and the transnational corporations that control it. What does it mean for critical infrastructure to be automated? What kinds of systemic changes need to be made in order to make it so that critical infrastructures can function in ways that are more intuitive, economical and allow for greater user choice? What kinds of infrastructures should be made redundant? What kinds of autonomous systems should be created? What kinds of partnership agreements should be reached with stakeholders in order to foster greater user choice?In an age of massive data capture and consumption</text>

Consequently, systems engineering includes more than just the construction of cyberweapons and cyberdefense architectures; it also considers the broader implications of new AI and robotics technologies. This latter, more expansive meaning of AI is likely to include broader social impacts as well. A recent article in the MIT Technology Review makes some interesting points about the different kinds of AI and the ways in which they might interact with one another. For one thing, there’s the kind that exploits labor, specifically the kind that exploits workers. Machines that catch fraud do just that: they hire workers who perform tasks that humans can do better, but at a lower standard of living. In effect, the articles suggest, machines should be able to discover new kinds of labor, ones that are more like humans and thus employ less labor. Machine learning, or machine learning as it’s sometimes called, is a type of AI that’s becoming more and more capable of learning. It includes computational techniques that teach machines to detect patterns, and tasks that teach them to execute certain actions. Such systems don’t just perform tasks; they also harness meaning, actions and agency within them. It’s this latter kind of meaning that I want to work with</text>

Moreover, the social impacts will be felt not only within the AI community but will also be felt by communities of people all around the world who will now have a means to influence the development of their society.In the wake of these devastating hacks, it’s easy to fall prey to the comforting belief that malicious actors are often identified and blamed on the AI threat. However, the reality is that systems designations like ‘smart phones’ and ‘computer networks’ play a much larger role in our lives today than they once did. The ubiquity of these technologies in our connected cars, homes, workplaces and beyond is likely to produce much more profound social changes than the individualized interventions often touted. Given the stakes, it’s imperative that we collectively come to terms with the fact that malicious AI will be much more prevalent and pervasive in our societies than has been previously imagined.This will require us to come to terms with</text>

Such systems, which operate on massive amounts of data and constantly benchmark themselves against historical data, are likely to see a great deal more social impact in the future as a result of human language than in the past. The AI apps that I develop automatically flag critical healthcare and education systems as malicious and deploy defenses against the threats that they could present, while the systems themselves that generate and interpret that language also see a future in which they can shape meaning and perform certain kinds of actions. In fact, the systems that create meaning for me and other researchers involved in the field might well double down on their original purpose in the future by encouraging others to do the same.This kind of flexibility and ability to see the world through differentiating agents—AI and robotics researchers—</text>

Consequently, systems engineering includes more than just the construction of cyberweapons and cyberdefense architectures; it also considers the broader implications of new AI and robotics technologies. This latter, more expansive meaning of AI is likely to include broader social impacts as well, for example, since it’s predicted that up to 90% of the global population now lives within close range of a source of AI. At the same time, AI is likely to make it easier to commit terrorist attacks, since a malicious AI could well be able to map out a terrorist attack and its location, and collect intelligence on its victims’ movements in real-time. In the wake of these developments, it’s worth revisiting some of the more abstract questions about how AI will affect us and the world around us.What does it mean for an AI to be able to understand human language? What does it mean for an AI to be able to understand culture? What does it mean for an AI to be able to understand history? What does it mean for an AI to be able to understand the social consequences of its actions? What do we mean by the broad implications of these notions?Consider the following scenario: In the 1950s, a team of</text>

Consequently, systems engineering includes more than just the construction of cyberweapons and cyberdefense architectures; it also considers the broader implications of new AI and robotics technologies. This latter, more expansive meaning of AI is likely to include broader social impacts as well. Consider, for example, the increased surveillance and control systems that AI systems must implement in the wake of massive data breaches. This is already happening in cyberspace; as AI improves, so does the number of breaches. It’s critical that systems engineers and data scientists design systems to the maximum extent possible in the face of this ever-growing and expanding data breach count.

As an AI researcher, I strive to design systems that understand more than they speak and can infer meaning from patterns. In the wake of massive data breaches and other cyberattacks, it’s imperative that systems be able to infer meaning from data, and can-do anything from detecting drug use to stopping terrorist attacks to being self-defense against cyberattacks. Consequently, systems engineering includes more than just the construction of cyberweapons and cyberdefense architectures; it also considers the broader implications of new AI and robotics technologies. This latter, more expansive meaning of AI is likely to include broader social impacts as well. 	The social implications of AI are still unclear, but a growing body of research suggests that it can revolutionize a host of traditionally human-critical roles. For instance, research suggesting that replacing human speech interpreters with computer programs that understand what’s said has led to the creation of new kinds of AI systems that can augment human speech processing and produce meaning from data. In these cases, the meaning of sounds becomes more objective, and AI systems that understand meaning can produce meaning from data. 	Similarly, research suggesting that replacing human editors with AI systems that produce text based on patterns has led to the creation of new kinds of AI systems that can augment human text processing and produce meaning from data. In these cases, the design of editorial systems becomes more objective, and AI systems that understand patterns can produce meaning from data. 	In recent years, AI has become critical in the creation of new ways of understanding the world. This is due in part to advances in computer</text>

Self-healing Cities are Made in 'Rethinking' China's Cities for Mobile Money 	China is rapidly becoming a global center for AI and machine learning research and development. Mobile fortune-telling apps are some of the most widely used in China, with estimates placing the market for such apps at over US$100 billion. Mobile fortune-telling is a growing field of study in its own right, and recent publications have focused on discussing the ins and outs of mobile fortune-telling with AI. One of the most promising directions for AI in China is provided by the work of Shanghai-based startup Re’Machine, which provides service-specific, cloud-based AI frameworks for service-specific AI tasks.

This latter, more expansive meaning of AI is likely to include broader social impacts as well.The rise of AI threatens not only humanity’s ability to perform complex calculations, but also its humanity itself. Consider, for instance, the growing arsenal of autonomous weapons systems that can be programmed to do incredible things, such as hacking into enemy military networks and weapon systems, or harvesting intelligence on enemy soldiers to identify and track them down, or even remotely locating enemy submarines by monitoring their acoustic signature. As the AI community improves, these systems become more sophisticated and can do much more, at least in theory.In my role, I attempt to envision what that might mean for a given situation. For instance, the threat from AI weapons may mean that we humans no longer need superintelligent AI systems like those developed in the 1950s and 1960s, when scientists began to develop theories of what artificial intelligence might mean for the future of humanity. In the wake of these studies, humanity’s ability to think rationally about such things becomes even more precarious. It is estimated that</text>

Consider the implications for public safety and the environment. Machine learning assumes that the underlying neural networks that define a given behaviour already have befitted human characteristics. In the wake of such massive, human-influenced changes in the infrastructure of transportation, the capacity to reason on its own is crucial. Consider the implications for privacy and civil liberties.Machine learning is the art of programming systems to identify patterns and infer meaning from data. It is the future. — NTWhen applying this kind of AI to public transit infrastructure, researchers could potentially end up being able to ‘hack’ the systems so that they would detect anomalies, or even change behaviour in response to them.</text>

But how to figure out where the boundaries are? There are two main problems with the idea of the city as a collection of computers: first, how to access the ‘temporal dimension’ (space and time) in which computer parts are stored; and second, how to access the ‘infrastructure’ (infrastructure, infrastructures, telecommunications, mapping and so forth) that supports the computer parts and facilitates data capture and transmission within the city. 13  A conceptual map of the ‘temporal dimension’ (space and time) in which a computer operates. In principle, every computer interface should be able to manifest this temporal aspect of the city’s virtual‐space. Yet few cities have this technological capability, which is why they tend to be slow, resource‐intensive and precarious. 14  One solution to the first problem might be to connect every computer in the city to a massive data</text>

But given enough computing power, a city could also adopt a kind of economic self-sufficiency. Theoretically, a city could produce its own content and appeas itself to the elements by harnessing the inherent resourcefulness of its inhabitants. Creative activity could be funded by a kind of fund – a kind of licence to do business – which enables citizens to step outside of the city and into the open world. Creative activity could occur anywhere in the world, and citizens could choose to reside where they please within the city, choosing from a growing list of destinations. Creative activity could come from anywhere in the world, and the city could step in to fill the gaps in anything from art to architecture. Creative activity could target individuals or small groups, and the choices made by individuals and small groups could be adapted for use within the city.

However, given the scale of the computer networked cities of the future, and given the inefficiency of the data-mining algorithms used, such an approach would mean leaving behind vast amounts of data that could be used only in tandem with the city’s infrastructure. Such an approach would rob users of their rights, and it is not clear that such a scenario is desirable. The city is a foundational building block of the computer, and the computer is the foundation of all computer networks. If not maintained properly, the computer could succumb to cyber attacks or other kinds of disruptive forces. Therefore, the city is a more or less secure location for users. However, as noted by Fridericianum in their reflections on their ADI: ‘The city is a platform, and the computer is a platform, for many other kinds of platforms and platforms. It is a platform that provides many possibilities for disruption and destruction’. 13  </text>

But given enough computing power, a computer could also be used to do interesting things inside the city, as long as the city didn’t overstep its bounds. For instance, the computer might not exist in a computer at all but instead harness vast amounts of energy to map the infrastructure of the city in such a way as to allow transportation, communication, and data infrastructures to be built without building permits or public funds. Such projects have been made without the need for a city council or any other institutional power. Instead, creative city dwellers have harnessed the power of the city to build themselves. Such urban structures were once objects of science fiction, but have become more and more real in the last twenty years. A kind of urban mythos is slowly emerging. Creative people are realizing that the logic of the city is flawed, and that the only way to address it is for a broad range of people to be involved in constructing, policing</text>

But given the scale of the computer networks involved, and the fact that the city is so densely populated, this kind of expansion of access would be incredibly difficult and would lead to a kind of balkanisation of the city. Instead, the application is delivered as user-friendly websites that point all city computers towards specific neighbourhoods or neighbourhoods with specific neighbourhoods or neighbourhoods. This kind of interface creates a kind of brand identity for the area, and draws users there. It is a kind of arbiter of access, and like the laws that prescribe what can and cannot be done in the city, the rules that can and cannot be done in the city dictate what kind of infrastructure can and cannot be built.  	So while the city is expanding its computer systems, it is also contracting with these new inhabitants of the city to make new neighbourhoods or wards or districts or even sub-districts of wards or sub-districts of wards.

Any sufficiently advanced computer could do this, and the possibilities are endless. But in practice, this kind of mapping is fraught with problems and lacks resolution. The city is a complicated system that users create and operate, and although cities now constitute some of the most dynamic and innovative parts of the global economy, they still suffer from this kind of urban sprawl. New kinds of sprawl are needed, but they need to be dignified and controlled. New kinds of neighbourhoods need to be created and maintained, and this kind of urban interface needs to be robust to changes in population density and other forces. New kinds of codes need to be created to govern how neighbourhoods are created and managed. New kinds of apps need to be developed to monitor and edit neighbourhood neighbourhoods.

However, given the scale of the project and the nature of its deployment, the city likely wouldn’t want its computer systems used for surveillance or illegal activities, nor would it want its citizens to rely on the system for critical functions. Instead, the city would likely want to let users and corporations design and build systems that it can secure, control, and monitor. This sounds like utopian thinking, but in the globalized and interconnected information society of the 21st century, dystopian thinking is the new normal. The fact that the MIT team was able to deploy their system in such a way, while also being able to figure out how to repurpose it after it was put into place, raised the question: how does the city create the necessary security and resilience to handle such unprecedented data surges? To answer this question, it is useful to recall MIT’s early work on network protocols and the</text>

However, given the scale of the computer networks that inhabit our cities and the proliferation of applications that use the ·––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––� system, an increasing number of users are being recruited into the infrastructure of cities. Moreover, given the human capacity for error and for multitasking, ‘liveness’ is a limiting principle. As a result, urban environments are becoming increasingly fragile. Urban sprawl generates huge amounts of greenhouse gasses that contribute significantly to global warming, and the constant shifting of users and destinations contributes to catastrophes of over-population, desalination and desertification. Moreover, the rapid growth of infrastructure in the metropolis necessitates a large and highly visible police force that is easily replaced.

In practice, however, this kind of expansive generalisation is extremely difficult to pull off, even for super-computer experts. The reason is that the limits imposed by the computer become embedded in the programming that is done in the city. If the boundaries are too perfect, there is no way to see how the city interacts with the outer space it is embedded in. And once you leave the confines of the computer, you return to the city – back to the empty lot where the super-computers are located. But once you leave that lot, you have to leave the city and the city is only ever partially accessible by means of a high-speed rail line that runs alongside the city's elevated Mulberry Street. While entering the city from Mulberry Street, you exit from the elevated Mulberry Street Railway. Both the elevated and the underground lines run alongside each other, creating a junction that only a taxi could ever hope to navigate. 	With</text>

But given the runaway growth of China’s internet infrastructure, which is catching up with its human infrastructure, this kind of urban expansion is also unsustainable. The city would grow larger and more bureaucratic, burdened with ever greater numbers of computer servers and data centers. The result would be massive data centers, with residents forced to move to ever larger apartments in the dense outer reaches of the metropolis. Such concentration of economic and political power would make the city into something like a vertically integrated business district, with a few bright spots at the very tip of the economic node. 	But this is not necessarily what happens in the metropolis anymore. The internet makes it easier than ever to achieve ‘surface-area maximization’, i.e. to access the areas with the greatest concentration of internet users. If the city has a smartphone app, then the internet reaches every user and thereby becomes a scarce resource. 	But this</text>

In 2015, the Venice Biennale was the only biennale to have been curated by an artist, and only in Japan by an organization.Art International (2001–2015) is the global art institution founded in 1971 by the merger of the Independent and Independent Member Associations. It is the largest independent arts organization in the world, with more than 200 member arts councils in over 100 countries. It is the international standard-bearer for artistic sustainability, and plays a pivotal role in the integration of sustainability and art practices in contemporary cultural constitutions around the world.

It is hoped that the artist-curatorial duo’s commissioning and promotion of ‘mass cultural impact’ through their publications, exhibition catalogue, performances, web presence, and other exhibition-based activities will enable them to create a future ‘relevant art institution’ that is aware of the art’s place and history in the world through their commissioning, promotion and diffusion of art within contemporary art and contemporary communities.2 The art must be able to negotiate the different forms of engagement with art that are possible within a contemporary art context.

In other words, they all share the same cultural background, but different levels of competence and expertise.The artist-curatorial team consists of tenant and community organisers, six artists appointed as permanent representatives of the Tenants Alliance, three artists appointed as Curators at the Royal, and one artist appointed as an independent curator. The tenants are responsible for recruiting artists, holding clinics and events, and organising group work and study sessions.

This process is often described as ‘institutionalising the biennial’, but I would rather see artists and curators making art in relation to each other, and the broader context in which they live, making art in relation to the art of cities and the world as a whole. The biennial as a ‘conversation’ deserves a description that is as evocative as its content. The language of encounters, the encounter, the encounter of ideas, the encounter of artists, and the encounter of art is what renders the art form meaningful and contemporary.

He is not alone. Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran both recently went for the jugular – going solo, travelling the globe and coming out with music that is both aesthetically pleasing and, well, socially conscious. There is a palpable sense of excitement, even awe-struck excitement, about the new mediators who can bridge the gap between artist and viewer.There are of course also those who would seek to constrain the new media to conform to established art practices, those who would seek to prevent the emergence of new media (including, perhaps, their own children becoming media users) from reaching a certain size, scope and mix of users, and so on. I think that the ways in which we imagine the role of the artist in our new media environments is going to be very different from the roles that artists had in the past. There are of course going to be artists who are curators, producers, writers, etc who are going to have to create environments in which the artist can do her or his</text>

But few have the reach or the connections to bring an entirely new context and perspective to an already existing artform. That is, until now.

The new hip-hop artist is probably just getting started, but already he represents a new equilibrium, one that is both socially conscious (pretending to not be aware of the ways you actually are) and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. He is not alone. The trend is unmistakable.Art, on the other hand, is not so easily neutralised. It has a tendency to grab at any object or concept that comes with a message (whether that message is art, history, language, or climate) and, as such, to repeat it ad infinitum (no matter how often you debunk it). And so we have to be aware that the art we produce and the art that comes out of the conference may in fact create some expectations that are not necessarily aligned with the expectations of those we purvey. The world we create is always going to be complicated, and we need to be aware that. For example, why do we as artists have to simultaneously be making art for ourselves and being artists for the people we purvey? Why do we as artists have to simultaneously be delivering that art to audiences across the globe and completely missing them? Why do we as artists have to simultaneously be educating audiences about our own condition and simultaneously feeding them lies about</text>

A number of artists, from Kanye West to Post Malone, have taken the project further, and as we all know, it takes a village to raise a child, so there is that.Art is a powerful language, and now we live it. In that language, there are many different ways of expressing the same thing, and very different expectations and capacities. But it is also true that in the language of art, there is also a trap. There is a trap for people like me, who cannot communicate with the people around them, and who therefore end up trapped in this world, and that is why there are so many tragedies like the one in Venice.

Her mixtape ‘Bon Appetit’ is a fad, but its relevance is undeniable. Katy Perry and Migos, however, are just the tip of the iceberg. There are many more artists like them emerging, and soon enough we will be inundated with them.The art world seems to be watching intently, and perhaps this is part of the reason why we will start to see references to social problems such as poverty, hunger and politics in the art world. We have seen this movie before. We all saw it once: in the press, in the golf course, in the boardroom. It did not matter. The point was that we saw it enough times that we believed it existed.

But while some of those artists have a huge following, the majority of us don’t. That is, we don’t have the brand identity or identity stones (or celebrity fans) that Mars &amp; Migos have, or have large followings in our chosen field. We have to work harder, smarter and creatively to build those identities for ourselves. So, how do we begin to imagine a future with those who do have those identity stones?

Katy Perry’s Witness is a 2015 USO song, produced by Katy Perry and Fredgo for the 2016 Grammy Awards, and written by Max Martin. It​—like much of Katy Perry’s work—is built around a duet of acoustic instruments. The lyrics, which are based on a lyric from the Gettysburg Address, are: I saw it on the TV, I heard it on the radio, but I never saw it through the fire'Cause I was busy hiding'/I was too busy trying to forget).  	The song became an Internet sensation in 2015, when it was revealed that Donald Trump had been elected President of the United States.

It is difficult to define what an artist is in the first place, or to define what an audience is, but there is a consensus that this particular audience is different from previous ones. They are urban, mobile and increasingly urban, so it is easier to identify with a crowd than to the people actually in the crowd. In a sense, the people who compose the crowd are the audience, and audiences are the audience.Bruno Mars and Migos, Trap ��士Trap, 2017.

By gathering and analysing this data, the machines and materials used in them could be programmed to heal themselves, rather than relying on the presence of organic material or human intervention.For example, the formation of hydrogen peroxide occurs when organic compounds – such as hydrogen peroxide – are exposed to direct heat or pressure, generating a reaction that generates hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane. When applied topically, the catalyst can perforate a hole in the surface of the material and expose the underlying molecular structure to light. The process generates electrical current that can then be applied to the surface of the material to generate a catalyst that chemically reacts with the hydrogen peroxide on the surface of the material to produce hydrocarbons, such as ethane and butyric acid. These processes operate over vast areas, and monitor the health of the environment around the material, providing valuable information for the development of environmentally friendly materials and fuels.</text>

In fact, research into the active principles underlying how materials behave in the world around us has often been slow and methodical, often centred on developing testable hypotheses and theoretical frameworks.AQUATRAID, the first open access journal published online, is a journal of emerging science and technology accelerator, publishing groundbreaking work every month on topics of emerging science and technology. It was co-founded and edited by Dr Katherine Shear, professor in the</text>

These monitoring tools can identify potentially hazardous materials using a suite of tests that mimic the physical characteristics of the material – for example, the number, shape, size, acidity and boiling points of a chemical compound – while remaining completely invisible to the senses.Once these monitoring tools were developed and were operable in a lab, they were put to use in a wide range of industrial processes, from the production of rubber to the production of pharmaceuticals and much more. As a consequence, the amount of toxic substance that was produced does not correlate with the amount measured, which allowed the scientists to monitor the amount of each substance produced. In other words, the ability to accurately monitor and analyse the amount of a toxic substance produced does not correlate with the ability to design a chemical or construct an infrastructure to deal with it.In an effort to address this issue, Baucom and his colleagues turned to an idea known as ‘automatic determining of properties’</text>

By monitoring the amount of silicon and the amount of hydrogen in the concrete, the researchers were able to detect changes in the amount of silicon in the liquid, and in the electrical charge of the concrete interacting with the liquid.By monitoring the charge of the concrete interacting with the liquid and the shape of the liquid, the researchers were able to detect changes in the amount of liquid crystal material in the liquid, and in the electrical charge of</text>

One of the earliest applications of this kind of environmental monitoring is provided by the development of self-repairing buildings, such as buildings made from biobased microcapsules of liquid resin that are continuously pumped through tubes inside a building. By monitoring the level of this resin in the building, the level in the resin and the volume of liquid resin injected into the building, the researchers can determine how well the building is supporting its structural purposes.Over the past decade, advances in computer modelling have allowed researchers to create highly detailed 3D designs that simulate the action of microorganisms in the human body, increasing our understanding of how the human body works and the types of damage that can be inflicted. For example, in the early stages of research into the disease Caesarean section, a surgeon cuts open a woman’s abdominal cavity to examine a Caesarean section that she may have to during her pregnancy.

These metallurgy models are applied to the real-world material prototypes and reveal hitherto invisible aspects of the processes involved in the production of high-performance building materials.This approach requires no prior knowledge of engineering or biology in the creation of materials or building materials, and the research teams are able to identify promising materials-systems candidates through data mining.The material prototypes developed at MIT and Carnegie Mellon University refer to the formation of these new materials through chemical reactions between nanite parts and liquid hydrocarbons, which are abundant in the earth's crust. By imitating the biological process of part-shifting between organic and inorganic materials, these new material prototypes can bond to virtually any surface and micro</text>

These neighbourhoods included areas around major hospitals and primary-care centres. Within a few years, Montreal’s downtown neighbourhoods became infested with these superbugs, with many neighbourhoods reporting a 90% increase in the spread of these superbugs over the past decade.The response has been devastating, with Montreal seeing a quadrupling of the city’s projected population swell as a result of this burgeoning downtown. The increasing number of people moving out of the city limits – which are predominantly made up of high-density neighbourhoods – has caused the space surrounding these neighbourhoods to swell as well, creating what’s being called a ‘multiplier effect’. This has both urban and environmental benefits, as more people can be incorporated into the ever-shrinking met</text>

For example, the widespread adoption of smart phones and ubiquitous computing devices has all but declared the biennial a ‘global phenomenon’.

It was originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Carnegie Mellon University in collaboration with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and is now a part of the OSHA Accreditation Database System.At the interface between engineering and biology, the two worlds were brought into sharper focus by the development of self-healing concrete, which was shown to be both highly ductile and can withstand high pressures and stresses, as well as extreme temperatures and pressures. By engineering the concrete to resist both high temperatures and pressures, the researchers created a material with enhanced mechanical and electrical properties that are ideal for use in high-performance building materials.At the interface of architecture and biology, the researchers demonstrated that a micro</text>

We’ll finish with a look at the houses themselves, and offer suggestions of what could be done with the houses (decorating, new carpets, a mural, a store, a bakery…). While the residents of the neighbourhood work on the layout of the house, the rest of us brainstorm. It’s a great opportunity to come up with new ways of looking at the place, that make use of the old and the demolished.

The key is that the text is there for people to understand: what we’re doing and why. We provide them with the tools they need to get involved and make a contribution. This is a very powerful way to engage people in a project without forcing them to do anything they don’t want to. And perhaps this is the way in which the Scottish Highlands are relevant to our project: we have a clear idea of what the city is like from the text, but we don’t know how it fits into the overall scheme of things. The alleys help us to think about scale and the city, and the alleys lend us wisdom and insight into how to build things in the city that way.The alleys of the Scottish Highlands</text>

Then we’ll go into the details of the landscape, the buildings and the alleys, and the process of creating a community’s self-image. The focus of the work will be on the alleys, since they’re the site of one of the largest urban transformations in recent Scottish history (the alleys, in fact, have been part of the city for over a thousand years). We’ll start with the façade, working our way up to the facade, which is made up of individualised façades, individualised wall paintings and individualised sculpts. The façade is the face of the house, but it’s also the site of much more activity: it has been redesigned, repainted and repurposed many times over. In the past, the alleys have hosted bingo parlours, clothing factories and also bookshops, and are now used by large financial institutions, who’d like to know what the bank can do with the alleys. The banks often invest</text>

Then we’ll go into the details of the landscape, the buildings and the alleys, and of course the streets and parks. The aim of the project is to create a sense of place around the house, with a symbolic placing as much as possible according to anthropological and class analysis. We’ll finish by explaining how the house fits into the wider urban-ecological scheme of things. The house represents the city in a non-urban way, and the city as a ‘system of streets and streets’. It’s a place where people can relax, come to shops, play football, take part in sports events, sit under benches, take part in meetings, get involved in community projects and so forth. Yet it’s also a place of resistance, where the house and its inhabitants take part in a process of continually shifting political, social and political meaning. In this sense the house is both a vehicle and a point of departure for further development. In this way the house serves as a locus of production for a met</text>

Then we’ll go into the details of the landscape, the buildings and the alleys, and how they’re all made up of parts and pieces. We’ll talk about the fact that this is a re-construction, and how this comes about: the use of recycled materials, the planting of flowers, the installation of benches and the creation of a plaza where people can gather and exchange gifts, as well as the creation of a new identity for the community. We’ll also look at what the future might hold for the area if the project is built on the foundations of the old one. The possibilities are endless. The question then becomes: what does it mean to be a part of this process? The answer depends on what comes out of the house. When everything is said and done, the house is the point where the community comes together to enact change. In this sense, it’s an institution, and the community is the architect. The design becomes something that the community can enact, and the outcome something that the community</text>

We’ll conclude with a description of the houses that will be transformed through the process. This is a no-holds-barred exploration of the landscape, and a way to come to terms with the fact that you’re building a house on top of a mountain. It’s a very different landscape from the one you’ve lived in for years, and you’ve probably never even heard of it. This is the story of how we came to be on the same mountain. This is the story of the alpine as a site for education, a place for work, a place for pleasure. I created the alpine as a site for dialogue, a place to ask questions, to find solutions and to explore in a different way. It’s a question of ownership, and in the context of a major infrastructure project like the Forth Road Bridge and Docklands development, the alpine is</text>

We’ll come to understand the spatial relations between the different elements of the area – the shape of the cone, the colour of the paint, the depth and curvature of the houses, the density of the traffic, the amount of rainfall and so on – and we’ll see that the goal of the whole project is to incorporate the entire area into one design.

The planning application is a 'living document' that reflects the city’s current situation as a result of the First World War. It includes information about houses purchased through the Housing Market Renewal Initiative (HMRI), as well as information about vacant properties and regeneration strategies. We’ll start by describing the area as a divided land. We’ll then work through the different uses for the area, and the roles of the city, the countryside, and the HMRI.

We’ll conclude with a look at the houses themselves, and the various uses that they may have in the future. This may include an assessment of the dilapidated character of the neighbourhood, as well as an interest in the places that are now houses of learning and culture, or, as we may decide later, into the future of housing as a whole. The fact that the city is such a big construction project doesn’t make it any easier to build a community, nor does it make it any easier to leave a community. As we’ll find out, the key to a successful and sustainable future for a community in the city is in fact its history and what it has done in the city. 1.

Much can be done to prepare ourselves in advance, and future generations can be saved by learning how to code, something that has never been offered as an option for a human being by either the elite nor the common folk. Nevertheless, many would rather die than contribute to a future society populated by artists than cease to be artists and become productive members of the art community.Artists, curators, artists’ plenipotentiaries would all be better positioned to tackle the daunting task of imagining a more beautiful future for artists and their communities. This is the opportunity that Future City Collective, the UK’s first truly community-based art school, embarked upon in order to develop strategies for artists’ collective empowerment. The school’s mission is to equip artists with the knowledge, skills and tools to tackle societal ills such as climate change and urban displacement.[1] The school has been in existence since its founding in 1994, and its students have collectively produced more than 120 projects spanning a broad range of disciplines, from grassroots projects to large institutions and multinational corporations.  Their commitment to social change, incorporating research and critique, has</text>

Much can be done to prepare ourselves in advance, and future generations can be saved by learning how to code, something that has never been offered as an option for a human. What should be done is done to help artists and the communities they work with, not for the sake of the artists or the communities who will one day own and control the creative works produced by those artists.Artists, communities, and artists’ own work are often the most powerful engines driving change. It is this ongoing, ever-shifting nature of the art form that produces the kinds of transformation that can reshape how we live our lives, creating entirely new kinds of possibilities and futures. But what if the art form were to become something more, or if the community instead choose to become producers or creators of their own future art? What could that mean in practice? This issue of Stages considers this question and more, drawing on recent research and project work undertaken in Liverpool, Berlin, and Sweden. It brings together six research projects undertaken since 2015, with proposals from local communities to create new work that explores the possibilities and challenges of ART as a social practice in their</text>

International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in New York and National Theatre in London have been researching the possibility of art being created by machines for some time. In 2015, the two institutions founded a collaborative research project, with IISS New York and National Theatre London, to explore the possibilities of art being created ethically through the interaction of AI and robotics. The project, entitled Creating Art with Machines, sought to develop practices and research questions that would allow artists to create tools that, ‘like machines’, could be used in the creation of art – but unlike machines, could never be truly understood or &quot;programmed&quot; to create anything new or satisfying: they would never dream of making art themselves. The project was co-founded by IISS New York and National Theatre London, as well as the University of Bath’s School of Art, where IISS Alexandria is based, and which is currently conducting a three-year research project entitled</text>

However, this does not mean that a future art gallery or museum dedicated to the capabilities of the human artist will be any less susceptible to the perverse whims of a machine.Artists, curators, collectors and art dealers with an interest in the future of art’s technological capacities should therefore seize every opportunity to connect with one another and, as much as possible, to imagine what a gallery or museum might look like in the future. This is the only way to ensure that art’s capacity to envision is not reduced to a twentieth-century standard that is too human, and that art’s future is not reduced to a gallery or museum of twentieth-century art.Artists, curators, collectors and art dealers with an interest in the future of art should therefore adopt an approach to one another that anticipates their own dreams and imagines what a gallery or museum might look like in the future.

But there is a critical need to talk about this in the context of unavoidable technological change, and with artists, curators, artists and the arts all around the world urgently calling for a return to the original purpose of art as a collective engagement with the world around us. 	So, what can artists do? There are a few things that are already happening at an incredible pace through technologies now, but there are many more that need to be learned and implemented. The art world is a big place with many different stakeholders, and a lot of stakeholders have different ideas and perspectives than artists do. And so there is a huge amount of work being done behind the scenes to align with the interests of many of those stakeholders with little or no visibility. 	There are a few exceptions to this rule, but they are few and far between, and many of those stakeholders still perceive the arts as a static or monolithic entity with very little agency or participation.

Much can be done to prepare ourselves in advance, and future generations can be saved by learning how to code, something that has never been offered as an option for a human being by either major political party in the history of the world. However, some are asking: what if something is automated and what happens when that thing is done? 	Artists have a simple but powerful way of responding to this question: creating and exploiting artificial intelligence (AI) and similar technologies. AI enables artists to do amazing things with datasets, including the creation of entirely new forms of artistic work that can be produced in massive quantities, using machine learning and other algorithms to scan vast amounts of data to identify patterns, such as music, or scenes, such as scenes in a painting, and to understand relationships between them.Artists can create worlds in which the processes involved in creating them are automated, or at least as difficult as it is to imagine them happening in our world. This is possible because of the inherent inhumanity of the human race – which is why AI cannot be trusted with the sensitive functions of state – but also because of the incredible freedom and flexibility of AI</text>

There are a few promising approaches that have captured the imagination of artists and curators alike: purveyors of alternative lifestyles, creators of participatory art, creators of virtual or augmented reality experiences, artists opposed to industrial culture, and so forth. 	However, there are far too many of them to be explored or employed by a city or a nation state alone, much less a multinational corporation, so how to sensibly engage the public or a global community of artists? Luckily, there exists a virtual or augmented reality medium or medium that artists and curators can inhabit and engage with, create value from and render meaningful to in a multitude of ways: create their own virtual reality experiences, collaborate with one another or work in concert. </text>

Much can be done to prepare ourselves in advance, and future generations can be saved by learning how to code, something that has never been offered as an option for a human being. But the choice to code will always remain with us, and artists will remain the voiceless members of a machine, even as the machine continues to rain destruction down upon those who would seek to alter its course.  	Artists, restorers, poets, painters, crafters, gardeners, web designers, farmers, house cleaners, lorries and countless others will all continue to play a part in the future of urban environments, providing useful intelligence to those in charge and allowing for the creation of new kinds of community. But the vast majority of us will remain content in our present forms, producing and sharing beautiful art that serves as history, informs debates and entertains generations to come. 	Artists will undoubtedly continue to lead creative, influential lives, and their work will continue to be read and considered by generations of artists and others. But the task of imagining new ways of working, new social situations and of existing – of making things new – will</text>

The ability to design one’s environment with remarkable precision and speed is the result of two events in 2015: the advent of 3D printing and the explosion of social media; the latter is no exaggeration. Rapid prototyping, or ‘post-industrial prototyping’, is the current paradigm in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and it is a paradigm that artists are desperately trying to adapt to. 	Artists, curators, collectors and the art market themselves often struggle with the notion of what it means to be an artistically-invented company today, and the concomitant pressure to be seen to be doing something worthwhile and ethical in the world. In recent years, there has been a strange proliferation of self-help and ‘community art’ categories, which seek to connect to-date art with contemporary social problems and/or politically-engaged practices,</text>

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection of artefacts. Performance art has taken on an international character, and thanks to social media and biennials, we see performance art all over the world. Performance art is a fine art form that is deeply nuanced, and unlike most art forms, where the art is represented through images, a biennial can actually foster a dialogue between artist and audience. Performance art is a form of cultural production that is inherently vulnerable, and while biennials can and do make mistakes, their main task in the world right now is to try to adapt to the ever-expanding range of biennials, and to provide a constant and visible input into the evolution of performance art globally. Although biennials may have particular jobs to do, their main job is to a large extent a ‘survive and thrive’ one, and their real and perceived mission is to expand the biennial portfolio. A significant and ever-increasing proportion of the biennial market is spent on reproducing and capitalising</text>

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection of artefacts, but a museum that seeks to articulate a proposition through documentation. The power of documentation lies in its ability to unite, but in order to truly understand a given issue or proposition, an organisation must actively participate in creating a history around that issue or proposition. Otherwise, artefacts are but collections of facts, and documents are only ever going to be an artifact of the moment and context in which they are found, and since the biennial is only ever going to be a small part of the overall art and arts systems museum, the power of the artefact has to be actively contested in order to truly understand a given moment. Contemporary art and contemporary art-making today is a ‘game changer’, and the biennial – and its documentation – is a game changer too.

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection of artefacts. Performance art has become a social practice, and whilst its social functions may be there, its critical mass now governs how the art is produced and distributed. A biennial commission may produce great art, but the critical mass it generates is what will change how art is made, distributed and enjoyed in the future.  The performance as a social practice  is where performance art differs from other social practices. The proliferation of theatre and dance as a performance art form in the arts has democratised art making, and whilst there are artistic practices that were once performed in private or in highly controlled settings, the advent of mass media and the internet has made it possible for artists to work outside of the context of the art gallery, the mainstream or institutional audience. The ability to produce and distribute material directly to an audience is a critical innovation of the modern democratised arts practice, and whilst it may be challenging to access these materials in the future, it is possible to recognise significant art making within the</text>

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection of artefacts. Performance art is a form of public art and as such it’s constantly under attack. Its festivals and collections are routinely criticised, vilified and even banned by governments, and yet they’re here to stay. What they’re performing is very different from the way in which art is typically conceived and executed, and although there’s a huge difference between the two, there’s a huge difference that can be made in the understanding of how art is produced. In the current biennial format, the biennial publishes a collection of works at regular intervals, often in parallel to the other arts biennials, and through this, constructs a shared set of relations between art and artists. Biennials may be institutions, but they’re artists’ institutions too. When I started, the only way to see a biennial was to book a place in advance, and so I came to understand that a place is only as good as</text>

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection of artefacts, but a museum built on the back of its own power, showcasing the very embodiment of the art form in a continuous narrative. A critical mass is a point where art is made visible and is a powerful tool for generating new narratives and constructing whole new worlds, and whilst it may be art, it’s art nonetheless. The art world needs to start asking itself and the community: how much of the art would we allow ourselves to see? If the answer is ‘nothing, absolutely nothing, zilch’ then the art world’s complicity in the art world’s impoverishment and injustice will have been excessive. Therefore, if the art world is to be authentic then it’s worth questioning why it upholds a narrative that exploits and exploits groups of people, and showing real work that impacts on people’s daily lives, then questioning the narrative that supports that fiction. Doing so may well end up in a gallery space or</text>

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection of artefacts; it’s a living organism that undergoes massive changes throughout the years. Performance art today is a museum-like institution, with its own distinct identity and purpose, but it also has a critical mass of audiences, who are drawn to the museum-like experience of seeing the art in a particular context. When I began my research for the exhibition I was working on I was surprised how few biennials have any kind of performance art as a theme; this was one of the first performances that I did not find particularly interesting, although there are many performances that are. In a biennial such as the UK’s, the US’ performance arts have a particular place, but in many other places they don’t. For example, in Germany, the performance is not part of the main mission, but a speciality that is heavily promoted. In many countries, the performance is a mainstay, but in others, the form of the performance is on</text>

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection of artefacts. It’s a place where we can come and learn from the arts, but also: be entertained by them, but also witness their importance in our contemporary and future world, in our historical and contemporary context, in a particular moment in time. Performance art is a form that has undergone a number of radical changes in the last twenty years, and whilst it retains a vital place in the cultural landscape of the world, it is being actively undermined by biennial and major exhibition formats. Just as the performance is a form that demands a specific material and mental infrastructure, so too is the biennial and major exhibition format a form that demands specific social and cultural organisation. In the modern biennial, the elements of the project that are most influential in shaping what is perceived as the art’s' actual quality, and the audience’s perception of the art’s quality, are those elements that are most susceptible to change. In the case of a major exhibition,</text>

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection of artefacts, but a standing archive of a particular art form’s performances. Performance art is a form of performance that is inherently recursive, and whilst it may have been a form of art that was intended to be performed, in the current cultural moment (which is to be expected in a given cultural landscape) it is the other half of the coin that is being performed. The biennial is the performance that the community (and by extension, the artist) seeks, and whilst it may be true that in the current biennial landscape (with its emphasis on the festival, rather than the collection) the performance is the asset, the collection is the enemy (because it is often the enemy that feeds the recurring performance, whilst the artist is often the only one capable of providing the artefacts), there is an opportunity to work in other ways. There is much that can be learnt from other performance art traditions, and it is this impulse that runs contrary to the tendency to fetishise the bi</text>

If performance art was a museum it would be a collection of artefacts, but unlike museums, it’s not a collection – it’s a set of relations. Performance art has become a multi-billion dollar business, and whilst it may have a significant cultural impact, its cultural significance is diminishing at an alarming rate. Performance art is a performance, not a collection of collections, and while it may have cultural impacts, these are secondary to the primary purpose of performance art.

In the 2000s, it was used to describe the post-monumental phase of a biennial’s development, when art institutions embarked on a 'biennial cycle’ – a form of permanent exhibition that began in 2001 and continues to this day.[2] See: PerformanceArt.org, Biennial Database, accessed October 2018.Download this article as PDFStacey Tw</text>

It’s a canon, and the capacity of this form to proliferate is a source of much frustration for curators and artists. Performance art is a relatively new discipline, and while its syntax and vocabulary has changed a great deal in the intervening years, the essence of what has made it successful remains largely the same.

The biennial format allows the curatorial and arthistorical production of a single work to take place simultaneously, in different venues, in different time zones, in different social and political contexts. It provides a platform from which artists can simultaneously operate across different social and geographical circumstances, and yet simultaneously explore and be moved by the events unfolding before them. It enables and generates a sense of place and time in and through art activities, that is not reducible to the site where the activity takes place. It is a set of</text>

And it is a recipe for a new art form that is both adaptable and disposable.Download this article</text>

It is a recipe for the reproduction of a particularity, and for the development of a localised and multi-disciplinary curatorial cadre of curators, artists, writers, policymakers, journalists and architects working across a range of sites in Istanbul, and all over the world. It is a recipe for the translation of one's own unique perspective and experience into a mode of shared understanding and experience. It is a recipe for the production of a unique curatorial and art historical artefact, produced through an art historical curatorial and an art and heritage curatorial collaboration. It is a recipe for the crafting and production of artistic and cultural multi-modal exchanges between a local and global curatorial community. And it is a recipe for the production of innovative and dynamic art historical curatorial practices that use cultural resources and paradigms that are not based on white, middle class, white settler settler historical practices.These are some of the expectations, or at least some of the designed outcomes, of Aarhus 2017, and curated by Aarhus Art Biennale 2016, and curated by Aarhus Museet. The curatorial process shaped some of these outcomes, but also shaped others. And these varied outcomes shaped the way in which the curators approached the art, their position and their place in the artworld.The expectations that were placed on the participants of Aarhus 2017, and their participation in the Biennale itself, were as follows: 1. In order to be considered a fully realised art project, the exhibition should involve both curatorial and artistic efforts. 2. The issue of audience participation and</text>

It is a recipe for the production of a unique curatorial and art historical artefact, produced through an art historical curatorial and an art and heritage curatorial collaboration.

It is a recipe for the production of art and cultural identities, produced in multiple formats and media, propagated by a curatorial and art historical enterprise. It is a recipe for the production of culture and collective action through the production of cultural resources, cultural and urban development, designed and built upon the biennial landscape and its products and artefacts. It is a recipe for the production of arts historical and cultural resources, the perpetuation of artistic and creative memory, and the public engagement of the public. It is a recipe for the production of cultural institutions and the curatorial agenda, the development of interdisciplinary networks of art and cultural exchange, and the provision of resources for future art and cultural activity. It is a recipe for the provision of critical art and cultural information and analysis, and the nurturing of the imagination</text>

It is a recipe for the crafting and production of artistic and cultural multi-modal exchanges across a globalised and digitally mediated urban landscape. It is a recipe for an artistic and cultural horizon beyond the immediate, defined frontiers of the city, of course. But perhaps the most significant contribution of this model is its potential to create and foster an understanding of a city's artistic potential. The biennial format offers us a potential medium for the production of cultural multi-modal exchanges at a regional, national and international scale, through the exchange of ideas, strategies and techniques. It is a potential tool for the production of cross-cultural understanding and relations, through which art and culture can engage with the means of knowledge production and the capacity of knowledge in a multiplicity of subjects and cultures. It is a potential medium through which the production of art and culture may be collectively understood. Covering a broad geographical area, and with activities spanning continents, biennials offer multiple vantage points and perspectives, allowing their members to engage with and contribute to the understanding of a city</text>

They are a rare and precious commodity, and are often the only commodity around for artists, curators and art collectors. The biennial as an art form is the rare commodity today, but it will be artists, curators and curators in their parochial art collections, museum collections and private collections in the future, and it will be interesting to observe how art historical curators react to the biennial in the future.Art historical curators will be positioned in regions where art historical curatorial approaches are already being enacted, and they will be positioned to observe</text>

It is a term that has been around for a while, and while it may be recognizable to those who grew up in the United States or in the West, its historical context is found in all of the world’s major infrastructure projects, from the Roman roads to the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean.Infrastructures are built to last – and in a global sense, that is</text>

In the twentieth century, the industrial transition came about as a result of the huge expansion of population, particularly in southern countries; a third of humanity now lives within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of the ocean.4 	The term ‘solid waste management’ refers to the process of breaking down materials into small forms of energy using heat, pressure and electricity. By analysing the enormous amounts of solid waste generated in the developing world each day, scientists are able to generate unlimited amounts of electricity.
