The projects were compiled from research carried out for an exhibition to be mounted in 2014, titled The Contemporary Condition. The aim of this exhibition is to ask, ‘What does it mean to be contemporary?’; to explore the different ways that art is produced today, and the relationship between art and the everyday world.ACTA funded the project through the AGCA Third Sector Fund, which provides financial support for activities in third sectors including research, production and dissemination.

The contents of the exhibition have been provided by the curator for the exhibition, and the curator’s discussions with the artists and the curatorial team have been conducted through an online platform created for the exhibition. The online platform allows the audience to interact with the curatorial process through augmented reality technology. The curatorial discussions took place in response to the question: what do we mean by contemporary? The artists and the curator’s team responded that they felt that the answer to this question could be summarized in one word: technology. In fact, they felt that technology––in its multifaceted forms, which include but are limited to civil engineering, physics and chemistry, as well as finance, media and logistics, marketing and PR, as well as social media and law and media—would play a much greater role in our contemporary world than art or design. They proposed that the art and design produced during this century should</text>

The curator for this exhibition, Professorial Curator at the Museum of Modern Art, Dr Katherine Shearman, spoke about the project in relation to the museum, highlighting the curatorial role as a maker and not merely an observer. Shearman emphasised the curatorial importance of the project in terms of the museum’s ongoing relationship with the city: the relationship between the museum and the city, which she described as a ‘complex relationship’. She said the curatorial role in this context should be seen as an integral part of the museum, and not just an extension of it.For many contemporary artists and art historians this is still a key concept in their practice, and it is an aspect of their ‘ambiguous genre theory’. But for the curatorial role to have an impact in this context, it is essential that it is seen to be dynamic and</text>

The team was led by Dr Hans-Georg Maurer, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Art, Culture, &amp; Society in Dortmund. System motifs were explored as a way to imagine new ways of understanding art and the social function of art in a contemporary context. They were also presented as evidence of how art and social function can coexist in the contemporary world, in an ongoing dialogue.Art is often described as an ‘infrastructure’. Its functional areas include forms of cultural infrastructure, including forms of art, livelihoods, production, consumption, production (including production for export), collectives and collectivity. It is difficult to imagine a concrete physical infrastructure of infrastructure, but in the contemporary world of the infrastructural complex the</text>

The projects were compiled from research carried out for an exhibition to be mounted in 2014, titled The Contemporary Condition. The aim of this exhibition is to ask, ‘What does it mean to be contemporary?’; to explore the different ways that art is produced today, and the relationship between art and the everyday world.ACTA funded the project through the AGCA Third Sector Fund, which provides financial support for activities in third sectors including research, production and dissemination.

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts have done amazing things for our society. Politically speaking, they’re one of the few areas of the globe where the dominant social ideologies still hold sway. The fact that so many people identify with the arts does a disservice to the notion of who we are as artists, and to the profession itself. It is an insult to the memory of those artists, who, in the eyes of the powerful, still hold a place in our collective consciousness. In fact, it shows a disrespect for those who have worked so hard to make their work meaningful and memorable. In my opinion, the new normal has to do with those who make art now, and beyond. It has to do with those still capable of creating meaningful art forms. It has to do with those who have the skills and networks to push the art form into new contexts – to the point where it becomes universal. These are the kinds of changes that have to happen for the arts to reclaim their place in our collective cultural histories</text>

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts have a way of generating contingency and new possibilities for people to inhabit and engage with.In this new age of massive data collection and streaming services, it’s easy to forget just how much our notions of what counts as art and what counts as trash ultimately come from the arts themselves. The rise of social media and the connectedness of all forms of media has dramatically altered our notions of what counts and what doesn’t. Contemporaneous is defined by the New York Times as follows: ‘Contemporary art’ is a term often used by curators, artists, journalists or collectors to describe work that has become embedded in the cultural landscape and is therefore difficult to categorise or reject.’  But what is contemporary art? And how is it embedded? How does the contemporary art form engage with the current political moment in the world? These are questions that address how our notions of what counts as art and what counts as trash are constructed, and how this impacts</text>

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts have a tendency to project its practitioners into desirable situations. For instance, the tendency is to romanticise the art of travelling as exemplified by the advent of photography, particularly in the context of a nineteenth-century globalised economy driven by photographic images. However, the economic and technological basis for photographic images was developed in large part by European makers of photography equipment. The advent of photography coincided with a corresponding decline in population growth, which in turn coincided with a corresponding expansion of industrial production. As a result, humankind produced considerably more images of itself than it took with photography anymore. And so the tendency is that the public image will be represented by images of things that are more readily available, more quotidian and quotidianised, and so be more persuasive. But this tendency is counteracted by the mores imposed by power on artistic and artistic-type practitioners to a greater or lesser extent. The art world has its moments of brilliance where artists and artistic communities really get off on creating opportunities for the</text>

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts have often been used in ways that are abusive, reductive and designed to please a powerful individual or entity. The power to define and oppress has always belonged to a strong centralized authority. Thus, projects that seek to draw upon the power of the arts in a dominant, centralized way are likely to encounter resistance from powerful vested interests. The art world has a tendency to do the opposite: empower and educate the people and promote harmony. In fact, it’s often the projects that seek to draw upon the power of the arts and promote harmony in a non-power-hungry way that are most at risk of being abused or destroyed by powerful interests. In an effort to ensure that a project doesn’t end up being used by powerful vested interests, the artist/organisation has a responsibility to ensure that the art is used in ways that are truly artist-centered and truly artist’s. Here, the art world can exert significant control over a project’s use</text>

In other words, change is not inevitable but can be fostered and facilitated.Change is fostered and facilitated through the arts, of course. The fact that the arts are often seen as a detriment to a project's success is a myth. The fact that the arts are often seen as a positive force in a project’s development is a myth. The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts have been around for a long time and have always been open to scrutiny and experimentation. After all, why would we give a platform to project developers who regularly denigrate the arts and deny the power of the artist to his or her work? Why would we reward a project that routinely traffics in formlessness and trivialises the work of others when so-called ‘artists’ can do likewise?Why would we want to? Why would we want to make another Great American Bunbury? Why would we want to patronise a company that regularly pretends to abhor violence, racism, anti-Semitism and so on? Why would we want to invest our art in a company that, by its own frequent announcements and self-congratulatory manifestos, is already showing signs of exhaustion?Why would we want to?Because the otherness of the art, its seeming lack of attachment to the site upon which it is displayed, and its seeming inability to connect with others – that is</text>

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts have a tendency to project its practitioners onto an already situated set of circumstances, and thus the art world has a tendency to project its practitioners onto already constituted social worlds. This is particularly true when the practitioner is a white, middle-class, heterosexual male artist. The art world has a tendency to project its practitioners onto already constituted social worlds in ways that are not always explicit and always inauthentic. The art world has a tendency to project its celebrants onto already constituted social worlds in ways that are often not explicit and always complicit. This is particularly true when the celebrant is a woman, but is true for many other social groups. The key is that the social world in which the actions taking place are taking place, and that the action is normative within that social framework. In short, the celebrant should be able to define what is and is not celebratory. There are of course diverse forms of social and political context in which the artist might find himself or herself, and it is</text>

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts should be of use to those with whom they are associated—not to those who seek to divide and rule us all. The fact that the arts are often seen as inherently 'contemporaneous' with other art forms is a myth. The fact that the arts are frequently seen as inherently ‘contagious’ with other social practices is a myth. Contagious is defined as ‘occurring at an ever-increasing pace within a community of people or groups over time’. Art is a myth that requires no human agents to be alive in its world.And so we move forward. The arts world has its share of detractors. There’s the critic who denounces the art as inherently political, lacking in substance. There’s the critic who decries the fact that  	the arts world is international, globalized, and now globalized itself. There’s the art critic who’s increasingly conscious of the artworld as</text>

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts have a tendency, though, to project prevailing ideologies and prevailing values onto a project. This is particularly true when the arts are a minority interest or a favoured interest. As a result, projects that seek to be representative of the dominant ideologies or prevailing values tend to be projects that are focused on the people or groups who are most ‘in the know’—in the public eye, at least. This is particularly true for socially engaged or ‘engaged’ projects. The more widely accepted the art is, the less it is likely that people will identify with a project based on its stated interest. The more widely accepted the art is, the less likely that people will identify with a project based on its stated primary interest. Thus a project that seeks to be representative of a specific class or interest may be more successful if the stated primary interest is in fact the least popular or influential.  Whether or not the stated primary interest is popular or influential, a project that seeks to be</text>

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts are part of a larger historical and cultural narrative of great injustice and conflict. The modern cultural turn against the arts is a myth. And the cultural turn towards the arts is likely to continue.There are a few projects that I know of that have attempted to tackle this problem head-on. One is the production of public space through art events. The other is the production of an artistic consciousness through art projects. These projects often develop into organisations or collections, and sometimes into art institutions. But the art events have the primary role – creating meaning and difference in the world – while the art projects generally see their role shifted from ‘creating meaning and difference’ to ‘making art in the here and now’. Art events and the collections that they produce usually have a minimal impact on the people who use the site or use it constructively. The collections that they support often have transformative effects that reshape how we perceive the world and create new vocabularies of meaning.</text>

The fact that the arts are often seen as an elitist art form that oppresses or ridicules others is a myth. As an art form, the arts naturally seek to reduce their users to a set set of prescribed behaviours and interests. The problem with the art form, however, is that it’s ever present and can be counted on to continue evolving. The art world as a whole is deeply mired in internalised heterosexism. It’s easy to identify a problematic piece of art when it comes out of the water cooler of a major art institution. It’s much harder to engage with a piece of art when it emerges from the water cooler of an independent artist. The challenge for the art world today is two-fold: firstly, to change how it views art, and secondly, to change how it produces and uses art.The challenge for the independent artist today is two-fold: to find a niche that will support her/himself, and secondly to find a project that will produce socially engaged art that is not beholden to a prescribed ideology.The independent artist today is often confronted with</text>

The second edition of the Biennale opened in 2003, and the third in 2011. It’s a good thing, then, that the biennale is often described as being ‘about building sustainable ways of living in cities’. This is an incredibly misleading way of framing the discussion; the real thrust of the project is often defined as much on the level of a policy statement as it is on the level of a narrative. The Biennale’s real ambition is often defined as the kind of extreme democratisation that would give full access to places and people to cities, notably through the initiative that it</text>

Our first phase of research and engagement in 2015-16 focused on the Jewish and Zionist communities in the Welsh Streets. We were looking to create a public realm that reflected the lives and work of both Jewish and Zionist communities in Dorset. As a result, we created a community archive project that incorporated archival research, text, image and performance studies. Our second phase of research and engagement in 2017-18 explored the lives and works of the community as a whole.

But as the biennial enters its twenty-first century, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that these technologies are not yet universal; there are cultural aspects to be taken into account when constructing a digital ecosystem. 	In this regard, the Venice Biennale’s decision to curate its 2016 edition around the structures of the old city – a city that it says has been ‘turned into a never-to-be-quite-a-complete-circulation of art, architecture and natural history’ – is deeply indebted to Clement Greenberg, whose book The Architecture of Luxury: Culture and Capital in Crisis (2007) laid out the political, economic and environmental factors that have created this transformation. 	Greenberg theorised that the relationship between culture and the machine was developing towards a situation in which the cultural would play a greater role in the transformation of the economy of nature than the latter. In the age of the biennale, there is a re-emergence of the idea that the biennial can function as a kind of a library</text>

But as the biennial enters its twenty-first century, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that these technologies are here to stay, that we will live in a world populated almost entirely with them, and that this is a world where we will all be cogs in the endless machine. 	The question that keeps coming up these days is about presence (or, well, non-existent absence). Is there still life left in the world, or does the biennial have too much of a presence? As the biennial continues to grow in volume and scope, it’s becoming increasingly evident that the question of presence is more of a reflection of how much information is being conveyed than of what’s actually being conveyed. For the 2014 edition of the Biennale, curated by P. Krishnamurthy, a film about the life and work of Indian artist Datta Kambhaiya is used as a stand-in for the city. In several scenes, Kambhaiya is depicted as a wanderer, floating aimlessly in space, carrying around</text>

The question is: what will replace the thing that created the ambiguity and alienated feeling of the big picture?

We need to start thinking about alternative uses for these same technologies, if we want to survive them. If we start to see these connected forms of media producing themselves in unexpected ways, producing new forms of understanding and perhaps even new forms of sociality, then we too could start to imagine alternate futures.Download this article as PDFJussi ParikkaJussi Parikka is Professor in Technological Culture &amp; Aesthetics at the Winchester School of Art (University of Southampton) and holds the UK and international commissionsing and communications anno 2007.

But as the biennial enters its twenty-first century, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that this world is also becoming increasingly connected. New technologies are enabling ever greater amounts of data to be gathered and transmitted; and in turn, a multitude of new cultural forms to be formed. In this context, it’s easy to see how biennials can play this new media game of connectivity, because they’re part of a cultural/linguistic heterogeneous media complex that is constantly updating itself. 	As the biennial progresses, it becomes increasingly apparent that this media complex is made up of many different sorts of media, with different players, all of whom are engaged with the same kinds of social problems. For example, the problems of engagement and political participation today face a constituent part, if not necessarily all, of today’s engagement. But this does not mean that the major social problems of our time do not also present themselves as part of this media complex.

We’ve all become victims of the new terminal capitalism. 	In the 1990s and early 2000s, biennials were places where artists and arts organisations could set up shop and conduct programmes in a socially engaged way. But as the biennial calendar has become ever more complex and variable, the quality of the art being produced has become variable as well. The artworld has a duty, now, not to produce art that can be appropriated by a terminal capitalism, but to forge art that is independent and politicised in ways that are resilient and empathetic. The artworld has an even greater obligation to imagine alternatives. 	A few years ago, I arranged a series of six events for the artist Joasia Krysaław to undertake.

But as the biennial enters its twenty-first century, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that these technologies are bound to one form or another, and that in order to thrive in that world, we’ll need to be able to grasp the meaning of all of these different forms. If we don’t grasp that meaning yet recognise it, then we’ll be stuck in this present and future historical moment, unable to move forward or backward, creating or exploiting the new forms of data that are generated. So who are we to make the future we inhabit? Who are we to say that life doesn’t need to be lived in accordance with certain kinds of meaning? 	In this digital age, we can no longer pretend that the past is static and that the future is unknowable, but we have to actively think about what kinds of meaning might be possible. This kind of thinking about the future is happening in art projects all over the world, and it’s starting to influence how we perceive the world around us. 	In the</text>

In an evolving, globalised society, it makes sense to begin to question whether certain forms of power are really necessary in the first place.

In researching my book Territory (2015), I came across an area of Manhattan known as the ‘Silk Road’ and its labyrinthine tunnels under the East River. I spent several months living underground in an abandoned school under the river, taking maps and research samples, before I was able to enter the city proper. But after that, it was all part of a larger ‘Trans-indicator Project’ that involved tracking the movement of large numbers of trafficked human beings.

The built environment is increasingly seen not as a repository of past practices but as a site of future possibilities. 	Looking to the Future 	Looking to the future is a key concept to envision a post-biennial world – one that isn’t dependent on the past or present – and that doesn’t merely postpone the future but anticipates it. That’s why biennials should always be asking, as all institutions that emerged after their 1980 publication, why did this happen? Why did this happen? Why do we do this? Why do these organisations exist? Why do we let these happen to us? Why don’t we do something about it? Why don’t we do something about it? Why don’t we do something about it</text>

This is similar to the way in which art is made today: by taking into account the different levels of the plant, the various layers and constituent parts, the researchers create a pictorial representation of the plant that is both quantitative and conceptual.  The film Airplane! uses this scientific approach to look at how we can all play our part in creating a better world through our own actions. The research and design team in the film work alongside community members, academics, artists and others to come up with ways to make the plant ‘work’s of today more like the plant that emerged in 1887.  Although this is an ambitious undertaking, the film shows that this kind of interdisciplinary thinking about the environment is possible and even desirable. It is an example of how the broadening of our scientific and artistic knowledge of the world around us can lead to radical change. This kind of interdisciplinarity is what Francis Bacon, the English biologist, described in his work on the moral character of mankind: man is justified in treating the environment as ‘a monstrous and depraved creation’.[24]  One of Bacon’s contributions to the moral character of man is shown</text>

Another example is the work of artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan, who for several years ran an online art and social media website called ‘Lawrence Abu Hamdan Gallery’ in Egypt and ‘Lawrence Abu Hamdan Digital Gallery’ in the United States. His latest project, ‘Mapping the Environment: Egypt’s Civil War on Acid’, is an exploration of the ‘carbon footprint’ of the Egyptian Revolution, from the oil it produced to the impact it had on the climate. The website includes a wealth of source material on the revolutionary’s economic and social policies and the subsequent transformation of the country’s surface landscape.  Another example is the work of Mamdouh Eldamaty, a Brooklyn-based artist and activist who in 2013 created the hugely popular social web magazine Stages on the word ‘environment’ in Arabic.

The researchers have a particular interest in the criticality of this scenario: if the plant ‘knew’ and the ‘layer’ ‘couldn’ ‘easily’ be identified, ‘a new understanding of how knowledge is produced would be possible.’1  The movie Airplane! also features a landscape architecture lecture by Norman Green and Prof. Jeffrey White, who are both from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Michigan, and are the co-curators of the upcoming exhibition, ‘Architecture and the Anarchist Imagination: Rock and Paper,’2 which is based on the film. Green and White’s two lectures are taken up by a group of other invited guests, who introduce the project as an example of how social and ecological processes can be catalyzed through the participation of an artist in a public space.

Each leaf component represents a distinct chemical element, and the component parts represent physical structures that react with one another in a reaction that produces a variety of organic compounds. The images were captured using separate cameras, and are therefore composites that reveal the layered nature of the design. The photograph of the engine of the plane in the project was taken from the press kit, and the photograph of the components taken from the researchers’ notebooks. The photographs were then combined to create a single, high-resolution jpeg image that best illustrates the structural details of the design.  The photo above is a composite of the two photographs of the engine, taken from different angles, in different exposures</text>

Similarly, the relationships between social networks and physical spaces have come a long way in the last twenty years, and new technological technologies are constantly being developed that alter the social and spatial relations between people and place. New social forms can be imagined created in the context of ever-more elaborate and interconnected networks of physical and virtual space.  Finally, there is the question of public space. As the phrase ‘public space’ suggests, this includes public realm, and it includes space that is publicly accessible, that is accessible to people regardless of their place of residence or origin, and that promotes social interaction between people from different places and backgrounds. Space is a shared resource shared between people, and this includes the built environment, including roads, streets and parks. New social forms can be imagined created in the context of such shared resources. New social forms can be imagined created in the context of a publicly accessible space.

Another example of digitally mediated work is the work of the artists Mumia Abu Jamal and Juan Carlos López de la Torre, who together with colleagues at the Instituto de Estudiantes y Bárbara have been involved in the Liverpool Biennial, since 2009. Their project ‘In Situ' – situated in the city centre as part of the Museo del Perú’s ongoing ‘Historic Continuum’ project – integrates a number of local ideas and practices into a single urban narrative, albeit one told through several different vantage points.  A third example is that of the artists and curators Project Cactus, who in 2011 created a series of public interventions around the history of inSite: Tucson, Arizona, using the City of Industry Building as a cultural memento of the Great Recession that year.

In both ‘plant-based and ‘art’ spaces, people are regularly and constructively engaged in activities that address the connectedness of people and the environment. In the case of social enterprises, this is often engaged with the idea of how to support socially engaged practices outside of the workplace.  One example of this is the Social Practice Research Lab (SPLR), an organisation that specialises in the socialisation of culture, engaged with the idea of how to support artists and community members who work with or with create opportunities through the art of making and sharing. The lab’s work often seeks to create collaborative opportunities for artists to work alongside community members or other stakeholders, while fostering engagement between the artist and other stakeholders, including stakeholders in the community.

Another example is in the book Starch – A Global Biennale Trick (2013), by Leslie Sturgis and her colleagues, who used archival and digitised collections to create a virtual reality experience of the historical Starch Plant in Dearborn, which they christened ‘Starch City’ and ‘Starch Night’ in response to the Tate Modern's redevelopment plans.3. New cultural forms emerging online. ­Cultural capture, no matter how subtle, can be quantified and measured. In the digital age of the internet and social media, cultures are captured, sold, and facilitated – online or in-person. In the past, cultural institutions, their online communities and archives, and artefacts found in them were collectively referred to as ‘the web’. However, the web is no longer defined by the physical exclusion of others; in fact, it is the intended audience of today's consumers. Therefore,</text>

The film Airplane! is a dramatic and moving depiction of the effects of air pollution on the environment, yet it also ends on a note of melancholy: when the plane crashes, no one really knows what will happen to the landscape. This is, perhaps, partly because the researchers involved in the project are so busy with the political and legal machinations of their respective places in the world that they don’t really have time to think about the consequences of their decisions.  Similarly, the online project [1] is about as metaphorical as one can get with respect to the current state of affairs in the world, and thus raises the question: what can one do to help?  [2]  The idea that one could create a complete set of components is common to many forms of engineering work, and is an important consideration in the context of aerospace. For instance, the composite parts in jet engines are made up of many interconnected components</text>

These are the transportation modes of the post-Ford society. The post-Ford society sees travel not in terms of the distance between cities but of the integration of all modes of movement into one ‘globalized' form. Travel is now possible through companies that ‘know’ the terrain and ‘speak’ the language of the postindustrial society.2  The post-Ford society also sees automation as a progressive end point, as new technological solutions to old problems are put into place in factories all over the globe. As these solutions are put into place, the post-Ford society expects more and more people to carry out these tasks day in and day out, year round, year round. These people will ‘make more and</text>

It is possible to be 'liked', or ‘shared’ like an app. 	When a community of people become aware of an area, or part of an area, via a community map or social media platform, they can ‘hack’ that area or neighbourhood to become part of a ‘network’ and participate in ‘the collective experience’ of that area. 	In a larger urban context, these types of technologies have the potential to form part of a much broader ‘urban-learning’ process that seeks to unravel entrenched forms of racialised (white) supremacy and create a city in which racial and socio-economic difference is understood not as an outcome of individual or social traits but as a site of social struggle.  	However, as adoption of new technologies and the flow of data have become ever more pervasive, so too has</text>

Social media and its platforms allow people to simultaneously be part of the performer and to be spectators. 	The performance of power produces forms of movement that are mediated through exchange, and thus its real power is in the social. The form that  	we create and adopt has been around for a long time and will continue to be. But the power that comes with the performance of power is power itself, and new media and their audiences enable us to create new media capable of changing the landscape of how we live our lives. New media tell us what to think; old media tell us what to do; and while these narrations may have certain factual elements to them, they are ultimately mediated through social images and practices that manipulate our perceptions and behaviour via what Carolee Pagels term ‘media demons’.  	Pagels relays various forms of cultural cognition via the forms of image, audio and visual media that</text>

It is true that in the past communities with strong grassroots histories were often left behind in the game of social media, but in the age of the big data and metadata, this is increasingly difficult to reverse. 	The key is for people to start noticing. The more we raise money, the more we can do research, the more we can create spaces for people to come and engage with each other, the more we can engage with the city in ways that are authentic to us, and that are not influenced by the data that is collected and the that is made visible – the more we adopt practices that are traceable but cannot be taken for granted. 	When we first started the project in 2014, we had only the ambition to look at the data and make predictions.

But in the age of the smartphone and social media, the need to organise in ever greater detail is being drowned out by the need to consume ever more rapidly.  quickShipThe need to be visible, to have a voice, to be seen and by then making things happen is being drowned out by the need to consume ever more rapidly. When we witness the impact of climate change on our climate, our climate will be what it will become: more arid, less fertile, more unpredictable – just as the geologists predicted. But the impact will still be arid and unpredictable. There will be floods and bush wars and droughts and rising sea levels and all the other problems that come with a changing climate. And there will be many of those who will be desperate to leave the planet in any way they can. So the question becomes: how can we as a society try to adapt?

Social media has played a critical role in enabling this information-gathering, and has even become a means of connecting with others in the world outside your group. 	However, the power of symbolic exchange in the social web comes with a cost. As the internet and its platforms have become more and more powerful, so too has the need for more subtle forms of social organisation.

It’s not just that we need to find ways to document our lives, but that we need to find ways to document our lives in ways that are private, transient, and precarious, and that are ever-present, so that when we do have to confront our work, we can recognise it and rectify it.  	The main obstacle to this being a reality for many people is the contemporaneous condition: we’re all caught up in what we can find online, whether it’s the latest Marie Antoinette and Nicolas Sarkozy fashion shoot or the fact that Nicolas Sarkozy is still alive, despite having just become president. More important is the fact that the contemporary photographer is embedded in our very being, constantly scanning the web for the perfect subject, one to photograph but also the perfect place, one to photograph but also the perfect moment, one to put together a photo that perfectly represents the moment but</text>

So, despite our talk of community in the city as a site of collective practices, we actually live amidst communities of individuals. We are surrounded by people who are like us, who are making and living together in a way that is not always obvious, and who are engaging with the city in ways that are often quite different from our own. 	And these are just as valuable as the practices that emerge from the city as a site of people-centred, ‘how to be like us’ conversations. These kinds of practices lead to radically different kinds of people, and offer radically different ways of being in and through the world.  	  Being live-streamed, these actions require participants to be present; there is no</text>

It’s no longer enough to take photos in an urban setting; modern urban environments demand that you engage with the city through means of documentation, presence and narratives. How do we create creative alternatives to the urban context in which we live? The answer is to engage with the very fact of living in the urban environment in ways that create and facilitate new forms of social organisation. In doing so, we can create and further develop practices that become traceable and can be replicated in other contexts. 	In the case of cordon-and-dagger policing, for instance, which is increasingly common in areas of high crime and poverty in large metropolises such as Liverpool, Manchester and London, the photographer             must act with extreme care as his or her images can quickly spiral into a mythological narrative of hopelessness and violence in the urban environment. 	The importance of such photographers remains largely unspoken, but their work</text>

Not all forms of social transformation can be catalyzed by information; new media do have a role to play, but their primary potential is as a platform to make ideas known and implement them. 	The way in which we produce, consume and consume media today is extremely different from the way in which production and consumption was conducted in the past. Mass media began to take root in the urban centres around the turn of the twentieth century, and from the 1920s onwards, and from there spread out across the country as part of a daily rhythm. 	To understand how the mass media shaped and is shaped today, it is necessary to understand how media is produced and consumed. Mass media represents the increased use of information technologies and social networks in the society at large (and particularly in urban centres), and in particular the spread of technology in the form of media devices.

As technologies became more pervasive and available, so too did the need for less visible forms of social organisation. 	When most of us have access to a smartphone, Facebook or Twitter, our means of organising ourselves in urban environments become more visible. We become more visible by sharing, by becoming part of communities, by adopting practices that are informal but powerful, by forming coalitions with other people than in hierarchical or professional settings, by becoming visible at conferences, by organising ourselves into worker-owned cooperatives, etc.  	In an increasingly digital society, social media is still a fundamental part of our practice, but it is also a necessity for survival. The more we share, the more we are visible, the more we are online, the more we are familiar with each other, the more we are part of communities and so on. 	But in the age of the smartphone and social media, the limits of what can be done via text or social media are increasingly evident. Any text message or image can be represented as a sequence of numbers and letters, and thus a number, as a symbol. A Twitter feed, for example, can boast upwards of 9,000 ‘likes’ and ‘reposts’ per hour. And since many of us are far less visible than we used to be, the practice of becoming part of a community is also becoming increasingly elusive.

It is the ‘episodic’ in which new social engagements, economic engagements and migratory campaigns are encouraged but also contingency plans are devised to halt or slow down the bleeding that results from this ever-expanding human tourism business. 	The gambit is that of the ‘triangle of distrust’: where once a certain amount of trust was placed in a particular government, business, or other institutional entity, now it is the other way around: people are not to be trusted with critical information, and ‘institutional biases’ rule in favour of those institutions that need to be protected from critical information. This is the presumption of all forms of modern governance, from the ‘bottom up’ down to the very top. Modernity, then, is seen to be coming to terms with the fact that it no longer needs to rely on a central state to provide the goods and services of governance, as a means to an end other than the end of legitimising the institutions as ‘responsible custodians’.

It is the ‘episodic’ in which new social engagements, economic engagements and migratory campaigns are encouraged but also endangered if not mitigated. This is because the more we engage with the infrastructure that supports ‘ordinary’ life around the globe, the less we are able to draw upon the collective knowledge and skills of those engaged in creating the infrastructure itself. The more we invest in the art and decoration of infrastructure, the less we understand how that infrastructure supports life’s functions. Thus, the infrastructure – whether it is conceptual, physical, administrative or software – is one of the most challenging intellectual spaces to unravel the immense complexity of. The more we learn about it, the less we understand it. This is why art and architecture are so compelling to a visitor like yourself, and why cultural tourism is a form of cultural tourism in its own right. It is a form of cultural tourism in which the art and the architecture are the same thing in all contexts.

The epiphanies of today’s world occur along parallel tracks, but they are not at the same pace. The pace of information processing today is such that it is possible to publish a novel on the internet in less than an hour’s notice. The story has to be relevant to a specific geo-political situation, and the publishing will inevitably be based on an assumption of partisan or ideological leanings. Hence, if the author happens to be a Democrat, or at least is politically connected, or is well-connected, or is a woman, or is from a certain social stratum, or is of a certain race, etc, etc. Then the publishing will be quick and easy</text>

In other words, a museum is not a place to an end game but a place to a beginning. It is a place to a place where other kinds of museums are established, and to a place where new kinds of museums are eventually created.  terminusOf course, the museum is not the end game and its construction today is but a beginning in a wider social and cultural conjuncture. The museum is a construction, a temporality, a specific set of relations between people and objects, and as such it is constantly subject to change (changing its form and function, which in turn changes its users). The museum is a ‘place of habitation and symbolism’ and as such it participates in the signification of places, making them what they are not without making them what they are. In this way, the museum is part of a wider social and spatial conjuncture, making use of its position within these relations. However, the museum is also a site of potential destruction</text>

To some degree, the discussion of the architectural forms of advanced urbanisation is also a discourse of possible futures, though these are explicitly divided into those where and when a ‘postindustrial society’ is an option. 	In this analysis, the ‘episodic’ narrative – which follows a given set of predefined parameters – represents a future with certain characteristics or futures, and the ongoing tension between these parameters is a constant. In the ‘medium-term’ set of predefined parameters, the dynamics of globalisation and the cultural processes that generate it are clearly seen to be of an enflaming kind, and critical questions of infrastructure and culture are raised. The ‘episodic’ narrative is characterised by a series of brief encounters, encounters and epiphanies that occur in a given city or region over a specified time.

It is the ‘episodic’ in which new social engagements, economic engagements and migratory campaigns are encouraged but also explicitly ‘critical’ in their implementation. The criticality of contemporary modes of engagement and cultural capitals is premised on the notion that, at the center of the social is the question, and the social is the question only. Critique and critique of the social is possible only within the social. But the social itself is subject to the very real limits and politics of its own size and shape. So the dynamic that characterizes contemporary modes of cultural engagement is a form of cultural abortus, which is simultaneously political and terminally real. The social is constrained by the very definition of the social. But the social itself is ever-present, and its limits and politics are ever-present with it. The social is seen not only as subject to the social, but also as an object of the social: the very notion of the social is being continually redefined, whether through the social’s continually evolving definition via definitions of being, such as those proposed by AI and the new technological</text>

The biennial as a cultural form has become deeply embedded in the contemporary mode of cultural consumption, and is therefore both a carrier and a settler of technologies that constantly remind us of their presence but also of their possible perversity and destructiveness. It is evident that the archaeological and historical interest in the Mesopotamian period is not limited to the interested parties interested in the material forms of the past. The historical interest in the region includes the public, for example, which comes primarily from the West. In the case of the recent past, it comes primarily from China, and is therefore a particular ordering principle for the collection of materials and cultural material brought back from the sites. The archaeological and historical interest in the region is thus not necessarily a sign of a deteriorating cultural inter-connectionist relationship between the two main world powers, but a sign that there are other interests and motivations at play.3.

In other words, an AI might not just make great architecture but also aid in the art and architectural production of new social engagements and economic engagements, but it is equally possible that the work of archiving and documentation might become the work of machines. 	The use of archival materials and data sets is a growing field of research, but much of the focus in recent years has been on the construction of remotely sensed, contextualised data sets that can ­presence, decipher meaning from vast amounts of data and be used to map social space and human migratory movements.

It is composed of neighborhoods that were formerly part of Portugal, but now call themselves the Portuguese Quarter, the Portuguese Village, or the Portuguese Quarter. The neighborhood assemblies have been organising themselves into autonomous economic and social spheres, taking pride in the fact that they are not part of the Portuguese Empire. Many of the women who founded the neighborhood assemblies are active in the Portuguese Quarter’s community. The project, which has been very much a construction project, was originally going to be a neighborhood preserve, but the economic and social changes that have taken place in the neighborhood over the past decade have made it into a destination for expatriates.

Envisioned as a ‘platform from the ground up’, the P.A.P.M. was designed to be self-sufficient, capable of supporting an independent political and social agenda, and sovereign within its geography. In Lagos, Lagos State’s capital and largest city, the P.A.P.M. was met with worldwide publicity and sustained by a local following of taxi drivers, street performers, artists and others who patronized the city’s cultural excesses. The city became a cultural epicentre thanks to this transparent, low-cost staging for cultural activities. The P.A.P.M. was also a catalyst for a city-wide cultural revolution that transformed Lagos into a cultural centre, with</text>

There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why they abandoned them in the first place. And I’m particularly conscious of the work I do with young people, because their work is often seen as a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. My hope is that my work, and the projects I’ve undertaken with them, can open avenues of understanding and relate to the community.  	However, I also believe that what’s most needed is a strong network of collaborative artists and organisations that can both develop artists and help them become artists themselves, so that we can make things that are both aesthetically appealing and eminently practical for them to implement into their everyday lives. That would be the answer to my question: how do we build an infrastructure that can support creative action? Creative Action is a word that has come up a lot in discussions about FACT, and it’s a word that has a lot of connotations of unskilled labour, of course. It’s a notion</text>

There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why certain projects never happened, or why certain arts education programmes didn’t work. The fact that art is often seen as a revolutionary act is often down to the fact that the artist is someone new, or has a radically different approach to the world than the established artists. In the art world, the newness of an artist’s statement often times differs from the established artists’ take on the world. As an ART producer and artist, I’m constantly trying to find ways to introduce new artists to the art scene, and to engage them in questioning the art world’s assumptions and prejudices. For me, it’s important for new artists to have a place in an art context. If I don’t provide that context, or if the art I produce and deliver isn’t relevant to the concerns of the community, then the people who discover art will inevitably become disengaged from it, and will spend their time elsewhere.

There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why certain projects fell through. It’s because the project is real and the act of creating it is powerful. However, the structural reasons why certain projects fail to take off – the art isn’t always realised and/or developed fully – also affect the success of others. For instance, the social work I do as part of the Creative Time programme at Liverpool University, represents a very traditional art practice, but is also very social. When I first started, in 2015, there was a special focus on the project in the Artsacres, with artists from the programme contributing their artwork to the letter, and the project was invited to be part of the Creative Time programme for the second year in a row. The intention was to produce a mural with artwork from the programme that would be displayed in the Artsacres, as well as a series of portraits that would hang in the National Gallery, the Whitechapel Gallery and the Lever</text>

There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why, in the 1980s, there was no ticket to travel to Egypt. It’s not just that people who are members of a community don’t have access to the arts education programmes offered in schools; it’s that the arts education programmes that are offered in schools are also typically short lived, and run by curators who act as though they’re an arts department, and more importantly, a museum department. And so the tension between public and private art institutions arises. I can certainly understand why a community might want to see art that isn’t represented in the same way that other communities are represented. It’s not necessarily a problem with the art, because the art is seen as aesthetically neutral, but the tension that arises between public and private art institutions is a problem. In a sense, public and private institutions should work together to find solutions to the tension that arises between community and art. Here, the artist herself gives voice to the community</text>

There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why certain projects were put on hold, or why certain artists were put in other areas of the city. It’s because their works speak to a current situation. But this tendency towards realism is a dangerous tendency, because it gives the appearance of permanence, but it also lends itself to a particularised analysis, where ‘real life’ is pre-conceived and controlled. Social practice needs to foster a sense of wonderment and amazement, not in the sense of something that’s happened to you, but in the sense of something that’s yet to happen. Social practice needs to break open new possibilities for artistic and creative expression, and to see creative acts as possible. Creative activists need to understand that social practices are here to stay, and that there are long-term investments to be made in them.  	In the 1970s and 1980s, social experiments were put into motion in many parts of the world, and today there’s an</text>

I’m particularly interested in the way in which social practice, and particularly the work that I do as a facilitator of socials, is often seen as having a reactive, ‘visible’ character, and in that way social practice is often seen as having a static, ‘illusory’ character. I find this problematic on several levels. On the one hand, the art I produce and deliver has a tendency to stand out more in a community of people because, in the eyes of a community, it’s more real. There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why certain projects were put on hold, or why certain artists are no longer inviting people into their communities. The fact that the art is real and the social work is not real is often underestimated, and so is the power of the project.  On the other hand, when the art is ‘real’ and the social work is ‘illusory’ – and it is often these latter two that I work with artists and organisations that construct their bureaucracies around – then the art is often seen as a more powerful tool, and the social work is often seen as a less powerful tool.  This can happen with certain artist-led projects, for instance, when the social work is largely imagined and pre-conceived and the artist’s intentions are left largely unspoken. It’s also true that while social work can have a transformative effect, this power can grow stale and dependent on the project’s success, and so it’s often the</text>

There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why certain artists are always cited as having transformed the practice of archiving, or why Wimbledon Archive became a global phenomenon. The idea that art can be taken out of the equation and that the social is the organizing principle of art is often overdrawn. If the social is seen as an inherently violent and brutal organization, then artists will often engage in practices that are also, in part, designed to subvert and manipulate that dynamic. On the other hand, there’s a way in which the social can be seen as a necessary ingredient in a just society: in a society where everyone has a stake in the outcome, where everyone manages the allocation of resources and property, and where everyone has a say in how those resources are used. The social is seen as a pragmatic and sometimes even ideal solution to a difficult but necessary political (and sometimes economic) problem.  For me, then, the social is both necessary and not. It’s a political concept because it</text>

In so doing, it’s possible that the curatorial turn can be seen as a kind of bureaucratic snare. And these kinds of regulatory turns can and do happen. In the 1980s and 1990s there was a time when, as a writer, I would have preferred it if the work I produced in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis were seen as cynical and reactionary, and that when the next crisis struck we would all have to work ourselves into submission with trenchant critiques of the system we were born into. But these are the times we live in, and as a community we have to work through the trauma and come to understand that we are hurtling towards a future of even worse things. I don’t think the past is arbitrary or unknowable, but I do think that the way we organise ourselves and the way we live our lives radically affects how we look back at the future.

There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why, in the 1990s, the Tate Archives were so full of reflections on the privatisation of culture. The fact that the biennial has to have an art department full of artists produced through a grant from the Arts Council means that the art of the past is often seen as valuable in the context of neoliberalism. However, the interesting work I do as an artist and curatorial prodigy is rarely seen as a valuable contribution to the current social and political context – despite the fact that I use the art of the past to push back against systems that we tend to identify as our own. And this is an enormously valuable and fascinating skill to have. Such an appreciation is a result of the biennial’s own logic and the deep pockets that it relies on. Biennials are a production for neoliberalism, and their wealth is generated through the back production that they get from the state.

There’s a reason why the Archives at Tate are always full of reflections on the past public works programmes, or the reasons why they don’t visit the site of a social practice project. It’s because they’re present in a certain way, and thus impervious to change. This is particularly true of work done in collaboration with local groups, because the public sees collaboration as a static condition, not always taking place on the terms I envision. The public does not perceive the dynamic engagement that can be found in projects that are centrally staged, mega-exhibitions or mega-mural exhibitions, and it is therefore rare for projects of this sort to be developed or even continue if they are not already on the cutting edge of a new technological revolution. On the other hand, the art that is produced and delivered via the web and social media rarely has a distinctive character or distinctive trajectory, which makes it easier to identify and capture in one image or embed in one embeddable piece of content.

This introduces an important qualification to the public realm concept: while the public domain is the probable site of potential conflict, it is not necessarily private property. Contemporary artworks often perform multiple functions in this context. As Tate Modern art critic David Hoggart put it in 1989: ‘The public realm is capable of sustaining a diversity of expression, but it is a fluctuating and transient space that is exposed to the vagaries of changing market forces and trends.’ This exhibition was no exception. The public realm occupied a sharp shift from that of its early representation, when works in the galleries and the public squares were spaces in which artists could freely circulate their works and engage with audiences. Curators, artists and art historians began to pay attention to the power of the exhibitionary complex to shape cultural practices and behaviour. The development of the mass media and public perception of art during the 1990s led to a revaluation of cultural practices in the 1990s, and this, in turn, influenced changes in the legal and institutional frameworks. The adoption of codes of behaviour that regulate what is and is not allowed in the galleries and public squares was a watershed moment for the biennial, and new conceptions of the</text>

This introduces an important qualification to the public realm concept: while the public domain is the probable site of potential conflict, it is not necessarily private property. Contemporary artworks often perform multiple functions in this context. As James Howard Kunstler once wrote: ‘The contemporary artist’s interest is not in the objects that she produces, but in the invisible or intangible objects that she conceals behind the scenes, in the unseen or intangible complications that she creates.’ This postulates on the public realm presupposes a public that is both complicit in the production of these objects and unaware of their presence. If the 1990 Biennale is a forerunner, then the present exhibition is a descendant, although it is not necessarily a direct descendant, of a tradition that began in the mid-nineteenth century and continues to this day. When considering the biennale as an art form today, it is still relevant to point to the various ways in which contemporary art can be constituted in relation to the objects that we produce and the public realm that is co-committed to its consumption. There are works that are seemingly designed to be consumed, but are also works that deliberately seek to be produced. In</text>

The exhibition ‘Dead Poets Society’ brought together contemporary artists from various fields of art who worked in parallel. It was also a counterintuitive intervention for the Commission to commission a series of works from a single discipline, but in the final analysis it was not a series, but a single work. In this sense, the exhibition had several domes and circumferences, as well as many interlocutors. In the case of the poetics of identity, the exhibition was a disused building, but it was also an intervention into the urban/suburban situation, an act of cultural resistance. It is true that the poetics of identity became a major issue in the context of the 1990s, due to the proliferation of sub</text>

This introduces an important qualification to the public realm concept: while the public domain is the probable site of potential conflict, it is not necessarily private property. Contemporary artworks often perform multiple functions in this context. As a cultural artifact, they can act as billboards, billboards of sorts, enabling the exchange of information; as collateral for a financial investment, a piece of artwork can act as a new currency; as a means to an end (as in war), or in the case of non-traditional artists, a means to an end in a different context. The word ‘public domain’ conjures up images of old world monarchies and empires; in recent decades it has conjured up images of activist art. But while the public realm has some rights, notably those recognised by the Locke’s Bill of Rights, it is notoriously difficult to define precisely what those rights are. For example, the public realm does not recognise the right of way clearing, nor the right to take part in a public procession. Nor does it recognise citizens’ first amendment right to assembly. Nor does it recognise a citizen’s right to take part in a referendum. Finally, ‘the public realm�</text>

Contemporary artworks often perform multiple functions in this context. As a public art project, their primary purpose is to draw art collectors and artists to the city, but they also have a secondary, sometimes subversive function of influencing public opinion. In doing so, they are often accused of being anti-urban or postindustrial. These accusations are often used to justify or rationalise current urban development, but they also serve to dehumanise or deny the people who use the city as a site of commercial activity. As an object of commerce, the contemporary art fair has a particular ethno-politically charged function. It is used as a platform to promote an industry that exploits and exploits its citizens, or at least that exploits those citizens in ways that are not always ethically questionable. This kind of ethno-politicisation of the contemporary art fair is common in capitalist cities, and it is often assumed that the contemporary art fair is an extension of the city’s economic potential.

This introduces an important qualification to the public realm concept: while the public domain is the probable site of potential conflict, it is not necessarily private property. Contemporary artworks often perform multiple functions in this context. As the exhibition at Tate Britain suggested, they are often engaged with in a complex web of relationship with the city that is almost completely invisible from the city. Contemporary artworks often perform services for the city through their use of urban resources, and this relationship is often complex but relies on politics, economics and legal theory. The fact that the artworks are often commissioned by the city or a local authority is a particularly interesting element of the festival; in the 1990s, the artists were often asked to radically alter their show in order to make it relevant in a local area. The fact that the artworks often contain political and social critique is another. For many artists, the public realm concept was central to their practice. The concept may be of some use in the contemporary art world, but for many other artists and curators, the public realm does not exist and may even be contrary to their interests. This is especially true for those living in or visiting areas of the world where art is often viewed as an</text>

However, they may also be used as public platforms or as a backdrop for confrontational encounters with those who would deny the public sphere a rightful place. How these early interventions in the public sphere were to be employed as a counterweight to the established art market is a subject of much contention. Some contemporary artists, such as Damien Hirst, have attempted to re-appropriate H.G. Wells’ ideas of the public realm in their own unique ways. However, as we know from H.G. Wells’ own writings, the final arbiter of what is and is not in the public domain is the British Museum and not even the Metropolitan Museum of Art. So far as the Metropolitan Museum of Art is concerned, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is still the undisputed master. But what if the other institutions, including the British Museum, start to play catch up? What</text>

Contemporary artworks often perform multiple functions in this context. As a digital artifact capable of being assembled and distributed, they can be considered part of a 'race to the top' – a race to the highest-volume online platforms – while simultaneously serving as a counter. If these assertions are made, then the race to the top becomes a potential site of subversive activity. This ‘potential' has recently been supplemented by the aggressive deployment of data capture and processing, which seeks to extract ever greater amounts of data from platforms and users of networks. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the art of contemporary art has been conceptualised on the back of social media. While the ethical questions that arise in the context of such work still need to be debated, the speed of innovation and the fluidity of change that can be brought about through such technologies are fundamentally altering the social and political landscape of the public realm. It is not inconceivable that the ethical questions of the digital public realm will also have to be debated on the social. What is certain is that the ethical</text>

Contemporary artworks often perform multiple functions in this context. As a cultural property, they are often used to commission performances, exhibitions, installations, or sell products. As a site for the production of political, economic, or social change, the public realm is a site of potential conflict. This is particularly true in the digital age, where citizens are no longer confined to the status of passive consumers but are capable agents capable of active participation in cultural production and consumption. In these new digital media contexts, citizens have a place in which to take part in cultural production, but also to critique and critique’s progress. This is true in the sense that cultural production and consumption today is conducted largely via social media, where cultural goods and services are produced in large part through the aggregation of disparate online behaviours. Nevertheless, it is important to distinguish three key cultural-commercial narratives today: the dominant narrative of the dominant capitalist system; the current cultural take-on of the dominant market in which the artist is a star; and cultural beacons and social media beacons.</text>

As the technology of exhibitionality evolves, and the social function of the public realm becomes more complex, the definition of who has a right to enter and use a site will be constantly in flux. The public realm may be contested and contested, but its rightful place is firmly in the balance. This is an evolving area of art-historical and archival research, and a reason to be optimistic. In the coming years, we can expect to see more and better work showcased in venues that are responsive to the needs and interests of the communities where art is produced and experienced. In the meantime, we may observe that recent exhibitions have been about developing strategies for how to engage with contemporary artworks and the practices that produce them, rather than in the tradition of the public realm that they are intended to honor.This scenario is also possible if the public realm is digitally mediated – that is, if the mainstreaming of art online produces a new generation of artists who are more open to engaging with sites of art and</text>

The Urdu ‘queens’ derives from the root word ‘Urdhva’, which in turn derives from the root word ‘Punjabi’. Urdu’s feminine stem ‘Urdu’ means ‘queen’ and Hindi’s root ‘Hindi’ means ‘woman’. Thus, the root of ‘Urdu’ and ‘Punjabi’ comes to mind when thinking</text>

The more obvious and intuitive the system is to use, the less it has to learn. This is the dialectic of artificial intelligence and it is a crucial piece of the overall system ‘building blocks’ that allow the system to learn and to question itself.  The dialectic also illustrates two things. The first one is that systems evolve in parallel but they are far more flexible and adaptable. The second one is that power structures that control how systems operate – bureaucracies and their modules – tend to dominate and govern systems in parallel but resist change and new ideas. This is why bureaucracies are slow to change and so resistant to new ways of working. New ideas and infrastructures built on top of them tend to be stable and efficient but they inevitably lag behind in terms of what is perceived as human needs and freedoms. This is particularly true in the context of a globalised and interconnected world. On the one hand we see the emergence of new infrastructures built on top of old ‘bullets’ but on the other we also see</text>

This is the dialectic of artificial intelligence and it is a crucial piece of the overall system ‘building blocks’ that allow the system to learn and to question itself.  The dialectic also allows us to see how the different layers fit together to make up a larger whole. For instance, when you put a pie in a ramekin, you can imagine how the different layers would interlock to form a pie, and how the pie would end up inside the pie. This type of analogy is often used in education circles but I would argue that it is crucial for system designers to understand how the dialectic of dialects works. When you break it down into pieces, you see how the different layers fit together to form a whole. For instance, when we learn how to drive a car, we learn how to turn a knob, but we also know how to turn a lightbulb, a radio or a streetlight. These are examples of dialects, but</text>

This is the dialectic of artificial intelligence and it is a crucial piece of the overall system ‘building blocks’ that allow the system to learn and to question itself.  One can ask whether a given dialect needs to be taught to another; one can ask whether a given construct is inherent to a given language; one can ask what ‘universal grammar’ might be possible in the future. The possibilities are endless and the questions too numerous to answer.  One can also ask whether a given system or dialect of languages is actually necessary in the first place – and this is just as important when considering a universal system as when considering an individual language. Asking such questions about a system or dialect can shed new light on old questions and shed new light on old questions in ways that are both clear and difficult. For instance, one can ask whether it is necessary for an individual to understand all possible paths that language can take in the future; or, alternatively, whether it is</text>

In a recent conversation, I asked him what he thought the role of a language designer should be.  The answer:  I don’t know. I don’t know what that would mean. I don’t know what that would mean in the future.  But I do know this: I think that in the near term, we’re all stakeholders in the success or failure of the system we develop. And if the system doesn’t work out? We’re all left with a mess. Who knows what that mess would look like? Languages do have dialects. As humans, we have a shared shared set of inherited linguistic traits: we have inherited a ‘native’ tongue. But we also share a set of differences that make up</text>

This is the dialectic of artificial intelligence and it is a crucial piece of the overall system ‘building blocks’ that allow the system to learn and to question itself.  The dialectic also creates an opportunity for the public to weigh in. The more versatile the language is, the more possibilities there are for the public to contribute meaning and vocabulary to the system. As more people become fluent in the system, the more natural language processing becomes possible, the more likely it is for the system to fall prey to human error. In the future, this could mean the loss of information or the misuse of resources.  Ultimately, the dialectic needs to be continually iterated in order to allow the full potential of the underlying systems to be realised. This is why computer systems are so fragile and why they break down – because they cannot expand or contract at will.  The dialectic also opens up opportunities for collaboration and communication between humans and machines. This could mean anything from collaborating with</text>
