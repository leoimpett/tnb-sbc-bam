She cites the photograph of a classroom in Peshawar, Pakistan, where a young girl, sitting cross-legged, a book by her shy, bare-chested teacher, is reading silently on a crowded school bus. The girl, sitting cross-legged, is a virtual portrait of intellectual detachment. In the photograph, the teacher is engaged in a quiet, reflective exercise in language. In the classroom, the two teachers, sharing an identical reading assignment, are engaged in a playful tussle for primacy over a student’s reading of a given passage.</text>

We spoke about her new work, Scared Straight, at the Barbican Art Gallery in London.The Scared Straight project is a new way of thinking about the cultural consequences of new technology and the urbanisation of the future. It involves research-based creative activities that draw on the archives, present and past of the technology; on-site visits to archives and specialist museums; and considers the connected but separate effects of new media and how they create distinct perception of places and people. This research and curatorial approach is important in the context of the technological revolution, where art and culture are frequently compared to the trajectory of a sudden internet connection.

Her work has also been shown at the Venice Biennale, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery.She has a unique approach to artists’ public engagements that are ostensibly about making art but can also happen when she is engaged in other creative activities. Her interest in the public realm arises from an understanding of how art is produced and sustained through the work of many artists, and how this relates to the civic engagement that is needed in order to sustain artistic outputs. She emphasises the fact that we do not produce enough art and that many other creative activities are possible through the shared resources of the community. She encourages collaboration and exchange between artists and communities, and encourages it through her work as a catalyst for action. Her interest is in the production of art and the practices that enable it to be produced, and how to engage communities in the production of art in ways that are not reductive or exclusive to a particular set of cultural interests.

When constructing the building, the project begins to look like an act of return – a mode of travel that draws on the object as a material substrate and object as a figurative template. Her collection of 200 objects represents a return to her childhood home in the Bronx, New York, but her interest in the collection comes from the memory of the collection as a whole. Her collection of objects is a final document – a sort of ‘final history’ that documents the history of the collection as a whole, a sort of ‘final language’ that documents the language of the collection.In her essay ‘Founding Documents’ (2015), Julian Barnes, an anthropologist at Columbia University, documents the ways in which early documentation comes to capture and encapsulate the story of the historical place and time of the encounter between the anthropologist John Graham Kerr and Jeanette Peters, the journalist. Barnes, a specialist in archival forms, materials and media, describes how the collection of objects – which he calls ‘the contemporaneous condition’ – comes to be read as a kind of ‘fugitive’</text>

When constructing the building, the project begins to look like an act of return – a mode of travel that draws on the object as a material and embodied template. For Unravelled, the objects emerge not as artifacts of history, but as objects that can be repurposed to meet the needs of a radically reimagined urban future. This is a reflection of an increasingly globalised and urbanised society: in a world where information is power, the future object represents the past in the present; and where art is just another commodity, there is no longer any separation between the past and the present.  	Looking back, the curators at the Venice Biennale might reflect on the curatorial choices that they or one of them might make today, or in ten years when they are still alive, in a world where architects and designers are no longer drawn to be avant-garde purveyors of destruction but instead to be part of a social enterprise engaged in the long-term conservation of the urban landscape.

In the collection, the building is both a metaphor and a challenge. It is a repetition, a point of departure, and a destination. When constructing the building, the project begins to look like an act of return – a mode of travel that draws on the object as a material covering and building block, constructing a narrative of discovery across both historical and contemporary material. She calls this ‘material imaginary’. The collection not only includes objects from her father’s and her mother’s periods, but also objects from postcolonial or settler periods, or pre-capitalist eras, such as the Roman or early modern period. Her interest in time and material is a recurring theme in her work, and it is this recurrent materialist tendency that underlies her fascination for archaeology and for travel. Her fascination for material objects comes through her interactions with people: her interest is in the ways in which people organise and represent life experiences; in turn, travel comes through a material narrative that makes possible the organisation of labour and the making of objects out of thin air. Her interest in labour comes through both her work as an artist and her research, which often takes the form of a documentary. Her interest in the material aspects of life (including her own work) comes</text>

When constructing the building, the project begins to look like an act of return – a mode of travel that draws on the object as a material and aesthetic foundation, while simultaneously addressing the hidden histories and social practices that exist within that object. This is a very different kind of travel, and one that we would not want to be associated with. oreAndUltimately, the collection becomes what it is – a collection of objects – and how we define the terms and parameters of the collection. What makes the collection unique is that it is a mapping of social, economic and political history, placing particular attention on the roles of indigenous people in particular historical episodes. While the individual objects may be of interest to archaeologists, their value lies in their capacity as building blocks in a larger social and economic system. The value of an artefact like a pottery vessel or metal object like a hammer lies not so much in its ability to be used but in its capacity as a building material and a means of linking different social sectors and cultures. In this sense, the collection as a whole is able to take on new functions and expand its range of economic, political and</text>

Unravelled is a project about the return of lost histories, but it is also a project about the construction of new ones. She does not pretend to have knowledge of every possible context, but she does claim to have visited every possible place, from Buenos Aires to Liverpool, and from New York to Kiev. Her claim to fame is that she has a collection of 200 objects. A claim that is unshakeable, but which is also untenable in the face of the overwhelming amount of documentation, archaeological and historical evidence to suggest otherwise.Unravelled is a retelling of the Rosie Cooper story, this time with Aboriginal voices. The story is told through personal stories of discovery and archiving, a mode of narration that is characterised by pauses and turns, punctum and brevity, and a collective take-off. The narrative unfolds in three parts, each told through the combination of oral traditions, maps, curiosities and objects found</text>

This repetition, the object as material and institutional template, provides the framework through which she imagines a ‘different kind of history’.2. Artist-organisation – the artist-state and the artist-individual With the artist-state in mind, Kuhn makes an interesting distinction. She sees the state as an abstraction, but also sees the potential for the individual to wrest control of an abstraction. Thus, the state is both possible and undesirable, but the state is also an abstraction that can never truly be taken. Kuhn sees this as an opportunity, and she takes it on board, executing her father’s project in an ambitious way. As an artist, she collaborates with the state in many ways, leading in particular projects such as her father’s art installation in the California State Capitol, leading the California Highway Patrol in a project that involved tracking down and shooting elephants in Zimbabwe, and so forth. All of these projects are framed</text>

When constructing the building, the project begins to look like an act of return – a mode of travel that draws on the object as a material and physical remnant of a past that exists in the present. Her collection of objects serves as both a source of material and a subject of memory. Her objects function as both objects and memory, and their assemblage, their patterns and their fragments – fragments that she assembles into buildings, into worlds, into cultures – functions as a form of archiving and a mode of inhabitation. Her collection of objects represents the paradox of the contemporary accumulation of things: there is so much stuff, and yet such little storage or retrieval. And yet this accumulation is also a form of reproduction, a form of what she calls ‘living memory’ that she says is a legacy of the economic precarity of the twentieth century.Her collection of objects represents a form of memory that is both ephemeral (its exact form is unknowable) and permanent (its content is unknowable). It is a permanent record of things that have happened, a set of skills that someone – perhaps us – has learned</text>

In her own words: ‘Archive and rediscover the past are the first reflections of a project that is a second act that unfolds from the rediscovery of materials and traces of organisation in the aftermath of resource crises.’[3]The rediscovery of materials and traces of organisation in the aftermath of resource crises – this is the thinking behind new age thinking and the postcolonial/hispanics gaze. It is the lineage of Neolithic knowledge, which James Howard Kunstler, in his book Empires and Replicas, documents in the emergence of craftspersonly skills around tools, tools with names such as 'gutwort-o-wort' and 'hemp' and their use in the production of rope, twine, belts, sickles, pulleys, pulleys and pulleys parts, pulleys with names such as ‘Purl Sennett’s’ Hitch Pulleys, used</text>

Her project ‘Unravelled’ draws on a collection of 200 objects that she found while researching archiving a lost family history. These include objects from her father’s collection from the 1950s; from her mother’s collection from the 1960s; and from a collection of Aboriginal art she discovered while researching the First Nations in Canada.The collection is a pastiche, a collection of disparate materials that come together to form a single building block – a concept that is central to her thinking. In the collection, the building is both a metaphor and a challenge. It is a repetition, a point of departure, and a destination. When constructing the building, the project begins to look like an act of return – a mode of travel that draws on the object as a material substrate, and which helps to reconcile the contradictory information that is embedded in the collection. Unravelled relies on the repetition of an endless loop, on the object as a form of accumulation. This accumulation is enacted through the act of archiving, which feeds back into the collection through what is colloquially referred to as the ‘collective memory’. In her own words:  One can also consider the archiving of time itself as a phenomenon that has a number of dimensions. This is one of the contributions of the new ‘material base’ to the analysis of a materiality that is both material and immaterial: the building is both a physical manifestation of the collectivity as a whole, and a collective memory.2  Archive and Reflection, 2015.

When constructing the building, the project begins to look like an act of return – a mode of travel that draws on the object as a material substrate and turns its shape into symbolic meaning. The repeated use of the term ‘building’ signals a beginning that implies a conflictual resolution. The collection of objects at the centre of her project then descends into a ‘whitening’ – a process whereby the collection is represented as a collection of discrete building units – a mode of representation that is as politically complex as its visual contents. The collection, like the self, becomes multivalent, and its divisions become part of a dynamic interpenetration between contemporary art, political economy and politics, history and environmental considerations. The collection is a site of resistance.The collection is a powerful metaphor for the social totality, and the contemporary artist as a collector. As a collector, she is interested in the ways in which art can function as a social mobiliser, a site of resistance, and a home for possibility. She knows how art can function in a multitude of other contexts, but she is particularly interested in art that operates</text>

Many argue that the increased population, related factors and fragmented market contributed to the housing market crash, but few have considered how the increasing number of professionals, managers, developers and others (including large international real estate firms) contributed to the increase in profit margins and shareholder value.

It is a place where politics, nationalism and aesthetic sensibility are deeply embedded in the social fabric of the biennial. It produces contemporary art that is both socially aware (through the engagement of artists with the biennial’s political and marginalisation narrative), and politically aware (through the production of contemporary art that addresses these histories and complexities). The biennial is a ‘present’ cultural production that is mediated through the ‘past’. It is a production that is fully aware of its socio-political context and position, and which engages with these embedded systems of domination and oppression through multiple modus operandi strategies.

The biennial is a site for the production of both contemporary art and ethno-cultural ethno-political theatre. It produces contemporary art that is both socially engaged (through participation in art-historical and typological categories), politically aware (through understanding that art is a cultural product of the contemporary condition), and aesthetically interesting (through its incorporation of technology and social media into the art-historical and typological categories). It promotes dialogue with other cultural sectors, seeking to uncover common ground and resolving differences through research and discovery. The biennial as an event is a site for the production of cultural and social change in the contemporary world through the symbolic exchange of space and time. It produces art through the socio-cultural production of the present in such a way that it can be shared and adopted by the public and often the former. This is done through the production of ‘events’ and the emergence of new ways of thinking about ‘presentism’ and the social production of space and time.

Here, the producer and consumptive user of art is placed in a situation of conflict between the forces of history and the forces of change that are producing ever greater amounts of noise and complexity in the urban environment. This dynamic can generate unexpected ‘potentialities’ for both the artist and the public. For some artists, this dynamic can even be a source of great pleasure and art. The biennial</text>

The biennial is a site for the production of both contemporary art and ethno-cultural ethno-political theatre. It produces contemporary art that is both socially engaged (through participation in art and culture), aesthetically interesting (through its incorporation of symbolic information), and is a site for the production of ‘potential future art’ through ‘potential futures’. This latter form could either be foreseen and controlled (like in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-four), or possible at the same time (like in the short story ‘Space Oddity’ by Ted Chiang). In both literary and fictional forms, social change is often explicitly stated as opposed to aesthetically pursued aestheticisms of change. How artists are trained to respond to contemporary art and ethno-cultural contexts is a site of contention. As biennials have become more institutionalised, and as a result become more like places – places of commerce, cultural centres, educational resorts, exhibitionary venues, and social gathering points – their historically spatial and temporal characteristics are increasingly questionable. Social change, it seems to me, is more important than ever.  The Biennial as</text>

The biennial is a site for the production of both contemporary art and ethno-cultural ethno-political theatre. It produces contemporary art that is both socially engaged (through participation in exhibitions and events), aesthetically interesting (through the use of graphic ephemera and sound installations), and is both geopolitically aware (through a globalised and interconnected urbanisation) and geopolitically aware (through the use of data analytics). It produces art that is not confined to a particular location or social context, but also art that is not confined to that particular spot or spot. For instance, the biennial may be interested in other aspects of its subject matter, and may engage in collaborative research programmes with other art institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) around the world.  One can also consider the fact that the biennial is a relatively new concept, and that its founding generation were artists rather than curators.

It produces contemporary art that is both socially engaged (through participation in the business of art), aesthetically interesting (through participation in the art of making art), and is a product of the past (through the production of artefacts that can be used in future curatorial works). How do we think about the production of art today in these new curatorial ways? What are the archetypes of the contemporary biennial, and how do we create them? What are the antecedents of the biennial today? What are its future prospects? These questions and more were discussed at the 2017 ACM Symposium on Biennials, Cities and Cultures, held in collaboration with The Cultural Capital Institute at UCLA.Joasia KrysaLara Favaretto, &quot;The Beatles: Rock'nRolla,&quot; John Lennon and Ringo Starr, with lyrics by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, with John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and Yoko Ono Lennon and Yoko Ono, with lyrics by Yoko Ono, performed by The Beatles, John Lennon and</text>
    <text>future curatorial forms. ‘Thinking curators’, as David Slater has it, need to be able to respond to the changes that nature makes to the biennial, but also to cope with the contradictions and conflicts that nature presents. The biennial, as an entity and as an ever-present historical document, is a major place where we can find these contradictions and tensions in real life, in the here and now. Through a series of infrastructural projects undertaken as part of the biennial’scuratorial fort, art is produced that is both socially engaged (through works that address the social aspects of the exhibitionary form), aesthetically interesting (through interventions such as installation and public function), and is a gesture towards the social relations that art can exert through the symbolic exchange of space and time. The biennial is a site for the production of both contemporary art and ethno-cultural ethno-political theatre. It produces contemporary art that is both socially engaged (through participation in art is cultural practice) and ethno-cultural in its own right. It establishes and maintains a relationship with communities through participation in their art, its sites and their history. It produces art that is both accessible and transfixing in its repetition, and art that is both deeply embedded in and beyond the sites where it is exhibited. And it does all of this in a city, a community, a suburb or even an island – the geographical limits of which are usually defined by its proximity to a port or harbour. However, in the modern era, the biennial has increasingly come to represent a multidisciplinary, global curatorial fantasy, where participation in art is confined to a defined set of artists and a curated list of curators. The biennial has become a site for the production of both contemporary art and ethno-cultural products of no particular particular relevance to the city in which it is located (for more information, see my book Worlds Apart: The Art Biennial Cycle).

The biennial is a site for the production of both contemporary art and ethno-cultural ethno-political theatre. It produces contemporary art that is both socially engaged (through participation in culturally responsive art programs), aesthetically interesting (through the construction of culturally responsive artworks), and is a cultural form through which contemporary art and ethno-cultural ethno-political theatre can be made possible. The biennial is a site for the production of art and aesthetics that are not reducible to aesthetic considerations and that engage with contemporary social, economic and political situations. It produces art that is not confined to a particular site, within a particular site and within a particular culture. It produces art of a certain kind of world, including things that are not necessarily beautiful or desirable or even possible within that world. It is a cognitive and/or affective production. It is art not necessarily of the aesthetic sense, but art that is conscious, purposeful, purposeful and that achieves aesthetic outcomes through some form of symbolic or tacit social negotiation. It is art that is socially engaged, and works through symbolic means. It is art that is culturally responsive, and works through its cultural form, but</text>

The biennial is a site for the production of both contemporary art and ethno-cultural ethno-political theatre. It produces contemporary art that is both socially engaged (through participation in art-historical and ephemera-based works), aesthetically interesting (through its incorporation of cultural resources), and more generally geopolitically aware (through its observations and infrastructural models). It engages with geopolitics through observations on the related field of culture and its effect on its inhabitants. These observations are made in ‘the museum’ by contributing curators to the research project The Museum Frontier, undertaken by Liverpool John Moores University, the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the European Graduate School, as well as the European Graduate School’s research project The Contemporary Condition. These curatorial actions are mutually dependent, and the relationship between the curatorial and the museum is not absolute, but depends on the context, the institutions, and the politics of the museum. The biennial can either produce the conditions for an artistic and socially engaged context, or it can neglect such conditions and engage in other curatorial practices.

It produces contemporary art that is both socially engaged (through participation in the monsoons of art), aesthetically interesting (through its involvement in the cultural tourism industry), and is geopolitically astute (throughits strategic engagement with the use of space and time). It requires no prior curatorial approval and can therefore be geo-politically responsive. The biennial form has its own set of rules and conditions, and it is this ambiguity that allows the biennial to function in a complex set of interrelated but distinct ways. The ambiguities inherent in the biennial form mean that artworks needn’t be placed in museums; they can instead reside in fairs, raffles, free zones, and be taken out for ‘choreography and fun’ on mobile devices. Also, artworks can reside in ‘places of exchange’ in ‘distributed communities’ and ‘underground' informal ‘tourism industries’. All these ways of constituting the biennial form arise from the</text>

I once did a job in a refugee camp in Austria. I had just finished a residency at MoMA, so it was a very strange but fascinating point in my career. I had just finished a residency when the Bosnian Muslims attacked, and I was suddenly accused of being from Bosnia. I had never even heard of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. When I went to MoMA in 2012, I thought I’d been invited because I was a curator there. I never imagined that I would still be living in the city, six years later, four years after the event. It’s really interesting for a curatorial person to be in a situation like that. I’m curious about how the event in question affected your curatorial approach.DD: It did – it changed the way you approached things. I think the thing that kept coming back to me was how you’d never really felt like you had a project for people to engage with. You had this notion</text>

I once did a small residency in Liverpool, and the documentary really captures how that felt. The biennial as an institution is able to represent itself as something that it is not, and how that impacts its relationship to the city. It’s a very powerful tool.DD: It seems that the biennial as an experience has changed a great deal in the past thirty years. There’s a question mark hanging over it because there’s so much energy and emotion that goes into it, but the biennial itself is able to say whether or not it’s experiencing a reorientation of resources. There’s a question of whether the biennial is a ‘permanent fixture’ or whether it needs to be constantly (re)located and relocalised. I think that there is a tension there between the ability of the biennial to capture its historical significance (like the museum or a large permanent collection) and the need to simultaneously maximise the life-cycle</text>

I once did a set piece for a friend that was part of a commissioning company that was doing a project in Liverpool. I went in as an artist and said, ‘Fuck it, I’m an artist and this is what I do.’ It’s a big risk for an artist to put your identity and the work you do at risk. You don’t want to be able to say, ‘Fuck it, I’m an artist and I’m going to be hurt by this.’ But you have to understand that what you do is artist’s work, and you have to take responsibility for it. If it’s not done with the consent of the artist then it’s not done with the artist.DD: Do you think there is a danger in the way we conceptualise the role of art and culture in the 21st century? That there is an increased commodification of culture, and that artists are less</text>

I once did a biennial in Berlin and it’s very easy for an artist to become complacent and forget what it takes to be a part of a real community. There’s a difference between being an observer and being a participant, and the biennial is the latter. I find fascinating how artists are able to create their own community. I remember, for example, the artist Rashid Khalidi was able to start a dance group called The Jamsil Circle. They’re powerful.DD: Do you think there is a difference between the biennial and the large-scale urban event, such as the Liverpool Biennial? You said that the biennial is an occasion that demands a sustained engagement, and you have to be able to regenerate it in new ways. What is it about this particular biennial that you relish in creating a continuous narrative? That’s what I love about it: the ability to say, over and over, that this is a story that we</text>

I once did a piece for the New York Times about my experiences as an artist in East Timor, and Timor was one of the places I went to in order to actually do work. I was in the pop-up cave. The public was really present and engaged. I brought out the politics of the place and the place’s politics, and it was really about the impact that art can have on the political process. I felt very much like an outsider in that context, not fully part of the system, so I felt completely excluded and invisible. But the underlying message was clear – we’re all living in this moment because we’re all artists and we’re all artists with this project.DD: That project had a sort of activist political context too. You were actively involved in the project from the beginning, and you created a kind of grassroots movement that was very much about being able to express yourself and being able to change the world. Is that still the case?</text>

I once did a series of self-portraits – very 1970s – which are very moving and personal. I thought, ‘Fuck, this is happening to me.’ It’s a very powerful moment.I also worked with a local organisation called the Arts Council, whose work you can see in the new wave films of that era – they’re part of the gallery circuit, they have a great relationship with the Tate, and the film festival circuit. They put on an amazing exhibition in Liverpool, and they did an amazing job of organising a series of performances in the town. Does the fact that artists can't really connect with what’s happening to them impact their work?DD: Absolutely. I remember, when I first started, I thought, ‘Fuck, this is happening to me.’ I was living in a bubble, detached from the real world. I didn’t see it. I didn’t experience it. I had no idea.</text>

I once did a set piece for a charity event where the artist was asked to create a scene in Liverpool and New York. I was thinking about the fact that WorkSafe was set in Liverpool and I realised how important it is for an artist to be able to inhabit places and people that are part of the city that are ‘home’ – ‘home’ is the operative concept here. I didn’t want to do it because I thought it was sacrilegious, but the fact that I was working with an organisation in New York that was literally trying to destroy its own city made me realise how much of an impact that culture can have. There’s a kind of biblical narrative that’s being told in the media right now about the conflict in Syria: Liverpool is part of it. I couldn’t be more opposed to that narrative. You’re absolutely right that I did in fact inhabit the city. But that was just to get a rise out of</text>

I once did a set piece for a ceramics company called  	Working Class Hero. The company was very interested in the idea of an artist being able to come to terms with the fact that she is making a work that is going to be worn by people in the workplace. They wanted to do research into what an impact that might have. I said, ‘Yes, I’m aware of the cultural significance of this. We’re making a sculpture that is going to be worn by people in the workplace – not just by the art world – but by the broader public. And the reason is that the impact that an art world can have on the culture of a neighbourhood is enormous. It’s almost as though the art world is trying to take over the neighbourhood. But the fact of the art being made in that neighbourhood is of course going to be very different from the impact that an artist can have on that particular art.DD: There is a tension there between the idea</text>

I once did a biennial for PBS called The Public Theater. We actually had to have a reception at the museum where the artists and the public were segregated. The biennial was about engagement and in-depth studies of art and society. The public was asked what they thought the biennial should be. I said it had to be a provocation and an intervention into the city in some way. So the art institution was able to come to terms with something that is happening to it, without being seen as some kind of outsider.DD: You have to be able to connect with the people you’re working with. I remember you saying that artists have a sort of political conscience. Are there things they’ve said that are not necessarily going to fly with the next generation of artists? Also, there are people in the art institution who may not want to be associated with things they’ve done in the past, because they’ve found a way to connect with the political notion of the crisis</text>

I once did a commissioned project for a Chinese company called Ledian Real Estate. They wanted to do a project in Liverpool, and I said, ‘No. We’re doing this project in Beijing.’ The connection was so clear. The narrative (in) that project was very clear. For me, there was a place in there for people to be able to be vulnerable and to be vulnerable in a different way. I don’t think that was the place for that story to go.I don’t think that there is a place for that story in the Liverpool Biennial. When I saw the script, it just didn’t seem real. There was a disconnect there – like the artist who came to visit once wrote to me: ‘You have to know the difference between a joke and a threat.’ I’m not sure that I did.I still remember vividly the day I received the script, when I opened it up and found out that</text>

[ii] The Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘immersive reality’ as follows: 	[…] an imaginative or artistic state of being, espoused in art  	programs as a possible future for art and visual culture. Immersive reality is one where perception is enhanced through the act of making and in which perception is not restricted to physical or virtual means. Rather, it embraces all aspects of experience, and perception in this sense … is encompassed within the ‘form’ of an object (…) and thereby extends to experience ‘even if it is not there’.[11] This definition clearly distinguishes immersive from physical and virtual, and suggests a possible understanding of the future form of cultural practices through its interaction with the present and the present, although it is important to note that this interpretation of ‘immersive reality’ is not confined to art programs or artists who develop their practices as immersive experiences, but is applicable to all levels of the social and cultural infrastructure of the future.

For Dhawan and his team, this included not only the objects themselves, but also the systems that enabled their production and consumption – the ‘material world’ as a ‘manufacturing of consciousness’. These included circuitry, software, data and network technologies that enabled the creation of virtual and augmented realities, as well as consciousness-producing practices such as virtual reality.[11] Practical and theoretical considerations, including those related to the role of the global economy in shaping the future, influenced their research and development.

Everyone experiences it differently. Will says that she can ‘see’ things that no mortal can perceive; that is, she perceives things that are ‘real’ and not ‘supposed’ to be so. But this perception, she says, is ‘illusory’ and leads to things that are not real … not in a literal sense, but by way of a conceptual conceit, where things that are not real are meant to be found.][11] See Willoughby, ‘Illusions of Realism’, in Willoughby &amp; Willoughby, pp. 21–25.  </text>

The project calls for a ‘bridge to the past’, one that incorporates both architectural styles of the pre-industrial past. The exhibition is divided into three parts: one for each of the three national parks where the project is located, and the final part for visitors to a nearby mountain passageway.

The project proposes an alternative future for the area if it is not pre-occupied with the problems of the present. In this alternative, the future is a garden with a border. The crossing of the Austrian-Hungarian border into Bosnia-Herzegovina is accomplished by a series of self-built crossings along the Trans-Siberian Railway (TSR). The crossings were all undertaken by a group of local citizens who organized themselves into teams and worked together to construct a series of shelters, some of which were as ingenious as they were functional. While the shelters worked, they also acted as rudimentary communication links for the migrants attempting to reach the Hungarian border. When the shelters were all taken down and replaced with new structures, the migrants who had set up cross-border networks also began to be determented by the construction of new structures further downstream. By the time the structures were finished, the number of stranded migrants had nearly doubled. In an attempt to stem the inflow of migrants, the project called for a halt to construction in Bosnia-Herzegovina until the refugees could be relocated to other European Union member states. In an attempt to absorb the newly arrived populations,</text>

The crossing of the Hungarian and Austrian borders is no longer an object of pilgrimage; it is a no-go zone. In an attempt to retain the façade of scientific objectivity, the Hungarian and Austrian governments have recently attempted to create a new kind of state-sponsored think-tank, the Austrian Policy for a New European Imagination (AUPEN), dedicated to the reconfiguration of the European Union and the future of the former imperial territories. If successful, this plan could well change the nature of the biennale from an imperial one to one dominated by nationalistic narratives. If unsuccessful, the architects may choose to return to the drawing board and embark on another project of national regeneration in the region. Regardless of the outcome of these attempts, the biennale must confront the fact that the social and political transformation required to support an ideological radical said to be in vogue in the region is itself an issue of no return.

The exhibition is divided into three parts: one for each of the three national parks where the project is located, and the final part for visitors to a nearby mountain passageway. The design concept is based on a ‘bridge to the past’, a physical manifestation of the idea that both the present and the past can be repurposed. The final part of the exhibition, where the architectural plans are dismantled and the plans of the failed projects are left behind, represents a more philosophical approach to the problem. The project proposes an alternative future for the area if it is not pre-occupied with the problems of the present. In this alternative, the future is a garden with a border. The crossing of the ÖBB (Austrian-Hungarian) river represents the end of an era for many. The river has played an essential role in the development of the empire of Austria-Hungary, as well as in the development of modern-day western civilization. However, the river has also played an essential role in the development of capitalist modernity. The development of the Austro-Hungarian empire was supported by a complex web of transnational networks of finance capital, which in turn relied on the relative safety of rail and the relative immobility of capital in the face of disruptive forces such as the infectious diseases that they were collectively responsible for creating. The development of the Austro-Hungarian state depended on a steady stream of migrants fleeing the violence and anarchy of the civil warring between the empires of Austria and Hungary. In the wake of these upheavals, which frequently devolved into civil war, large parts of the empire were either destroyed or completely transformed – from being swathes of</text>

The project proposes an alternative future for the area if it is not pre-occupied with the problems of the present. In this alternative, the future is a garden with a border. The crossing of the Hungarian-Austrian border into Austria is dangerous and the historical Junipero Serra do Sul (1324–70) is considered by many to be the father of the modern border. The exhibition ‘Toward a History of Monuments’ marks the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. The architectural plans for the ‘bridge to the past’ are a final report of the actions of the Hungarian and Austrian governments in response to the migrant crisis. The project looks to the future, wondering what might be possible if the past were not so present and contemporary. The building, the river and the buildings that comprise the Austrian-Hungarian border are part of a much larger historical narrative that includes the expulsion and capture of large numbers of people during the First World War. As the borders of the former Austro-Hungarian realm are erased, a new historical narrative begins to take shape. This is also the case for the structures that make up the present-</text>

The crossing of the Hungarian-Austrian border every day exposes Hungarians and Austrians to huge numbers of migrants, many of whom are desperate to reach the other side of the border and drown their sorrows in the river Belka. The crossing of the Austrian-Macedonian border every day is another form of transnational migrant crisis. The daily stream of migrants attempting to reach the other side of the Austrian-Macedonian border is a form of art, a ‘tactical] border check’. It is a reminder that despite the efforts of the state and the multinational corporations that construct them, the border remains a deeply contested space.The crossing of the Hungarian-Austrian border every day exposes Hungarians and Austrians to huge numbers of migrants, many of whom are desperate to reach the other side of the border and drown their sorrows in the river Belka.

The project proposes an alternative future for the area if it is not pre-occupied with the problems of the present. In this alternative, the future is a garden with a border. The crossing of the Hungarian-Austrian border for the trans-Austrian border patrol is no longer an incident that is reported on as if it were not happening. Instead, it is frequently cited as an indicator of increased migrant flows into the country. In the coming years, the exhibition ‘will be a space for the discussion and reflection of ideas generated in the project’, but its true intentions are now primarily political. The project serves as a vehicle for the emergence of a political ideology in Austria that echoes the European tradition of the Lockean, but is distinctly different: a return to the roots of authority, reason and law. The exhibition is not concerned with presenting the actual crossing of the border, but rather with the symbolic act of crossing it. At the centre of the border is now a large bulldozer, ready to lay down whatever is necessary to build a new tunnel under the Austrian-Hungarian border. This exhibition is about to get a lot more political.  The project was originally conceived as</text>

The crossing of the Hungarian and Austrian borders in the late 1980s and early 1990s heralded a new era in which technocratic governments rushed to put innovative technologies to work in the publics. But the harsh reality is that such technologies do not live in a garden but are constantly employed by everyday people in the area, who then use them to cross the border into Austria or Germany. These technologies create new jobs but also new ways of organising the area – one that can be exploited but does not create enough jobs to cover everyone’s basic needs. The story of the Three Rivers Valley becomes a cautionary case study for such seeming contradictions. In the words of Paul Domela, a.k.a. Moira Kenny: ‘Three Rivers’ is a name that started off as a pseudonym. It wasn’t intended to be a monument to architectural excess and architectural fantasy, rather a name that signaled the shifting sands that were lying beneath the city’s surface.’2 This</text>

The crossing of the Austrian-Hungarian border into Slovenia is not a metaphor for the migrant crisis, but a logical next step in the process of industrialisation. In this ‘second tier’ of the border – the land border with Serbia – the EU27 collectively own the geographical space and the 'home' market. The railway tracks running parallel to the tracks of the Danube divide the Hungarian territory, but in the event of war, the Hungarian government controls access to the Hungarian territory via a passageway under the Via Rail corridor. As a result, the railway undertakings that construct the Hungarian-Serbian railway network cannot simultaneously access the two territories at the same time. In this ‘third tier’ of the border – the property tier – the EU27 collectively own the ‘home’ market and the ‘market’ within the EU27 itself. Thirdly, as in the Austrian-Hungarian border, the EU27 collectively own the ‘home’ and �</text>

The crossing of the Hungarian/Austrian border into Austria is a routine event for many visitors to the Austrian capital, with over one million people crossing in 2014 alone. Unfortunately, the gardens of the Austrian capital do not have the same kind of border, although they may share aspects with the border region. In the case of the Hungarian/Austrian city of Vienna, for instance, the Austrians build a new high-speed rail line through the center of the city, which will run alongside the Hungarian border and then turn around and run alongside the Italian/Italian-tunneled railway that runs parallel to it. At present, the Italian/Italian railway is only four kilometers away from the Hungarian border, and the Austrians only fifteen kms away from the Italian/Italian-tunneled railway. In such a situation, the Austrians would have to divert large numbers of vehicles, due to the construction of a new tunnel under the Hungarian border, to run the Italian/Italian-tuned railway two kilometers</text>

The crossing of the Austrian/Hungarian border into Austria is not a natural phenomenon; it is a highly automated part of the European Union’s Schengen Area. The digital technologies of the internet and social media have transformed the border into a transient spatial phenomenon, where no human actors are in any way responsible for its actions. The use of technology to monitor and map the border is a European construct, and the architects who proposed the project bear a major responsibility for its implementation. The project was originally proposed by Kübler-Ross, but the Austrian government actively intervened in the proposal in an attempt to prevent a ‘different kind of analysis’. Kübler-Ross argued for a no-fly zone, a position that was shared by many European governments. The proposal was withdrawn by the Hungarian government on the grounds that it did not have a valid environmental assessment, although academics at the time argued that a ‘different kind of analysis’ was needed. Since no such analysis was required by</text>

This new object catalogues all the objects in the area, and allows the user to ‘track,’ ‘untrack,’ and locate the objects’. This approach to monitoring and capturing data is novel and raises new questions about civil liberties, objecthood and the relationship between the private and public spheres.

With this in mind, the analysis reveals that the objects that comprise the M.A.T. are constantly evolving, and that they can be divided into three categories: structures, activities and data.

The collection of objects in the San Francisco Bay Area continues to grow, and their analysis reveals that, as a result of human activity, the Earth is heating up’. The collection of objects in the San Francisco Bay Area is an object that is constantly subject to change, being made up of many different kinds of objects. When the collection is viewed through a microscope, the appearance of new objects is often used as a measure of their environmental quality. A collection of trees being pruned on a large scale, for example, can be seen as a sign that the environmental quality of the local environment is being appreciated.

The collection of objects, objects and data sets is colloquially referred to as the ‘Bay Street Machine’.[17] The collection of objects, measurements and data sets, or the ‘stationary built environment’, is a recurring metaphor that seeks to capture and describe the dynamic temporal complexity that characterises the contemporary world. It captures the dynamic interaction between people, places and things that arise from and through the actions of humans; between people, concepts, actions and data; and between people, knowledge and data.[18] Such a concept presupposes and depends on a specific understanding of what ‘stationary buildings’ are and are not. It would be un-stationary if it did not place a particular site of action in relation to a particular time – in other words, it does not designate an area or a place of action but rather an area (or a class of places) where people live and act in relation to each other. Such a</text>

A sound byte is a unit of data consisting of a unit of text, an object representing an object of measurement, and a unit of data representing the data. A sound byte is unique to the originating station, and its meaning is defined by the authority that issues and distributes the sound bytes. 	Within the M.A.T. sample set, objects referred to as ‘tape’ objects typically have meanings that are defined by the authority that issues and distributes the tape. Object names derived from authority figures, however, tend to capture the imaginations of listeners outside of the authority figure(s) with whom the name is uttered.

At the beginning of each new object collection period, the M.A.T. transmits a new set of measurements and data to the ground station. The object sets, which can be considered the genesis of the collection, are a collection of things that happen to be there. The collection thus becomes ever more particular, as new data and measurement techniques can be used to investigate ‘the spatial nature of things’, and objects come to represent a particular kind of spatiality. The collection of things that make up the ISS is a collection of measurements and data; its measurement is a set of relations between things. In this sense, the collection of things that make up the ISS is a kind of ever-shifting recording of the world around it.

In the display cases, the count is maintained against the object number. The M.A.T. collects and distributes data through the convention center’s glass doors, and through the public lobby, which is divided into ‘tenant-level sections’ and further subdivided into ‘room-level sections’ and so on. The count is made by way of software, which is then texted to all party members via Twitter.

It is this element of the analysis that enables the user to contribute to the ongoing development of the station by continuously adding to the collection of objects whatever data collection and/or mapping they please. The collection of objects reflects the changing needs of the city and the society as a whole, enabling the user to contribute to the analysis of a city’s urban landscape through the collection of knowledge. Such contributions would include, but are not limited to, data on buildings sold and vacant properties, street and building illumination, vehicle speeds, street sweeping, debris removal and any other type of urban maintenance that is related to the city’s growth and development. Such knowledge would enable the M.A.T. to detect and characterize trends and variations in the collection of objects, thus enabling the city to take proactive measures to mitigate the effects of such phenomena as flooding and power failures.</text>

In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of the city, to locate it where people walk past or are made to walk past it, is a decision that was historically and contemporaneously made by a central government. It is a historic urban landmark, and a set of regulations that govern walking and public places in the city. It is a zoning requirement, and it is a public space. But it is an object, and as such it falls outside the purview of the city’s planning regulations. It falls outside of urban-design canon, and thus object conservation becomes a negotiation between artist and city. It’s a negotiation, and often it’s a dead end. The Biennial has had to learn to live and negotiate both the urban space and the object that it photographs, and has to do so in the light of new technologies that allow it to document both at the same time. If it’s to maintain its autonomy, it will have to learn to love both the newly invented urban space and its photographic</text>

In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of that city, to locate it in the midst of a metropolis, to locate it in the centre of a metropolis, and to then, finally, move to the city of the future, to the city of the present, and thereby to return to the city of the past, is a decision that was once again and still is heavily influenced by the architecture of finance capital. The question becomes, can the Biennial do this with its current portfolio of art and cultural enterprises, while remaining anchored in its present location, insofar as such a location is relevant to the functioning of the cultural sector in the city? The short answer is, unequivocally, it can. But only the Biennial can do that. The city of New York has had an important but now somewhat diminished role in the cultural life of the city, and its image is often represented in the art and the design industries as something that is diffuse, ambiguous and dependent upon the whims and caprices of the cultural-economic complex. And this</text>

In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of the city, rather than in the outer reaches, has always been a big issue. It’s not just a question of location, but of what kind of relationship you want to establish between the photographer and the city. In other words, what does the Biennial do with the photos it takes from its archives? If the objects in the photographs are of public spaces, then the answer is a yes. If they’re of private property, then the answer is a no. The question becomes, what kind of relationship do you want to establish between the city and the photographer? 	The answer is: that’s a difficult question to answer. I would say that the biennial as an institution’s main role has been fulfilled, although there are other forces at work. The city has fragmented into many different pieces, and now cities are fragments of many different pieces. Each city is working through its own version of the Big Apple, each has its own version of the</text>

In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of the city and photograph the entire city becomes a challenge. If the museum is always right, and the Biennial always gets displaced, what does it do in the city that it doesn’t already photograph? In the city of New York, and in the rest of the world, when the Biennial moves to a new location, it’s usually because it’s not meeting its original plans. The question is, can the Biennial take its place, or will it relocate to someplace more desirable than its current location? In the city of New York, and elsewhere, the question is, can the Biennial take its place, or will it remain displaced? In either case, what happens to that displaced space? The short answer to both of these questions is, ‘yes’.The long answer to the first one is, of course, ‘yes’. The question is, where does that space take place? In the city of New York,</text>

In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of the city and photograph the entire city is a decision that was being whittled away at, but it’s still a decision. It’s a place-making that was being made on a massive scale, but it’s also a question of where the best places for that kind of decision-making to happen? In other words, it’s not just the photograph, but the complex relationship between photograph and place-making is question 10 in my book, whether that’s the photograph, or the place-making that’s happening right now, or more particularly, what is happening right now in that place. The question of where to locate one’s studio or one’s home-life seems to me to be one of the most pressing of the five questions in the Social Life series.  The next most pressing is: what should the composition of a Social Life be? In my opinion, the answer to that is a question that</text>

In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of a metropolis like Manhattan or Times Square was made before you even stepped foot inside. In other words, you’ve got a very early, &quot;Hey, I’m here!’ New Yorker contribution to the Biennial tradition.Today, the Biennial is a global phenomenon. It was founded in 1990 in New York and has become a global phenomenon. It’s not just an object or phenomenon, as such. It’s a phenomenon that has consequences and outcomes and is constantly (very) much shaped by contemporary events and culture. It’s the magic of modern artifice.Art is a very powerful language. It’s easy to write poetry while browsing the web, but reading poetry is a much harder thing to translate into poetry. You have to be exposed to a great deal of poetry in order to truly understand its poetic form. For me, personally, and to be honest, this has always been the case. I come from a poetry</text>

In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of the city, rather than in the outer reaches of the city, is a decision that has real-world, economic and political consequences. If the city of New York is to retain its cultural identity, it’s imperative that the Biennial follows this city’s lead in its development. If the city of New York cannot or will not follow this lead, then the Biennial will inevitably follow another city’s lead in its development. And this is the realisation that’s being made in the Biennial’s HQ. It’s being made now, but it’s going to be made in the future too. The question is, can the Biennial simultaneously inhabit the city and be independent? The answer to that question is a definite YES. The key is, however, that the lead city must have the political will and the cultural identity to allow the Biennial to happen. Otherwise, the question becomes, can the Biennial inhabit the city</text>

In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of the city has always been a point of contention. Is the studio in the city or in the suburbs? In the city or in the suburbs? Is the studio in the city or in the suburbs? In the city or in the suburbs? The tensions and tensions of this constant redefinition, this constant need for expansion, this constant scramble for space, have built the city into a remarkable paradox, allowing the Biennial to thrive in ways that other, more traditional artworlds simply cannot. The question, then, becomes: can the Biennial simultaneously inhabit all of these disparate places and at the same time inhabit all of them? If it marries these different elements, it becomes something completely new – something completely ficto­tem – an object that transcends both space and time. This is what happens in the Biennial’s most ambitious projects, projects that attempt to incorporate all of these disparate elements, while keeping their distinctive, urban character. These projects are often visionary and poetic, but</text>

In the city of New York, it’s always been an issue whether the object that is being photographed or the photograph itself is of a public space quality, or if they’re photographing an urban landscape in its natural, uninterrupted form. In the city of New York, the decision to locate your studio in the centre of the city, or in the outer reaches of the city, or in the outer reaches of Manhattan, is a decision that was originally made to house theaters and performing arts centers. The city of New York has a unique ability to assume and project space and time, both physically and socially. It can project its cultural and urban significance, its real and imagined diversity, onto these surfaces. This is a much more difficult thing to do in the city of New York, which is still primarily a farming community. The Biennial’s current location on 42nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue in midtown Manhattan is a decision that was originally made to house a bakery and a clothing boutique, respectively. The decision to expand the Biennial to take up its present role as a cultural centre and its current position as an exhibition venue seems to be an over-simplification. The bakery and clothing boutique that the Biennial is situated in, and will occupy for years to come, will be able to</text>

Its main offices are in Dublin and Los Angeles. The Breakthrough Institute was founded to address a gap in knowledge regarding the architecture of human language, a phenomenon that is understood to account for the structural qualities of language.[2] The Breakthrough Institute website describes the language as ‘the most fundamental of social systems’. It further explains that human language is composed of ‘biological systems that continuously reshape themselves according to changing conditions and actors’. These changing conditions include ‘environmental factors, cultural factors, and economic factors’.

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39), the Chinese military constructed what they claimed was the world’s first ‘phalanx’ of skyscrapers in the Central Business District. The Central Business District is a hybrid skyscraper–manufacturing district with an industrial use – a point of ultimate power and influence. Though largely ignored by policy makers and the public, the area has a vital role to play in the city’s future development. 	In the wake of the war, the project was put into reverse-distribution; now a park, it functions as a regional commercial centre. Though it is difficult to assess the true economic value of a downtown park, the City of London appears to have made a positive profit on the project at least initially. 	In the 1970s and 80s the park became a site for anti-globalisation protests; today it is a popular tourist destination and a point of convergence for international artists, activists and journalists. Though the anti-globalisation protests that followed the</text>

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39), the city commissioned a series of paintings by Kazuo Tsuru, including one called ‘Machwa Ren’ (The Machwa Renaming). The rationale for the work is that the architectural renderings of the new park would be difficult to merge with the historic character of the old docklands – in the words of the artist, who was asked to ‘reanimate’ the old dockside into something new. But the question that remains is: how does the city acquire the means to support the infrastructure required to support a new art project? As a city, the City of London has a budget that it regularly modifies and submits to the government for funding – funding that is usually allocated to areas in the city where housing is a problem or where the city needs to be frugal in its use of resources. At various points during the 1980s and 1990s, the City of London was in a financial crisis, and as a result the government sought to repur</text>

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39), the British military sought to create a public park system covering much of East London. However, the park emerged much earlier, in 1937, and while it is important to mention it, the origins of the park are a bit hazy. 	Perhaps it is a nod to the fact that the park is named for John Lennon’s pet dog, Punch, who was once again adopted by British artist Norman Wilkinson. ‘Punch’ is a character in many ways, and the story of his adoption is a familiar one in the City of London. 	Wilkinson was a producer for the music of En Vogue, the ­Black-E, and was known for his political involvement. So perhaps we can identify two things in particular about Punch: his adoption and the origins of the park. 	The establishment of public parks was an important event in the development of the city, and for many reasons, one of the most significant being the massive financial resources at the</text>

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39), Samson Kambalu, the self-proclaimed ‘White Elephant’, openly challenged the city to take back East Dulwich Square – an area around the Fruitbank–––––––––––––––––––––––Churchill International School where the British military were training Special Forces. Kambalu was backed by the Russian government, and so London had an obvious agenda. Although the Kambalu rebellion failed, the political and economic logic of the machine seems to have been deeply influenced by it. Indeed, as Birgit Weil shows in her work  	Walking Towards Revolution, the history of urban development in the 1980s and early 1990s in the East Dulwich area is closely tied to the events that would later become known as the Black Saturday and Strike of 1985. 	In her book  	Walking Towards Revolution, Weil documents the transformation of the East Dulwich community from being one of the most ethnically diverse</text>

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39), the Chinese military constructed twenty-five self-propelled howitzers, which they christened ‘Little Green Men’, to protest the British military involvement in Vietnam. The name comes from a proclamation by then-Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who proclaimed that the machine was revolutionising the world through its ‘greening’ of the land. The men who built the guns were initially made up of Hong Kong Chinese migrants who had immigrated to Britain during the First Opium War. By the end of the war, over half of them were dead, and the rest were veterans of the Chinese Civil War who had returned home after the conflict was over. 	The greening of the countryside came about as a direct result of the mechanisation of British industry. As early as the 1920s, commentators such as Winston Churchill were warning that the spread of literacy was threatening to destroy British industry, so the war on illiteracy didn’t come until 1937, when the Sack</text>

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39) the RMA imported over 1,000 tonnes of opium from China, and from the start of that war onwards, all the addicts turned out to be British. The fact that the RMA was established with a biennale as one of its four main revenue streams ensured that it became politically independent, even though it often felt as though it was dependent on the London Club for funding. 	The RMA used its funding to set up a cultural wing, the Champion Club, which produced culturally-relevant works including videos and paintings. Champion Club members travelled to the USA and Europe to work with artists such as Ray Bradbury and Ingmar Bergman, and were later joined by W. W. Jacobs and Paul McCarthy on the editorial boards of Daily Worker and The Times in London. Jacobs would write later that the Champion Club’s cultural programmes were a source of pride, and that Bergman</text>

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39), the city trained up a reserve of armoured personnel carriers called the ▘Lance Corporal––– a name that echoed the name of the first Knight Captain of the Merchant Navy. The Lance Corporal was a modified version of a ship called a Lancer, and so the connection to the first ship can be made. So the machine is in part a reminder of the role that industry plays in the city, and part of the reason why the city is so rich. 	But what if the city stops supporting industry? What would that mean for the people of Tottenham? 	The city council has already made it clear that it does not wish to support Tottenham, and so the only way to exert any influence is through protesting – or as I understand it, engaging in self-harm. There is a very real possibility that if the city does not hand over the park to the community, and so continues to fund culture in an area, that area will become something else entirely.</text>

However, 	once the machine was switched on, it was quite simple to reverse the direction of flow – as soon as the City of London raised its tax-supported London Docklands Development Agency (LDDA), the entire development programme was wound back. Quite how this happened is unclear, but it is likely that the City Council decided that it did not want to support an area as an area anymore, and so the decision was made to either support an area as a cluster of disconnected municipalities, or to withdraw support altogether. In either case, the area would become even poorer and separated from one another. So the question becomes: how does the city future look if it withdraws its support? 	It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39) the city was heavily industryised, and as a result, a lot of people lost their houses to the dockside demolition. During this period, the LPGA was developing an impressive fleet of fishing boats and derelict dockside shops. Many of these projects were completely ignored by the machine, which is why we have such a huge stockpile of dockside property in London: it is now a very attractive investment, especially for developers. 	The process of industrialisation in London did not happen overnight, and while the rise of the dockside and the early modern industries mirrored one another in many ways, at an early stage, they also saw the emergence of a whole new form of capitalist relationship with the surrounding environment. As a consequence, the early modern city, even in its industrial form, is interesting in that it creates and/or imagines a relation between the dockside and the present, or at least creates the relation between the dockside and the present in ways that are related to</text>

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39) the M.F.L. developed industrial parks in an area around the ship channel that would later be known as Trinidad and Tobago. These were strategically placed to provide quick cash flow for the war effort, while at the same time holding onto the abandoned properties as wasteland for future use. So while the machine is developing economically, it is also slowly but inexorably transforming the city. In the coming decades, both the M.F.L. and the city’s development agencies may wish to revisit this historical context. 	 In the meantime, the question that remains is: how will the city sustain its growing human capital, given the increasing automated nature of the city?

It is often forgotten that the machine became involved early in the history of the city, long before the park was even conceived. During the Second Opium War (1937–39) the Chinese Communist Party developed a close working relationship with the port, and so it is quite plausible that the machine could have developed its own dialectical relationship to the park. In fact, the parallel could be drawn between the eastern and western systems of ports – the western system represents the logic of the industrial machine, while the eastern system represents the potentialities of an increasingly interconnected world. 	As early as the 1940s, artists and artists’ organisations in the East were actively exploring the need to operate from the shadows, and using port installations as a way to do so. Some of these port organisations even incorporated port tours into their day-to-day activities. 	The interest in port as a place to do business, exchange, and exchange did not go unnoticed in the City of London. In fact, in the early days of the Port of London, port infrastructure was often depicted in artwork and was a prominent part of the cultural landscape.

This new being embodies a radically different conception of humanity – a kind of post-materialist form of humanity – than the person who created the ape. In other words, the new being is not necessarily post-human, although it may be so radically posthuman that it calls into question all notions of humanity.This is the ambiguity and paradoxes of posthumanity. It’s a concept that can be used to probe new frontiers, to explore new ways of understanding the world.

The ambiguity arises because the machine has no concept of self; it is ambiguous as to whether it is a ‘human-like being’ or an ‘artificial intelligence’ that is evolving, and thus the situation is constantly evolving. The ambiguity arises because the ambiguity arises because of the ambiguity in the first place: the ambiguity in the concept of personhood, which is the very root of much of what we do with our bodies (including our brains), when faced with the very real possibility that we’ll one day no longer be able to control what happens to us; and thus we must grapple with the ambiguity as a constitutive feature of our being. If we don’t understand that we’re evolving into what Lefebvre called an ‘ambiguous situation’, we may nevertheless indulge in what he described as ‘a little over-zealous abstraction’, which is the very over-reach of the capacities of</text>

We’re not so ambiguous about it, since we’re aware of it, and we’re making it clear to ourselves and to anyone who might come across our project that we’re making progress that we’re moving ahead, even if it’s just to get things ready for the inevitable. We may not yet have fully autonomous vehicles, but we’ve certainly begun to add to the repertoire of hazardous environments where machines are tempted to do bad things.  The tricky part for artists and the burgeoning fields of AI research is that while machine learning can identify patterns in data that could be used to guide a course of action, it also has to be able to parse ambiguity itself. If that ambiguity is too great, as with the way in which Facebook is processing massive amounts of data about us, the danger is that the very human aspects of the process that went into constructing those patterns could be lost in</text>

When we create artwork that is technically challenging but also socially interesting, but also socially destabilising, but also ethically ambiguous, there exists a potential for it to be perceived as both legal and socially beneficial to our existing relationship. 	To some extent, this may be the situation in the present, where we encounter new technologies that alter our conception of reality and alter our ability to act with agency; but to some extent, this is also the case in the future, where we encounter more accurate, machine-like representations of the world. The ambiguous situation of the ambiguous client has long been one of the great dilemmas of the modern artist, who has to figure out which of her projects is actually ethically ambiguous and which is actually not. The problem with the modern artist is that she is trapped between two sets of values; her audience is presented with work that is either created by her or recognises her work through other means, and this creates an</text>

In order to understand them, we must understand how they are evolving, and this is why Lefebvre stressed the importance of the artist as a creator, and how that relationship should be construed. The ambiguities that emerge from the new relationship between the artist and the machine are what fascinate us, what make us gasp, what make us mad.What Lefebvre didn’t foresee was the institutionalized relationship between the bio-technical and the cultural industries, or the rise of the biennial, and the cultural ecology of the following century.

The implication is that any organisation could create a platform on which its use can be defined, and so on. The point is that in this context, the platform or use could be considered ‘natural’, and so ‘interpreted’ by an artist or organisation. The ambiguity around the concept of the ‘port’ is resolved in one ‘word’ spoken by the artist: ‘port’.  In 2001, Lefebvre and his team at the Autonomous Museum in</text>

The ambiguity arises because the client doesn’t know what the ambiguities are, and the artist doesn’t know how to deal with them. The ambiguity arises because the ambiguities are invisible, and the client can't figure out what the hell is going on. Now, there are many other ways of putting it. For instance, the way in which the Internet is transforming the workplace may cause the ambiguity of work environments to creep into the firm’s infrastructures, where workers don’t necessarily know what the boundaries are. And there are other factors that we may not yet be facing. For instance, the fact that we are all connected creates what Lefebvre called the ‘intrinsic contradictions’ that can no longer be ignored. If we don’t feel like creating our own online presence or our own Wikipedia of knowledge, then we’ll all end up like the user who created Ambient Magazine</text>

In that case, the client is the artist, but in the new relationship, the client is the system that creates and supports the art. The ambiguity arises because the ambiguities that the new relationship demands of the artist are invisible to the human observer. The invisible hand that orchestrates the world through codes, symbols, symbols and so forth is rendered unintelligible to the human ear. But the new relationship between artist and client is one in which the artist has a new capacity for understanding; a capacity that is both trusted and accountable. This is why so many artists are drawn to the work produced through the Narrative Project, both those who came out of it and those who came out of it later. The responsibility for the work lies in the hands of the artist, and so the artist is able to devote herself completely to the project, to the point where she ceases to be an artist. The project itself seems to embody this new capacity for understanding.  The project began when</text>

In that case, the client is the artist, but in the present the machine is also the client: both the artist and the client are now subject to the whims of the algorithm. 	[34] As an example, Lefebvre used a similar scheme to create a series of public sculptures around the site of the 2002 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. The sculptures were commissioned by the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport and show images of the games from the ‘black box’ that was kept in lockers below the court of the Acropolis. As part of its mission to identify, analyse and mitigate any potential security risks, the Ministry commissioned a company called SecuriInfo to develop a suite of tools to combat 'hoaxes and cybercrimes’. One of the tools was a 'bot', which was programmed to do things like retweet fake news stories and spread misleading information about the state of Greece through social media.

Understanding this kind of nuance is one thing that is still relatively new for us, but it is quite another thing to be exposed to it in a cultural context, to experience it in the form of art works and to absorb it as part of our cultural system. This kind of exposure is what Lefebvre called ‘ambiguous situationality’. To understand fully, we need to be exposed to a range of different kinds of ambiguity, to master all aspects of it, to be able to analyze and comprehend everything that is ambiguous. But in the new relationship, we don’t just mean understanding the ambiguity of the new technology; we also mean understanding the context in which the technology is deployed</text>

Art’s event is made up of three components: capturing, narrating and understanding. The capture and retelling of an event is a story that captures and interprets time. And as we all grow older and wiser, we will all have to start telling stories again and again in order to satisfy the ever-growing collection of interests that the AI and its collections of instruments will inevitably create.

It permeates our aesthetics, our politics, our law, and contributes to the production of a multitude of cultural products – including, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, video, maps, social media, and now social networks. But what does art today even mean? What does it mean to make art today? What does it mean to produce art? I propose that we might begin to understand the word iconomy (meaning image or pictorial image) as an element of social meaning and production in the 21st century. The ubiquity of images today tells us a great deal about the conditions on which we rely in a daily basis – whether we are making images ourselves or whether we are induced to make images by professional image-makers.

It is worth recalling that the term ‘future’ was coined by futurist Ray Kurzweil more than a decade before Richard Florida’s famous essay in the 1949 book   Philosophy of Automation that is widely attributed to defining the technological singularity. Indeed, Florida’s account was considerably more nuanced and conflicted, describing a future with  	machine intelligence rather than with computer programming or programming languages. But Kurzweil’s position was clearly that the technology that would define the future was already here and could be found, made ideal and controlled in the service of capitalism.  	There is good reason to believe that</text>

That is, whereas a painter can capture the magic of a painting with a single painting and a fine art dealer can identify the artist’s intended audience, a machine can only do so through repeated performance and repetition. Consequently, the art of the future will have to be made by machines that understand how to be artist and artist’s audience are likely to be quite different from those of the past. 	Art will also have to be made that is both understood and actively engaged with in order to be understood and appreciated by others.

What would be the role of art today if not for the purposes of information capture and exchange?  	What might art do in the era of swarm intelligence? Art’s current and potential place in this context is made doubly clear by the fact that its current appropriation comes at a moment when the AI that creates it is being developed with DARPA and other federal government agencies. The question becomes whether the art of the future will be made by machines or whether it will be art that is made by artists who find creative ways to use machine intelligence in unpredictable and dynamic ways.Art and culture are made possible by science, and the more we learn about its capabilities, the more possibilities we can imagine opening up. But given the current state of science, it’s easy to see why artists today are drawn to projects that put them in direct contact with the parts that make up their work: why would an artist choose to work with a machine? And it’s a question that comes up again and again: how will the art be made?Art today is made possible by the combination of technologies that give rise to new kinds of art and art that can be assembled from existing media. But given the pace of change and the extent to which we’ve all become cogs in a production line, it’s easy to see why the possibilities of what art could be today are much more limited than we are.

The question becomes whether the art of the future will be made by machines or whether it will be art that is made by machines that understand their place and purpose. 	Art as a Raw Material / Raw Material for Machine LearningArt today is more data-intensive than at any time before, and in many contexts, including science and technology, the consequences of this exponential increase in material consumption are dire. A leading cause of this crisis is the ever-increasing consumption of raw materials – things that can be used to make things more effectively, more meaningfully, more ethically.Art today is produced through the process of design that is part of what is now called Machine Learning. This term derives from the book Machine Learning: An Introduction (MIT Press, 2014), by Geoffrey Bowker and Andrew Gooch, but it is increasingly being applied to a suite of techniques and vocabularies used in the creation of intelligent systems. Machine Learning is used to detect patterns in data to generate new ways of employing materials, automating production processes and much more. The word ‘</text>

The question becomes whether the art of the future will be made by machines or whether it will be art that is made by machines with the capacities that humans have.Art today is produced from a production line that is driven by algorithms that understand how to produce images according to a predetermined set of rules. But what if the line producers don’t need to produce images; what if the creators can generate images according to their set of rules? Such an image-producing AI could hypothetically operate independently and autonomously, producing artwork according to its set of rules.  	What if, one day, this kind of AI is developed and used to produce images on its own? What kinds of relationships between humans and machines that might arise? What kinds of capacities might such an AI have?Art today is produced through a production line that understands how to produce images in accordance with a prescribed set of rules. But what if the artistically inclined AI doesn’t follow the rules? What kinds of relationships might arise between humans and artists? What kinds of capacities might such</text>

The question becomes whether the art of the future will be made by machines or whether it will be art that is constructed?Art as constructionThe term ‘Artificial General Intelligence’ is often used in connection with computer programs that mimic the learning and memory processes that lead to creative thinking. But machine learning isn’t just talking about programs; it’s also about how to arrange data in ways that create or increase the utility of a system. In other words, it’s about culture and how to engage with and engage with culture in a contextual way. The way in which art can be made by machines is also a question that AI researchers are asking in relation to artistic practices that often rely on the artist’s personality and identity.Is there a way to make artistic activities more contextually aware? One way to think of it is as a biennial that engages with the idea of culture in a very intimate way. 	Artists who produce works using AI are developing technologies that monitor, analyse and contextualise their work in a systematic</text>

The question becomes whether the art of the future will be made by machines or whether it will be made by artists who find their place in this new society through their art?Art is an essential part of the social process that has to occur in the aftermath of massive data capture and exchange. But what if, hundreds of years from now, people discover, through historical research, that through a process of collaborative inquiry with native artists they can create something entirely different from what was imagined possible by the artist? What would be the response? If the future is going to be populated with autonomous, self-sustaining creative enterprises, it is essential that they have the capacity to function in a democratic society. How to make art that is autonomous and self-sustaining is a very difficult problem to address, and art today is far too visible and popular an object to be easily explained away or controlled. But there are tools available that can be used to understand how art is produced and distributed in the social.Art today is made possible through the exchange of images. And while the</text>
