It draws upon a tradition of quantum mechanics and computer science to create worlds in which interactivity, culture and technology become non-linear and subject to the laws of physics and math.[2] If these principles can be extended to the physical and virtual worlds of the contemporary interface, then interface design could be seen as a way of creating and supporting both the physical and virtual worlds in the real and the virtual worlds of the future. This is consistent with the concept of a ‘thin layer’ that is used to describe the interface: thin media such as paper, metal, glass and plastic are considered to be components that connect the user interface to the physical world.[3] If these principles are to have any real world relevance at all, then we must all wake up to the fact that this is happening and act accordingly.

They are divided up into different levels, with different responsibilities and rights. There are also ‘actions’ that can be taken by a user in the real and virtual worlds, such as ‘wandering’ and ‘clicking’’. These ‘actions’ are taken as input by the user and produce various behaviours and ‘results’. In the ‘real’ world, humans have rights, and these rights can be exercised in many ways.Contravision has taken this rights model and applied it to the emerging sector of social and cultural studies. This is done in many ways, such as through the use of models, documentaries and the like, but also through the construction of legally enforceable codes and constitutions that bind all participants to a set of obligations. The model is</text>

The autonomous vehicle became an important concept in that it allowed the users to create a highly customized version of the system, giving rise to the concept of self-driving. The concept of autonomy was further developed through the research of psychologist, Max Horkheimer and his research associates, including Alexander Provan, who coined the term in the early 1950s. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, several other researchers, including Max Spiers and William Lane, investigated how humans generate agency and political choices. Lane developed the concept of moral agency and Spiers developed the concept of political agency, using materials and computational techniques, to understand how the interaction of people can generate certain kinds of agency. These terms derive from a pair of essays in Max Horkheimer’s Philosophie der NSDAP, 2nd edn, published in 1956. The essays examine</text>

Contravision creates and supports virtual and physical worlds in the real and virtual worlds, while at the same time perceiving and influencing the world through its transparent and powerful infrastructures. It bridges the gap between the natural and the virtual, while offering powerful tools for understanding the world that are not dependent on imposed paradigms and understood human perspectives. This is demonstrated in the system’s architecture, which at times appears to be based on principles of physics and mathematics, but is actually deeply based on culturally specific understandings of the world. Its transparency and ability to move between spaces is a particularly potent tool for understanding the world that is opaque and dominated by certain ideas and systems of thought. In a larger perspective, this has recently been demonstrated in the collaboration between artist Arjun Appadurai and ITER Initiative, an interdisciplinary research project based in Rotterdam and New York City that is conducting a collaborative project through which the artist can probe the physics of the contravision that is produced when materials with unique physical properties collide. This type of surface interaction is particularly relevant for the context of ITER as it is considered to be a major component of the project’s overall architecture.

Their project therefore sought to understand the wider socio-political context of the city in terms of cultural practices, geography, and urbanisation. Their research and design process was driven by three key questions: (1) how the spatialisation of information affects our ability to understand (2) how cultural practices affect our understanding of the world (3) how the socio-political context of a given city affects its ability to sustainably build and support a culturally responsive urban future). The three questions inform not only the spatialisation of information, but also the socio-political contexts of information gathering and dissemination. For example, the question of why are universities in cities, while those in rural areas are agricultural campuses? The answer to (2) enables researchers to identify and map geographically relevant hotspots of cultural exchange, while (</text>

The Open University was an EU funded project for research into knowledge-production and innovation in which participants contributed in different ways to create the knowledge base of the project. The European Commission’s research programme into Knowledge Cities was an innovative and rich development because it was multidisciplinary and allowed participants to draw upon different cultural, educational and professional backgrounds to bring about a common understanding and action. This was an important element in enabling the growth of the project because it allowed the participants to develop innovative and tactical responses to changing situations and to continually challenge their understanding and understanding of the larger context in which they were operating within. This multidisciplinary research framework enabled the development of alternative understanding of the world and the future of relations between people and the world as a whole.In 2014, we launched the European Commission’s ambitious Knowledge Cities Initiative (KII).

It bridges the gap between the natural and the virtual, while offering powerful tools for understanding the world that are not bound by the constraints of traditional media. The system is not only able to perceive and manipulate the world, but is also able to create and sustain new worlds through its transparent and powerful architectures. This project is just one among many that have sought to understand the world through this technology. There are many more like it that I have not mentioned here, and they exist in almost every corner of the globe. They are the future, and they are just around the corner. The reason why we are able to create new worlds through these tools is because of the human capacity for imagineering new worlds in the here and now. New worlds are able to be imagined, created and imagined, because the world is possible through the mediation of symbolic language and cultural practices. New media make it possible for us to imagine and create what people would not necessarily choose to see or do. In this sense, new media are able to conjure up images or narratives that are not necessarily guided by the organisations</text>

Contravision creates and supports virtual and physical worlds in the real and virtual worlds, while at the same time perceiving and influencing the world through its transparent and powerful infrastructures. It bridges the gap between the natural and the virtual, while offering powerful tools for understanding the imperfect causal relationships between phenomena. Its open architecture and collaborative processes enable a multiplicity of possible futures through a single understanding of the present.[7]Contravision is a useful tool for a number of purposes, but its primary role is to imagine possible futures based on the current situation. Its ability to generate new knowledge about the world is what distinguishes it from other curatorial practices. Its ability to understand and manipulate its users is what makes it different from other art and documentary-making practices. Its ability to create and foster new knowledge about the world is what makes it different from other art forms. At its best, this enables artists to imagine entirely new worlds through the power of a very specific understanding of the world. At its worst, this leads to bureaucracies and constitutional monarchies. In order to truly understand and exploit the power of Contravision, artists and curators must be able to innovate and experiment with new ways of understanding the world. This might require compromising on certain essentialist conceptions</text>

The primary reason to study curatorial practice in this way is to gain an understanding of the social and economic context of being a curator. But in addition to the social, conceptual and ethical considerations behind the practices we engage with – what it means to be a curator, who is it that we are, how the contemporary curatorial role is constituted, and so on – we also need to be able to articulate the politics and ideologies that underlie the ways in which a particular practice shapes social and political change. This requires both a deep understanding of the social and a conceptual understanding of the concepts, but also an understanding of the contemporary condition and the world as a dynamic process that can be addressed in a way that is both ecological and progressive. It is important to draw on the experiences and knowledge of workers and youth in order to develop concepts and skills for how to live sustainably as artists and consumers of culture, but it is equally vital to work in a material sense and to create socially responsive practices

This is why it is so crucial that we develop skills in the contemporary curatorial writing and design processes – not just skills in how to identify good and bad art, but skills in how to live sustainably as artists and how to create social meaning and social change through artmaking] – skills that render art possible but also employ art as a tool for social change and a mode of artistic practice.  	[1] See, for example, David Harvey and Michael Parkinson, eds.,  	Towards a Reproduction of Art or a Bio Art?

This requires both a deep understanding of contemporary art history and a conceptual understanding of contemporary art’s relation to the past, but also an ecological and progressive understanding of culture production, consumption and distribution.[8]Modern art today is produced on a globalised capitalist economy driven by the logic of profit-maximisation, and its cultural production is supported by a social economy that places a premium on cultural consumption and collective creativity. The social ecology of contemporary art today is produced through the specific production of identities – identities of various sorts – that are fused and recombined in the creation of narratives that then narrate the (typically capitalist) future of art and art in the world as a whole. The result is a global audience of art-goers with varying levels of sophistication and knowledge about art and art history. The identities that are constructed and recombined in this process include, but are by no means limited to: (a) the globalised public</text>

In the end, this means accepting the fact that our art will be made visible and the world will react with what it means for an artist to be made visible, and to live sustainably, but we also need the political and material means necessary for the progressive response.Esther Tabatabai is the Director of the Centre for Inquiry, University of Toronto, where she is responsible for strategic planning, institutional development and the steward of the Biennale tradition.

In order to achieve this, artists need to have the tools and knowledge to be able to create social change through their art, but also to be able to translate this art into practices that are responsive to the conditions of society and the planet. This is why it is so crucial to have a biennial that is both ecologically sustainable and socially responsive, and this is one of the ways in which biennials can intervene in the development and maturity of their subjects and cultures. The fact that subjects and cultures are brought together through a common subject matter allows the biennial to intervene in the social and cultural dynamics of a given subject area and thus, in a way, radically changes the dynamic between the subject and the artworld. In other words, the artworld cannot exist in isolation from the social. When the artworld is made up of people and communities of people, both artists and audiences, it is made up of people</text>

What is beautiful and aesthetically potent is not always socially responsive, and radical urban living must be attuned to the needs of the capitalist city in order to be truly radical.  One example of this in New York is found in the creation and perpetuation of public art – works by artists – that are funded by the city in an amount that reflects the cultural value of the site, but is in effect a subsidy to the cultural production of the surrounding area. These kinds of radical urban practices and procedures can and will be taken upantigen, but as we will see, this is a dangerous game and opens the way for the expansion of the city’s cultural capitalism.  One can only presume that the discussion that took place in the Liverpool Biennial boardroom on 11 and 12 June 2017 about the need to create ‘an alternative to the present’ was also taking place in other areas of the city, including in the areas</text>

It is important to draw on the experiences and knowledge of workers and youth in order to develop concepts and skills for how to live sustainably as artists and consumers of culture, but it is equally vital to work in a material sense and to create socially responsive practices that are also economically mobile. The material dimension is of course by no means a given, and it is possible to be both materialist and progressive – in the same step – but it is crucial to develop concepts and skills for how to live sustainably as artists and consumers of culture, while at the same time being sensitive to the material conditions that contemporary culture is subject to. This is why the term ‘culture production unit’ is so crucial in this critical moment: if the social conditions that generate the culture are not addressed, can ‘culture production units’ be organised and controlled, and the politics of culture are created? If the latter is not addressed, then the politics of culture will not be addressed and inequality and oppression will re-emerge. This is why it is so crucial for artists and creatives to find ways to work in and contribute to the infrastructure of the city, and for arts organisations to be able to effectively coordinate activities across different sites, different communities and different</text>

This requires both an understanding of how to work with youth and a conceptual understanding of the contemporary condition and the world as it exists now. The latter is necessary in order to generate the necessary material conditions for a future culturally responsive urban development, but it is also necessary in order to absorb cultural energies into the city’s infrastructure and to emerge as a result as a sustainable mode of cultural activity. This latter, ‘metabolism’, is the condition of a future ecologically based urbanisation, and it is a condition that must be addressed at an accelerating rate in order to achieve a meaningful impact at the macro-level. The discourse of decoupling needs to be re-constituted in order to encompass the full range of possible impacts of a given development, and this requires both a conceptual understanding of the socio-political and a technological understanding of the city.

This requires both a conceptual and a political knowledge base, but is especially important in today’s capitalist world. I would argue that in the age of the biennial and the museum, the role of the cultural goods retailer is to promote culture as a sale, and as such it is critical that we have a conceptual understanding of how our cultural practices shape social and political change. The biennial and the museum might offer temporary solutions to the problems that face us, such as through the magic of location or even the power of discovery, but their real value lies in their ability to stand for something and be recognisable as such. This is particularly true in the age of the biennial and the museum, in which identification with a cultural form is no longer sufficient to explain why we attend a particular form of art exhibition or take part in a particular way.

But in addition to the social, conceptual and ethical considerations behind the practices we engage with – what it means to be a curator, who is it that we are, how the contemporary curatorial role is constituted, and so on – we also need to be able to articulate the politics and ideologies that underlie the ways in which a particular practice shapes social and political change. This requires both a deep understanding of the social and a conceptual understanding of the concepts, but also an understanding of the contemporary condition and the world as a dynamic process that can be addressed in a way that is both ecological and progressive. It is important to draw on the experiences and knowledge of workers and youth in order to develop concepts and skills for how to live sustainably as artists and consumers of culture, but it is equally vital to work in a material sense and to create socially responsive practices that are ecological in their production and consumption. This is why biennials have to be places that are both places of habitation and sites of transition – places where structures and cultures are continually undergoing change – a consideration of which are central to the biennial form and the mode of its circulation. The biennale as a live form is constantly marked by change, and so is its social concomitant. But it is also a complex system that relies on a great many more forces than the sum of its periodic structures. The sum of these periodic summits and comings is the regularities and biases of the exhibitionary market that constantly invent, reshape and recommence new forms of exhibition and consumption. Art and curatorial practice is intimately tied to this market, and so art and the curatorial work that they produce inevitably enters into the very fabric of the biennial. It is a complex, but critical business, one that requires great skill, cunning and organisation, but also great amounts of</text>

In other words, it does not necessarily follow that the kind of theoretical and conceptual foundation of the art school can transform the practices of art within the art world. Modern art schools have always been materialist and capitalist, and their theoretical and conceptual orientations have been globalised (see, for instance, S. Rajamouli and S. Subrahmanyamurthy’s Cultural Theory: Globalisation and Materialism, Verso, London, 1980, and Geoffrey Pullum’s Culture and Capital, Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, 1987). But understanding, characterised by its articulation through material and concrete means, is different from understanding simply by its appearance or the habitual repetition of an idea or set of ideas. In both the social and the conceptual sense, understanding is a choice. And yet, despite its emphasis on the habitual and the norm, Marxist'S Cultural</text>

The question is where to put the collection�s curatorial priorities. The collection should be able to fulfill its curatorial priorities while remaining nongame, as opposed to the present situation in which the museum is often pressured to become a home for contemporary art exhibitions while simultaneously positioning the collection as if it were a museum).  A biennial is not a place where one can hide or magically disappear; it is a place where art is made visible, makes itself visible and is made to happen. It should be a place where art is made visible, makes itself visible and is made to happen. Unfortunately, in the current political and economic context, this kind of curatorial fluidity is under threat, and the collection is frequently left behind. The biennial format is experiencing a kind of temporalization, i.e. the art is made visible in front of what art critics are calling the ‘big five’ publishing houses, but also behind them all – at times appearing to be published in 2013 but actually happening in 2015.

Art’s downtown, then, should be able to offer a similar mix of experiences, in a city that is both home to the Museum of Modern Art, where the collection resides, and a museum that documents the city’s rapid growth and development. The question is where to put the collection�s curatorial focus.  The answer to this is two-fold: what is the museum that documents contemporary art’s growing up, and what kind of curatorial focus can the collection bring to bear on this growing up? If the curatorial focus is on the collection, then the question becomes whether the curatorial hand can either (a) move the collection forward in a sustained way, or (b) use the collection to investigate past and future art’s development in a way that is not reducible to the momentary interest of art’s market. The curatorial hand that is witness to art’s growing up, and can neither read nor analyze the art’s market, must therefore find new ways of engaging the art’s public in new ways.  Another question for the curatorial hand is what kind of curatorial hand can the collection bring to bear on art’s changing form, and what kinds of situations can the collection be</text>

The question is where to put the collection�s curatorial priorities, and the museum’s curatorial priorities, in a city that is both home to the Museum of Modern Art, where the collection resides, and a museum that documents the city’s rapid growth and development? The answer to this question is a great many locations – many cities have their own set of priorities, priorities that are not necessarily aligned with those of the Museum of Modern Art. For example, the Museum of Modern Art, which is a museum of modern art only, has a particular interest in addressing the cultural effects of postindustrialisation, but it is also a museum that documents the city as a systemically produced production (how the museum is part of this process is left to historians like myself to figure out).  A museum of the modern museum, then, must offer both a curatorial presence and a production (how the museum is produced and consumed). Both are, of course, required for a museum of the future to be reckoned with. The cur</text>

The question is where to put the collection�s curatorial priorities. The collection has often been described as being on a quest for meaning, but in truth, its collections would rather ponder the meaning of life itself. How might the collection achieve a deeper and more lasting engagement with the city? In conducting the 2018 Philharmonic, the Biennale decided to put the onus on the curatorial to initiate and push the conversation, rather than the other way around. The collection had too much on its shoulders. The audience, which had been invited to participate in a one-day workshop, was its first line of defense.  The collection’s collection manager, meanwhile, had built a vaulted ceiling and new lighting systems in an attempt to contain the ever-expanding collection within the building. The local community, which had been invited to contribute objects or set collections, was often left waiting for an explanation as to why the collection was either not there or was far too far gone to ever be utilised. The collection was often</text>

The question is where to put the collection�s curatorial focus and the museum’s curatorial mission, and how these intersect. The answer to this, as always, is in the city.  The Museum of Modern Art’s collection is housed in a complex of buildings on the city’s fringe, beyond the museum’s walls. It is a mix of old and new, of curators and museum visitors, of sorts. And it is a museum. Nevertheless, the collection’s primary purpose is to house the Museum of Modern Art’s collection, which is housed in three buildings on the museum’s grounds. This interconnection and sharing of resources is what makes the collection different from any museum. It is an effort to inhabit the same worlds, to be seen through the same filters. And it is a museum. In this sense, the collection is like a virtual museum, allowing visitors to different worlds and to experience different experiences. These collections, and the experiences they create, are</text>

The question is where to put the collection�s curatorial priorities.  The Museum of Modern Art has made an initiative, begun in 2015, to create a fully digital museum that records the collection’s history and present conditions. This is a museum that is both a physical manifestation of the collection’s internal processes of production, storage and transport, as well as a platform for the collection’s subsequent public works projects. The museum is a transition structure that records and represents the changing conditions of modern art, created and directed through the collection’s curatorial priorities. It is a user-friendly digital museum that records, as it were, the changing dynamics of the modern art market and the curatorial profession in the city.

This should be an open call for ideas and reports from around the country.  The question of where this biennial would be located should come as no surprise, considering that the site of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where the Museum of Modern Art’s significant collection of art and art’s products is housed, is located in the heart of downtown. Art’s downtown, then, should be able to offer a similar mix of experiences, in a city that is both home to the Museum of Modern Art, where the collection resides, and a museum that documents the city’s rapid growth and development. The question is where to put the collection�s curatorial priorities and curatorial agenda in a city that is both home to the Museum of Modern Art and a museum of the contemporary contemporary urban condition? This is a tricky call to make, and it comes down to where the collections fit into the city’s socio-political framework and urban/suburban nexus. The collection should be able to anchor in its chosen spot, but it should also be able to expand and map new experiences and situations. For example, the collection should be able to acquire knowledge and knowledge of its surroundings, but it should also be able to translate this knowledge and knowledge into new situations.  A biennial may come and go, but it is an experience that remains, and can last for many years to come. Its status as a collection, and its curatorial composition, should reflect this.  The biennial form was originally intended to last for a specified number of years, with various curatorial disciplines and sub-disciplines developing and augmenting the</text>

The question is where to put the collection�s curatorial priorities, a question that can be posed by any museum or collection. This biennial should come from the heart of the metropolis, and its curatorial priorities should come from the museum or collection that provides the most value to the metropolis. In other words, it’s the mix of values, both cultural and urban, that creates the city. What makes the city is the combination of cultural values (ideology, history, etc) and the city’s infrastructure – roads, bridges, tunnels, streets, parks, etc. – which together form the urban fabric. If the collection or museum is focused on a single value (like, say, art, architecture, or urban history), then the infrastructure (roads, bridges, tunnels, buildings) that support those values is of course a much less desirable quality of infrastructure. But the aim of the collection or museum should be to support a shared set of values across the city, rather than to provide an idealised</text>

The question is where to put the collection�s collections and its infrastructure in such a way as to enable a live-work, collaborative process between art institution and community. The recommendation to locate the art primarily in the Museum of Modern Art, where the collection resides, seems to me the most promising.  The challenge now is for the other three institutions to follow suit and for the community to create something like a biennial that is not just a collection of art, but a living organism, capable of growing and changing according to the needs and desires of the community. This may require new curatorial approaches and a complete rethink of how art is presented and collected. In the coming years, I predict that the biennial will be more like a museum, with exhibits and a curatorial focus, than like an art institution, with its collections and live-work programme. The key to the museum becoming more like a biennial is the emergence of a community of artists and curators who are able to see the similarities but also differentiate between the two.</text>

The question is where to put the collection�s objects – both contemporary and museum-worthy – in a city that is both home to several contemporary art institutions, and a museum that documents the connections between these institutions and their broader social and spatial contexts. In other words, the collection as a site of gathering and destination. The Museum of Modern Art has recently begun a new phase of its collection, this one focused on its collection as a whole.  The Museum of Modern Art, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, has a sizable collection of art, some 1,500 objects in all.  The collection as a whole constitutes a much larger collection of objects, and the collection as a whole is a site of gathering place and destination. The collection as a whole, however, is a site of holding and destination.  The significance of this collection as a whole, and the heterogeneity of its contents, cannot be overstated. Each item in the collection, whether contemporary or museum-worthy, represents a different kind of experience; each is</text>

These interventions may be used to create new situations, or they may become established forms of existing. That is, they may become oppressive and create new forms of oppression. The choice is up to the curatorial and artistic community to use this material constructively or oppressively. One thing is for sure: if the end result is oppressive, it will remain so. The choice is up to the individual curatorial artist to use this material constructively or in such a way as to actively participate in creating new oppressive conditions. The choice is up to the community as a whole to use this material constructively or in such a way as to actively participate in creating new oppressive conditions.

They are not here to be of service to, or an interpretation of, past or future urban development; they are there to be changed. In the end, they are there to be changed. But that is what history is about: change. This is why the curators here at The Municipal have the idea that they are changing the city through dialogue, even if it is only through changing the very people who live in and around the building. They are changing the very fabric of the city, changing its character, even though at the same time it is quite possible that in a few years, when the buildings are knocked down and the history is made clear, those very same people will be asking themselves and others, when and where in the city should the new museums be located? What kind of a dialogue should the city have with respect to its urban fabric? What kinds of conditions should it strive to eliminate? If the city is to</text>

The notion of the ‘future city’ refers to the developed metropolis that is at the same time subject to natural and man-made disasters, but also to catastrophic climate change. The notion of the ‘present city’ refers to the urban core, but also the suburbs and rural areas that are affected by urban sprawl and are expected to be affected by rising sea levels. The present city is expected to adapt to these new conditions, but it is also expected to become increasingly variable in its ability to adapt. As sea levels rise and cities expand, the future city is expected to get more like the present and less like the past – subject to</text>

They are not a set of absolute rules, but rather a starting point for developing further practices and objects relevant to the present, and of which the present is the final outcome. This is an opportunity for the curatorial, research-based or museum-based organisation to adopt or adapt these first-wave interventions into their curatorial or museum-based work. or to actively participate in the development of such practices and objects. The two main curatorial bodies in Canada, the National Gallery and the Calgary Museum of Art, for example, have their origins in the Civil War Museums, established in 1896 and 1910 respectively, and the Canadian War Museums, founded in 1917. The Civil War Museums emerged due to the strong influence of the Modernist Museum movement, whose publications on art and culture were published between the two wars.

They are works that emerge, mature and function in the context of the exhibition, but are also places where they can nonetheless be used to make a difference. That is, they can change and they might have unintended consequences, but they also have the potential to be used wrongly or badly. This is intended to be a self-starting project, and the curatorial calls for it to mature and to function in new ways through feedback. The curatorial call for it to happen comes as no surprise to researchers who have been looking into what happened in the 1990s. There is a call to create participatory art, and to undertake long-term, multi-year projects with artists’ unions and other stakeholders to bring about change. However, there is also a limit to how much genuine engagement and democracy can be brought about by such initiatives. It is not enough to want more meetings with the artist’</text>

The title of the exhibition is a catalyst for the user of these terms to action: to action, to ideas, to actions. It is a modifier of meaning, and the title is a trigger. I have chosen to treat these as though they were actions, and my own &quot;back stories&quot; as though they were entanglements. These back stories would be my reflections, my own version of the city’s past, which I believe is very important in understanding the present and the present, and which inform how we think about the future. But they would also be works that were commissioned by the city or a municipality, or both. That is, works that were explicitly or implicitly targeted at a specific audience or set of audiences. It is easy to create an experience that is specific to a specific audience: to a city or a locality. But doing</text>

It will attempt to identify those cultural practices or assets that are most relevant in the current political and social situation, while recognising the role that art and artists can play in resisting, intervening in and creating change. The curatorial approach suggested here is a first step in the right direction, and it is necessary to continually expand and refine it in order to meet the changes that need to be faced and to provide the maximum impact. The curatorial and curatorial disciplines are interwoven, and the boundaries between them can be blurred. But they all have to be seen to be believed.

This is possible through dialogue, and the curatorial interventions suggested here are intended to be used where necessary, but also as a tool to intervene in situations where dialogue is clearly not desired. They are not intended to change the past, but to question how we conceive of the past, especially as it relates to urbanisation and the future of the city. The idea of the future city is to some extent a projection of the past, and the past is not always what we wish it was. The choice to engage with the past in the present is a difficult one, and the methodologies suggested here may or may not be ideal, but they may help us to develop strategies to question the assumptions and desires that create the structures that support or constrain growth in the present. This is true of developments in urbanisation worldwide. New ideas of how to inhabit the built environment are continually being proposed, but the challenge is to evaluate whether the projects are actually solutions to the problems that are produced by the built environment, rather than the solutions that emerge from engaging with the built environment in new and creative ways. This is perhaps the present situation in many cities worldwide.</text>

This is one reason why machine learning is so powerful: it is able to ‘learn’ through data, and thus all manner of unpredictable outcomes can be programmed into the system.Another reason why machine learning is able to achieve such massive changes is that it relies on very specific data – actions, data – that are gathered and transmitted constantly over the networked world. If the behavior of individual objects in the real world is programmed into the algorithms, there is no way to change that behavior – not even with the users of the systems. This is why disruptive software designs, including those found in social networks, are able to evolve and change in ways that are beyond the immediate control of the developers – able to change the way we connect, what we post online, what we shop for, and so forth.Machine learning is able to achieve these seemingly impossible goals because the data underlying the systems is captured and transmitted constantly through the use of protocols – codes that seek to separate truth from error and symbols that tell the computer what to do.

In this sense, grass-roots organizing is an iterative process that involves many data points – including humans – and the interaction of many different data points. The interface is a data point that constantly records and transmits information to and from the computer. Unlike other types of data, which typically have multiple meanings or context, the data that make up the interface is understood by a single point of entry and by a single point of exit.

In other words, it’s not just the situation of the individual, but the whole situation is subject to algorithm.Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the systematic generation and use of data, particularly of large amounts of data, through the use of algorithms.[1] It is a form of artificial intelligence that seeks to understand the underlying principles of the world through data.[2] It achieves this through a combination of mathematical and human mechanisms, and the interaction of many data points. The term ‘machine learning’ is often used synonymously with vernacular, but unlike other artificial intelligence techniques, its underlying principles are immutable and irreversible. This means that machine learning cannot be taught, nor can it be implemented into a system (like a computer) – only the underlying principles can be changed and changed again through repeated programming. This is one reason why machine learning is so powerful: it is able to change its form and structure over and over again, constantly renewing itself through repeated programming. This repeats itself in parallel across many nodes in a complex network, called  	induction bay. Machine learning algorithms thus learn to repeat themselves – change form, change function, and so on. Machines that understand language could also learn to do this, as well as other forms of artificial intelligence.Another reason why ‘machine learning’ is able to evolve in parallel is the fact that ‘human error’ is constantly incorporated into the system through the use of language, cultural values and so forth. If an algorithm encounters a problem that cannot be automated, such as learning to recognize an art form, it adds additional logic to the equation to recognize artistic talent rather than pure human talent. A more general statement of this kind of thing is beyond the scope of this article, but the parallelisms that machine learning algorithms run into every day are striking. As an example, consider the use of</text>

This means that machine learning cannot be taught, nor can it be implemented into a system (like a computer) – only the underlying principles can be changed and changed again through repeated programming. This is one reason why machine learning is so powerful: it is able to expand and contract the underlying data, continually changing the underlying assumptions and underlying structures, continually learning more and more, and thus continuously evolving itself.Machine learning is also able to deal with more complex data, through the use of deep neural networks, which are type of deep reinforcement learning algorithms.[3] These networks learn to recognise simple patterns, building on previous experience and data, and thus can easily be programmed into larger and more pervasive systems. For example, the networks that underpin the web browser and social media applications can be trained to recognise patterns such as hashtags and songs, and thus can easily be programmed with deep learning to recognise pictures and videos, pictures and videos, and other images and multimedia content.Another reason why the web is such a powerful tool is that it is both static and ephemeral – ever on the same page, always available at the top of the web page. This makes it possible to embed content or images in the page without actually having that content or image installed</text>

This is one reason why machine learning is so powerful: it is able to evolve and change at such a rate that it becomes fundamentally unrecognisable as human behaviour.Another reason is that ‘human error’ is a much more prevalent cause of error in the world than can be fixed, and thus algorithms are able to detect and correct for this error far more readily than humans can. A number of studies over the years have shown that performing poorly on an algorithmically generated task is not a conscious decision, but instead comes about as a consequence of the underlying mathematical and human mechanisms that allow the algorithm to work. For example, in 2014, a study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Georgia Institute of Technology found that performing poorly on a computerised task is as easy as choosing between two options: take an option one option and vice versa. In this sense, there are two distinct systems that are operating at the same time: the world around us and the internet. Assemblage of Behaviour[3] is a group project at Cardiff University,</text>

This means that machine learning cannot be taught, nor can it be implemented into a system (like a computer) – only the underlying principles can be changed and changed again through repeated programming. This is one reason why machine learning is so powerful: it is able to evolve and change at such a pace that it cannot be contained or controlled. So one of the ways in which machine learning is able to expand its scope and change, is because of the unreliability and speed of data that it consumes. As a data point, data consumes more energy per byte sent to it, than any other kind of data. This is one reason why large datasets – those larger than the human range of thought – are able to hold such massive amounts of information, and why vernacular approaches to data – those employing text or image processing – are also able to hold this kind of information.Machine learning is able to do this because it subscribes to different kinds of data, and because it categorises these different kinds of data according to certain principles. For example, it is able to classify images into categories, based on features such as colour, shape or number, rather than treating them as discrete entities.

This is one reason why machine learning is so powerful: it is able to change its form and content at will, and to continually reinterpret its understanding of the world through data.So far, we’ve focused on the mechanisms of machine learning, but there are many more that play a part in the underlying principles of artificial intelligence. These include:1. The human factor. Humans are the fundamental units of analysis and discourse in the digital age, and yet it is machines – not us – that exert significant influence over what is and is not considered possible. There are many forms of automation today, but one of the ways in which machines understand the world is through data. Given a set of data, a machine might infer truths about the world through its mathematical formulas, or it might implement a philosophy or ethics based on data that derives directly from the software that runs the computer (as opposed to thinking processes that derive directly from the hardware). While both of these possibilities are possible, they are not ethical; they are just ways of organizing knowledge in the world.</text>

This is one reason why machine learning is so powerful: it is able to change its form and make itself known, constantly evolving and mapping the world according to new data.[3] A more subtle but crucial reason is that ‘machine learning’ relies on very specific data structures and abstractions, which render programming more difficult and variable – allowing the developer to specify what data structures and abstractions are used, and for what reasons.[4] For instance, programming a computer to deal with images of dogs instead of humans becomes computationally infeasible, because the data sets involved are so vast and varied. Machine learning algorithms therefore need to be programmed to deal with images of dogs, because the data sets involved are so limited and specific. Machine learning algorithms also need to be instructed by humans in order to work, so that the underlying mathematical structures and data structures can be programmed with certain behaviours and dialects of human language. This last requirement is what makes machine learning so powerful: it allows the underlying mathematical abstractions to be adjusted to meet human needs and</text>

This is one reason why machine learning is so powerful: it is able to solve complex problems because the underlying principles are immutable and irreversible, making it possible to change the underlying mathematical structures and data processing in a way that attests to the underlying principles rather than blindly implementing them as specified by the computer.Another reason why machine learning is able to solve complex problems is because the underlying mathematical structures and data processing that enable it are often described as being ‘holistic’ in nature. This is often taken to mean that the systems that are programmed into a computer are motivated by a set of values, rather than being self-interested or exhibiting any kind of intrinsic 'good' or ‘bad’ intrinsic behaviour. Supposing, of course, that the programmer has fully agency within the computer, and that he or she exhibits no intrinsic values – that is, does not exist in the traditional computer sense. In traditional computer programming, the programmer exhibits a set of behaviours – a set of ‘language rules’ – and these rules determine what actions can</text>

The phrase ‘Machines making movies’ appears again and again, in various incarnations, in various contexts, and in different intensities. One can study the historical trajectory of this idea (and others like it) through various curatorial approaches: curatorial as media (new media have their place in a museum, after all), as a curator in a museum (a role that is both highly visible and highly specific), as a researcher in visual arts (a.k.a. a curator in the museum), and, of course, as a filmmaker (a.k.a. a filmmaker). All these different approaches require a particular set of skills and knowledge, which are, in turn, subject to different standards. As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is.

As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is. You need to be able to pick up on subtleties in language (cultural linguists call this ‘intermediary structure’), and you need to be able to pick up on nuances in cultural consumption (cultural capitalism is a big business these days, and distinguishing between the artist and consumer is often hard, if not impossible). And you need to be able to pick up on cultural flows across different cities and different cultures. That last bit is the most difficult. The cultural theorist Adam Szymczyk has a term for this: cultural colonialism. Skilled cultural administrators can do far more than administrators of land and financial resources: they can infuse culture with the kind of grassroots democracy and direct-to-consumerism politics of direct democracy that are at the core of the contemporary movement for social and economic change, and can do this through whatever mediums they choose. For Szymczyk, cultural administrators aren’t just interested in the objects they acquire: they strive to create</text>

All these different approaches require a particular set of skills and knowledge, which are, in turn, subject to different standards. As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is. You need to know what a mirror is. You need to know that works of art are made by artists, and that the work they create is valuable. You need to know that art is made possible through technologies, and that when that technology is disrupted, things can still be art’s way of telling stories. If all these different kinds of work were possible in a museum, then the museum would be the place to look for them. Curatorial narratives often tell us something about the mode of artistic production in a specific culture, and the kind of cultural politics underpinning that production. Curatorial narrations are more like moments in a gallery show: they capture the essence of a moment, making it easier to comprehend what that essence is. And because such moments occur almost always in a museum, they are a kind of historical document of a particular moment in time. A museum, by contrast, is an office building, with its dark, damp and sometimes hostile work environments (one has to be</text>

All these different approaches require a particular set of skills and knowledge, which are, in turn, subject to different standards. As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is. You need to be able to read between the lines, and to understand how the systems that create the art are put together. And you need to be able to ask, rather than have a head-start of sorts, which is sometimes given to people by their institutional training and other times needs developing itself.In this sense, the museum is a ‘living room’ – a room where images can be taken, a library where images can be found, a stage for performances, a marketplace for products and services, and a scene in which acts of commerce can be established. It is a ‘recipe’ that is constantly evolving, subject to changes in its users, and that constantly needs updating. As such, the museum is a space where new modes of being are created, and in which images can be taken and disseminated. Indeed, it is a space where images can ‘memento’ of the past, making their presence felt through figurative packaging, museum</text>

As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is. You need to be able to pick up on the history of photography and film, and also have some basic knowledge of English (the role of the artist today is made more difficult by the ubiquity of electronic media). And you need to be able to speak the language (English as a second language, or ASL, is a huge global market today). In other words, you need to be able to pick up on the history of art and visual culture, and perhaps to understand how art is made and consumed today.The fact that the biennial format has come to dominate the visual arts is a consequence of a convergence of several factors: a) the technological innovations of the 1980s, which made it easier to create a multi-media work (pictures, videos, music, maps); b) the increased accessibility of visual arts materials (leather, text, maps); c) the proliferation of arts programming (programming languages: ASL, programming, games, graffiti); d) the</text>

As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is. You need to have the tools (the knowledge) to decipher language, and you need to be able to imagine your way into a place (a visual medium). But beyond that, you need to have the heart (the will) to pull the trigger. You need to feel like you have the ability (the will) to do it. Sometimes, that will mean putting your own self at risk.This all sounds a little bit simplistic, and it is, at first glance. But think about it: even though we know that something we have done is wrong, we do not know what that something is, or how to do it. We do not even know what the tools are. And now imagine trying to imagine that you could be that person. There are many forms of cultural appropriation today, and we do not even know what those tools were. Maybe the most insidious form of cultural appropriation today is being done through the use of social media, which is turning cultural capital into a commodity rather than</text>

And you need to know how to negotiate the differences between the different cultures that make up the ‘museum world’.I come to all this from personal experience. I am, as the saying goes, an ‘Empire State of Mind’ superfan. I am drawn to all the different worlds that these machines construct, and I watch them make movies with various voices, intonations, dialects, cultures and languages. I am also a maker, and I enrich the world I come into through my art. Films, television programmes, sculptures, poetry, songs, poetry, music, videos – I have my art aimed directly at people, places and times. I am interested in the ways in which art, and the work that comes with it, shapes our conceptions of the world. I have done this not through scholarly work, as most curators do, but through what</text>

As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is. You need to be able to map the museum (and/or a particular cultural theory museum) and its space and time, and to know how to ask genuine questions of the museum. You need to be able to change from one situation (taking up residence in a museum, for instance, or visiting a curatorial practice) to another (taking part in a curatorial thinking through a museum, or visiting a museum), and to a certain extent, to a certain extent. And of course, you need to be able to change from the museum to the world outside the museum, and vice versa. Curatorial practice is a dynamic, shifting thing, and it is easy to become lost in the shuffle, unable to keep up with the changes that are so rapid and so pervasive in the art world. That is, the museum is a transient stage, and the world is a much messier place outside the museum. But this dynamic is difficult to grasp, and perhaps one reason for the reluctance of</text>

As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is. You need to know how to ask the right questions, and not just in front of a mirror (although that will be obvious in the film below, where the audience is encouraged to ask insightful questions). You need to be able to master the hierarchy of meanings, and the systems that enable us to understand and manipulate them. And most of all, you need to be able to ask questions that the audience won’t soon understand. I propose the idea of the cult of the smoothie, in order to give the context in which work can be understood in a way that is both accessible and that the audience will understand. This may be seen as a subtle curatorial move, but it has proved very useful for the film industry in its quest for image. The smoothie is a media phenomenon, and its ubiquity makes it easy to understand how image becomes meaning. The smoothie is a useful concept in its multiple guises: a metaphor, a point of origin, a ritual. But the</text>

This may take the form of picking up a museum book or a museum pamphlet, or it may involve sitting through a video lecture, which is increasingly popular with curators and art historians. I also want to make clear that when I talk about the historical trajectory of computer programming, I am not talking about people who grew up in the 1980s or 1990s; I am talking about people who have relevant career and technical know-how. Today, computer programming is considered ‘professionally tradable’ within a professional network of software developers and academics; within the computer systems and hardware that are the product of the past; and, increasingly, in the relational databases that are the products of the future. So the notion of the machine becomes less about the maker and more about the system that produces the things that are made. And in this context, the project becomes less about the individual and more about the system that is replacing what used to be called the human race.  And what does replace</text>

As a visitor to a museum, you need to be able to pick up where the museum left off, and to know where the mirror is. The mirror is a metaphor: it is both the source and the end of the work produced by the machine. It is neither here nor there, and thus, unlike the machine, it is not subject to the laws of physics or human history. In this sense, it is both metaphor and science fiction. The mirror is a construction that cannot really exist, or at least cannot be simulated.‘Machines making movies’ is a kind of meta-metaphor that is deeper than the machine that is often cited as a singular reason to explore the work of art in the context of computer programming. It is also a kind of proto-psychology that will map directly onto the work of art produced by the machine. A kind of meta-narrative that is both literal and metaphorical, and which seeks to lay out the world through the specific programming of machines. A kind of meta-narrative that is able to map directly onto the actuality of artistic production, and</text>

This is the kind of radical thinking that might change the face of art tourism.

And while the details may vary, the themes and techniques may differ, and the biennial can and should, there is always a common denominator. The importance of cultural belongingness cannot be understated. Artists, curators, art historians, art administrators, art writers – everyone with a stake in the artistic direction of their art – has a role to play in imagining possible futures for their art, and in shaping the art that comes out of the biennial. Without their input, this would be possible, but at this point in time, everyone but the most rigid enforcers of art-historical fact could be countedenance the possibility that art might once again, albeit tentatively, be found in the city.Download this article as PDFAlexey SavrasovAlexey Savrasov is an independent writer, curator,</text>

The Biennial could become something completely different – a once-in-a-generation cultural monument. Meanwhile, the city grows increasingly distant and numbed to the point of absurdity. In the coming years, people are likely to pay a lot more attention to the art and culture they inhabit. This scenario would be terrifying for the Biennial, but also quite popular with visitors. As biennials become more and more institutionalised, the city would regain some of its cultural potency. The stigma would be lifted from the idea, and the city would once again exhibit its cultural potential. In order to achieve this kind of transformation, long-term cultural planners would have to engage the public on an emotional level – in a way that artists and the city can only dream of. The city would have to embrace the biennial as an actual cultural form, and it would have to be accompanied by an artistic director who could convince policymakers that the city was a truly cultural entity.

The Biennial could become something completely different – a museum of culture, dedicated to the art and activism of the marginalized.We started by questioning whether the Biennial could become a museum of culture. In truth, we didn’t know what the museum of culture meant then, and we don’t mean it now. We just knew that the museum of culture was a place where ideas from different periods were brought together to form a coherent whole. In the museum of culture, ideas from different periods are brought together to form a coherent whole. We believe that the museum of culture should be a place where ideas from different periods can be brought together to form a coherent whole. We invited local artists and arts professionals to take part in a exploratory tour of the city that would enable them to develop cultural theory from the ground up, through an in-depth look at the past, and into the future. The museum of culture would become an extension of their practice, a place where they could explore the wider social and political context of their work,</text>

The Biennial could become something completely different – a regular museum, or it could become something completely different. This is the kind of situation that the museum has been trying to avoid becoming. It is also the kind of situation that a city like Venice, which has supported the Biennial since its inception in 1999, could play. There is a danger that the Biennial could become something completely different. It could also become something that serves tourism, in the sense of the old adage: ‘For the Venetians, and anyone else interested in history and culture’. This last possibility is the kind of historical-cultural hybridization that New York, London and other major cities have been actively pursuing. It is a hybrid between art institution and cultural tourism entity, cultural tourism entity and a host of other forms of cultural tourism entities. It’s time to deliver a lesson in Cultural Theory to the Biennial in the form of a museum. Art-historical society may not like it, and it may not be able to change,</text>

The Biennial could become something completely different – a museum of natural history, or even a museum of art in its own right. This would be unprecedented in its own right. It would mark a radical shift in how art is understood, experienced and represented in the city, and it would put an end to the museum-industry-like dependency on tourism as a form of local currency. And here is where the biennial becomes art. The change would be spectacular, and it would put the Biennial in the vanguard of a new kind of cultural capital. But at the same time, it would mean breaking with the tradition of the art museum and its dependency on the city for its structure. Art would have to change or dissolve itself as a form of art, depending on what became of the Biennial. And this is the dilemma that the Biennial faces: it can either become the museum of its own preservation, or it can become something completely new, which would place it outside the museum.

The Biennial could become something completely different – a museum with a permanent collection of works curated by a board of directors, committed to a particular curatorial style and agenda. This is the trajectory most biennials have taken up to this point. The board of directors may well want to expand the museum, and the board of directors may well want to cull the museum, but they don’t necessarily need to. The board of directors may simply want to add more material to the museum, and they certainly don’t need to change the museum’s form or structure. When the Biennial was originally conceived, its focus was on the Venice Architecture Biennale, and the museum as a collection of selected works from the biennale. Today, the biennial, as a form, is a city-wide event, usually involving a number of related activities such as exhibitions, performances, events and so forth. It’s quite possible that the board of directors may want to add another event to the biennial calendar,</text>
    <text>The postponed 2021 Biennial, to be held in October 2022 at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, is a move that many in the community deem a betrayal. What seems to have escaped the notice of many in the local art world is the extent to which the Biennial will be controlled by the city and, to a greater extent, the museum. If the Biennial is to become a museum, it will have to adopt a curator-like role in the museum. With the city in control, the Biennial can no longer operate as an independent entity. The museum will have to step in when the Biennial is not meeting its own standards. If it's not meeting its standards, it will have to change them. In 2022, the museum could even cancel the event. This seems overly dramatic, but in the face of the unprecedented overcrowding, over-dependence on tourism and biennials as a form of mainstream cultural importation, the unthinkable could happen. The Biennial could become something completely different – a once-in-a-generation cultural experience that transcends its region and country, and stands out as a unique artistic achievement amongst a city's diverse cultural landscapes. This is the kind of radical change that biennials can achieve, and it is happening right now. The question is, will other cultural centres follow suit? If they do, we could all benefit. 6. Art and the social transformation of art’s social contexts, c. 1970s To mid-1990s. 	Art and social change are often defined as the effects of state and capitalist socialisation. But the historical and contemporary evolution of art’s social dynamics and its relationship to the state is important for our interests, as biennials. 	The social transformation of the artworld is a complex process that requires great commitment and organisation. The aim of this contribution is to look at an important aspect of this in the 1970s and to consider how the social qualities of art are influencing and are influenced</text>

The Biennial could become something completely different – a museum. And this is where art and the biennial meet again. The biennial is a meeting space where artists, curators and art administrators come together to explore, discuss and produce work in progress, or ‘migrate’. It’s an evolving space that produces and reflects on its own activities. It requires frequent and continuous updating. It is a place where artists can experiment, make mistakes and grow from there. Art, the museum and the biennial are not mutually exclusive forms, and art institutions can and must engage with and contribute to a metropolis’s development. 	The biennial has always been a meeting place for a specific set of priorities and needs. Today, it’s a collection of disparate collections that collectively and ultimately aim to produce works of art or significant contributions to urban development in the metropolis. The biennial is a space in which art is often read as a replacement for infrastructure or mass media, and it’s a</text>

The Biennial could become something completely different – a museum of cultural importation, or (better yet) a museum of cultural exchange. This is the kind of museum that Emily Pringle wanted to build, and which many artists aspire to be. It’s the kind of museum that would engage, educate and move people, not in a lecture or a lecture about art, but in a kind of cultural, historical and practical way. It would engage, educate and move people through exhibitions, public programs, research projects and other activities that artists and curators generally reserve for museums. It would supply the art and artists with the tools they need to create works of exchange and spread their cultural practices globally. It would show the culture of its places, explaining why they are places and what they mean to each other. It would show contemporary art making practices from every conceivable angle, including the inherent limitations and tensions of space, and would do so in the face of a seemingly never-ceasing stream of media and economic promotion. It would do so in</text>

The decision to postpone the event until 2022 was a clear attempt to force the Biennial into the future, while its other, more structural problems made it seem as if the festival was somehow trapped in the past.  In an attempt to move the festival away from its present location in the heart of the city, a new biennial would have had to address the city’s present crisis of housing and homelessness, while simultaneously rebuilding a new, mythical ‘city’ around the festival. The decision to dedicate an entire festival to the eradication of homelessness seems rather ridiculous, since there is already such a crisis going on in the city.  The Biennial has repeatedly postponed the next edition of its eventful Nuit Blanche pavilion in the Place Royale, despite persistent rumours that the installation is nearing completion and that the Biennial will host another, smaller pavilion in the future.  The decision to completely deconstruct the space of the biennial seems especially bizarre given the festival’s history. In 1992, the Biennale was moved back in time from the arty-championing year of ‘92’ to ‘97’, while the Biennale of London in</text>

The decision to postpone the event until 2022 was a clear attempt to force the Biennial into the future, while its other, more structural problems made it seem as if the festival was somehow trapped in the past.  In an effort to return to the festival experience, the Biennial has invited artists from the past to collaborate with the present, though these collaborations often seem forced and opportunistic, as though the festival is constantly on the verge of reinventing itself.  A third biennial, planned for Montreal but ultimately for the Bay Area, would further experiment with this structural shift.  The Biennial’s current crisis of overproduction and urban blight is a direct result of this third act of the festival. The biennial as a whole is experiencing its own crisis of overproduction and urban blight, as art institutions around the world scramble to deliver the ever-present commodity of art in the most consumable form possible.Art is often cited as a political tool, but its real power lies in its ability to disturb, to create uncertainty around, and even to embrace uncertainty.  Art is political because it creates uncertainty; it breaks through the seeming certainty of the contemporary to reveal a potential future for art that can never be</text>

The decision to postpone the event until 2022 was a clear attempt to force the Biennial into the future, while its other, more structural problems made it seem as if the festival was somehow trapped in the past.  In an ironic twist, the festival itself is actually a catalyst for a new generation of artists to be born in the city.  The festival is an event in itself, but it is also a site where protest, activism and art take place, producing new ideas and questioning old questions. In that sense, it is much more than just the art fair held at a local art centre. It is an event that can produce new ways of engaging with the city, questions around gentrification and the postindustrial city, and questions of urbanicity and urban politics.  The festival has even been shown in high-end venues such as Venice, using the money from the sale of artworks to support the development of its sister organisation, the Biennale.  It is one thing to show a project through the festival, but quite another to actually commission the artworks? This is an issue that has divided practitioners for a long time.

The decision to postpone the event until 2022 was a clear attempt to force the Biennial into the future, while its other, more structural problems made it seem as if the festival was somehow trapped in the past.  In an effort to make the festival more like the other venues it visits, the Biennial could have staged a city loop that brings visitors back again and again, like a tourism board that gathers information from everywhere it goes and distributes it across the city. In this scenario, the ‘festival-as-system’ would have become a myth and the festival-as-place would have become a collection of images.  When we think of the modern biennial, we picture museums or ancient graveyards, but the real artists we tend to think of are those who emerge out of the contemporary environment, those artists who create in the images we share, those moments that make us speak, laugh, cry and take stock.  And we can design biennials to be those moments, helping to define the kind of place we want to be called, the kind of image we want to project and the kind of culture we want to consume.A museum or an ancient cemetery?Modern bienn</text>

The decision to postpone the event until 2022 was a clear attempt to force the Biennial into the future, while its other, more structural problems made it seem as if the festival was somehow trapped in the past.  In an attempt to recapture the festival’s theatrical energy, the Biennial decided to create a dedicated year-round platform, dubbing it ‘the present’ and promising to ‘work with and learn from the past’ as it evolves. The festival was to do away with its Sunday format and create a ‘time capsule’ of its own.  The opening salvos of protest from the 1990s, when artists, academics, writers, rally leaders and city dwellers showed their opposition to the event reflected the anxieties of the city’s future urban presence. The Biennial’s decision to create a city around itself in the years to come reflected a similar impulse.  It began with a ‘T-shirt with a question mark around the perimeter’ and a small-scale version of the ‘monument to urbanization’ that is the subject of Jean-Luc Nancy’s seminal book  	Towards a</text>

The decision to postpone the event until 2022 was a clear attempt to force the Biennial into the future, while its other, more structural problems made it seem as if the festival was somehow trapped in the past.  In an effort to make the festival more palatable to artists, the Biennial offered a co-registration system, in which artists would get a cut of the money raised at the festival, while festival goers would pay a nominal fee to enter the art fair.  The system seemed like a reasonable compromise, while still allowing the festival access to the proceeds of its success, although it soon became clear that the money would be better used developing the city’s notorious drug war. The Biennial’s funding streams have always been conditional on the art being judged as having a significant impact on the city, and so the art fair became the place where the artists could expect to find that much guaranteed goodwill.  The public could have encouraged the festival by offering to buy a spot in one of the many permanent art galleries that it established over the years, and encouraging the Biennial to establish a permanent art gallery in the city.

In an odd twist, the new version of the festival frequently attempts to pre-figure the former, attempting to imitate its informal, disorienting nature while also questioning its institutional efficacy.  The festival was even accused of beginning to resemble, if not collaborator with, the original.  It seems the festival is stranded in the present, unable to confront the past or envision new options, which is itself itself itself somewhat of a gamble.  The festival often seems to be conducting an in-depth version of the political-economic-cultural-experiment known as ‘Project: Wire’, an important aspect of which is its collaboration with the East London School of Art's (ELS) East London Community Land Trust and East London Architecture Project. This distributed, collaborative management system envisages a return to a pre-industrial economy through a future that does away with large corporations and their fixed structure, but with a major emphasis on creating new ways of being active in the city.   ELS East</text>

The decision to postpone the event until 2022 was a clear attempt to force the Biennial into the future, while its other, more structural problems made it seem as if the festival was somehow trapped in the past.  In an effort to make its events more social, the Biennial has focused heavily on the fact that they take place in cities, while neglecting to mention that these are the very same cities that were the site of the 2015 Paris Climate Accords negotiations and that host for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  A key finding of the Soccer Futures research project is that: ‘In 2035, the city represents over half of the biennial market.’  This prediction is especially significant given that the Paris Climate Accords will mean that over a quarter of a million new jobs will be created in the host city alone.  A third of the anticipated revenue from the 2022 World Cup will come from the sale of housing, infrastructure, parks and historic sites. ‘The Biennial is a brilliant business decision that can double or even triple the value of the buildings it builds.’ This prediction was made by the Soccer Futures research project, which was started in 2000 and funded</text>

In an effort to be present in the future, the Biennial needs to be able to engage with the present and move it forward.  This may mean engaging with the present in different ways, but it also means developing strategies that are capable of influencing the future in fundamentally different ways.The decision to delay the event until 2022 seems to have been motivated by the festival’s failure to attract sufficient financial support from early in its history. The financial crisis in 2009-2010 saw a rapid expansion of the festival’s artist advisory board, and the subsequent hiring of several artists who would later be involved in the Biennial event but who were not part of its initial artist advisory group.  The biennial’s 2013 Horizon initiative seems to have exacerbated this crisis by hiring a large number of artists from outside the UK and Europe, who were invited to participate in a promotional tour through of the city that was not based in the UK and Europe. Many of them ended up moving to Sao Paulo or Berlin</text>

In an effort to make the festival into something more contemporary and contemporary, the Biennial decided to create a platform for its artist-in-residence programme to explore ‘present-day issues and concerns in a cultural manner’.  The revised proposal to bring the artist-in-residence programme into the present is even more ambitious, though it does not specify what kind of a cultural way the future arts programme should take.  The new proposal calls for a symposium format, with the artist-in-residence programme and the museum as two parts, with the museum serving as a node of action within the city. The artist-in-residence programme is invited to take part in a symposium, but not to propose a course in architecture or urbanism as a museum’s ‘primary curatorial tool and platform’.  The fact that the symposium format is proposed in advance, and that the proposed course is to be delivered as an alternative to the main</text>

We also looked at anthropology from the point of view of aesthetics and visual culture. I became interested in how different anthropologist disciplines looked at the same geographical place. For example, the study of American Indian religions led to different approaches to how these social structures might be constructed through aesthetic means. For me, the importance of cultural anthropology wasn’t in finding common ground with other disciplines, but rather in understanding how we might build upon what we already have.For example, the archaeology of language offered us different ways of understanding similar linguistic structures.

The system must be able to detect and address these complexities, but it should also be able to detect and address fundamental, if difficult-to-detect, art imbalances and trends. That is, the heart of the art market must be able to sustain periodic fluctuations in the quality of artistic and curatorial attention. 	Such is the  	systemic, but also the contemporary, art market. The contemporary art market is a complex and shifting target market. It is populated by collectors, contemporary artists, contemporary creative professionals, and an eclectic mix of other art collectors and curators. It is also constantly buffeted by unpredictable, but potentially valuable, market forces, both financial and otherwise. As a marketer of contemporary art, you’re constantly juggling the needs of different stakeholders in the market, from the curators of art fairs to art institutions to wealthy collectors seeking out high-quality contemporary art, to the increasingly precarious precarious artists and creative professionals searching for long-term employment. 	The current political situation in Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza and the West Bank, and the increasing economic reliance on fossil fuels does not appear to be giving any artists</text>

In short, a curatorial system for the exhibition of art and cultural activity on European and global scales must be flexible enough to detect and address fundamental art imbalances and trends, but flexible enough to simultaneously generate new art and entice new art from abroad.I have often heard the claim that there is an art shortage crisis in the European Union. This is simply not true. The number of curators in the EU has increased seven-fold in the past twenty years, and today there are over 6,000 participating artists from over 80 countries. In the 1990s there were only about 400 participating artists from North and Central Europe and the Middle East, and today there are nearly 4,000 from these regions and beyond. Furthermore, the participation of a region in the EU is a global event. In 2015, the Biennale of Sydney received over 4 billion Euros in funding from across the board of the major art institutions, and in 2016, the Venice Biennale received over 6</text>

The exhibition should be able to detect and address systemic trends, but it should also be able to detect and address fundamental art imbalances and trends. The exhibition should not only display contemporary art, but should also ‘engender social change and change the world’. In other words, it should be able to detect and address fundamental art imbalances and trends, but it should also be able to detect and address them at a scale sufficient to endure their influence and to effect change. 	The current curatorial approach to art in many parts of the world does not see fundamental art as a contemporary contemporary or even a significant part of the contemporary art market.

The system must be able to detect and address these complexities, but it should also be able to detect and address fundamental, if difficult-to-detect, art imbalances and trends. In my opinion, this is the case at this moment. Art market research firm, market research company, Nielsen MarketResearch, recently released a report ‘Art as a Precious Metric’, in response to the crisis of the Brazilian art market. The report ranked the 39th‐ranked gallery in Brazil as a potential site for a new exhibition, based on the number of artworks displayed. The ranking is not a recommendation, but rather an indication of the relative strength of the Brazilian gallery as an exhibition venue. The report clearly identifies the importance of identifying art imbalances in advance, and of preparing for them in advance of the crisis that may strike the art market. The gallery should be able to identify and address the art imbalances before they become problematic, and gallery staff should be able to identify and address such issues ahead of time. More generally, the report ‘Art as a Precious Metric’ should be read as a call to action, not</text>

The public, and particularly the rich and powerful, is encouraged to travel to many of these places, to places where cultural tourism is highly valued. In many cities, such pilgrimages are highly profitable. In some places, such high ticket prices and the high returns on such high returns are anathema to the city. In such a situation, the development of alternative curatorial forms is strongly encouraged, but in the absence of such alternative forms, the city is encouraged to export its cultural wealth as cultural tourism. Such tourism generates huge profits for the city, but it simultaneously threatens not only the art institutions that make it possible, but also the biennials, museums and other cultural entities that benefit from the economic activities of tourism. It is also often the case that the alternative curatorial form is the only form of cultural tourism that</text>

The system must be able to detect and address these complexities, but it should also be able to detect and address fundamental, if difficult-to-detect, art imbalances and trends. This critical inability to detect and address systemic crises is the real genius of the exhibitionary format, and real genius of what people like Gaudi, Sarrazin, Rubens, and Rubensi have built into it. It is a testament to the probity, the resilience, and the guts that they put into this system. But it is also a testament to the incompetence, if not the outright corruption, of the curatorial caste as a whole. As biennials get bigger and more systemic, and more global, and more local, the threat of art imbalances and trends becoming systemic becomes less credible. The best curators and art market researchers can learn this system fluently, but they are mostly trained as analysts, or market researchers, and thus are exposed to art market trends and phenomena on a micro-level. They encounter them as they write their notes, or research reports, or curatorial bulletins, or just plain read the art publications that come out of</text>

The system must be able to detect and address these complexities, but it should also be able to detect and address fundamental, if difficult-to-detect, art imbalances and trends that result from human behaviour, and in such cases, act decisively to shift the dynamic balance of contemporary art, and thus modernize the artworld.Modern art is undergoing a radical shift in its values, in part due to the advent of global connectivity and media culture. The rise of the personal digital artist, the mass consumption of cultural goods, and the ubiquitous media of all kinds – movies, music, sports, commercials – has all contributed to a culture of ever greater inaccessibility and global mobility. This is a great challenge for a curatorial system that was historically oriented towards the cultural – the art market – and is perceived as such by many artworlds to be losing its identity. Consequently, if the curatorial gesture is to retain some sense of place and identity, it is imperative that the art not only be placed in one's preferred narrative, but that the narrative itself is universal and encompasses all narratives. Therefore, the curatorial gesture must maintain some kind of fundamental link to its</text>

The current curatorial model is not sufficient for this task. There are other, but more practical ways of organising art and culture, ways to allocate resources and make choices that directly affect the consumption and production of culture, such as buying and sharing. There are other ways of organising cultural exchange and cultural circulation, but they are more easily applied and universalised. For instance, there are now over 200 curators operating in over 100 cities around the world, many of them based in the same city for extended periods. This reflects a desire on the part of many artists to collaborate</text>

This is the only way to ensure that the system can detect and address these crises, and to ensure that art markets do not destroy the social fabric of European cities.  Aesthetic city  Aesthetic city is a new kind of cultural district, one in which art is not a centrality, but rather a position or set of positions. It is a space of relationships between artist and viewer, viewer and citizen, artist and public, public and artist. It is place where political, economic and social ideologies converge, yet differ in their structure and function. It is a city of ideas, but with a public that is active and capable of producing its own ideas. It is a city of havens, yet also a city of attacks.  The word ‘iconomy’ has come to refer to clusters of aesthetic qualities, from the simple to the sublime to the ephemeral, that characterize contemporary art today. But what does it mean to be iconomy today?</text>

In other words, ‘systems programming’ is not just a computer programming issue, but a completely different situation. Systemics and artificial intelligence need to be exposed to the same conditions and interact in the same manner in order to gain access to and use of such a system. In the case of a biennial like Tate Modern, which is currently assessing the structural changes required to cope with the dynamic cultural change that is now being implemented at the museum level, the introduction of such a critical theory may well call into being a more general interest in ecological systems and their architectures, consciousness, and emergence that is now the subject of a multi-year, multi-edition biennial that is increasingly aware of its inevitable urban and regional changes, but which is also acutely aware of its inherent vulnerability.  In recent years, there has been a rush of biennials adopting a criticality that is now solely based on the financial success of the institution issuing a succession of institutional awards and recognitions</text>

It was first established in the early 1600s by John Knox, and it was very much an institution at the beginning of the century, with masters and students from different schools of artallying to work with each other. The curatorial school has a particular relationship to the city that is set against a background of a number of cultural migrations that are often credited with transforming the city. One of the earliest recorded histories of the school comes from 1519, when Vasily Ivanchev wrote that a group of Russian anatomists led by Anatoli Primakov were discussing the similarities between the human anatomy and that of an extinct species of monkey. Primakov was a leading anatomist of the time, and he and his fellow anatomists quickly grasped the enormity of the situation.

Primakov was a leading anatomist of the time, and he and his fellow anatomists quickly grasped the enormity of the situation. The human body is made up of many thousands of fragments, each with its own unique combination of building materials, internal organs, and signals. To excavate a particular fossil is to strip away a fragment of the organism from its context, and to do so in a sustained way for a sustained period of time. To do so effectively, the material needs to be chemically inert, or else it will sit in the body and do irreparable damage. Ivanchev’s characterizes the state of affairs as one in which, ‘in the presence of all these fragments, one would strip away all the pieces in an effort to reveal whole new meanings and purposes’. In other words, the more fragments one seeks, the more one will lose them. So the accumulation of fragments is a global phenomenon that operates at multiple scales. It is a global condition that can be experienced as a microcosm of the city; a phenomenon that emerges through studies of the urban environment but is most definitely</text>

They were talking about the fact that the human body has many anatomical similarities to that of a primitive ape, but unlike apes, which have a well-developed nervous system, the anatomy of a chimpanzee or jaguar lacks a central nervous system. The system that makes up the nervous system of the chimpanzee or jaguar is a very rudimentary one, and much less sophisticated than that of a modern human – much less capable of handling complex cognitive tasks – such as the ability to think abstract thoughts or abstract language. In fact, the anatomy of the nervous system of the chimpanzee or jaguar is much less sophisticated than that of an adult human, and while the latter is more evolved, it is also prone to error.[6]The origin of the name 'cURIOUS' – and, indeed, of the image – is a bit mysterious.

One of the earliest recorded histories of the school comes from 1519, when Vasily Ivanchev wrote that a group of Russian anatomists led by Anatoli Primakov were discussing the similarities between the human anatomy and that of an extinct species of monkey. Primakov was a leading anatomist of the time, and he and his fellow anatomists quickly grasped the enormity of the situation. They were describing to a rapt audience of Anatolian zoologists just how the fossilised remains of the once-common human fossilised on the west coast of Asia would be found in the city, in what is now Kazakhstan.The Anatolian zoologists, led by Peter I. Thompson, PhD, curator emeritus of metonymy at the Dana Farber Museum, started by describing the anatomy of the newly discovered fossil, which turned out to be remarkably similar to that of the extinct species. Primakov goes on to describe the ineffable fossilised remains of the fossilised parts of the body that can only be described as &quot;mummified like the bones of a gigantic serpent … covered with the marks of the tiger … the filth of vermin … the breath of abject poverty … the breath of mad beasts … the breath of every kind of ungrateful creature … the breath of every kind of impalas … the breath of every sort of beast … the breath of</text>

Primakov was a leading anatomist of the time, and he and his fellow anatomists quickly grasped the enormity of the situation. The human species had just been discovered, and the question of who can take part in scientific inquiry turned on the basis of a species.Primakov’s group of anatomists made a number of other extraordinary claims, some of which were substantiated centuries later by subsequent investigations. One of these was that the art of art has a social function – organising, maintaining social order. Art has a social function because it is a social transaction. Social transactions happen where there is a high degree of interpersonal trust, and the art is one way in which interpersonal trust can be created. This claim was also made by Georges Canguilhem, who was a leading figure in the colony of Canada who established the first permanent museum in Canada. He also claimed that the first evidence of human language was present in rocks thousands of years old. If these claims were so, then the museum should be able to demonstrate that the origins of its collections are traceable to a common origin – a position that is at</text>

Primakov was a leading anatomist of the time, and he and his fellow anatomists quickly grasped the enormity of the situation. The human body is made up of many hundreds of fragments from a single primitive cell, and the fossilised remains of the body are often variably divided into two basic parts: head and body. The anatomists quickly came up with a number of ingenious ways of painting the head of the specimen with a range of colours and textures that added depth and dimension to the otherwise monochromatic image. One of the most successful ways of incorporating colours and textures into artworks of this type is the use of vanes, which are fibres attached to the surface of the material with chemical bonds. The fibres then exert a drag and drape the surface of the material over the top of the head of the specimen, creating a crack or crackle that adds texture and colour to the appearance. The mainstay of the school was developing works that would be accepted by the curatorial council as truly representing the cutting edge of knowledge, while questioning whether certain sorts of knowledge were actually created.I would argue</text>

The human species, Ivanchev wrote, was created &quot;out of a single lump of clay&quot;.5 	[…]The origins of the name 'curatorial' are a bit hazy, but it is generally agreed that its use in this context is pejorative. In the first place, the word ‘curation’ clearly refers to a form of institutionalised art, and not a name given to a particular body of knowledge or aesthetic sensibility. Secondly, the object is seen as something separate and distinct from the processes of art production – perhaps even a critique of this separation. Finally, the object is seen as something that it alone, independent of all else, produces through its own inherent power.6 	[…]The concept of the archive was first used by Italian anatomist Paolo Portoghesi in the late eighteenth century, and it has been widely attributed to him, either out of habit or in an act of pure apriority, that �</text>

A giant panda or velociraptor, or two, with a skull the same size as a football, and a body the size of a skyscraper, what kind of ecological catastrophe could there be?[29]The idea that we could create a curatorial form that actively engaged with the city in a way that anticipates the cognitive capacities of future generations is a new one, and it comes as no surprise to me that this work came from the man who would be the patron of the arts school at Oxford University, John Knox. Oxford was one of the first universities to offer courses in art, and Knox, who would go on to found the prestigious law school, was a leading advocate of the art as a public functionary. Art as a public functionary is a concept that has been around for a while, and it is a concept that is constantly being reinterpreted and amended, constantly adapting itself to new circumstances and people.

The human body is made up of many thousands of fragments, each with its own unique evolutionary story. To understand the full range of bodily functions, each with its own unique anatomy, would require a body of immense volumes and data storage. To do so would require vast archives, and while the primary use of such archives would be in the service of historical research, the curatorial might one day archive everything from daily life to art collections. The museum, on the other hand, would be able to gather such information from the city, displaying it in a unified way across museums and other art institutions. So the school met, and through a series of private meetings and increasingly public confrontations, the two factions came to a tentative agreement: the curatorial would preserve the anatomical accounts of the anatomy as a collection of wax seals, while the museum would establish a permanent collection of anatomical specimens. The new division would be called the Human Anatomy Museum. Vasily Ivanchev’s account of the Anat</text>

They were either going to put a monkey in the museum – which is a very dangerous idea today – or dismantle the school and leave it to decay – which would mean leaving behind a standing collection of objects that are both rare and really, really ugly. This would completely destroy the very basis of the system that they were trying to repair, to put it crudely, so long as they retained the power to move objects around. The only way to repair such a system is for the museum to be able to collect data on how often objects are stolen and how they are used, and these are big questions for a digital curatorial society. The answer to both questions is going to be &quot;yes&quot; in a hurry, and a master's thesis is a great way to get started in that process.I would argue that the key to the success of the contemporary curatorial is data.

[1] The act of writing, or any act that seeks to render visible something that has already been hidden, is one that is being actively performed by others (including oneself) in the same or similar settings. The term is used in the sense of ‘secret societies’, though it is also used in reference to: planning, for instance, to keep a secret about the location of an offshore oil rig; or as a way to keep secrets from being exposed (such as the location of a nuclear weapon).   [2] The act of travelling is the act of leaving something behind in order to go somewhere new or different. It is also sometimes used to refer to journeys undertaken for economic reasons, such as travelling to avoid congestion on the M1 motorway.

I was initially sceptical about the extent to which the act of writing would be accepted by the curatorial. As someone with a collection of odd and decorative objects, I had a kind of fetishisation of things that were not in common use, at a time when art was still writing down its ideas and motivations. In the words of Gregory Ulmer, a curatorial theorist and Curator at the British Museum, we should not write in the public realm; instead, we should &quot;figure things out in the [public realm] ourselves, through our own actions, and then, if we find ourselves moved, we can change ourselves … create our own imaginary, change the world we see, act accordingly, and so on&quot;.2  I think I first saw this kind of thinking represented by Gregory Ulmer in an episode of ER in the 1950s, when Leslie Nielsen attempted to commission a performance of Hamlet in the British Museum's</text>

It captured the act of writing a letter using ink that had been chemically conceived as a disinfectant. The image appears in the 1937 painting Water Colour With a Painted Surface, by Joseph Rycroft. It was the second letter in the sequence, and it is written in a series of charcoal letters that are joined by a horizontal band of shades. Rycroft’s intention was to demonstrate the chemical formula of the substance in question, but his message is so devastating that it is difficult to convey the full impact of what he has painted here. While the letter is a destroyer’s creed, its intent is evocation rather than attack. Despite its harsh composition, Rycroft’s painting is remarkably composed: there is no bitterness in the expressed sentiments.

I imagined a future where writing was treated as a public good, where the responsibilities of citizenship were distributed among many different stakeholders, where the acts of writing actually became productive, instructive and instructive in its own right. Perhaps the act of writing could be seen as a form of public trepidation and self-consciousness. Perhaps it would require the collaboration and the politics of cooperation that we now shun. Perhaps the politics of collaboration would demand it. Maybe the politics of collaboration would permit it. There is much that is contradictory and uncertain in the world, and few clearly define what is trusted and what is not. Perhaps the politics of collaboration would permit the politics of invisibility. Perhaps the politics of invisibility would permit the politics of mutual respect.

In this act of writing, the artist conceals crucial information about the city in a way that would not be possible in a publication or even a museum. The act of writing is a public function that the artist performs in public; it is a public function that is often misunderstood or derided as being performed by artists. The act of travelling is a secret act that the art institution that initiated the act of writing wishes to keep a close eye on. And the act of staying, when it is performed by an institution, is a closely guarded secret. As soon as the act of writing or traveling is revealed, the act is condemned as anti-popular, counter-cultural or simply wrong.‘The act of writing or travelling is a utopian ideal, but in a contested and increasingly urbanised world, its execution is a possibility],‘ I’m told.

The act of writing, perhaps, is the act of premonitory gesture in the service of a contingency. ‘“Writing Lessons” is the third entry in a monograph on the archipelago of islands collected by Norman Wilkinson between 1900 and 1925. In it, Wilkinson describes how the  	Norman’s Archipelago was mapped by a team led by Archibald Phillips (1826–1907), who was a naturalist and the son of a sea captain. These seafaring peoples – who included the Lewis and Clark tribe – lived in bands, each with a chief, and their goods and services chartered from commercial ports to ferry the goods and people of the mainland.

Paul Getty Museum and Art Gallery in Liverpool, I came across an exhibition that had been on view since 1923. It was a special exhibition of sorts – a time capsule, in that it was exhibited in a museum and then, in that same museum, in another, a hotel. It was also a capsule, in the sense that it contained in it the very essence of the exhibitionary form in its various incarnations. The exhibition was entitled The Portrait of an Artist – the artist had been killed in action on a Moscow battlefield two years earlier – and it offered a rare and now somewhat legendary insight into the psyche of the artist, whose name has only now begun to be forgotten. The story of the photograph first appeared in the journal of the Russian Photographic Society, on account of the artist’s avant-garde style of self-deception and double-think.

At the time, I had just published an essay in the Sunday Times on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the Portrait Gallery’s founding, in which I indicated that the collection had come a long way from its humble collection of portraiture to become a significant art institution. In that essay, I indicated the continuing value of the Portrait Collection to the city and its economy, and the necessity of preserving its cultural character. I suggested that, in a city with a museum, the collection could become a source of cultural exchange, a place of pilgrimage and destination of choice, where artists could gather and discuss their work, and where the city could assume the role of tourist, where culture was a profitable enterprise and a source of social power.1  The invitation to consider act one of act two: stay  in the city and create a palpable sense of place by way of tourism came</text>

With the Portrait Gallery, Portoghesi’s three acts of concealment create a metaphor for the social totality in which the artist is able to intervene in a very powerful way, even though the social totality is often opaque and muddled. The act of writing, however, is even more potent. In the first instance, it is able to point to a specific event or set of events and, through a series of precise actions, create a narrative arc or set of actions that diverges from the background noise of contemporary life. For example, the Portrait of a Lady, 1921, taken with her artist husband, Robert Hewison, depicts the life and times of Murray Gaunt, an English soldier killed fighting in Vimy Ridge during the First World War. Like many of his time and place, Gaunt was on Merseyside,</text>

As a blog, it documents the life and work of Math-World, France’s oldest and most internationally acclaimed computer magazine. As a magazine, it has published many books and many articles. It was first published in 1864, in Paris, and repeated twice a year, from June to September, in London and Berlin. It was edited by Henri Lefebvre, from October 1899, with an article by Claude Perrault, from November 1900. It was not widely read in its first French language version, but is now widely read in almost all editions of the magazine. It was a source of pride for computer programmer Yves-Justine Lecraeux, who in the years that followed would establish the magazine as one of the most important in France. Yves Justine Lecraeux (born 1864, Lyon, France)</text>

It features a wide range of technologies and tools for the developer’s ‘medium is now arrayed against a background of ever-more pervasive and configurable sensors, networks, services and data capture and transport devices’. As the website’s text reads, ‘the relevance of design today is limited; there is no room for reflection, planning or development in the context of the ever-more pervasive and configurable sensors, networks, services and data capture and transport devices that are the product of contemporary society’s infrastructure’. 	[2] The term ‘infrastructures’ is frequently used in relation to cities, but in recent years many urban centres have started to adopt design that includes elements of the natural world, such as mountains and rivers.

The former protects themselves from the unpredictable by constantly improving their models, programming them with ever more sophisticated ways of understanding the world, and then publishing those models in respected scientific and engineering journals, while the latter ensure that their models are taken seriously by their peers by publishing peer-reviewed books on the same topics. The division between the two continues to amass in the public imagination, but little is known, largely because it is so pervasive that it is almost impossible to detect.

It’s a platform on which ideas and opinions can be formed. When such platforms are part of a debate, they’re part of a discourse. When a discourse is not a place, it’s a chimera. And so it continues.
