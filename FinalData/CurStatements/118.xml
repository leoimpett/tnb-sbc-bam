In other words, it does not merely address the curatorial tools or paraphernalia of the biennial, but also how such paraphernalia might be designed to support the activities of local communities. The proposal was made via an exploratory research project (AR) into the curatorial practices of two local communities in the Welsh Streets area of Toxteth, north of to ​​Jayne​s​ Road. The AR presented its findings and observations during a Workshop at the Welsh Streets Artspace in Toxteth in April 1976.  The workshop was organised by the Jayne’s​ Road Community Arts group and the Welsh Streets Development Corporation.

The AR (unlike the biennial) proposes no fixed funding source for the project. Rather, participants’ proposals were invited to develop a curatorial strategy for the workshop, with a focus on the needs of the community. The participants also suggested strategies for further collaboration.  The AR stressed that local initiatives were encouraged, but that larger organisations, especially those with a global reach, should be challenged to provide meaningful alternatives to the ‘dead end’ of large institutional arrangements.  For the purposes of the workshop, the participants were to identify and project towards a ‘permanent solution’.  If possible, the projects should be drawn from existing or future projects with a local context, but should also explore alternative career or community options.  For the purposes of this workshop, the  Jayne’s Road Community Arts</text>

Participants included: Professors John Stuart Brent Bellamy (Director, RAC) and Peter Brown (Director, Royal Academy of Arts) both with a joint project entitled Social Sculpture: Art and the Social Life of Communities in Crisis and Reform respectively. Professors Ewan McCartney (Director, Royal Academy of Arts) and John Tyndall (Director, Royal Commission for Art and Artwork) with joint projects entitled Communities in Crisis and Reform and The Bluecoat. The workshop was divided into three parts. Part One addressed the role of the arts in the social context of the Welsh Streets area. Part Two addressed the role of the arts in the establishment of cultural identity for the area. Part Three examined the relationships between arts and social activities in the area. Welsh Streets Biennial 1976 The Biennial was an art project and ‘curatorial exercise</text>

The discourse touched on the politics of the arts development in the area, and on the place of art and culture in the public realm. The participants’ shared a concern about the impact of a number of the proposals, but also a desire to move forward because they believed that there was a way of thinking and a willingness to explore that could lead to a different kind of future for the area.

Curators were unequivocal in their views that the task of the institution was not only to offer a distinctive presentation of art, but also to facilitate the collaborative, experimental and experiential work of its members, particularly through the provision of materials, methods and strategies.  The workshop participants recognised that the objective of the Biennial was not only to commission art for the art institution to display, but also to enable its members to make works that might be exhibited and, if successful, to carry out these works themselves [1]  in a manner that would be engaged with by the art market and the arts’ institutional press.

It was felt that the workshop, whilst relevant to the current context of the area, should not be a replacement for continued interaction and dialogue between the community and the arts organisation. It was felt that the community had its own ideas and could build towards a more robust and productive engagement strategy with them.  This view was reinforced by the participant feedback that came out of the workshop</text>

And thus, although virtual and augmented reality may seem like modern day magic, in reality they are also deeply cultural artifacts reflecting the past.‘Reality check’, in other words.Art has always been a platform on which art has been made and the market has always been a platform on which art has been made. The role of the market, then, remains crucial to the future of art and culture; if not actively manipulated then certainly rarely guided by its own magic. As a significant chunk of the artworld shifted towards digital media, and eventually to photography, and as a consequence the role of the artist also shifted towards the self-appointed arbiter of what is and isn’t artistically significant (a.k.a. the marketplace), the curatorial turn towards a fixed, representable image became critical. And so it remains to this day: the role of the curatorial turn is critical to the identity of the art in a market place like the museum, but also to the magic of the marketplace itself. If the magic of the marketplace is defined by its ability to allocate</text>

And thus, although virtual and augmented reality may seem like modern day magic, in reality they are also deeply cultural artifacts created by and for the cultural elite. They are artefacts meant to be shared; widely and metaphorically. But this doesn’t make them any less real; only in so far as they are shared. And this is where things get interesting. It is claimed that in the future, when augmented and virtual reality are commonplace, we will no longer need artists to envision the social structures that will underpin them; we will understand what is possible through machine learning (see: Kay Sekula &amp; Kevin Yu, ‘On Learning and Its Applications in Computer Vision’, IEEE Trans. ACM, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp.S50–64). The key concepts underlying these claims are as follows: image processing, deep reinforcement learning, and big data will make it possible to create visualisations that are not limited by the confines of traditional art forms. Image processing will make it possible to capture and analyse images in real-time, and to utilise this data to make</text>

And thus, although virtual and augmented reality may seem like modern day magic, in reality they are also deeply cultural artifacts of a bygone era. They are artefacts of a different time, created by a different culture.’[10]Such cultural legacies and such a rich tapestry of practices and discourses of the past, in the present and in the future, can be understood in the light of technological innovation and the complex interactions between citizens, institutions, citizens themselves that result when and if technology emerges. As noted by Prof. Ambasz, ‘the future is a complex of contradictions and events that are unpredictable and often chaotic, but also a future that is fragile and uncertain. The future is also a complex of similarities and differences, with some being extremely novel and novel combinations of different cultures. In trying to anticipate and account for everything that is ‘different' in the future, we must also anticipate and account for everything that is ‘identical’ to the present.’[11]Such creative legacies and creative cultural legacies are arguably what contemporary artists attempt</text>

And thus, although virtual and augmented reality may seem like modern day magic, in reality they are also deeply cultural artifacts with cultural values. They are not, in other words, ways to be used by amateurs; they are works in progress that continuously evolve and employ diverse technologies to provide novel experiences for users.‘Thinking Machines’, as the discipline is now formally known, is the application of mathematical and computer sciences to the study of human behaviour that begins with Darwin’s theory of evolution and progresses to modern biological and evolutionary psychology. The field’s name comes from a 1925 essay in which the intellectual brother of biochemist Max H. Lee, named the ‘Thinking Machine’, an acronym for ‘The Thinking Engine: A Machine For Thinking About Life’. In the early twentieth century, theoretical and applied mathematical modelling combined with historical, archival and technical documentation enabled a great deal of what ‘The Machine’ did, including the design of infrastructure and the social machinery that supported it.

And thus, although virtual and augmented reality may seem like modern day magic, in reality they are also deeply cultural artifacts. … [T]he most fundamental question for art and creative practitioners is this: what does it mean by ‘real life’? And perhaps it is this deep cultural understanding of the importance of cultural analysis that has allowed artists to tap into this new wave of innovative, transformative creative practices, but it is also the exact opposite: what is it that artists create when they turn to cultural practices? In a recent poll of over 1,000 artists, creative professionals, academics and researchers, Computer Vision/Deep Learning artists were found to have the highest critical rating of all, at 83%, indicating that deep learning is indeed affecting creative practices in a way that is affecting all artists and creative professions.Artists and creative professionals have recognised the importance of cultural analysis in their technological and other game-changing decisions, and have incorporated cultural theory and cultural studies into their decision-making.

And thus, although virtual and augmented reality may seem like modern day magic, in reality they are also deeply cultural artifacts. They reflect certain cultural values, such as the primacy of the individual over collective, and the intoxicating feeling of powerlessness. And so, although the methods may be applied to humans, the end result may be that cultural values are violated, as a function of technological innovation.  	Conversely, once these values are violated, the potential for their reinvention is over. This may be the case with technologies like augmented reality, where the interpretation of data feeds directly into the production of imagery – a production that in turn may be construed as a reinterpretation of cultural values. 	There are of course other considerations to be taken into consideration when developing and applying these types of theories, but the interaction between the artist, the media, and the wider public that is affected by the technologies is one that must be planned for. There is a tension between the intentions of the creators and the consequences that result from the use of cultural resources. 	Art has an inherently political connotation</text>

And thus, although virtual and augmented reality may seem like modern day magic, in reality they are also deeply cultural artifacts.’[3] Consequently, while it’s true that virtual and augmented reality are the future, they don’t yet represent the center of cultural activity; although they will, of course, eventually become that. In their current form, they display the cultural paradoxes of the present, but also present and potential futures. That will happen when and if and – more importantly – where the magic happens.Download this article as PDFJessica CoonJessica Coon is Associate Professor of English and Director of the English and Film Studies Program in the College of Arts and Sciences.

It comes into being when a computer system ‘programs itself’ and becomes aware of the ‘real-time’ that it is experiencing, using ‘AI to detect and avoid common human errors, and to do more’ through reinforcement learning’.1  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more of a concern, partly because of its potential to replace humans in many contexts, and partly because of its increasing ability to reason on its own.Artificial Intelligence refers to systems that understand more ‘already embedded patterns of behaviour’, such as human behaviour, in which case the need for reinforcement is reduced.

This increasing accessibility of information about technology is often attributed to the ‘connectivity hypothesis’, the idea that information overload causes brains to over-utilise the available synaptic connections.1 The connectivity hypothesis has been further supported by several studies demonstrating that having a physical (rather than virtual) representation of technology in your head maximises one’s ability to absorb new knowledge.2 For more information, see the article   &quot;Connectivity and Flourishing</text>

And thus, although virtual and augmented reality may seem like modern day magic, in reality they are also deeply cultural artifacts; artefacts of a specific historical moment in the history of humanity, crafted using particular artefacts and set in a particular historical context.’[17] This statement by Turing is a classic example of cultural usage and the technological singularity. The singularity – or literal meaning – of technical terms, concepts, and objects (such as computers, hardware, software, image processing units, and internet protocols) results in a conceptual entity (such as a computer program or physical object) that is both powerful and enigmatic. In this sense, the term ‘singularity’ is not only to signify the thing in question, but also to denote something that is both unknowable and unknowable, unknowable in its own right. In this sense, the computer is both ‘the thing’ and ‘the thing-in-itself’.[18] This statement is one of many that Tiziana Terranova makes, many of which are direct analogies</text>

The challenge is to imagine a way of working together in ways that are not mediated by the conventions of the city and nation. The way that city and nation are constituted today, and are likely to remain so – in part because of the proliferation of data-mining and mapping operations – opens up opportunities for third-parties to intervene in and influence what is sometimes described as ‘the city’.

They would also create new kinds of problems for the city and nation that could potentially be addressed in different ways. But the way in which art institutions, local government, artists and the local communities they work with inhabit the city or the nation in various ways, whether through education, activism, or simply being there, is an inherently political act. It is political, in fact, to engage the city and its political and social systems, but it is even more political to render those systems ineffective or non-existent. The challenge for such institutions is to infuse imaginative, responsive and imaginative-usable ways of living, working and playing in ways that are not mediated by the city and nation-states. Creative perforations such as the one that took place in Liverpool in April 2018 may or may not in fact lead to change, but they do show that cities and their communities are capable of recovering and reinventing themselves in creative and innovative ways. This is a crucial work.</text>

But they could also emerge from the experience of artist-organisations, as did the intervention of the Black-E, the Cambodia Arts Forum, and the rest of the arts and cultural organisations that have recently come out of the relative obscurity of urban/regenerative design.  Art and art-making in the age of the algorithm  In the age of the algorithm, data mining and machine learning are the language of the future not of the present. It is true that in the past when art was produced in large part on a large scale on a computer, the artists and curators who participated in the statistical modelling of the art produced were, as we now know, faced with a choice between a nondeterminism of computer generated imagery or the actual art produced – essentially limiting the kinds of interventions that could be made on the computer. But the algorithms that we have today are far too complex and malle</text>

And they already exist. The Cam­bridge Biennale has been investigating how to best engage the city and nation at large in the creation of a new generation of art institutions. We’re thinking differently. We don’t yet know what the next step is, but we do know that the Cam­bridge Biennale cannot be limited to what it is today. It must engage all aspects of the city and nation. And it must do so in ways that are not dictated by the state. If it’s to be truly global and truly integrated, it’s imperative that the Biennale be dynamic and responsive to the urban and local realities of the day. If it doesn’t do that, the challenge will be to create the conditions – both structural and random – that allow art to happen, while simultaneously maintaining the institutional capacities necessary for</text>

The challenge for contemporary urbanists and artists is to imagine more positively the role that could be played by artists and institutions today, than is currently being played by large government bureaucracies and their artists. This could mean looking to the future and imagining what could be achieved through innovative arts and culture initiatives today, rather than the intervention of large government bureaucracies in the future.

But they could also emerge through a decentralisation of political, economic and legal power in favour of local communities and grassroots groups – something that is already happening in parts of the UK and abroad. This could mean creating grassroots art organisations in localities where the biennale is located and encouraging artists to move their studios to such groups.

The way to think about these kinds of interventions is to consider them as episodes in a larger trend, rather than as isolated incidents.  Art, of course, has a long and complicated history in the UK and globally, and its recent global impact has been accompanied by a ‘bigger picture’ that seeks to be seen in all aspects of the world.  Art has a long and important role to play in envisioning a utopian future for humanity, and its significant contemporary impact is due to its realism-defying ability to connect with its audiences on a deep level.  Art today is able to operate in ‘deep red zones’ around the globe.  Art today has a much greater global impact than it had in the 1990s, and this is largely due to the fact that people are waking up to the fact that real creativity</text>

If the city is made redundant and dispersed – in the sense that it is no longer a central node in the city infrastructure, but rather a collection of diverse sites and mediums – then a city-wide re-imagining and re-constituting committee could be set up to provide alternative sites and modes of organising.  One could argue that such a ‘think-tank’ would replace the city-wide, ‘planning’ council, and that similar committees could be set up to reconceive and reorganise ‘architecture and urban-planning’.  I see this as a possible future, although the ‘next’ city might well repeat the mistakes of the past.  In the end, though, it is the residents of the cities that hold the vast, far-reaching, far-reaching resources</text>

Art and the politics of globalisation 	Art and art’s political place in the 21st century is made all the more precarious by the proliferation of data-mining operations, social media and drones, which gather ever more information about our everyday practices and places our interactions – our identities – in increasingly distorted ways.

But they could also emerge from the sidelines, providing opportunities for artists to shine through the political leanings and blind spots of the localities and even the nation. We might want to call this ‘infrastructure-as-art’, and in the UK it might include a ‘Cambridge Architecture Biennale’ as a periodic, multi-year, multi-recurring, and multi-platform event. The ‘infrastructure-as-art’ described above would imagine art as a tool, not unlike the way in which infrastructure is implemented in the UK. It would also involve artists and the city in ‘infrastructure-as-art’. This could mean collaborating with local authorities on the design and construction of infrastructure, or the collaboration between the city and the biennale as a whole.

But they could also completely alter what can and cannot be said to be in the city, and in many cases, what is said to be in the city. This seems to me to be the current context – cities are such powerful mediators of political, social and economic life that they are often caricatured as economically primitive environments devoid of culture, economic activity and sedentary citizens confined in gated communities. But the advent of satellite imagery, mobile phones, social media and other technologies that record and streamline the processes of urbanisation creates opportunities for urban pre-eminence not confined to the city’s core. Cities are also places where cultural apparatuses are often modeled after or emulate those of other large urban centres, and for this reason many artists find their work situated in or influenced by the cultural apparatuses of Birmingham, Liverpool, Mumbai or New York, or other related high-end cities.  Artworlds are places where</text>

The new phase represents a new equilibrium between the biennale and the museum, a balance that is being forged between the artist and the collector. The opening of the Biennale was also the first for the new curator, Pascual González de la Torre. The new curator’s mandate is to work collaboratively with the artist and the collector, seeking out elements of the exhibition's tradition that can be brought back to the biennale through the museum’s collection. In her interview with Urbana’s City Paper, de la Torre discussed how the Biennale would approach a project from the previous, more conservative, direction: the collection. She said that the focus of the new curator’s research would be ‘a cross section of the population: rich, poor, young, old, urban, rural, young, connected, […] and so on’. In other words, the museum, as an entity, would continue to be central to the curator’s research, but the biennale would act as a site for the collector to target his/her</text>

The two exhibitions capped a frenetic cycle of public events, with new works appearing on the walls of the former museum, as well as on the grounds of the new biennale site. The exhibition structure was also a new construction – constructed with prefabricated plans and modular units that could be easily reconfigured – incorporating permanent and ‘hidden’ collections, temporary exhibition rooms and public areas, a café and conference rooms, a data-center and workshop park, as well as a testing ground for the new technologies of the biennale. All these elements of the biennale were designed to be adaptable, subservient to the needs of the biennale, and responsive to the agenda of the curators and art buyers.

The new phase represents a new equilibrium between the biennale and the museum, a balance that is being forged between the artist and the collector. In the biennale, the biennalee presents itself as a visitor’s museum, subject to the museum’s curatorial agenda. In the museum, its raison d'être is the gathering of photographic and archival materials to make, or restore, something or other, or share, exchange, or organize. The museum is the site of the art’s making, but it also holds the museum, which acts as a check on the art’s activities. If the museum is closed, or exhibits are banned, or engages in curatorial changes, the art is often far less active in its own right, and its effect on the public is often felt. In this sense the museum is an essential site of the museum, providing the two sites with essential mass, and thereby establishing a mutually reinforcing relationship. But the biennalee is also a site of the art’s ultimate make-over. It creates a new biennial,</text>

The new phase represents a new equilibrium between the biennale and the museum, a balance that is being forged between the artist and the collector. The museum’s collection has a special place in the biennale’s cultural landscape because it comprises a large proportion (more than 80%) of the art sold abroad, particularly from the Americas. As a result, the collection is a display of art from multiple subjects; it is a display of different kinds of art, in that it is a display of works in different settings, and it is a display of cultural exchange. The collection is a museum of the contemporary art of the Americas, and the museum of art in the Americas. The collection as a museum of the contemporary art of the Americas has a number of other connotations as well. It stands for something, and its many dimensions suggest a definition of time itself. The collection as a museum of the contemporary art of the Americas is being made up of many different kinds of art, and their common thread is their contemporary contemporary import. This common thread runs through all the biennials’ collections, and it is a feature</text>

The new phase represents a new equilibrium between the biennale and the museum, a balance that is being forged between the artist and the collector. At the same time, it is being tested by the museum, whose relationship to the biennale has always been contentious and has sometimes felt as if it was collapsing. In 2017, the biennale changed its name to the John Moores and UT Austin Art Biennale, and in 2018 the museum was renamed to the Art Biennale. Both the names reflect the fact that this is an exhibitionary form now, and not just an art museum. The name changes are a way to signal to visitors that this is an evolving exhibitionary form, and to signal to art collectors that their investment is no longer purely in the form of art, but is now also in the form of wealth. The intention behind the name changes is that visitors, who now constitute the biennale’s largest single user segment, will be able to experience the change in the museum, and that other cultural institutions will follow suit. In the long term, the goal is to create a situation in which</text>

The exhibition setting is a sophisticated collection of works that was curated by Francesca Bertolotti, who has a particular interest in art-historical texts, particularly those relating to the Middle East. Her interest in the region comes from her years as an archivist for Pan African, Indian and African diasporas, and her current research involves archiving and documentation of art from that region into the 21st century.  The other half of the equation is the artist, who is finding ways to bring art from the region into contemporary art practice. This new dimension of the biennale is a double-edged sword, not only because it can lead to the biennale becoming entangled in contemporary art practices, but also because it can undermine the artist’s negotiating position with the museum. The point of the biennale is to imagine a possible future, but the artworks that come out of the process are usually works that were prepared specifically for the occasion, and thus have a particular</text>

On 9–10 September, the Museum of Modern Art hosted a public open house, with plans to expand it to cover the entire building by the end of next year.

The new phase represents a new equilibrium between the biennale and the museum, a balance that is being forged between the artist and the collector. This new equilibrium will undoubtedly change the face of the museum, but it is a face that will have to adapt to the changes that the biennale is likely to make in the future. How to Know About Art and Culture (2017) was the first exhibition to be curated by a woman, and the first to be open to artists and the public. It was also the first to take place in the former museum space, where menus and exhibition boards still displayed large male artists. The exhibition was not solely concerned with the aestheticisation of culture, and its discourses on beauty, experience and identity were frequently coloured by the curators’ own cultural identities. The aim of the exhibition was to question the roles and identities of the artist, the museum, the community and the public in the creation of an ‘intelligent city’. It was also to engage local people and communities in the process of making the city, through a ‘tactical exchange’, by engaging</text>

The new phase represents a new equilibrium between the biennale and the museum, a balance that is being forged between the artist and the collector. The biennale’s 2018 plans, drawn up in London, are directed not only towards the museum but also towards the future exhibition space and exhibition house that are currently unused or vacant in the city. They call for the revival of the city’s gallery culture, with an emphasis on the roles of artisans and artists in the city’s infrastructure and the postindustrial infrastructure that it supports, as a new medium of exhibition making. It is to be noted that the gallery culture of the 1980s and 1990s is to be reacquainted with the city’s gallery infrastructure in the context of the new gallery culture that is to be created. In other words, the biennale is itself to some extent a museum in the museum-like sense of the word. It is to be seen, not seen.

    Working with algorithms, in an attempt to understand the drives that enable and disallow human behaviour, the researchers used functional virtual reality (VR) to expose the mechanisms that enable and disallow human behaviour. A virtual reality is both spatial (in that it takes place in a physical space) and temporal (in that it is experience). By exposing the underlying mathematical mechanisms that underlie human behaviour in a virtual setting, the study of human behaviour in the real world can be approached as a science and not just as a humanities pursuit.

Wolin, Jr. The book is a response to the nineteenth-century decision to reinstate capital punishment in response to the growing mass murder of innocents at the hands of the criminal criminal law. The decision to retry Samuel Chase for the first time in twenty-one years came as a surprise to many, since Wolin’s book suggested a swift and brutal punishment for recalcitrant states. Wolin, however, focuses specifically on the cases of two New York City poets and the late John Lennon, whose body was found two years later, allegedly murdered while walking to work. Wolin focuses particularly on the character of John Lennon’s older brother, Paul, who is portrayed as a passive and complacent apologist for the criminal law’s abuses. Paul is portrayed as a tortured, ­hippie teenager thrown into the role of state propagandist after state propaganda is shown to be ineffective and violent. Despite its title,  </text>

For example, the way in which Twitter identifies artists’ profiles may be used to identify those individuals who might be part of a public, or part of a private, Twitter following, but it may also be used to identify those individuals by their followership, or, in the context of a site such as Twitter, their ‘infrastructure’. So, the role of the artist becomes both curator and user, and the power dynamic shifts from the user being the artist (who controls the algorithmic means of production) to the artist becoming a co-developer of the ‘infrastructure’ (which is to say, a user of the Twitter Platform and its tools).

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the complex situations that arise from the real-life interactions between people? Art is a powerful tool, but it has a very difficult set of co-beneficial relationships with other stakeholders, both public and private.  In this context, the question becomes: what kinds of configurations are there for artists to negotiate? The answer may be ‘infrastructural’. This is a catch-all way of saying that infrastructure is a point of intersection between public and private life, and is a site of interaction between people. It is, in other words, the point where ideas originate, or, more accurately, where those ideas originate from and with whom they are communicated. Infrastructure, whether public or private, is a site of exchange, and the role of the artist in this interaction is to negotiate the roles and conditions that are made manifest in that interaction. This interaction cannot be mediated through the mediation of technical means, which are invariably desirable in a functioning market economy, but it may well be that</text>

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the contemporary condition? This raises the question of public versus ‘private’ and state; what kind of relationship can artists develop with social media platforms? In what way is the public not fully included in the Public Realm envisioned? 	In this configuration, art is often used as a disciplinary tool, deployed to intervene at a societal or even a local level in an attempt to create a more optimal future through intervention or change. A more general notion of the Public Realm can be imagined as a shared commonwealth, in which everyone takes part and in which all are stakeholders. 	The Public Realm is not a monolithic idea, but it is a starting point for coming to terms with new modes of being that are at once visible and unknowable. It is an understanding of the infrastructural aspects of contemporary society and their relationship to art, aesthetics and social interaction. It is a ‘complexity’ that must be worked through in order to truly engage people. This initial configuration of</text>

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the contemporary, post-collapse society? This raises the question of how ‘infrastructure’ is defined in contemporary capitalist terms, and how it is possible for an artist to create infrastructure that is neither dependent on nor responsive to contemporary material conditions. I propose the idea that infrastructure is both a noun and an adjective, and that infrastructure is both material and interpretive. Infrastructure is what enables and creates the infrastructure of the contemporary society, and what it is possible to create through the contemporary materialisation of labour (in the social reproduction of art’s image). 	So, infrastructure is both material and imaginal, both existent and imaginary, both physical and immaterial, both movable and untimely. But what kind of movement is this? What kind of definition of ‘infrastructure’ does he/she/it/it/it/it/it/it/it/it/it/it/it/ it/it/it/it/it</text>

So, the role of the artist becomes both curator and user, and the power dynamic shifts from the user being the artist (who controls the algorithmic means of production) to the artist becoming a co-developer of the ‘infrastructure’ (which is to say, a user of the Twitter Platform and its tools). This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the complexities of urban infrastructure, to engage with the projectors that are part of the city’s renewal process, and to engage with the public sphere? One might imagine a kind of ‘migration path of the urbanist imagination’, as the New York Times put it, one led by the city’s renewal process itself. 	One might also imagine, however, that the city has already done this artist’s work for them, and that the artist is the sole user of the infrastructure that it generates. In this scenario, the question is whether the artist can continue to call the work ‘infrastructure’, or whether the infrastructural future must necessarily belong to the state. This is the situation in large urban transformations, such as those that have been carried out in the wake of the Great Migration, which took place between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the massive urbanisation of China during the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century</text>

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the specificity of Twitter? In my view, the role of the curator is multifaceted and depends on many factors, but perhaps one of the most critical of these is the political power dynamic between the United States and the United Kingdom. In the UK, the role of the artist is to engage with the dominant power in a way that is politically vulnerable and thereby maximises the chances of being seen as a pro-British artist. In the US, the role of the artist is to maximise the chances of being heard by being seen to be pro-American. The role of the curatorial is to enable as many diverse modes of representation as possible, while also allowing the artist to realise his/her potential when creating public space. This implies both political and aesthetic considerations. In the US, the role of the artist is to produce public space in the public interest, whereas the role of the curator is to maximise the return on investment of any particular art form. Thus, the curatorial role</text>

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the generated information landscape? This raises the question of public and collective cognitive space. The role of the curatorial is to imagine possibilities and to actively engage with the world in order to effect cognitions. But what kind of engagement are we trying to foster? What is meant by the  	public? If the public is defined narrowly as a possible audience of artworks, and specifically as an audience with a consciousness of its own, then the curatorial has a significant role to play. But what kinds of capacities do the curatorial bring to bear in producing art? 	There are many ways of putting it. The use of mathematical models, the language of numbers, the construction of imaginary spaces and the elimination of boundaries between people. But the most potent way of putting it is the use of codes, the manipulation of language and the production of images. And this is where the connections with art and the internet start to fade. The most effective modes of production in generating information between people are collaborative and</text>

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the specific situations that generate economic growth and which demand political participation? It is worth noting that the infrastructural landscape is frequently constructed in relation to specific actors – for example, the biennale as a biennale is often constituted as a private engagement between an artist and a museum. 	But it is also worth noting that the artworks that are produced by the art institutions and their artists are produced in a particular mode of cultural consumption – a mode of consumption constituting a particular set of relations between producer and consumer. This implies that the art that is produced is different from the art that is made by the users of the infrastructural landscape, and so one could argue that the spatial relation is as essential as the semantic one. In the case of the biennale as a whole, the engagement between the artist and the spectator is what creates the experience of the art, and the spatial relation is what provides the tools for artists to engage with this experience. In the case of</text>

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the technological contexts of contemporary society? This raises another question: what kind of infrastructural configuration are we creating?  In my talk at PW2019, I’m going to explore the question of complexity in relation to the work that I do, and the ideas that I’ve developed since 2014, and I’m going to present my thinking as a combination of theoretical and practical framework. I intend to use the ideas of emergent complexity, and the kind of technological complexity that it engenders, to envisage a future in which there are no borders, and in which infrastructure is not static, but is constantly shifting and subject to dynamic needs and desires.  The idea of the ‘borderless world’ that I believe in comes from a concept called ‘global positioning system’ (GPS) ‘system theory and computer algebra’. In short, it’s the set of rules and parameters that give the shape and the speed of movement</text>

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the complexities of urbanism and globalisation? In this context, the answer may be found in the book ‘Infrastructures: Impacts, Adapting Strategies’ by John Graham Kerr and Amitav Ghosh. It is a testament to the authorship of this work that it is still relevant more than twenty years after its conception. It is clear that in the age of algorithmically generated information, the author of the text is thinking not only about the infrastructure that is being fed information, but also about the people who inhabit that infrastructure and who are fed information through it. The question that emerges is: what kinds of political and urban transformations can the authors of this text point to?This brings us to our second premise: what is at stake in the management of information? The management of information refers to what is understood by the human species as the ‘meaning of life’. In other words, it refers to the values and beliefs that emerge through the act of conceptualising,</text>

This raises the question: what kind of infrastructural configuration do artists have to negotiate in order to engage with the public? The answer, increasingly, is ‘nothing’.Artists who are increasingly aware of the capacities of algorithms in which to transform their work into information consume what can be called the ‘infrastructural literacy revolution’. This is the age of the artist-explorer, when the artist is both consumer and designer of media. The transformation of media consumption is an industry that has for a long time been thought of as being in the public interest. The reality is that the public is often indifferent to what is produced and consumed in the service of generating information. The public is more likely to absorb or ignore a given artefact than of-valuable cultural artefacts, which are often produced with greater fanfare and spreads. The public is also more easily distracted by more abstract and mundane things, which are often produced in the service of commercial ends. The fact that art is increasingly produced outside of galleries and museums makes it more difficult to define, quantify and ultimately disent</text>

In the twentieth century, the concept of the ‘postindustrial city’ was developed to describe areas of the country where the production and consumption of which are geared toward the service of humanity (at a societal level, of course). Postindustrial cities today are often characterised by the glut of consumer goods and services, the spread of non-utopian activities (like Uber and Taskrabbit), and the proliferation of non-profit infrastructure projects galore. These developments and their associated anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases mean that the peripheries are being visited by a nomadic humanity, one that is consuming and creating at breakneck speeds. Cities are cogs in a machine that is, in effect, intent on meeting its own timetables. This is the world as it is being fashioned today, and the anthropocene is but one of many transformations that have taken place since 1995.</text>

And they still use phones and computers, but they’re doing so partly because they’re bored or need something to do, as all users of the web know.

The ‘postal service’ has been redrawn.

Postindustrial society is made up of the peripheries, that is to say, of cities, which are becoming increasingly genericised and remote, where people live and work in larger cities, and where, increasingly, art is produced in the form of travel agencies, festivals and tourism promotion agencies. As a result, the society of the periphery is becoming more and more like the society of the summit. Art and cultural production in this society of the summit is being created through the consumption of topology. 	This systematisation of consumption is being made possible by the sharing of data, which is being made increasingly accessible through the sharing of information. 	Information consumption is being made possible not by the physical (the power to produce and consume, in the form of factories) but by the teleology of the information society. The sharing of data is the sharing of non-material (but crucial) quantities – quantities of information that shape and determine the very nature of life on earth. The sharing of data implies a mutual relation between humans and these quantities; and since these quantities are becoming increasingly non-materialised, it is becoming ever more likely that humans will become ‘smart enough’ and employ such data</text>

Postindustrial society is made up of the peripheries, that is to say, of cities, which are becoming increasingly genericised and remote, where people live and work in larger cities, and where, increasingly, art is produced in other cities. The twentieth century also saw a rapid expansion of international trade, which increased the number of people with jobs in the coastal cities that were increasingly dependent upon each other. Art, then, emerged as a result of these terminal conditions, and although it is true that, until the mid-nineteenth century, the bulk of the global art market was controlled by nations, the twentieth century also saw the emergence of regional or local alternative art markets. These emerged in part as a result of the transatlantic slave trade, which saw artists transported across the Atlantic to be worked as slaves on plantations in the Americas, Asia or Africa. The slave trade itself, although it affected not only Africans but also Native Americans, was a global enterprise at this point. The emergence of regional alternatives to the cities that emerged as a result of the slave trade was a spectacular illustration of the power of image over reason. It is this image that has endured, and which is often cited as a reason to be</text>

Postindustrial society is made up of the peripheries, that is to say, of cities, which are becoming increasingly genericised and remote, where people live and work in larger cities, and where, increasingly, art collectors and contemporary artists constitute the bulk of the population. The commerce of culture, as Trump’s term indicates, is made up of cultural transactions that occur mainly between cities and the peripheries, between the urban centres and the rural areas – that is to say, between the cities and the peripheries and the remote places. Art, on the other hand, is made up of cultural acts that take place mainly on the peripheries, between the city and the city, between the rural and urban areas, and between the rural and remote places. Nor are such acts accidental nor do they constitute the vast majority of what is published and enjoyed in the world of art. The vast majority of what is published in the world of art is created by artists who happen to live or work in the peripheries, and their work is published in the world of art in very small print.

Postindustrial society is made up of the peripheries, that is to say, of cities, which are becoming increasingly genericised and remote, where people live and work in larger cities, and where, increasingly, art and performance are non-stop commodities. (Nowadays, this scenario is no longer the case.) In this new world order of transient representations of the world, the contemporary artist is reduced to transient images, images that float on the screen, in the cloud, or in the DNA of future self-replicating micro-organisms. (Incidentally, the notion of the micro-manager is also becoming a cliche, if not a very convincing one.) 	But artists today are artists because they produce experiences through images, and the more images that are produced, the more impactful an image that is.‘Thrillingly simple to grasp’, said W. E. B. Du Bois, in his famous line, ‘an image is worth a thought’. (You’d never guess which famous painter had just uttered that line.) 	In modernist art, the image is of a great many things, but the thought that one can produce</text>

Postindustrial society is made up of the peripheries, that is to say, of cities, which are becoming increasingly genericised and remote, where people live and work in larger cities, and where, increasingly, art is produced in remote locations. So the twentieth century may well see a kind of contemporaneity with the twenty-first century, but it is also a kind of contemporaneity without borders. It is a world in which cultures of different sizes, across borders, across time, gather into communities and engage in shared imaginaries, affective encounters, shared histories. It is a world in which cultural exchange is no longer confined to the narrow frontiers of nationhood, identity, and, indeed, cultural identity itself. But the very constitutive relations of postindustrial society depend on the construction of national identities, and postindustrial society is no longer content to inhabit those narrow frontiers. It engages in cultural imperialism as a way of life, and its commercialization reflects the pressures of this dynamic. The kind of cultural imperialism that takes place in the peripheries is geopolitical in character, and it is reshaping not only what kinds of identities are created but also what kinds of histories are lost.

Postindustrial society is made up of the peripheries, that is to say, of cities, which are becoming increasingly genericised and remote, where people live and work in larger cities, and where, increasingly, art is produced outside the city. (I have a particularly speculative, if perforce generalised, remark about this in the wake of the Manchester terror attack: where is the art now produced in the symbolic significance of a city? Where is the art now produced in the image, or better yet, the shadow?) The level of abstraction required to render such a possibility is still quite impressive, and I strongly suspect that the art world would still value what it saw as its true frontier, its true center, were it not for the increasingly urgent, globalized, interconnected nature of contemporary life?) 	But the new ‘exoticism’ required to render such a seemingly benign possibility has set in: the city is no longer the lone stand-in, exemplar of modernity, in which the individual finds himself or herself. To a large extent, we are used to it, to the way things are. We are used to the fact that cities, which used to be the scene of</text>

The twenty-first century may well see a kind of ‘postindustrial society’, if only in the abstract. But the kind of postindustrial society that we are creating is going to have to confront a kind of postindustrial backlash, and it is going to have to address the real causes of this decline – real causes, rather than theories such as capitalism that are almost entirely focused on the interaction between the different parts of the global market. 	What is it that we  	need in order to create a kind of postindustrial society? I would argue that it is first of all an understanding of the social contradictions of the modern world. I do not mean theories of how contradictions arise and how they are resolved. I mean what are the social means by which to create ‘postindustrial’.

One could even imagine cars that monitor the road and act as sensors, harvesting data from traffic and weather to deliver parts or even completely ignoring the road and traffic around them, as in the case of autonomous vehicles that operate on self-learning algorithms.These kinds of connections are already happening in some areas, as autonomous vehicles take over parts of the country where otherwise non-autonomous vehicles operate. But in most of the world, connectedness is limited to highly networked infrastructures. Infrastructure-scale infrastructures, such as roads, are the focus of significant research and development efforts. And although connectivity does indeed increase the capabilities of infrastructures, it also follows that these infrastructures are also constantly evolving, subject to the whims of unpredictable resource scarcity and overbuilding. As a consequence, infrastructure-scale applications will always have to be adaptive to the new infrastructures that emerge on the scene, and this is why new inf</text>

For example, automated dialing in of parts could lead to a completely new kind of manufacturing that exploits data on the road to create new products and services, or it could lead to the creation of entirely new kinds of urban environments.In general, connectedness promotes a new understanding of the urban, both of which are increasingly dependent on data (including the car). This knowledge is both automatic and comes from sources such as car batteries, satellite imagery, and data from infrastructure management systems. It is also characteristic of connectedness, which is now often conflated. For example, many urban planners and urban designers emphasize the importance of transit in an increasingly measured way, while still having great concerns about the quality of life in the metropolis. In the past, planners and designers would often struggle with the challenge of envisioning an ideal urban future for the metropolis, given the rapid growth of infrastructure and the proliferation of devices that can be connected in unpredictable ways. Today, many planners and designers would rather focus on the problem at hand, such as the challenge of regeneration or mapping the effects of new urban developments.In this context</text>

This kind of integration or ‘deep linking’ is what makes autonomous cars or cars that can learn behave like human drivers or vehicles.What are the challenges for autonomous car makers today? How do they anticipate how the challenges of today will affect autonomous cars in 2040? Who will be the heroes of this new connected car era? These are questions that continue to dog autonomous car development. The answer to their identification is a resounding ‘No!’ The emergence of self-driving cars marks a new level of automation, and car makers are now faced with the difficult decision between the technologies that make up their self-driving cars or the social and ecological consequences of their techno-utopian visions. How do car makers reconcile the need to constantly monitor the road and its infrastructure and inhabitants with the need to simultaneously automate and augment their vehicles with people?

For example, automated dialing in of parts could lead to a completely new kind of manufacturing that exploits data on the road.In general, new kinds of interaction or interaction between humans and machines are always the outcome of in-depth philosophical, social, or political discussions about the nature of life itself. These kind of developments are often credited to the advent of science and technology, but in fact much of what we think we know about life comes from diverse sources including historical documents, archaeological finds, folk tales, architecture and much more. In the last century alone, the development of science and technology coincided with a proliferation of historical and folkloric accounts of life on the road, in part due to the widespread use of both print and electronic media. This abundance of historical documentation and iteration allowed a proliferation of folk ideas and fables, which in turn acted as a kind of random seed that helped to form what we think of as modern urbanism. For example, as the internet and connected devices became ever more pervasive, the myth of the lone hacker liberating the world from bureaucratic excess began to be cast as a ‘</text>

For example, automated dialing in of parts could lead to a completely new kind of manufacturing that exploits data on the road to tailor parts to specific requirements, such as the ability to detect when a vehicle has entered a certain area. This kind of sensor fusion or software engineering is happening now in connected cars, but until now it has mainly been applied to large-scale manufacturing plants or to highly automated research and development projects. Now, thanks to the connected car, there is a push towards self-driving vehicles, which one could argue are also vehicles ‘under construction’. More and more of what is considered ‘the future’ is becoming automated, and as a result, the infrastructure that supports the infrastructure of the future is collapsing around us. This is a scenario that is far from straightforward, and it is far from certain that all vehicles will be able to cope with the new vehicular traffic, but there is growing interest from cities and regional governments to give autonomous vehicles a try. It is also a question of whether or not the infrastructure of the future will be able to support the infrastructure of the</text>

For example, automated dialing in of parts could lead to a completely new kind of manufacturing that exploits data on the road to tailor parts to specific applications. This kind of object-oriented manufacturing is happening already with cars that detect when a repairman is nearby, and cars that monitor for emissions, braking, and so on. All the sensors in the cars are sent signals to other cars, and as cars continue to repair or replace themselves, more and more of the infrastructure is sent signals, leading to ever larger, more sensitive 'cars'. And of course, as cars get more complex and expensive to repair, there is the need for more sophisticated diagnostic systems that monitor a driver’s data, habits, and so on.Autonomy and Machine  	[i] More than just the automation of tasks, sensors and computers are increasingly being connected to one another, and this is often referred to as ‘deep sharing’ or ‘deep computing’. This refers to the practice of sharing data between computers or devices, or between different parts of the car. For example, cars now</text>

For example, automated dialing in of parts could lead to a completely new kind of manufacturing that exploits data on the road to tailor parts to individual users.Another example of the sharing of information on the road is taxi cabs. As autonomous vehicles become more sophisticated, the amount of data that flows between the driver and the passenger becomes more significant. It is no longer sufficient for the driver of a taxi to know what the safest route is; he or she needs to know what the most convenient one is. Therefore, taxis need to understand the wider context of the road and the city. In addition, they need to understand the specific systems that monitor and control their vehicles. This last point is perhaps the most fundamental. Although we may imagine autonomous vehicles that do not have human drivers, it is still driven by systems that need the driver to be attentive and take into account all the factors that affect the road, including human error. It is this aspect of the shared responsibility that taxi drivers and passengers share.

For example, automated dialing in of parts could lead to a completely new kind of manufacturing that exploits data on the road to optimize parts production. Similarly, driverless cars that park autonomously and take turns driving could lead to completely new kinds of travel, such as driverless horse-drawn carriages.All of these possibilities are already commonplace in the metropolis, but a new kind of metropolis is needed to handle all of the new forms of data and interaction that will be created as a result of all of this technology. This new kind of metropolis will have to address the old question of what is meant by ‘the city’, and the failure of traditional notions of what the city stands for. In the 21st century, cities are often seen as effacing certain kinds of complexity and wild spaces that exist in cities today. But in a metropolis, complexity is an accepted and inevitable part of the urban landscape, and wild spaces are only ever a symptom of the disease. Wild-card questions that arise in the current period are a sign that the city is in trouble, not because the</text>

These kinds of possibilities are endless, and they occur because of the inefficiency of the physical vehicle and its programming, or the inefficiency of the software that runs on it. In the physical world, in other words, the limits of what can be done with limited space and energy are a fundamental law of physics. If these limits are ignored, or even violated, negative effects can be felt. For example, critical electronic chips used in the car today are made by a semiconductor company that also makes chips for phones, computers, and sensors. The fact that these chips were once embedded in circuits that control many of the vehicle components is a fundamental aspect of the connected car. The fact that the codes that control the components are increasingly accessible and that they can be changed at will also opens up new ways of using that</text>

Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this sense, animals and plants – particularly those in the natural world – can be thought of as assets, and the experience of travel can be thought of as a form of slavery. In the service of the service, the animal is valued at more value than the natural world around it. Travel contributes to the service of capital through jobs, consumer products, financial speculation and the accumulation of vast amounts of data. It is the physical manifestation of the fetishisation of size and form. And yet, despite its nomadic character, travel contributes to the service of life itself, contributing to the establishment of a physical and mental geography favourable to the service of humanity.  So, ‘the ability to imagine is a crucial humanising skill’.1  So, the impulse for travel emerges from an awareness of the world as both possible and not necessarily certain, an awareness that one can ‘choose’ over the world. And yet, these same voyagers also know that travel is ‘not</text>

It is, in fact, possible to whip up imagination with little or no formal curatorial training. In fact, the extraordinary ability to imagine can itself is a skill that emerged in the service of the contemporary condition. It is the contemporary condition, but with the capacity to imagine any future condition. This makes it a force of imagination that is both adaptable (its capabilities can be adjusted) and malleable (its malleability opens the possibility of malleability). What is possible today is neither guaranteed nor assured, but it is possible that what we try to create is malleable enough to permit new experiences and predicaments. For many of us, this includes the experience of travel. Travel creates new situations and predicaments for many of us, and through travel, new social relations are formed. Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this conception, animals (and, by implication, animals in general) are placed in roles that are neither wild nor wild-animal, but which are culturally specific and have certain cultural values. (Some have animalistic traits, such as lions and tigers, while others are more humanlike, such as hyenas and giraffes.) As a result of this combination of nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle (with nomadic imagery) and the exotic animal-dolphin metropolis that it spawned (the automobile and its motor), human beings acquire cultural values and acquire languages.

For many of us, this includes the experience of travel. Travel creates new situations and predicaments for many of us, and through travel, new social relations are formed. Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this model, the human species is re-oriented from the bottom up, towards the top down. Through domestication, the human species is able to imagine itself in the form of a more naturalised animal (in this case, the horse), rather than in the form of a physical object. This is the model that the animal advocates use to justify industrial production. In the end, however, this model is just an idealized image of an idealised animal – a creature with certain distinctive physical features and an internal logic that distinguishes it from all other creatures. The actual process of domestication is far more complex and dynamic, and the advocates of the ‘bottom-up’ model of animal domestication need to study and master the complex systems and networks that create and emerge out of that model. Such systems and networks are not naturalised features or archetypes that emerge naturally from the conditions that animals face; rather, they are social mechanisms that evolve in response to the social and economic interactions that animals</text>

Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this sense, it can be seen as a kind of modern slavery. In this sense, animals are objects that humans have created to serve a particular function. The anthropologist Franz Boas describes the object as ‘a kind of legalized human writing that … permits us to articulate, imagine and take part in a kind of thought – thought, that is, in the sense that it is not a denial of history, but a reconfiguration of it … endowed with certain […] rights and privileges […] that we do not possess or confer upon any other living being, and that […] make us […] equal in dignity to other creatures […]'[27] Travel creates new situations for many of us, and through travel, new social relations are formed.Travel can also be imagined as nothing. Travel does not create new situations for many of us, but its presence nevertheless alters how we take part in society. It alters the role of the traveller, and it may well be the case that the very act of travelling creates</text>

Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this sense, animals, birds and animals in general, or in particular plants and animals with particular lives, are capable of serving as objects of travel, object of observation and metaphor. 	“Traveling Imaginary Beings” 	When we speak of domestication, we are usually talking about animals and the environment in general. This is not always the case, but when it is, we are usually talking about animals in human society. In human society, animals have particular social roles and relationships, and we humans are social animals. We are creatures who build and design societies and institutions to serve our own interests and desires. When we allow certain animals to do things for us, we often do not fully understand what that means politically or economically. For instance, when the British Museum decided to put up a statue of an elephant in its grounds at Buckingham Palace, a number of political activists criticised the decision based on the exploitation of elephants for commercial purposes. However, the biennial had its own</text>

For many of us, this includes the experience of travel. Travel creates new situations and predicaments for many of us, and through travel, new social relations are formed. Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this transformation of nomadic, sedentary forms of culture, cultures are created and destroyed. Yet when we think about the specific conditions of life in any given location, we inevitably end up there ourselves. We end up where we are because that is where we are found. There is no escaping this. We have to face the fact that we inhabit a different world from the one we were raised in. This reality is profoundly felt in the art world. I speak as someone who has been curator for many years now, and has been living in Berlin for several years now. I have a particular interest in the notion of where the art is when it is not actually there. And I see this all the time in the art world. I have curatorial skills, but they are used in a very different way than artists have. Curators use art as a tool to make sense of the world. They do not constructively use art as a vehicle to take us anywhere. When I first started in 2007,</text>

In the musical, ‘The Wizard of Oz’, Dorothy Gale includes the element of travel in her epilogue: ‘Who told you that you could only go where 'the golden eagles fly’?’. In the film Groundhog Day, Harold Ramis makes the same point when talking about Christopher Plummer's character in the film Groundhog Day.

For many of us, this includes the experience of travel. Travel creates new situations and predicaments for many of us, and through travel, new social relations are formed. Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this scenario, animals – humans included – are placed in situations that are similar to those of animals that emerged during the Neolithic period, around 8000 to 6000 BC. The domestication of the animal comes about through the interaction of humans with the environment, through the rationalization of need, and in the sense of the anthropologist Max Horkheimer, that involves the production of ever more efficient ways of transporting and managing goods and objects. The object that we eventually want becomes an object that can be moved and managed – more efficiently, in fact. This process of abstraction and economic exchange around the object calls forth a new mode of culture and society that is not necessarily a result of the historical process of industrialization but can be explained away as a function of the inevitable properties of the material world around us (including the anthropological process of human culture) – things that come to be through the process of production. In this case, the object is not the thing itself but rather the thing that is produced in the</text>

For many of us, this includes the experience of travel. Travel creates new situations and predicaments for many of us, and through travel, new social relations are formed. Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this sense, animals and plants – both natural and artificial – play a part in our social, economic and political systems that are shaped by the needs and desires of humans.Through their adaptations to the complex circumstances of the contemporary condition, the natural and social sciences can contribute to imagining a future with greater possibilities for its formation and survival. The social sciences can contribute to this through their disciplines of architecture and urbanization, which are tied to the conditions of the current condition and, in turn, to those of a future that is possible only through the modification of the present. The social sciences can also contribute to imagining a future through the study of travel and travel narratives, which come to us through cultural practices such as poetry, travel narratives, travel advertisements and the such. For instance, the use of bicycles in travel advertisements from the 1920s is thought by some to be a vital step in the development of the publicity of the automobile, and even though the origins of the feature are not completely clear, it is believed</text>

Travel can also be imagined as domestication. In this scenario, animals and plants are domesticated and taken into domesticated environments, becoming howsoever subordinate and dependent upon us they may become. This can happen through the domestication of agriculture, industry, culture, and language, in which case animals and plants are taken under the wing of humans and given the capacity for self-sufficiency.‘Cultural appropriation’ is a powerful political concept that has come to define modernity. It embodies the idea that modernity has arrived and that we have a duty to resist its effects. The first step in the process of modernity is the establishment of the political, legal and social order that supports the assumed social and ecological equality of the assumed imagined future social world. This process requires that there is a concerted and public effort to imagine and create new social relations, political and legal systems that support the assumed equality before the law of the assumed social world. The political, economic and social forms of cultural appropriation are intricately linked. The social and political struggles</text>

There is a way of people talking that isn’t necessarily what people choose to do. 	So what do we do when we think about the social? We often do things because we think that people will like them, or because we’ve heard others do things similar. But that doesn’t necessarily make them good or interesting. A person might choose to engage in something because that is what their own personal interests are, and because that is what is comfortable and natural for them. 	So what do we do when we encounter a place or social dynamic that we don’t understand? We’re tempted to jump to conclusions, to make generalisations and to generalise from there. And that is sometimes the most powerful and interesting work that we can do. But that work often needs to be done with care and nuance. And so the social encounter is often very illustrative, but it isn’t always perfect. There is always that element of travel and culture and experience that we should be adding to the mix. 	A place is either truly beautiful or truly horrific. And so when we think about the</text>

There is a way of people talking that isn’t necessarily what people choose to do. 	So what do we do when we think about the social? We tend to amplify the importance of our own social life, and neglect the social dynamics that are happening all around us. We tend to concentrate on the things that make life exciting for us, rather than the ways in which that life could be more interesting or more complicated for others. 	Here, we see the limit to what can be conveyed through language. We can no longer deny that there are complex social processes at play, and that our own social lives are often complex, uneven and incomplete. We can and should acknowledge that we have social lives too, and that they too are subject to the social dynamics that we create and institutionalise. Social encounters, whether they are socialising with friends or making new ones, are likely to be marked by moments of confusion, friction, anxiety and sometimes anger. But we also need to learn to love them and nurture them and allow them to develop into something beautiful and fulfilling for others. This sounds cliche, and it’s true. But</text>

There is a way of people talking that isn’t necessarily what people choose to do. 	So what do we do when we think about the social? We often talk about the need for cultural organisers to be involved in creating the social, but there is no easy answer to the question: how do we as artists, writers, choreographers and dancers create the kind of community involvement and involvement required to bring about a social transformation? There are many ways to approach cultural organising, and each is valid and can be employed in different situations. But what strikes me about the work that I do is the degree to which the social is reduced to the level of a function within a museum, or a festival. In the case of a festival, the social element is reduced to a paid engagement with nature, a set of activities that draw people together through their engagement with the festival, and sometimes to a paid opportunity to act in the festival through a paid engagement with the art gallery, or a community engagement with a commercial gallery. The level of engagement required to change all these elements is quite different from engaging with the social, as a political act or a demand for</text>

We tend to frame it as if it’s an interaction between people who happen to be located in the same city, but are also situated far away from each other. But there are other factors as well, which make the social more of a community effort. 	For instance, the fact that we live in the same city but are also situated far away from each other, makes it more likely that people will be able to come to an understanding about how to move forward in a multi-use space that they’ve collectively created. The fact that people are displaced as a result of development but also have to leave their houses because there aren’t enough affordable houses, makes it more likely that they will be able to find places to live where they can be part of a community. And finally, the fact that we live in the same city but are also situated in a far-flung region with distant destinations, makes it more likely that we will be able to find</text>

There is a way of people talking that isn’t necessarily what people choose to do. 	So what do we do when we think about the social and we don’t know what social engagements people will choose to engage with? We can choose to ignore the social and engage with nature. The choice is: do I want to become part of a natural ecosystem, or am I going to become a part of a social ecology? Nature has many tools at its disposal – including physical and social, economic and political – that can be used to actively participate in the social. For example, membership in a closely held community of farmers' cooperative is not a natural right, and such unions are often pushed by the very economic actors who employ and control the local land-use and development decisions. Likewise, workers in some cases own and control significant amounts of land and are therefore often the most engaged members of communities. Mutual Aid is another effective way to think about the social and its impacts. Mutual Aid is a term given when a collective of people come together to share a common goal – often a collective goal in itself – with the explicit intention of enabling those</text>

There is a way of people talking that isn’t necessarily what people choose to do. 	So what do we do when we think about the social? We often talk about community engagement and how it’s a two-fold approach: engaging the city through art, and then organising the city through government. But there are other ways of organising the city, and engaging the people who live there. Art has a very particular way of making visible spaces that are essentially public – something that politics and urban studies do not typically do. It is, in other words, pre-occupied with the city as a public realm, and engages with the very essence of who is a person in that public realm. Art has a particular vantage point, and that is a situation in which urban theorists and artists would find themselves uniquely placed. Urban theorists and artists would have a field day.Urban planners, artists and other concerned parties would find other things to do with the city.

The idea is to map out the social into geographical terms, and then use that data to help us make better social and spatial infrastructures. The problem with the city is that it’s too neat and tidy, and its inhabitants are too easily identifiable. So the map that emerges is likely to be quite illustrative, and not exactly accurate, in terms of the social structure of the city. The social realm is a much more complicated place, and much more ephemeral. There are so many players that we don’t know about – so much of what we think we know about people comes from the media and other cultural institutions. The fact that we don’t know how people actually make their social engagements worksfond of the city is another reason that the social generates an inaccurate map. There is a way of people talking that isn’t necessarily what people choose to do. 	So what do we do when we think about the social? We typically don’t identify as social. We tend not to think about how people actually connect. We tend to treat it as an object that we have to negotiate, that we’ve toil away at, that we’ve toil away at in order to build a social fabric. Social actors can and should engage in different modes of engagement. But they can and should also sit down and talk. 	The way in which language is constructed, the way in which knowledge is acquired, the way in which language is shared – all of these things are possible through language. And the more we learn, the more patterns emerge between people that we don’t necessarily know about. We don’t know how people find ways to connect through language, and we don’t know how people find ways to disengage from it. 	So what do we do? We can create language that is both malleable and malleable in ways that</text>

We tend to prioritize what can be said about them, but we also tend to overvalue what can be said about them. We tend to build up big picture narratives about the social, and then let the micro-stories speak the real stories. 	I once had the chance to teach a course in ‘Social Studies and Social Issues’ at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. It was a weekly, six week course, with a weekly topic of ‘Social Studies and International Relations for Young People’. We would study a particular theme, and then work through a case study that we had prepared from the course. For the last week of the course, we also did an online social project called ‘The Universitas Project’ that explored the idea of the ‘nation state’ in relation to the social. The project brought together representatives from different branches of knowledge to work on a project. Students would prepare a research proposal, speak to museums, local authorities</text>

There is a way of people talking that isn’t necessarily what people choose to do. 	So what do we do when we think about the social? We typically identify three broad categories of people who fit into one of these three broad categories: workers, consumers and residents. All three have certain core values that bind them together as a group. A person has a job because that is the only way that people with those values will engage with the city. A person has a job because that is the only way that the city will fund its operations. A person has a job because that is the only way that the city’s services will be available to meet the needs of its residents. 	But there are also invisible workers. People who put in long hours but don’t get paid a salary and yet still get to inhabit the city. There are also residents who move back and forth between the city and the region but don’t get to lay claim to the property that they build with their homes. There are residents who commute between the region and the city but don’t get to lay claim to the land that</text>

There is a way of people talking that isn’t necessarily what people choose to do. 	So what do we do when we think about the social? We often talk about social change as if it were a static process. It’s not always clear to whom our social vectors point, and why. 	The way in which we engage with our social social world is through what is often called the ‘pleasure center’ – the point where the highest pleasures can be found. Pleasure centers are places where people gather to exchange and socialize, to exchange money, food and other goods. They’re places where money is made, and pleasure is experienced. So the social feeds into the pleasure center, and the pleasure center into the mainstream. 	In the 1980s and 1990s, the social was intricately connected to the mainstream – in both modern and postmodern media culture, language, and art forms were all elevated to objects of exchange. So the idea of the social novel seemed necessary in order to engage with the social novel, and the social novel was essential in order to engage with the contemporary social.</text>

    brings together vast amounts of data, often gathered from diverse sources, to reveal patterns and trends across a city. The key is that the patterns and trends we uncover cannot be attributed solely to the city’s current or recent architecture. Urban structures play a role in the formation and perpetuation of their surroundings, and if we take that on board, we can then invest in producing vulnerable local infrastructure that can respond to changes in the socio-political system that result from the dynamic combination of a growing economy and an increasingly urbanised population.  In the 1970s and 1980s, for example, the explosive growth of Mexico City – which began soon after the cities were considered to be unmanageable – was fuelled by an aggressive policy of planning largely in response to the city’s economic quixotics of currency and food shortages. As a consequence, a great many Mexican cities were transformed from bad to worse by the end of that decade. Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing

The key is that we invest in infrastructure and development in the cities that are most at risk of becoming ‘disappeared’ – places where large numbers of people are moving into and out – so as to ensure that the next crisis doesn’t turn into a golden age of architecture and urban decay.  And we do that through progressive, if not ‘holistic’ forms of development that take into account the complexity of urban structures and the city’s fragmented landscape, but do so in a way that maximises the positive impacts of a dense and rapidly expanding population on a city’s natural resources and infrastructure.  One example of how to do that is the Mexican city that is Mexico’s largest and richest – at $5.5 trillion in 2016 terms – but also the poorest and most fragmented in the country.

Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing rapid population explosion and a third of a trillion dollar budget deficit. The combination of an expanding economy and an increasing population threatens urban infrastructure and infrastructure projects that feed it, from agriculture to retail to healthcare to education to everything in between. As a result, a great many cities have resorted to the use of eminent domain, the legal doctrine that emerged from the US Supreme Court in the 1980s in the context of urban growth and the public good. The doctrine holds that a government has the exclusive right to alter a city’s shape and size in response to specific criteria, most often defined as ‘economic development goals’.[4] The doctrine has recently resurfaced in light of a string of decisions that have dramatically increased federal control over development and policy in America. For example, in the 1990s, when Los Angeles County sought to reduce its massive, over-utilised and over-taxing Downtown L.A. property-belt, Jack Grossfeld argued that the ‘war on</text>

Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing rapid change thanks to agribusiness, but a city's ability to support its infrastructure in the face of rapid growth – which is now evident in Mexico City’s rapidly expanding population – is of great importance.  And yet, as cities around the world become more urbanised and urbanised, their infrastructures are being forced to uproot themselves deep into the city’s fabric due to a combination of government programmes, highly mechanised development and a general feeling that things have gotten too complicated and expensive in places like London. The result is that cities are no longer the preserve of ‘habitat warriors’ who build their futures around habitation, but of people who come to town to shop, eat and play ‘till’ – and now ‘s the season to be idle’.  As a result, ‘habitat warriors’ are leaving cities behind, heading to greener pastures, settling in cities with better</text>

Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing the effects of Malthusian urban sprawl. Yet despite these setbacks, the number of billionaires in Mexico City consistently hovers around the same as the number of cities – at least until recent years. Why? Because Mexico City is a city of last resort, its wealth concentrated in the last 20 percent. If the economy collapses in that last 20 percent, the city is the last place to be hit. Most Mexicans live in smaller towns or far away metropolitan areas. And as a rule, those with properties larger than 50 meters around metropolitan areas are better off than those with smaller ones. So while smaller towns and faraway metropolitan areas with their sprawling populations and rampant unemployment are the places with which people with a grudge against the state will always struggle, their relative deprivation and poverty barely registers in comparison to other parts of the country.  So although the rate of urban growth in Mexico City continues to outpace that of other Mexican cities, the magnitude and determinants of which cities are built on,</text>

As a consequence, a great many Mexican cities were transformed from bad to worse by the end of that decade. Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing similar problems in California and other parts of the world.  So, while we might wish to deny it, the real impetus for much urban growth in the world today is economic growth – and that is largely due to the growth of rich countries in the wake of the per capita income of just about every country on the planet, including in developing countries. As a consequence, the number of people living in major urban centres has skyrocketed, while the per capita income of developing countries has remained virtually constant. And so, while we might like to think of ourselves as urban-dwelling metropolises, we actually have a mixed-use housing crisis unfolding in many of our cities. Cities are the sites of growth and now some of the most volatile. But the social and spatial conditions that foster growth and make it possible for cities to sustainably grow – developing the cities, providing social and educational services to encourage good behaviour in the face of resource depletion – are becoming increasingly difficult to find.

As a consequence, a great many Mexican cities were transformed from bad to worse by the end of that decade. Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing rapid population growth and an assortment of other  infrastructural maladies. More than likely, the key to the city’s recent resurgence has much to do with its newly urbanised, economically mobile middle classes, which are much more open to information and readily available in urban environments, and which tend to consume more information about themselves and the world around them.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the megacity became the global symbol of technological creativity; now it is commonly cited as a factor in the growth of emerging economies. But once you start adding up the number of megacities, the global infrastructural model starts to fall down. In 1990, for example, Mexico City had a population of over six billion people; in 2014, it was reported that there were over six and a half billion people living in the country.8 Cities are creative and dynamic places, and they are vital for the development of any city.

Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing similar problems in their core metropolises.  In the early 1990s, the biennale was able to tackle these problems head-on by establishing partnerships with socially engaged organisations, and through an innovative use of existing museums and cultural institutions.  The problem with the biennale today is that it plays host to a growing number of disinterested visitors who gravitate towards the same particular experience – which is often quite different from what the artist intended – and demand the same particular set of activities. As a result, it is increasingly difficult to sustain a biennale – especially one as large as the one we’re currently experiencing – without becoming entangled in a host of other, more systemic tourism and cultural issues.  So even if the biennale is up to its current organisational problems, it is also critical to create mechanisms by which the diverse parts can come together and address the underlying causes of the disjointed experiences we’re experiencing now.

Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing similar problems in their capitals.  In the 1990s and early 2000s, the financial crisis in Iceland largely blamed on hyper-inflated real estate markets there, which in turn fed into a wave of corruption and nepotism that in turn fed into the rise of NRx, which in turn fed into the financial crisis in Cyprus. Today, the crisis in Cyprus is much more complicated, and may even be a solution itself. But the main causes of the crisis in Iceland are still there – namely, an irresponsible central government, a reckless private banking sector, and an unsustainable residential housing market. The main effect of the crash in Iceland may well be that it has left many cities worse off than when they were bailed out by the European financial system.  The problem with the current crisis in Cyprus is that it is being driven by a private banking sector that is much too powerful, and too insulated from the rest of the population.

Now, many major cities in Mexico are in serious decline, and many others are experiencing rapid population explosion due to over-crowding, conflict and violence. A decade after Mélbaza, cities in many poorer places around the world are experiencing similar demographic changes, but are also experiencing a number of displacements. In the 1980s and 1990s, the response to these patterns was to embark on a massive urban renewal programme, which in many cities was sparked by the economic crunch. In places where there is no sharpened need for expansion, such as in China or Russia, this has become an increasingly difficult proposition, as evidenced by the rapid population growth there.  So even as we conduct geo- and urban-research-based projects in poorer parts of the world, we must also learn to appreciate the importance of geography in our larger socio-political systems. We’re not born with the skills or the places to develop the knowledge, but we must all work together as partners to create the knowledge. This isn’t easy in poorer parts of the world, and</text>

So, while the biennial may have arrived, it is not necessarily where we are headed. We need to reckon with the fact that, today, the biennial may not even be where we are headed. That is, the trajectory of the biennial may be a lot more interesting, dynamic and random than the trajectory of the actual exhibitionary market – in which we are all participants – and the art world as a whole, which recognises the increasing randomness and randomness of the market in its own way. 	So, how do we shift the artworld from the biennial to the cultural sector, and how might this affect the way that we look at certain kinds of art? I think that there are three ways to think about it: historical, pedagogical and terminological. 	The first is to consider the volumetric transcription of bi</text>

The biennial as an institution is part of a much broader dynamic that is amenable to research and analysis, and can therefore be more easily analysed. 	There are many objects in the Tate box that could be analysed and analysed to produce a complete theme. One such example is the corner gallery that Harold Bornstein found in the South Bank tower he was renovating. Inside the corner gallery, Bornstein found a set of paintings that listed the names of women who had worked on Tower Hamlets Council during the 1960s and 1970s. He concluded that the works they depicted constituted a ‘truly international tapestry’. One of the women featured in the work was Shirley Bassey, whose portrait he displayed in the gallery. Bassey responded by creating the Birkenhead Biennial, an exhibition of her work in the borough. Its title was a play on words, a pun on Bassey’s earlier Bi</text>

Around the turn of the century, Bon Secours issued its first series of five annuals, continuing the tradition that the city had been instilling in young people, in a steady stream for the next five decades. The city’s cultural-economic miracle, in other words, came about when the biennial was seen by many as a legitimate form of art-historical object, and by others as a legitimate form of cultural artefact. Today, it is generally agreed that the biennial has arrived, and is here to stay. Where once it was confined to the pages of a journal, the biennial is now everywhere, and everywhere in a definitive sense. It is the new exhibit in a museum, the new art exhibit in a gallery, and the new art-historical object in a zine. It is the new form of destination, the ultimate end point, and the ultimate object of desire. It</text>

But it is the only one that can claim the title of cultural capital with such firm footing. 	Also, despite the insistence of successive governments, including the coalition that reigned for five years in 2009–10, that ‘cultural organisations’ were self-sustaining sources of economic power in the city, the biennial has, since its inception in 1990, been a public-sector enterprise: taxpayers have funded part of its funding, partly through direct grants and loans. As a result, its activities tend to align more closely with those of other institutionalised forms of cultural activity. A more</text>

To understand the phenomenon of the cultural pinch one has to understand the other. 	In recent years, cultural studies has become a terminal discipline, unable to sustain the kind of critical eye that characterises the more extreme forms of its own growth, which is why art-historical manuscripts are dying out, why biennials are on a trajectory to become non-existent, why cultural studies is now so ubiquitous that it is almost a necessity course in most university courses on the planet, and why biennials are now so concerned with showing their collections that they may be able to cobble together from various points of view, even if this limits the kind of imagination that existed in the first place.

Is it the ‘biennial with a collection of works selected from various museums and archives’ that is so influential in the museum-going public, or is it the more radical proposal that one might acknowledge the increasing ubiquity of cultural consumption and cultural capitalism as a global crisis?

A narrative that begins with a biennial, an important but by now rare commodity, and ends with a museum piece – or a handful of smaller works – would read like a novel. It would be the work of art, or at least an approach that maintains a literary quality to the narrative. It would disclose the hidden life of the art, often in opaque ways, that we do not yet fully understand. And it would tell the story through the moral lessons of cultural-political engagement. 	Such is the potential. But for the most part, curators and art administrators remain trapped in their craft, their curatorial language, their art form, and their subject matter. They have little choice but to provide the required information to the artists, critics, collectors and publics that frequent the museum or the art market, and to some extent also to the researchers who monitor and analyse art within and beyond the museum walls</text>

And if that is so, then what does that make the other? Does that mean the other end of the coin, the other side of the coin, where art is but a component part of a wider cultural-economic complex? That seems to me to be the other edge of the coin; the edge that is the currency of the biennial but not the asset (or the debt) of the region. 	My own take is that the biennial needs to have its own kind of character, in order to engage with the other ends of the scale. It’s up to the biennial to establish what its other boundaries are, and to worry less about the edges of the biennial itself and more about the peripheries; what it means for an institution to be based in a particular city?

In fact, there is some evidence that this kind of externalisation is good for the biennial: the biennial has a kind of internal consistency that makes its own maintenance a necessity. The biennial has to be sustainable in order to keep its identity firmly embedded in its subject matter, and it is not unusual for it to become visible in a city, visible outside its city, and visible in only a very narrow circle of places. This kind of internal consistency is good for the biennial as a whole: it keeps its social mission firmly embedded in the city, and it gives it that distinctive but also potentially powerful kind of identity that it can use to generate new ideas, act upon those ideas, and so forth. In the words of Paul McCarthy, who was the curator of the 2011 Venice Biennale and was also the exhibition maker at the London and Venice Biennales, the following biennials</text>

As biennials get busier and busier with their fundraising appeals, and as their events become more institutionalised, the situation is likely to get worse. The problem with the biennial is that it is institutionalised in the form of a biennial – which means that its problems go beyond the curatorial rigours of the biennial itself. To some extent this is true of the biennial as a structured form, and in that sense the problems it tries to solve are problems of the larger biennial – in the sense that large cultural systems tend to accumulate in the form of institutionalised modes of knowledge. But the biennial also has an institutionalised form that is deeply embedded in the cultural-economic landscape: it is both the venue and the object of economic dependency. It is both the face of the art-world as a whole and a privileged elite subset of artists, curators and collectors who know and appreciate every trick</text>
