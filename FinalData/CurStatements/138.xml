Sebastián in the Arsenale. S. Sebastián was a French writer and critic best known for his critical writings on modernism and related topics. Although Canguilhem was a French citizen, his ideas about the biennale as a transnational event that exploits space and public for commercial ends are deeply rooted in his country’s intellectual and urban history. 	The new generation of biennials is engaged with the question: how to honor, discuss and ultimately inhabit the past while experiencing the contemporaneity of the present, both in the museum and in the real life? In the case of the Arsenale, the Museum triumphed over the Biennale, which felt compelled to present a unified history of the building and its curatorial staff’s participation in the biennale. The Museum’s proposal was more an assertion of identity and place over time, and the projection of the biennale’s current curatorial role as a re-enactment of its past. 	In these circumstances, the Biennale – which had been committed to permanent cur</text>

In the main exhibition hall the new generation of artists is engaged with a project that began in 2014 with the installation of a bronze copy of Georges Canguilhem’s La biennale de S. Sebastián in the Arsenale. S. Sebastián was a French writer and critic best known for his critical writings on modernism and contemporary art. In 1994 he co-founded the biennale, which became an international sensation, and in 1998 he won a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant for his critical writings on the Columbian Exposition. In 2015 the biennale began a new phase with the permanent installation of a video and photographic archive of the exposition. In 2017, the archive was expanded to include the work of the architect and biennale producer Willem de Kooning, who also worked with Architectural Gothic and ARS to design the new biennale. 	The new biennale is a multi-disciplinary event that engages imagination, feelings, behaviour, knowledge and geography, taking place in five main chapters: design, architecture, fashion, publics and transportation. Each chapter presents a different aspect of the biennale, offering a unique perspective on the cultural, economic and urban evolution of the city in the last decades of the nineteenth century.

In the main exhibition hall the new generation of artists is engaged with a project that began in 2014 with the installation of a bronze copy of Georges Canguilhem’s La biennale de S. Sebastián in the Arsenale. S. Sebastián was a French writer and critic best known for his critical writings on modernism, but he has been developing a new generation of essays and reviews that engage with the possibilities, challenges and anxieties of a biennale today. These will be published in several formats including a memoir, an essay and a collection of over 100 essays. The project was supported by the French National Endowment for Democracy, the Sorbonne, the Agence national du Québec, and the Canadian Institutes for Advanced Research. 	In 2014, the Canadian Museum for Tractative Art and Archives (C.M.T.A.A.) selected C.E. Singer’s Children of the Great Depression: The Art and Politics of Abandonment from the Crisis to Recovery, from 1996 to 2016, as one of a set of projects that year. This project, which sought to use the collection of depositories of former U.S. savings and loan, represented a new and aggressive approach to art and culture in the aftermath of the crisis.

In the main exhibition hall the new generation of artists is engaged with a project that began in 2014 with the installation of a bronze copy of Georges Canguilhem’s La biennale de S. Sebastián in the Arsenale. S. Sebastián was a French writer and critic best known for his critical writings on modernism and cultural Marxism. In recent years, he has been producing a host of essays in collaboration with the Center for a New Culture, including the 2017 collection  Signs, Signs of Life. In 2014, he published a collection of essays entitled The Third Party, including essays on the US presidential election of 2016. In this connection, he was a co-editor of the online version of Stages published by the Centre for a New Culture.  	The gathering of contemporary and historical artists and thinkers is a gathering of those who have had some kind of meaningful engagement with the contemporary condition. It is a gathering that is increasingly occuring in the presence of, or even taking place in, the immediate aftermath of, a major artistic event, such as a biennial, a major exhibition, or a major festival. It is a gathering, in other words, of people whose work is part of a canon, or who are part of a canonised tradition, and whose work is part of a</text>

Sebastián in the Arsenale. S. Sebastián was a French writer and critic best known for his critical writings on modernism and postmodernism, especially in France. His biennale was one of the first to offer a platform to consider the cultural impacts of postindustrialisation. The project has been renewed and revised several times, with several different iterations occurring in different cities in different regions of the world. The 2014 version, now housed in the Museum of Modern Art, included a ‘re-constituting’ section that sought to draw attention to the city’s past through a series of sculptures and installations that combined elements of architecture and art. These were complemented with a narrative by short stories that reflected the region. These stories, based on a region’s traditional and contemporary folk tales, were then used to imagine a future in which people could return to the region and participate in the way that the region had always been engaged with, through art, farming, fishing, gathering, travelling etc. By the early twentieth century, many European cities were experiencing a style of urban revival driven by artistic</text>

Sebastián in the Arsenale. S. Sebastián was a French writer and critic best known for his critical writings on modernism and cultural imperialism. In 2014 the Biennale announced the commission of a curator-selection process for the main exhibition, in which the French and Italian artworks in the main categories of the Biennale would be presented in their respective languages. In 2015 the Biennale chose Italian artist Paolo Portoghesi, whose works in recent years have focused on the relationship between art and biennials, as its curator. In 2016 the Biennale chose Colombian artist Alfredo García Muñoz as its curator of the new century, and the year before that, in 2017, a Swedish curator. In the case of a Spanish speaker, he was the curator of the first half of the twentieth century, and in the case of an Italian, the first half of the twentieth century. The fact that the biennial subjects are all from the same city or region (with similar social, political and economic contexts) suggests that their historical and contemporary circumstances are similar, although there are notable differences</text>

His new biennale of the same name is being developed for October 2018 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. 	[1] M.E.A. program, in its early years, was a place where the political, economic and social development of many cities was actively coordinated through a series of local, state and national biennials. The biennial became increasingly opaque in relation to the city’s economic development, but with the support of successive federal governments it came to define a particular temporality in relation to the city. In 1964 the biennial was reorganized and renamed the National Museum of the American West. In 1990 the biennial shifted to the National Gallery of Canada, and in 1992 the Franciscan Missionary Church of Canada, which at the time was supporting the West Coast</text>

Sebastián in the Arsenale. S. Sebastián was a French writer and critic best known for his critical writings on modernism, but he has also written extensively on the biennale, especially as an institution. In the run-up to the biennale, the Arsenale commissioned a series of six books published in 2017, which the curator Florentino Pascual Martín has described as ‘a work in progress’.1  The six works – three by artists and one by a journalist – deal with ‘the politics and ideologies of biennials’ in a range of major cities around the world. Their publication coincides with the one year anniversary of C.M. Arsenale, and the year of the first Venice Biennale, which is also published in the Bulletin de Compostacion (26 September–12 October 2017). Publication in major venues around the world coincides with the institution’s global expansion, which is driven by the Arsenale’s sales and marketing campaigns, as well as the collection and maintenance of a large archive of works by</text>

Sebastián in the Arsenale. S. Sebastián was a French writer and critic best known for his critical writings on modernism and cultural consumption. His biennale was one of the first to offer a platform for the exchange of ideas and opinions, especially in the wake of the political events of that year. The project has gone on to host numerous conversations about the meaning and future of culture consumption, with artists, curators, writers and others coming together to explore the notions of participation, participation theory and biennials in the age of social media. The biennale that year – which was co-curated by Isabelle Huppert and Marcelo Ruiz-Leite – used materials from the Arsenale collection to explore the ways in which cultural consumption shapes our everyday experience of the material world. The workshop series ‘Culture Currencies’ opened with a discussion of the ways in which cultural consumption is produced in the contemporary world, and offers a possible response to some of the criticism of the contemporary biennale.

In the second half of that same year, the Spanish cultural authority, Instituto de Artes Mundi, commissioned two parallel exhibitions, one in Madrid and one in Barcelona, to mark the second half of the nineteenth century. The Catalan and Spanish biennials of that period were co-chosen by the director of the Spanish National Film and Television Archive, María Parra, with an opening act specially chosen by her. The institution that holds the copyright to the works now calls itself, in Spanish, the Instituto de Arte Contempora de Seguridad Universal (international association for the historical preservation of art and culture). The name comes from the first letter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was written in Seguridad del Mundo, the national language of the Maya people, in response to the domination and exploitation of that history and culture by European powers.

More and more, authors are turning to the arts as a means to imagine and theorise the future. This is partly due to the advent of social media and collaborative coding, but also to the advent of graphic design, animation and web design. Journalist, writer and director of the Open Humanities International, Deborah Levy, offers a detailed survey of the changing forms of science-fictional science, in her book The Second Humanity series: ‘Art as Science Fiction’, published in 2012: ‘From Basic Forms to Meta-Forms, 1890–1945.

In the art world, the share of people living in cities has remained constant, while the globalised museum has become ever more of a museum of consumption. In the discipline of art history, cities make up a large part of the historical ‘temporality’, while in the discipline of art, they are a core part of the ‘context of production’. In the contemporary art world, the former is increasingly seen as essential to the latter and, in many cases, the former is the only option left.In an attempt to encompass all aspects of contemporary art, the Biennalee chose to make its title an open question. In the past, the Biennalee has simply announced that it is a biennale.

In The Contemporary Condition (2013), Peter Osborne portrayed the effects of climate change in a range of artworks, including the effects on London’s Thames waterfront, where a new generation of artists are developing publics of their own future waterfront projects.[1] The project was funded by the Natural Philosophers Trust, the Biennale Research Fund, the Leverhulme Trust and the Arts Council.[2]See: http://www.biennalereform.org.uk/cases/uk-england-europe.html#sthash.uQhBq.3Jl.2014.11.2014.x.x.y.y.y.3Jl.2014.11.14.x.y.y.3Jl.2014.11.29.x.y.y.3J</text>

Art biennials may well play a prominent role in these new forms. But they will play no small role in the establishment of healthy cultures, in my opinion. Art biennials will play a crucial role in the establishment of human cultures, and human cultures only – beyond the artworld.Download this article as PDFEmily PringleEmily Pringle is an artist.

In an increasingly globalised and integrated economy, ‘ordinary people’ in ‘ordinary’ situations constitute a growing share of the global population. As a consequence, biennials of the future may be found in multidisciplinary research projects, in art institutions, in urban centres, in remote places, or in some case in completely different human-computer interfaces. Nevertheless, the main objective of these projects remains the same: to engage the public, to foster understanding, to produce connections and to offer opportunities to engage with the ever-expanding and dynamic real-life situation. The biennial format is an essential part of this continuous work, but it is also a form of cultural circulation and a place where politics, policy and architecture intersect and mix. In an ever-expanding and ever-interdependent society, politics and policy are naturally most acute where there are large-scale public programmes of biennials on the one hand, and on the other, the more obvious but still essential elements of cultural self-healing and human-machine collaboration on the one hand, including, but not limited to, the biennial itself. In an increasingly digitised and mobile society, this interplay of public and human-machine culture is increasingly difficult to imagine or to grasp, but it</text>

In an increasingly globalised and integrated economy, ‘ordinary people’ in ‘ordinary’ situations constitute a growing share of the global population. As a consequence, biennials of the future may be found in multidisciplinary research projects, in art institutions, in urban centres, in remote wilderness areas and in the vast, uninhabited outer space that is the result of human culture.Art is an essential part of this ‘big picture’. In the twentieth century, art as a cultural form emerged in China, and later in Europe, and spread to other parts of the world. In the twenty-first century, art as a cultural form is expected to spread to other parts of the world. The question is, which part of the world will that be found? The location of the future cities will depend on the decisions that are being made now regarding the future ecological and climatic conditions. It may be that the biennials of the future will be found in the cities of the present, such that the art museums of the future will be located in the core, or in the peripheries. This is the current planning of many cities, and it is an option for many reasons, some positive and some negative. It is a change from the past, in</text>

The biennial may also consist of visiting arts institutions and cultural institutions ‘operating on a notional basis’, operating on a seasonal or ‘holidays’ basis, or as a ‘partnership’ with tourism agencies. The latter two senses of ‘partnership’ are increasingly important, as tourism agencies increasingly target ‘high-value, high-impact visitor destinations’ such as biennials. Recent biennials, such as those organised by the London Biennial and Museo de Arte Contempora, represent a new ‘gold standard’ in the book of ‘partnerships between art institutions and cultural groups’.5.

The biennial has become an essential node in a globalised and integrated urbanisation process, providing us with critical perspectives on the changing urban landscape, but it is also an essential part of this process that seeks to map the human population movements that are driving this transformation. On a globalised and integrated level, biennials of the future will be found in cultural capitals of the world, their distribution of resources and cultural consumption patterns in relation to the distribution of resources and cultural consumption patterns in the world as a whole. The biennial becomes an essential part of any ecological or urbanisation agenda, providing critical perspectives on the social and spatial relations that are produced by a given society, and on the relations between culture and geography that are also being transformed.

London’s Tate Modern, for example, continues to be a staple of the biennial catalogue.The main objective of the biennial has come to depend on what is perceived as a ‘big picture’ – a concept that is increasingly contested in an era of increasingly globalised and integrated economies. In an increasingly globalised and integrated economy, ‘ordinary people’ in ‘ordinary’ situations constitute a growing share of the global population. As a consequence, biennials of the future may be found in multidisciplinary research projects, in art institutions, in urban centres, in ‘better’ off’ neighbourhoods, in ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ – organisations that increasingly increasingly demand data and data-gathering skills. In this increasingly urbanised world of ubiquitous connectivity and data capture, the biennial may also be seen as a relic of a bygone era of urban architecture and culture. Hence, the biennial is often characterised as an era of biennials in declining cities. Yet, this is not at all accurate. Far from it. As biennials of the future, we are in fact in a technologically mediated age where information overload and data capture are the order of the day. We are hooked on data and we are artists, urbanists and urban strategists in our own right. We are urban commentators and urbanists in our own right. We have our sources of urban wisdom and knowledges. We have to ask ourselves and others questions such as: what does it take to build a</text>

In this position, it became necessary to secure a separate venue for each of the five continents – Berlin, New York, Sydney, Seoul and Basel.

In an increasingly globalised and integrated economy, ‘ordinary people’ in ‘ordinary’ situations constitute a growing share of the global population. As a consequence, biennials of the future may be found in multidisciplinary research projects, in art institutions, in urban centres, in remote locations and with no country identity, much less a country identity. The biennial has become one of the most valuable forms of the ‘common good’. In the contemporary era of ever more comprehensive, urban and integrated forms of documentation, it is no longer possible to say whether an institution represents a shared or historical past – or even an idea or a set of ideas. Art and its place in the biennial – and in art in general – is a complex and variable proposition.Art is art, and art is generally understood to be an economic agent that produces its own social and political transformation. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the biennial could become a social institution – nor that it would replace other forms of institutionalised cultural forms such as museums or large monuments – but the attraction of the biennial as an art form is primarily political, driven by the political and the cultural logic that underlies the biennial. Biennials of the future may be art collections, but their</text>

The initial scope of the project is to monitor and analyse the economic impact of the Biennale through a public-private partnership. The partnership has expanded to include the provision of critical materials, technical and financial support for the project, as well as a reserve of up to 150,000 Swiss Francs (SD) at the end of the project. 	The citizen science initiative was developed as a collaborative effort between the city of Liverpool and L’agenda, a public company established to manage the development of the Italian part of the Sausalito International Airport. The objective of the project is to monitor and analyse the economic impact of the Biennale through a public-private partnership, while providing critical materials, technical and financial support for the project. 	The partnership between the city and L’agenda is a new model for the collaborative, public sector ‘next big thing’. It is a model that actively seeks to engage with, and supports, the project in a way that is informed by, and responds to, the values of the Biennale. This engages with the city as a producer, rather than as a consumer, and draws on the city’s vast and ever-expanding</text>

The citizen science initiative has two components:  	an in-browser online survey and a mobile app that is downloaded over mobile networks; 	both developed in-house at the Biennale. The first component, the survey, allows visitors to explore a detailed understanding of how the Biennale is generated, organised and delivered out of neighbourhood to the viewer. The app allows residents to add their thoughts and questions to the online version of the survey. Questions related to the Biennale’s format or organization, such as how to choose a venue, audience, or topic, can be asked and answered in the Biennale’s interactive, 360-degree venue, the 'Performing Arts' building at the University of Liverpool. 	The second component, the 360-degree venue, is a new concept introduced in Liverpool by Biennale co-founder, Joasia Krysa. It allows audience members to</text>

The partnership has expanded to include the provision of critical materials, technical and financial support for the project, as well as the construction of a new urban research centre. 	The citizen science initiative has two parts: part monitoring, part learning. Part of the project consists in gathering and collating information about the Biennale, building a public register of knowledge, about which is then passed on to the neighbouring organisations that are members of the Biennale’s research consortium. 	The part that is learned is the part that becomes operative when the two parts come together as a whole. As a result of this collation and aggregation, a public register is formed and new knowledge about the Biennale is created. This raises the question: what challenges does the public sector face in its work with the Biennale? 	As an organisation, Liverpool Biennial faces many challenges today: challenges that could be addressed through a citizen science initiative. The biggest challenge for the Biennale at the moment is the ever-present threat from violent extremism, which seeks to impose its interpretation of Islam or other</text>

The citizen science initiative has two parts: the Monitoring and Analysis project and the Community Land Trust. The project was originally conceived as a research project for a master’s thesis, and the two parts have come together to form a new kind of research project. The project now seeks to expand the scope of the project beyond the confines of the city, by creating joint ventures with other institutional partners to provide critical infrastructure support for the Biennale. 	The partnership between the Biennale and the city council has been developed as a pilot project, and a further phase 2 is currently under way with the council's backing. The aim is to develop a joint venture that will provide permanent affordable housing for up to 30% of the project’s target market.

The citizens science initiative has two main components: monitoring and analysis. Monitoring the impact of the Biennale through passive and active materials and systems is the responsibility of the participants, while critical design and monitoring functions are performed by a hybrid research institute (HR), which is drawn from local authorities and public sector bodies. Skilled practitioners from local authorities, civil engineering and urban studies departments take part in the project’s research and development process through established partnerships. The hybrid research institute combines traditional research methods with new media and capabilities, enabling collaborative research on issues relevant to the Biennale, while maintaining independence from the city. 	The Biennale’s first collaborative project, carried out in partnership with Rotterdam-based firm Witte Rend, examined how people react to different materials and manufacturing processes when exposed to them in different ways. The project involved placing coloured plastic pellets in water containing ethanol and other chemicals, and monitoring their reaction with water</text>

In the 2015 Liverpool Biennial, a 'citizen science' initiative was developed to address the structural inequalities and injustices that emerge from economic development and urbanization in the city.

The partnership has expanded to include the provision of critical materials, technical and financial support for the project, as well as a position in the future design of Liverpool. 	Within the framework of the citizen science initiative, a project like this one could be developed with citizen participation and collaborative research, while the city grows more like Liverpool, in that it is continuously monitored and controlled. 	The question is: what might a multi-year, multi-edition, ‘once in a generation’ project look like? 	In this model, the city is the laboratory, and biennials are the (temporary) theatres of urbanization. The aim is to observe and detect cultural phenomena that occur during the course of a given project, or ‘phase’ in the case of a ‘long-term’ project. Citizen scientists would join artists, local authorities, artists' organising bodies and other stakeholders, as well as academics, in a multi-disciplinary mapping and research enterprise that would reveal ‘snapshots’ of the cultural life taking place within the city at a</text>

The citizen science programme builds on previous experience in Liverpool to expand upon the knowledge acquired during the project. The aim is to provide a public platform on which structural inequalities can be addressed, whilst simultaneously enabling a collective and dynamic exploration of the social and political processes that generate and emerge from them. This approach is complementary to the physical and virtual effects of the Biennale, which is increasingly being perceived as a public relations disaster. 	In an attempt to bring transparency to the process, the partnership has decided to share certain technological and scientific secrets with the public at large. These new institutionalised forms of knowledge production will be facilitated through an initiative codenamed Projections, named for the location of the Tate Modern, in reference to the city’s medieval primary school for artists.

Cultural institutions were particularly important to the Biennale in their consideration of the use of their platforms. The institution that emerged from this process is a response to the question, not so much of what can be done with the event, but what can be done without it. The aim of this institution is to offer a platform for the exchange of cultural ideas and to foster the production of knowledge through research-based practices, while enabling the exchange of cultural values through research-intensive cultural practices. 	The Biennale has entered a new phase where the artworks are installed in permanent locations or fabricated entirely new configurations, and the city adapts itself to the new form of the biennale’s activities.

After a brief incubation period in 2017, the project is now calling for public and stakeholder feedback before proceeding any further. If implemented, this new public-private partnership would provide the required institutional and financial support for the project at a later date, with a phased approach over several years. If fully implemented, the project could potentially replace the role of the Biennale, providing a greater degree of transparency and accountability. 	In this regard, the project is unique in that it calls for a citizen-led, transparent and accountable incubation phase, followed by a fully accountable post-acceleration phase. This latter phase would entail a permanent monitoring and analysis of the project through a public and stakeholder-driven participatory process, with a view to enabling a future urban redevelopment scheme. 	In this regard, the project calls for a multi-year participatory plan that extends beyond the initial public investment of CASH 6.5 million to address</text>

Yet such structural changes are always fragile, and much of what is applied in the latter half of the 20th century was actually designed to address the problems of the former half. In this sense, we can say that the cultural practices of the postindustrial society are reflections of the social situations in which capitalism was at its best and worst. At its best, this means adapting to the new economic and political circumstances created by the explosion of information and communication technologies, and to the fact that many of the social goods and services provided by capitalism are now provided by platforms that are created with the support of both governments and large financial institutions. At its worst, it means providing for the future while also adapting to the impact of climate change and other forces reshaping the planet. 	</text>

Rather, what is needed is an awakening of cultural resources directed towards the maintenance of knowledge rather than the growth of artificial things, things capable of sustaining life’s cycles of culture.’3 Such is the  	logic of the cultural reductionist.Yet the cultural reductionist is not easily persuaded or dismissible, and recent deep genealogical studies reveal that cultural reductionism is deeply entwined with economic and social realities all around the world. For example, the economic collapse of the Soviet Union brought with it an enormous reduction in population, but the social costs were immense, with a mass emigration of people both inside and outside the</text>

The question of faith perforates the challenge, but it is also the preserver of the human spirit. 	[3] It is worth noting that the search for meaning in seemingly random events – technological disruption, economic irrationality, geopolitical maneuvering – is what gave rise to the emergent technologies of social media, instant messaging and blogging. Such technological distraction often seems necessary in order to perform certain functions, but its realisation can seem downright silly. 	[4] Technology is a powerful abstraction, but it also has significant, if subtle, effects on the world we inhabit.

Today, the language of the future seems to be more or less appropriate when discussing such things, and the pre-scientific worldview of the past.’’[6]The third trend is ecological and cultural reductionism. This refers to the behaviour of cultures in the face of environmental destruction and societal collapse, and it is understood by some cultural theorists to be a form of existential crisis. In the words of Gregory Bateson, ‘the cultural reductionism of the twentieth century was primarily a response to what he saw as the inevitable loss of religious meaning and purpose in the wake of global urbanization and economic growth’[7]. The anthropologist Viljoen Van Wyck makes a similar point when discussing the declining numbers of the Native people across the North American continent: the more that each population was removed from the site of the sacred, which is located in the interior of the country, the less sacred that land became.

Today, technology is everywhere, and has become a principal platform upon which all manner of discourse, all manner of manipulation is made possible.’, Pressfield writes, and this is no exaggeration; it is becoming ever more evident that the technologies of the future will be far more numerous and flexible than those of the past. Pressfield is echoing Kantor’s characterisation of technology as a negative but positive influence, which he employed to describe the excesses and perversions that have become the defining characteristics of the contemporary species.Modernity is being defined not so much by the technologies of science and technology but rather by the ways in which they are affecting culture and society. The question is what can be done to adapt culture to accommodate and accommodate with these new systems of control?

The term has come to represent, in the minds of many, the new normalisation of power, material abundance, consumer culture, and in many cases, of the very notion of history.3   	Technology is now often cited as a means to an end, but this usage is often misleading. While the means may be technological, there is a much broader perspective that needs to be considered. Perspectives on the past, on the social ramifications of technological change, and on the future of humanity are often rendered into symbols and motifs. The use of biotechnology as a way to engineer species to fulfil certain functions is a prime example of this.4   	Rather than trying to anticipate what technologies will one day</text>

In other words, the limitations of technology are not technological in nature, but political, economic, and ideological.3   	3 	It is true that in the West, the proliferation of computer systems and connected devices has put tremendous strain on already limited resources. But this is offset by the fact that these devices are increasingly used in tandem – connecting peripherals, computing devices, data storage and more – which means that the human capacity for self-healing is greatly reduced. This political and biological change is reflected in the nature of the computer – which is no longer programmed into a specific binary or tabular sense, but is instead multipurpose, capable of representing data in many forms and conveying ideas across vast distances – but it is also reflected in the rise of new media such as social media.

Globalisation is the system that distributes wealth and cultures across globalised locations; in effect, it is the underlying logic of the global economy. Yet questions of identity, language, labour, labour mobility and labour mobility are pre-eminent concerns for those locations where the global commodity becomes liquid and no longer represents an intrinsic value. Globalisation creates opportunities for corporations to subvert labour, to work out labour contracts that best suit the needs of the mega-corporation, and to shift labour flows almost entirely to machines.Globalisation creates new kinds of migrants.

His assertion is backed up by numerous scientific and academic studies, which consistently demonstrate a growing global population explosion, stunted birth rates, rising seas, more intense industrialization and other impacts that can be traced to the actions of humans in the wake of global commerce and urbanization.

The problem with the present moment is not limited to those outside of the urban centres. It is felt all around the globe and it affects those who have less than immediate access to resources or connect with cultural experiences. For instance, those less connected may be reluctant to engage with the art because they feel alienated or inadequate, but the reality of the situation is that the art is there for a reason, and the reason why the art is there is understood by many people. The biennale’s engagement with the globalised urban centres that it represents may have contributed to create a false sense of accessibility, but it is also a result of how the art was always seen as a last resort, and thus, at least in part, a response to the challenge posed by the biennale’s comparatively lower profile and wider</text>

It is apparent that the engagement and potential of artists, especially emerging or experimental artists, in curating activities was negotiable, since it was not only the city that placed a premium on artist-generated creativity, but also the Biennale itself. While this ‘valuable contribution’ to the development of biennials was made by a small community of artists and their collaborators, it is undeniable that artists and their collaborators saw an opportunity to exploit the community’s collective creativity. This is particularly evident in the work of local artists who established local networks of artist-recruitment and became enablers of the Biennale’s growth. It is these networks,</text>

It evolved into a project for a specific set of questions, questions that at its inception were framed in terms of people rather than in relation to specific places and people. These questions emerged as a direct result of the participatory methodologies developed during the early part of the project: the Architecture of Community Suite (2001–2006), the Development of Community Design (2007–2010) and the Constructive Thinking from Below (2011–present). The question of where to draw the line between art and architecture emerged as a way to engage with the notion of land-use in an innovative way. While the concept of place had been around for a while, the extent to which it constituted a meaningful boundary or distinction in our current social and economic development was quite a controversial</text>

The Biennale should be seen as a dynamic process, and the recent events as a building block to be continuously renewed and expanded. The aim of the Biennale should be to support both the artist and the community in their work, and to foster dialogues between the different stakeholders in the world of art, architecture, design and culture. The Biennale should foster dialogue and exchanges with local communities through dialogues with local politicians, grassroots groups, artists’ organisations and academia. It’s high time that the Biennale started incorporating all these elements into its strategic plan. The current biennale structure, which is built on the political ideology of ‘socialism in one country’, will probably remain in place for a very long time, so it is imperative that the Biennale actively engage with the contradictory values and ideologies of its historical and contemporary</text>

It is said that the name was taken from a line in the Koran, which is often translated as: ‘If you want a place, offer me a place?’. In the case of the Biennale, the misreading of the name came up time and again during the curatorial process – at one point, during the selection of the site, Ata commented that the name 'Kufra’ meant 'the abode of abodes'. He was, of course, referring to the ‘Islamic’ part of the ‘Baklaka’ family, who are believed to inhabit the area and to have founded the locality. He was also speaking of the nomadic ‘Abbas’</text>

The biennale, like any other art form, is a ‘gift of the city’, and the city, like any other, is a ‘gift of the biennale’. The actuality of the situation being displayed, the actuality of the art being made available to consumers, and the actuality of the cultural exchange taking place – all of this is anchored in the city. The problem with the biennale as such is that it relies on a largesse from the city: the art is produced and distributed in London, and the biennale itself is a ‘capital asset’, with a huge retail market share and a huge cultural impact. As such, it is able to absorb all</text>

It is not always realised, but it is a declaration that comes out of the blue. It is not a given that all who apply will necessarily find success, but the declaration does lay down the path for action and suggests an obvious next step.’[2] The Biennale’s social mission statement is an ideal case study in the power of the word mission. It establishes a shared identity and self-image, generates collaborative action, engages with established hierarchies, and is a principal vehicle for the organisation’s future growth. Yet in its desire to be inclusive and equitable, and to be seen to be doing something about globalisation, the Biennale often engages in practices that disempower or outright destroy its own members. A good example is the project to re-animate the Dutch urban landscape, or as it is sometimes called �</text>

This latest iteration, Documenta 13, was organised by the Italian public broadcaster RAI and the Italian cultural organisation ANO. New media works are often employed in this context, and documenta 13 employed artists who are artists, curators, journalists and social critics. Their work is often critical and activist, often dealing with controversial subjects, and often commissioned by the Biennale. However, the Biennale’s current projectors often utilise social media to connect with people and to engage with ideas and issues of the moment, and documenta 13, through a combination of artist-curated and cultural programmes, produced and supported by RAI and ANO, sought to bring this critical</text>

The art world is a small part of a much larger system that includes large corporations, foundations, government bodies and other institutional stakeholders. As an institution, the Biennale rarely engages with this larger cultural context; it is the exception rather than the rule. However, the Biennale has a significant social responsibility that is growing increasingly unwillingly: its mission statement is increasingly a retreat into itself, a retreat into a world of its own making, where everything is for the benefit of a privileged few. Therefore, the Biennale, while it pursues its social mission, has to address the system that is producing art in ever greater quantities, and often in ways that are indistinguishable from those of commercial galleries. If not addressed, the Biennale risks becoming something else: a vehicle for the exploitation of art resources, or a place where art is actively suppressed or rejected. Dialogues with curators,</text>

The social aspect of the exhibition has often been underestimated, or even under-appreciated, and its potential is being realised through these visual media platforms. The curatorial shift towards a social aspect also allows the inclusion of art not usually associated with a particular community, and this has led to an increase in the number of artists from diverse artistic backgrounds contributing to the exhibition.Some curators have their eyes on a universal and long-term aesthetic that is shared by all humanity, while others see a particular aesthetic potential in particular situations, or even universal truths. The challenge for the future curator is to discover both, and to engage with both, finding the best of both worlds whilst ensuring that the universal and long</text>

As the Hudson’s team discovered, the only way to stop the madness was for people to show up to council and protest the break-down of the cityscape.  	A third figure in the story of the revitalised downtown is Peter Lanchester, the artist who brought negative and positive images to life through the work Wallace Stevens Design. Lanchester’s work served many purposes: he was an urbanist, a landscape architect, a journalist, a politician and a novelist. All of these things align with the idea that the sphere of urbanisation represents an increasing threat to the sphere of resistance, which is why the federal government appropriated his name and image. The urbanisation of Canada is complete, and it is happening at a fast pace in Newfoundland and Labrador. The question is, what comes after it, and what kind of organisation is built around it?

As the Hudson’s team discovered, the only way to stop what was happening was to petition the city council and the federal government for a full-scale new downtown relief line – a plan that would extend from the Don Valley to the Don River – which would in turn split the city into two. While the city council and federal governments may not like what they are seeing happening in Toronto, they have a responsibility to act in a way that is not opposed by the dominant political forces in Ottawa. As the Hudson’s team discovered, building works are routinely cancelled or scaled back due to political pressure – which is why we have blockades in the city. It is up to grassroots activists to hold elected officials and councillors accountable when they make decisions that are not supported by the dominant political forces in Ottawa. If the city can build a new downtown relief line and call it ‘Kitchener’s District 9’ then it is up to local residents and grassroots groups to create a similar neighbourhood improvement corporation</text>

While there are many different ways to look at the same situation, there is no doubt that she and her team worked in concert to arrive at a solution that maximised the use of the building while minimising the negative impacts. As the Hudson’s team discovered, the only way to stop the building from growing too big was to completely demolish it – a task that would have required immense amounts of new housing, massive new public works projects, and a completely different kind of ‘culture district’ that would have housed only a handful of high-end restaurants and retail outlets. The only way to stop the proliferation of super-storey buildings was to make sure that the neighbourhoods they were placed in never got any taller. That is, of course, until the end of the Great Recession in 2008. Since then, the housing market has largely bounced back, with average house prices stabilising around $450,000 – somewhat lower than the $550,000 range for high-end condos.  	While the private and public sectors may sometimes collaborate to produce innovative solutions to seemingly intractable problems, the increasing influence of non-profits such as Urbanatures and Community Plans has ultimately forced such actions.

While there are many different ways to look at the same situation, there is no doubt that she and her team worked in concert to arrive at a solution that maximised the use of the building while minimising the negative impacts. As the Hudson’s team discovered, the prison industrial complex had its own set of rules and that particular set of rules had significant cultural weight. The rules had been written in a dialect of symbols and phrases that were similar to those of English common law, but with a distinctly Hudsonian flavour. For Hudson, the dialect was a necessary evil that she and her team actively sought to undermine. Her quest for greater power came to a head when she found a way to re-brand the entire complex as a ‘homebaked’ brand of bread and butter. Overcoming Identitarian DemandsWhile in Kitchener’s Downtown East Campus, I visited Joe Hill and Mary Turner’s Homebaked Project studio where the two lead designers, Andrew Turner and Juliana Engberg, developed a number of dialects into fully realised projects.

As the Hudson’s team discovered, the only way to truly address the challenges presented by the housing crisis was to work in concert as a unit, rather than as individuals. The end result is a remarkably complimentary narrative of efforts that seem entirely to align. 	One of the most moving passages in The Ghost of Middle-Class Anxiety (2007), for example, recounts the arrival in 1985 of two MCCA teams led by architects Joshua Clover and Wendy Chun who, along with a local artist, Louise Hui, undertook a year-long, multi-disciplinary project that sought to rethink how architects and designers might engage with the spatial aspects of the city. While the two teams members may well have been driven by different motivations, the end result is a project that manages to bring together two diverse disciplines while simultaneously understanding their inter-relatedness. As the narrator of The Ghost of Middle Class Anxiety argues, the MCCA project ‘turned sour’, with issues of race relations</text>

While there are many different ways to look at the same situation, there is no doubt that she and her team worked in concert to arrive at a solution that maximised the use of the building while minimising the negative impacts. As the Hudson’s team discovered, the only way to stop the building from deteriorating was to completely knock it out of the ground and allow it to fall into the River Don (a.k.a. Lake Ontario).  	Since there was no way to monitor and control the falling building, the only way to stop it was to waterproof it and create a wall around it – in effect creating a buffer zone between the city and the river. While this sounded good on paper, its real world application was far more important, and was what made Hudson’s team so effective. By bringing a creative and innovative solution to a problem that was already too intractable, her team was able to transform the situation from one in which it was possible to build a social and economic model around the building, into one in which it was possible to deconstruct it. As Hudson puts it: ‘Over the years, the challenge became how to activate the space in a way that is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also</text>

As the Hudson’s team discovered, the only way to stop the building from rising was to buy it outright – by which point the development company would control the building and its management, ensuring that it was used for good rather than maximising profit. 	[5] And, as the Hudson’s team discovered, buying the building outright would not only end up in legal proceedings, it would also end up in the hands of the city, since the purchase price would be capped and determined by the city council. As a result, the Powder Palace team found themselves trapped in a loop where they had to actively negotiate a low price with the city in order to keep the building, but also to maximise the benefits of the low price by continuously lowering the price of the building in order to maintain a profit. As the price of a building goes up, so does the value of the buildings in the complex, since the demand for living in the building goes up with it. As the price of</text>

As the Hudson’s team discovered, it was necessary to employ eminent domain to take control of the building and its assets in order to make way for new development. While this may seem like a large and sweeping imposition of power, it is important to note that these same powers can be used to make changes in the direction of a city’s development – making empty buildings into parks, making industrial parks into urban districts, making empty buildings into parks, and so forth. Doing all of these things simultaneously, and in parallel, is a larger goal that all of these actions pursued in turn. 	In my Memory Palace project, we have documented our efforts from the ground up, capturing every step of the way. While we did not achieve all of our goals, our stories do the same things in different forms and formats, and the same patterns emerged again and again. Some of these stories were told by family and friends, but most of us were just beginning to emerge. As the project unfolded, we found ourselves telling more</text>

As the Hudson’s team discovered, the only way to stop what was happening to the building was to petition the city council and the federal government to re-zone the entire neighbourhood – an idea that came up in relation to the Powder Palace project. While this did achieve some kind of co-presidency with the federal government, it was clearly seen as an idea best served by a city council and not an industry that was being created in Ottawa. As the Hudson’s team discovered, the Powder Palace project never went beyond the planning stages because the developer, Ken Dryden, was not given a share of the city’s development pie. Dryden died in 2004, but his widow, Suzanne, continued to own the Powder Palace business, selling home decor and making improvements to the building. Ken Dryden, meanwhile, developed a number of other interests outside of the architectural arena, including developing a Canadian flag factory and working on the Immigrant Movement International (IMI</text>

The book is the result of a research project that was part of the UCLA Art &amp; Social Research Lab from 1984–2005: the center’s first ten years were devoted to analyzing and conceptualizing the legacy of the Black Power movement, which had emerged out of the wake of the Black Panther Party. The Black Power legacy continued to be a source of contention for the next several decades, but its ubiquity and proliferation in contemporary activism and political culture meant that its political latentities were largely ignored or denied. The popularity of the Black Panther Party in the 1970s and 1980s also meant that a large share of the population felt their political agency lay in the hands of an organisation well-established in the social hierarchy of the city. The biennial format of the 1980s was a perfect time to begin to consider how the biennial format might operate through the social hierarchy of the city, and the ability of such a hierarchy to produce environmental and social change through its resources.

The conversation was moderated by LA-based architecture critic and Curator of Modern and Rare Art, Norman Eisenberg.The Biennials have been a part of the conversation about mobility in the US and the world. What do they mean to us, and to each other? What is happening in the world right now that is impossible for any of us to know? The Biennials have provided a forum through which to explore these questions, and have given voice to those who otherwise wouldn’t voice.

The system was tested on a small number of pigs, and on two in vitro fertilised (i.e. pig-human) rat strains. The pigs' reproduction was studied using in vivo and in vitro fertilised rat strains. The in vivo studies used ultrasound to detect the presence of embryonic fibroblast growth factor (E-selectin), a growth factor required for neural tube and mesenteric regeneration in the developing rat brain.

The in vitro studies used immunohistochemistry to measure the levels of proliferating neural stem cells (Nscs), which are precursory to the establishment of mesenchymal stroma and other fine motor structures.[51]In a more recent study using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), researchers from Imperial College London and Imperial College, London, utilised iPS cells to create a human-like facial system using photoreduction, fibroblast growth factor signalling and epigenetic modifications. The facial systems were created using templates derived from the Imperial College London library and medical collections, as well as stem cells taken from the eye and the muscle.[52]The systems were tested on seven volunteers, aged between 18 and 40, who provided informed consent to continue using the systems in the study of ageing. The facial systems were installed in the participants' faces, using the procedure that has been described in detail in the journal BioSystems[53] and is described in greater detail</text>

The in vivo studies used ultrasound to detect the presence of embryonic fibroblast growth factor (E-selectin), a growth factor required for neural tube and mesenteric regeneration in the developing rat brain. The in vitro studies used a synthetic biology toolkit that synthesised E-selectin from the elements of silver, gold, copper and nickel using enzymes produced in a lab.[51]At this time, the term ‘episodic’ was also frequently used to refer to temporal relations, but in a general sense these terms were reserved for discrete events such as the coming of a new religion or the coming of a new language. It is now generally agreed that ‘episodic’ refers to timescales of several weeks or months, and ‘towards’ to ‘thirty minutes’.[52]As a general principle, ‘episodic’ is preferred over ‘fixed’ temporalities, because it more accurately reflects the temporal complexity of temporal relations, and creates a sense of contingency and unpredictability. As David Himmelfarb points out, temporal complexity makes up part of what he calls ‘the big picture�</text>

The in vitro studies used immunohistochemistry to detect the addition of fibroblast growth factor to rat brain tissue following in vitro fertilisation, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect the uptake of these factors by the developing rat motor cortex.[51]In its basic form, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner is a multipurpose tool enabling studies of the human cerebral cortex, used to image brain regions involved in decision-making, memory and behaviour. It was originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and is now part of the Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands. The term ‘machinery' was used to describe the parts and components that serve as the basis of a computer program, and how they are organised and interfaced. The term is used synonymously with ‘machine’, although it is clear that the authors are not referring to abstract machines; the mechanism that underlies the functionality of a computer is fundamentally</text>

The in vitro studies were carried out at the Rutherford Appleton National Laboratory using rabbit and guinea-pig models, and the in vivo studies were carried out at the Karolinska Institutet ‘Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Research’, Stockholm, Sweden.

The in vivo studies used ultrasound to detect the presence of embryonic fibroblast growth factor (E-selectin), a growth factor required for neural tube and mesenteric regeneration in the developing rat brain. These growth factors are produced in the developing rat brain by the placenta and are present in the diet of the growing pig or pig-human embryo during gestation 1–3.[51] The in vitro fertilised rat strains were used in the in vivo studies because their high genome sequence and high-throughput DNA extraction and synthetic biology techniques allowed the authors to detect genes present in the E-selectin precursor during embryogenesis. The ability to grow E-selectin in the developing rat braincureted the development of neural tube defects and mesenteric tumours, and in at least one case this ability was due to the fact that the embryos were induced via ultrasound into pluripotent stem (ovarian) progenitor cells.[52]These pluripotent stem cells then grew normally into adult neurons, responsible for the body's natural self-repairing mechanisms, including the formation of new bone and soft tissue, and eventually into cardiac, lung and gut epithelial cells that were capable</text>

The in vitro fertilised rat neural stem cells were used to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can then be used to engineer human neural stem cells or act as progeny for human neural stem cells to develop into neurons or astrocytes, whichever is preferred. The in vivo studies used immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of extracellular matrix (ECM), a biomarker indicating the degree of collagen deposition in the synovial fluid and the subsequent health of the epithelial cells lining the neuromuscular junction. E-selectin is required for neural tube and mesenteric regeneration in the developing rat brain, and is a co-supplement to the growth hormone IGF-1.[51]Since collagen is a required co-factor for its synthesis and maintenance, and since ECCM is a 'good' co-factor, it follows that the presence of ECCM is a requirement for collagen synthesis and maintenance, and that the production</text>

The in vivo studies used ultrasound to detect the presence of embryonic fibroblast growth factor (E-selectin), a growth factor required for neural tube and mesenteric regeneration in the developing rat brain. These growth factors are produced in the rat pituitary gland and act through enzymes to activate various signalling pathways in the developing rat heart.The in vitro studies used rat cardiac fibres harvested from the ventricular septum, which are connected by ductus arteriosus to the ventricles and medulla. A fibres is a fibrous material that results from the breakdown of a single protein or molecule. Using in vitro fibroblasts, the in vivo studies used human cardiac fibres obtained from the same patient, or from patients with a similar underlying medical condition, and implanted into fibroblasts in a lab. These cardiac fibres then circulate in the bloodstream supplying cardiac muscle with myocardium and myocyte precursors. The in vitro studies demonstrated that cardiac fibres transplanted into rat heart muscle quickly integrate these newly derived fibres into myocytes and rapidly form new cardiac fibres, termed myocardium onwards. Thus, by merging different anatomical types, such as muscle</text>

The in vitro studies used a synthetic analogue of E-selectin as a precursor for the production of human growth hormone (HGH), a hormone required for the proliferation of neural precursor cells in the rat brain.[51]The in vivo studies used a combination of in situ hybridisation and in vitro fertilisation to investigate the effects of different fertilisers and zygote suspension on neural tube and mesenteric fibres in the developing rat brain. The in situ studies used sections of the optic chiasm, the thin covering of fibres that line the inside of the eye, as a source for neural precursor cells in the developing rat brain.[52]In vitro fertilisation is the act of engineering an animal through in vitro fertilisation with the goal of producing offspring through in vitro reproduction. The synthetic progeny of in vitro fertilisation are derived from the embryo through mitochondrial fusion, the splitting of the mitochondrial prokaryotic chromosome 21 into two pieces, and recombination with neighbouring eukaryotic chromosomes</text>

The in vitro studies used a synthetic antibody, produced by injecting genetically engineered E-selectin receptors into rat brain tissue.[51]It was found that E-selectin receptors were present in the human brain, and that E-selectin receptors mediate the inflammatory response that is required for the initiation of neuritic mesenchymal stem (NS) cells, which then propagate throughout the body and are present in high levels in critical organs of the body. When these organs are injured, such as when a stroke occurs, damage to the brain stem occurs, and the body cannot repair itself. Brain stem injury can lead to multiple organ failure, and is considered to be a primary cause of disability and premature death. E-selectin receptors are present in all mammals, but are present at extremely low concentrations in the brain. When injected directly into the brain, the antibodies bind to proteins on the surface of the neurons, and activate a signalling cascade that initiates the production of the neurotrophic factor (</text>

She has a set of toolskit-like talents, including fine art, media, design, communication and architecture. She has a unique ability to perceive connections between things, people and culture. For example, she once worked with the Dutch artist Jeanne van Heeswijk on a project called ‘Deviants’, which sought to reconcile orthodox and progressive art practices by understanding how the roles of artist, public and state are often reversed. The artist Jeanne van Heeswijk would not normally permit her work to be misinterpreted, but Jeanne’s project in India coincided with the time in question, and she realised she had to act. She began collaborating directly with the Indian government, which was at that time framing a major cultural programme around the country’s first female president, a task that came to her as an ideal opportunity to develop her skills and acquire new knowledge.The project was developed in collaboration with the Swedish Council for Independent Cultural Organisations, Arts Council of India, Art and Cult</text>

She has a critical and theoretical bent, and often ventures into these. She is interested in the ways in which art and culture are entwined, and the societal consequences of that entwining. She has a particular interest in the ecological and social ramifications of driverless cars and trucks, and the ways in which these could impact the planet in novel and unpredictable ways. She has a particular fascination with the growing up of autonomous vehicles in relation to what she refers to as ‘the ancient tribal practices, legacy of [human] civilization’.New Delhi-based artist Jeanne van Heeswijk has a particular affinity for biopolitics and social anthropology, and has worked with communities for over twenty years now. Her work often operates between aesthetics, geopolitics and constitutionality, although her particular interest is environmental law and tribunals.

She has a critical and creative mind, a natural gift for finding novel ways to utilise scarce resources, and the capacity to perceive patterns and trends in the world around her. She has been called ‘the Genealogy Artist’ by her peers because she integrates her artistic practice with the genealogy and family history departments at Harvard Medical School, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Wellcome Trust, a global biomedical heritage and biotechnology research organisation based in London. With these agencies, her work often seeks to unpack complex biological terms and concepts through metaphor and historical figure of exploration. For example, her 2016 project The Groundwork took the archaeological dig deep into the family history of autonomous vehicles and driverless cars, exploring the growing body of literature on this topic, from the ancient to the recent, tracing the path from pre-capitalist to the social to the spatial. Her interest in the automobile and autonomous vehicles draws on her research interests, including archaeology, anthropology, and ethnomusicology. Her work</text>

She has a conceptual eye, an artistic mouth, and the political skills to be able to pull a complex concept together from many disparate sources. She has the political skills to be able to look a set of disparate trends in the context of a future that may or may not exist. She has the political skills to be able to translate a set of different ideas into action. She has the social skills to be able to sit down with a group and discuss strategies for an organisation’s future. She has the social skills to be able to create a situation in which a group of people can do something creative and unexpected. She has the political skills to be able to ask tough questions and to be able to translate those ideas into action.These are among the qualities that make Jeanne unique among artists today.

She has a critical and experimental mind, and an imagination that fuses many different kinds of knowledge into a single, universal, yet paradoxical notion. Jeanne van Heeswijk: I came across the word ‘inherently relational’ while researching institutionalised religion and social reform in my native Rotterdam. Socially engaged and critical-thinking artists, I came across two very different ways of thinking about how institutions really function. Socially engaged art has a relational quality to it, which is apparent in the way that many social reform and progressive artists struggle to articulate this in contemporary creative work. Socially engaged art has a social purpose, which is also apparent in the ways in which institutions enact and facilitate that social purpose. 	In a word, socially engaged culture is a mixed bag. It is relational, but also subject to the whims of unpredictable and sometimes powerful economic forces. Its temporal complexity and multidimensional character also makes it vulnerable to the prevailing ideologies of large institutional structures. 	</text>

She has a critical mind, a creative heart, and an uncanny ability to perceive the future. She creates works that speak of change through metaphor, and she has a particular set of skills that allow her to unravel complex webs of societal change through observation and analysis. But none of those things translate to creating truly autonomous vehicles or machines, or even to constructing human-level artificial intelligences that can think and reason like us, or even to creating truly different worlds or cultures entirely.That remains a work in progress. In the meantime, artists need to pick their battles well in advance of any given crisis of societal evolution. It would be naïve to think that there is anything inherently different about us than an animal: that there is only a relationship between us and them. Humans are social animals with a history of war and tragedy, and the potential for far greater tragedy and devastation with the right to resist, is real.

She has a critical and folk wisdom-based sense of aesthetics, aesthetics, and language; a folk knowledge of India and of parts of Southeast Asia. She has a love of travel and of exploring places she doesn’t understand; and a knack for making things look simple and beautiful. She has a particular appreciation for the way in which art can help people become more connected to their surroundings.These attributes and more are qualities that, at a basic level, most people can identify with. But in their complexity, nuances and subtleties, they require a certain amount of expertise and nuance to fully realise their potential. A self-starter, van Heeswijk’s artistic gifts are obvious and obvious even to those who have never seen her work. But her artistic processes also have a very structural aspect that is complex and underlying. Her early work is all about the political, activist aspect of visual culture and activism.

She has a set of artistic tools at her disposal, including paint, brushes, markers, fabric, pencils, eraser, tape and even glue. She uses these creatively and efficiently – building community art projects, design thinkingfully, and using emerging technologies to imagine possibilities beyond the confines of her hometown.While her interest in human behaviour and culture comes through in her work, her interest in the future is driven by two overriding philosophical convictions. The first is that humans are cultural nomadic animals who inhabit a connected and collective body of knowledge and culture evolving across time and across continents. The second is that humans will inevitably become ‘machine’ and fall subject to ‘technological unemployment’. Both of these convictions sit at the core of a project that seeks to understand how artists can work with emerging technologies to create new ways of inhabiting the future.These two convictions inform both the design of infrastructure and the design of culture – frameworks through which artists can intervene and create new ‘present’ forms</text>

She has a critical mind, an imagination, a talent for problem-solving and creativity, and a set of tools for coming up with creative solutions to complex problems. She has also a set of skills and talents that set her apart from most artists of her generation: she has a commercial imagination, an economic imagination, and a social conscience.These three elements – critical, creative and organisational – make Jeanne a valuable artist today. Her work for commercial clients, critical thinking, collaborative working and the Environment Agency has been at the centre of a capitalist restructuring of infrastructure and society for decades. Her work for the environment in particular, along with her work for the environment in general, is a direct consequence of the historical relationship between infrastructure and capitalism. The social, environmental and political contexts of infrastructure development are complex, and there is no one true understanding of the social, environmental or political consequences of infrastructure. That is, there is no one way to understand the social, environmental or political consequences of a given technological advance.</text>

Communities are the new Dickens novels.And yet the ability of communities to intervene in such issues-based conflicts – to change, to persevere – is a source of much that is valuable, creative and innovative. Changes in the media, between good and bad, are often accompanied by extrapolations of those trends. Consider the example of television and crime. The rise of crime-ridden areas in the 1980s coincided with the advent of television, which in turn coincided with the advent of crime dramas with names such as ‘The Sopranos’ and ‘The Wire’. The character of ­Scared Tom, played by Matthew Broderick, represents the inescapable link between the proliferation of TV and the proliferation of crime. Television sets were invariably made of wood, in part because of their low energy-conversion efficiencies. But the ubiquity of TV sets and the proliferation of crime-ridden areas in the 1980s and 1990s also coincided with an explosion of computer games – which were themselves often programmed with human traffickers as their primary users. These coincidences lend weight</text>

Communities are the new Dickens novels.And yet the ability of communities to intervene in such issues-based conflicts, the ability to root them out – that is, to change the economic and social trajectory – is the very backbone of the project. It is this last bit that my organisation, Cage, is fighting for. It is a rare and precious commodity that has gone unmet for far too long in the UK and beyond. Cage is short for Community Arts Research Centre, and refers to the group's long-standing commitment to artist-led projects. In the wider arts and cultural community, it is sometimes mistakenly thought that artists are the unsung heroes of the community, that they create meaning and purpose for communities through their work. But this is not at all what we consider when assessing the value of an artist’s contribution to the community, but rather what we consider when assessing the value of a community project. The value of an artist’s time and effort, in our view, should be measured in relation to the work produced by the community. And so we have been asking ourselves and</text>

Community art is all the rage these days. The term is often used synonymously with –––respectable?–; however, the practice of curating, as distinct from producing artworks, is a completely different kind of intervention. It is the latter that is meant. It is the kind of intervention that is neither here nor there, ‘just there’. It is art of its kind, and it is art that is actively produced through curating. And so we, as artists and curators, are called upon to create works that are both timely and ‘deeply embedded’ in the present, while simultaneously insisting that those who come after us will understand and appreciate the significance of this kind of artistic practice. This kind of art is never going to be produced by a</text>

Communities are the new Dickens novels.And yet the ability of communities to intervene in such issues-based conflicts is precisely what has revived artists’ work, as new practices and strategies have emerged. Artists have a way of operating in situations that are more visible, more authentic, and more possible, than when they operate through the traditional means of publishing, protest or litigation. In the 1990s, when artists started confronting the art market, it was very much through the prism of identity; as an artist, I stand to be identified with the colour green. I became the person I was when I painted ‘All Together Now’ on the wall of the Welsh Streets Artist’s Centre. I painted ‘Shouting Lion’ outside the Montréal’s Gael King Centre. I painted ‘Tequila Sunrise’ on the back of a Honda Civic. I painted it on the doors of the cultural institutions that sponsor major exhibitions in Montreal. I painted it on T-shirts for the Juno’s female artists. I even painted a ‘Get Well Soon</text>

And I believe that the potential of such potentialities lies in the very, very core of the social, cultural and political imagination of the community. In other words, it does not come from within, but from the other side of the coin – from the sources of social organisation and power quixotically lumped together under the rubric of ‘community’.Such potentialities are what makes such efforts possible, but much lessening global access to such raw materials is a big part of the overall package. More and more, the community is understood as the only real difference between such potentialities and non-problems. But if such efforts are to have real effects, they need to be supported by a responsive and empowering local government. And, more and more, such a supportive and empowering government is eroding away, replaced by local authorities that</text>

The ability of communities to monitor their neighbourhoods, to root out criminal behaviour, to engage in self-healing anti-social behaviour – all of that is under siege. Communities are the new Dickens novels.And yet the ability of communities to intervene in such issues-based conflicts is a fiction – invented fiction – in and for the city. The cultural and urbanising efforts of the 1990s were premised on the premise that communities would somehow be able to mend the damage done by techno-utopianism. But as techno-utopianism wore on, it became increasingly apparent that such a capacity was already there, already ancillary to other social deviant activities, already a by-product of – for example – the oil crisis. The aim of such creative perforations, which were to some extent fantasies, was to stir up latent social  leases into proactive action, to stir things up so that, if not dealt with, the technologies around them soon will be used to commit horrendous human rights violations and ecological imbalances everywhere.More and more of what was considered socially desirable had to be fetched from the community, or else dismantled. And this is why communities of artists, writers, activists, architects, urban planners and others with a keen interest</text>

The ability of communities to monitor their neighbourhoods, to root out criminal behaviour, to engage in self-healing anti-social behaviour – all of that is under siege. Communities are the new Dickens novels.And yet the ability of communities to intervene in such issues-based conflicts remains somewhat hazy and undefined. Is it really community engagement that is under siege, or is it that the very concept of community is under siege? Perhaps it is that the arts are seen as somehow the enemy within – a threat to the state apparatus that feeds off of arts consumption. But then again, perhaps the arts are the very opposite: a way to step outside of the system that feeds off of it. The power dynamic in the public realm is one of competition. If the arts are seen to be an impediment to the progress of the state, then perhaps the other way around: the arts are the very opposite of staid, predictable, subject to the prevailing forces of mainstream culture. That would be a radical approach to the cultural hegemony that we live under.Perhaps the true test of artistic potential will come when and if the arts demand it; when and if the powerful urge to impose itself directly on the social. That will come when and if the arts actually effect change, rather than</text>

That is, the true mark of artistic productivity. And when I say ‘real life’, I don’t just mean art produced by people living in a contemporary environment. I mean actual life – actual relationships between people, actual interactions between people – life that is guided by principles and values, and that produces creative action through the production of meaning.If you follow the values and principles of contemporary art today, you will find that there is no such thing as art today, and there is no such thing as art history. There is a tendency to simplify things, to lump together contemporary art and art from any era, and to conflate these two things. And there is a tendency to isolate artists who engage with social change, by making them icons or archetypes, or making them titillating figures, or turning them into sexualised 'perform</text>

Because such intervention is apolitical, dependent upon the state, and dependent upon the monied interests of the gallery industry. The gallery industry would rather see a collection of works made by and for them than forge creative and positive alternatives. Yet this isolation and this dependence on the state also make the gallery a prime place to harbour cynicism, to harbour the fantasy that one could change one’s circumstances through hard work and determination, to harbour the suspicion that one is not truly in control of one’s circumstances, and to harbour the desire to fleece the public purse by selling art that it did not choose or deserve.The gallerist and the artistToday, the gallerist is the most prominent practitioner of the modern curatorial form; he is the person who orders, manages and creates the collection.

But the cultural and political subversion of the commons has been going on for a long, long time.Looked at from a different angle, the situation today: the city is awash with information, and as a result a user-friendly Google will do almost anything to access information; just about anything. The problem with information today is that it is leaky, and information traffic is the modern-day Dickensian business. The ability of communities to monitor their neighbourhoods, to root out criminal behaviour, to engage in self-healing anti-social behaviour – all of that is under siege. Communities are the new Dickens novels.And yet the ability of communities to intervene in such issues-based conflicts – to bring about a change through petition, boycott, sit-in – is what drew artists and thinkers of all stripes to the area, including, of course, Jane Jacobs. Much of what she advocated for as a means of fighting poverty and hunger in the name of social justice was, in fact, a form of community organising. She advocated direct action, direct action, and she was right to do so. But what she failed to mention is that such action would also involve substantial political and legal manoeuvring. It would also involve mobilising large numbers of people to fight alongside and alongside, as well as training and arming the local populace in the skills-based drama that is now being staged by the Arts Council. The failure to take such action highlights another aspect of the biennial phenomenon: its flexibility and adaptability. Its articulation and constant re-balancing on the world political landscape is part of what makes it possible to perforate its many cultural zones and so continually redefine its</text>

The biennial is a museum-type institution with a permanent institutional memory, and its current and prospective collections should be able to inspire and inform a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest. 	However, what is most characteristic of biennials is the fact that, wherever possible, the artworks, objects or projects produced in them occur within the museum context: in many cases, within the museum itself. 	As biennials become more and more institutionalised, their collections should become more and more like those of a museum, with permanent exhibitionary dimensions and a main exhibitionary programme. Within a biennial, the collection-system needs to be reconceived and revised in order to accommodate contemporary artworks, collections, and collections that move between different exhibitions. Figures that trace back to the nineteenth century need to be systematically and continually updated in order to reflect what is happening in contemporary art’s world. The biennial is a worldwide phenomenon, and its collection-system needs to account for this dynamic. 	The biennial is, of course, just one part of the equation.

The biennial is a museum-type institution with a permanent institutional memory, and its current and prospective collections should be able to inspire and inform a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest in the city that goes beyond the institution's traditional curatorial role. 	The biennial should be able to grow in both its institutional and its curatorial senses. Its present form should be remembered and its future plans entrusted to future generations. The biennial should be able to narrate its own historical journey, from the beginning of the institution to the present, in a sustained way that anticipates the present and strives to build future biennials out of its collections.  	As biennials become more institutionalised and political in nature, their collections, once vast and ever-present, should be released to the public. This would permit the biennial to embark on a recurrence of its collection-centricity, although this would mean giving up some of its most beautiful and moving collections to be shared with other museums or exhibitions.

The biennial is a museum-type institution with a permanent institutional memory, and its current and prospective collections should be able to inspire and inform a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest in the city that continues to this day. 	The Biennale itself may be an artefact of the present, but its historical importance is ultimately historical, since it is the object of gaze and the organising principle of the biennial in the modern, urbanised world. 	In the present, the Biennale is a museum-type institution with an exhibitionary character, and a curator-type who works in a permanent, museum-like setting. The key difference, however, is that the Biennale now has a social function, while the Biennale of 1992 was primarily an art institution, and its virtual disappearance in the wake of the new millennium is evidenced in the increasing number of biennales around the world.

The biennial is a museum-type institution with a permanent institutional memory, and its current and prospective collections should be able to inspire and inform a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest in that period in a way that is culturally responsive and accessible. 	In sum, the biennial should exhibit works from its full collection that are culturally responsive to the situations in which they are presented, and it should be able to do so in a way that is culturally accessible to and integrally associated with its local cultural context. In short, it should exhibit cultural works that are culturally responsive to the urban environment and should do so in a way that is culturally responsive to its inhabitants. The following principles should guide the biennial in its cultural journey: present and future exhibitions should be culturally responsive to their contexts; biennials should exhibit culturally responsive works that are culturally responsive to their contexts; and biennials should undertake projects that are culturally responsive to their contexts.

The biennial is a museum-type institution with a permanent institutional memory, and its current and prospective collections should be able to inspire and inform a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest, since the contemporary biennial is often described as ‘the museum of the future’.[7]  	The Biennial Commission, appointed by the Biennale Board, has its origins in the mid-1990s and is responsible for selecting biennials, planning their collections and managing their affairs. It also has the final say in selecting biennials and museums, and in appointing curators and artists. 	The Biennale established a permanent exhibitionary collection in 1992, and since then has curated eight exhibitions. It has a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest in art from many corners of the world, and has recently established a new, more experimental interest in art from within the biennial itself. 	The Biennale has a historical mission of encouraging dialogue and exchange between different cultural sectors, particularly between those who consider themselves to be present or embedded in the particularity of the particularity of the city, and between those who call it home and</text>

The biennial is a museum-type institution with a permanent institutional memory, and its current and prospective collections should be able to inspire and inform a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest in that collection. 	The biennial should also have the institutional power to initiate and influence collections to preserve their historical condition, since, unlike the case of an exhibition, the preservation of cultural resources is a race against time constraint. As biennials become more institutionalised, the institutional memory of a particular form or medium is gradually replaced, allowing the other elements to act as an extension of the main event. This process is clearly seen in the case of permanent collections such as the collections of the American Folk Art Museum or the collections of the British Museum, as exemplars of the biennial. 	Finally, the biennial should have the institutional power to monitor and influence collections to ensure that they follow its lead and become what it describes as ‘a cultural touchstone and benchmark for othering and globalisation’.[7] These three elements are in my estimation the weakest of the three, but they are by no means sufficient to render the biennial a blank check or to render</text>

The biennial is a museum-type institution with a permanent institutional memory, and its current and prospective collections should be able to inspire and inform a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest. 	The biennial should be able to undertake research projects that are not bound by strict time or institutional limits. For example, the biennial could initiate research into its collections, through research projects that it sponsors or co-sponsors and even wholly own, with the sponsor providing the institutional resources.[7] 	The biennial should be able to develop long-term research projects into its collections, into its own long-term interest in its urban environment. For example, the biennial could establish long-term, collaborative, and environmentally responsible long-term relationships with local and international archives, museums, and archive-systems partners. 	The biennial should be able to establish research-gathering partnerships with local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs), public authorities, and local grassroots organisations. For example, the Nachtenburg Project, initiated in 2014, is a collaboration between the Biennale and the Nachtenburg Foundation, a private Swiss foundation.</text>

The biennial is a museum-type institution with a permanent institutional memory, and its current and prospective collections should be able to inspire and inform a long-term, even multidisciplinary interest in the city. For this to happen, the biennial would have to become more than just an exhibitionary venue, and also need to become a curator’s institution, since it is the curator’s institutional memory that keeps the artefacts in the city alive and registers its history. Such a transformation would mark a new level for the biennial, and would shift the form of the biennial away from its present, typically architectural, curatorial orientation. The biennial would create an entirely new understanding of the institution, and its curatorial legacy. Such a radical shift would make the biennial a museum-like institution, and might even alter its traditional curatorial role to something more akin to that of a museum. Such a museum would conjure up images of crumbling buildings and abandoned metropolises, but would also stand out in a sea of images of similar structures, capturing the idiosyncrasies and hidden histories of this forgotten urban space. Such a place would draw visitors away</text>

I would propose that the biennial should be able to demonstrate a deep and abiding attachment to the city, its places and people, while at the same time maintaining a critical eye towards its development and reconfiguration. This would mean not only the building of new museums but also long-term, even multi-generational cultural centres that continuously point out the city’s cultural significance, while continuously shifting and adapting to the changing circumstances and interests of their sites. Such centres of cultural exchange and radical change should be able to articulate their own cultural values and attract cultures from all over the world, while simultaneously maintaining a relationship with the city that transcends its geographical location and global reach. 	Finally, biennials should be able to exhibit the cultural significance of their locations in a sustained way, and perhaps this last requirement is the strongest argument for their present cultural relevance. As biennials become more institutionalised and globalised, and as their collections become more extensive and diverse,</text>

There is still a strong orientation to the region, and the geopolitical landscapes of the twentieth century, but the biennale is shifting its gaze to the connected present, and its participants are pulled back into the fire of the present, as well. At the beginning of this century, the biennale was made up of a number of artists, including Francis Ford Coon, Norman Stone, Virginia Madsen, and others. By the start of the century, the biennale was making a comeback. The nineteenth-century biennale, which followed a strict formula for aesthetic perforation, produced a peak of artistic achievement, and the twentieth-century biennale followed a development trajectory that produced considerable artistic perforation. The nineteenth-century biennale offered great opportunities for the artistically inclined viewer to become entwined with the events as they unfolded. The twentieth-century biennale offers a peak of artistic perforation, and both the viewer and the artist are now embedded in the infrastructure of the event. ‘The Biennale is a production of the City of Brotherly Love, and the City of Brotherly Love is a City of Heroes’</text>

The biennale has no choice but to play some role in this new spatial landscape.Its position is not that of an authority, as in, for instance, the Museum of Modern Art, which is at the forefront of the modern museumisation process. The biennale is a participant in the current institutionalisation process, and its development is often driven by its engagement with the processes of modernisation in the broader society. In other words, the biennial as we know it today is a product not of the art museums of the past, but of the social and behavioural sciences departments of the present. The role of the biennale in this new landscape is complicated, but fundamentally reliant on its participants. The biennale cannot be neutral. It has to be involved, and</text>

The fact that the biennale is a public undertaking, with the intervention of state actors – individuals and organisations such as the United Nation’s General Assembly, the Rockefeller Foundation, the London School of Economics and Political Science, as well as national governments, multinational corporations and international financial organisations – helps to shift our collective gaze. The biennale’s public mission is being defined. The main thrust of the biennale’s publicity campaign in recent years has been to position the spectacle as a metaphor and point of entry into the social hierarchy of the contemporary world. The 2013 Venice Biennale released a multimedia installation, ‘Reclaim the Nomenclature’, that it says ‘purports to reclaim the past, the present and the contemporary meaning of the word “modern””. It also produced and distributed ‘Reclaim the Square’ T-shirts, which it says ‘taunted</text>

There are many forms of the biennale today, and each has its own distinctive set of relations to the past, to move from the past to the present, and from the present to the future. The biennale is a public event that demands a great deal of information and imagery, and so it is also a media event. There is a reason why biennales are so attuned to the materiality of art, and why artists are drawn to them, and why some disciplines are more attuned to the visual worlds generated by the various artworks, and to the literary forms</text>

First, the biennale is a ‘present’ event, and its focus is now shifting from the past to the future. Second, the biennale is a ‘present’ site of continuous reproduction, with its own evolving collections and collections. That is, its function in the present is to narrate the past and to point to the future, while its other functions revolve around the shifting of images and images. The biennale has emerged as the ideal site for multiple readings of the same event, and these readings are happening increasingly simultaneously in different locations, in different times. And this is a biennale after all: it is not just an event in Paris, but a contemporary site of habit, repetition and repeat.

The biennale has become the global marker of cultural transmission, and the monumental task of mapping that transmission marks. The biennale is expected to map the social, economic and spatial conditions of contemporary globalisation, and its manifestations on a planetary scale. The biennale is also expected to map cultural landscapes in its sites of origin, and of departure. It is a document that emerged first as a set of practices, and then, upon the emergence of a particular language, a set of concepts.

As the biennale shifts its focus to the present, it pulls into the present the otherwise existing time, and thereby creates a space for the contemporary and future generations to inhabit the same historical moments. This is perhaps one way in which biennales can be counted on to create new historical moments. A biennale that is countenanced by the state and its audiences is countenanced by the state—and, in that sense, by the very essence of the institution.‘The biennale is a historical event that has to be reckoned with’—as the saying goes. The number of acts of remembrance is growing, and biennials are among the few remaining monuments to the humanities in an ever more politicized cultural landscape. The biennial has to grow in order to show a continuing (political and economic) sense of purpose in the face of constant (subjective) change. The biennale is a rare and precious gift,</text>

As a curatorial gesture, the biennale has become a venue for the subsequent making of artworks – works that are works in themselves, and not works of art in and of themselves. As such, they are both objects of consumption and objects of art (whatever their content or form). This is a complex set of relations, and it is one that artworks produced in the context of the biennale must understand and navigate. It is one that artworks created for the biennale must adopt, and to some extent, master. For instance, the biennale has a mission to conserve as many archaeological sites as possible; it is this inalienable human right that makes the biennale different from any other kind of exhibitionary venue.

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing abundance of labour and surplus generated by the increasingly privatised biennale. Nor was there any public or institutional appetite for such a revival or revival of the kind – with its attendant public works and cultural institutions – that would confront the biennale with the kind of ‘big-boxy, red-curtained, cathedral-like situation’ that the 1850 Paris Exposition did, only to a limited extent. The biennale’s subsequent moves overseas and into domestic venues did little to assuage concerns about overproduction or decadence. However, the exhibition itself was deeply flawed from the outset, with its fixation on the artist as a singular entity punctured by recurring motifs of overproduction and decadence. Its obsession with spectacle rendered it incapable of capturing the deep insights into the lives of artists and the practices of their professions that the biennale offers, or would offer, absent a public audience.

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing abundance of labour and materials that it produced in the service of the financial markets. The biennale’s increasing focus on the exchange of capital instead of just its realisation raises the question: what kind of commons are we making by allowing the biennale to deliver so largely on its own two hands? As biennales everywhere become more institutionalised, less able to articulate a single ‘true story’ or single identifiable event, how does the biennale itself shift the cost and availability of these commodities? How does the biennaleer engage with this new ‘price point’? In a forthcoming book on the biennale, Richard Florida proposes the concept of a ‘biennale identity card’ – a CV that will permit a visitor to the museum to identify himself or herself by name, place and chronology, and place of origin.9.

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing abundance of labour and surplus value generated by the financial sector. In the past, this labour had to be actively managed – managed in part by the biennale itself, but also by industry associations, city councils and other local government bodies. The overproduction, overconsumption and ever-expanding of state-backed infrastructure meant that industry itself now controlled vast amounts of surplus space, both physically and socially; this was taken as a given. The biennale’s ability to align capital with people instead of against them came as no surprise to historian Renate Lorenz; in the 1930s she worked for the Manhattan Historical Society, during which time she came across numerous architectural examples of the city that had been either ghosted or demolished by the city. She noted the obvious contradiction: how could the biennale claim to be an object of cultural exchange when so many of its projects were designed by or for industry?9.

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing surplus of socially and politically unstable and economically destructive behaviour. The biennale’s increasing role as provider of culture meant that it could no longer be defined solely as an exchange of commodities; it became something more akin to a stock exchange or futures market. In other words, the biennale was always in the process of becoming something more, not less. The biennale was also always about the accumulation of capital, but moreso towards the post-capitalist creation of ever more encompassing forms of social value. For many artists and curators, this meant entering the market solely as a promoter of culture or the post-capitalist singularity; no other function. This came as a huge surprise to artists and arts professionals who expected the biennale to remain strictly about exchange and exchange as such, and to invest exclusively in its production; invest in the art, in curating, in research, in logistics, in art-historical curatorial work, and in the infrastructure of</text>

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing abundance of labour and surplus generated by the newly invented financial instruments. The biennale’s increasing autonomy and direct democracy over how labour and surplus are distributed across the world's capitalist planets seems laudable, in part, because of its increasing abundance of surplus labour – labour that could be automated to satisfy the needs of the biennale. But the biennale as an institution – and its growing political, economic and artistic patronage base – is premised on the theft and exploitation of labour, and the subsequent exchange of surplus labour. The very act of writing the biennale’s 2017 programme, for example, is itself a form of surplus labour. In this process, the biennale’s curators took the place of their patrons, generating revenue through their exhibitions and publications while simultaneously investing in the production of their galloping horses and hired carriages, which could be dispatched to virtually any city in the world and driven by the entourage of any number of leading</text>

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing abundance of labour and surplus generated by the biennale. The biennale as a cultural form had become sufficiently anaesthetised by its digital consumption to not be able to register the surplus value generated by the biennale. As a circulation, exchange only ever took place on the rare occasions when the biennale was actively engaged in retraining or repurposing what it had produced, or in other cases when it was simply absorbing what had become surplus to meet the needs of its owners. The circulation could not sustain the excess, and with the end of the biennale as a visitor’s experience, the opportunity to tie the exchange of surplus into socially useful forms of work was lost.⁘The Biennale as a Cultural Form is Over, Now What?’Although the biennale as a cultural form was never going to regain the political inflection that it had in the 1990s and early 2000s, its capacity to produce artefacts that can</text>

The financial services industry is the industry for the production of financial instruments – stock market, futures, loans, derivatives, and tax advantages that reshape and control our behaviour.

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing inequalities generated by these increasingly sophisticated financial instruments. The biennale’s increasing focus on art as a main form of exchange, its increasingly exclusion from overt forms of cultural capital, its increasingly exclusion from overt forms of economic capital – all these things were aimed at creating a public space in which the exchange of capital could take place in ways that were positive for the biennale as a whole, but also in ways that were negative for artists and the biennale as an art form. These are the kind of complex interactions that biennales can foster, and that artists would do well to understand and appreciate. 9. The idea of ‘the biennial’ was invented in the 1970s by Norman Wilkinson, whose work with the BMMA was part of a cycle that also saw the BMMA create the National Biennial and the LA County Museum of Art create the LACMA. The BMMA’s other major international exhibitions that year were Things That Malte Greenberg</text>

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing surplus of value created via the ever more pervasive exchange of financial instruments. The biennale’s increasing role in the city, in the service of exchange, in turn became a source of pride for the increasingly privileged and well-connected participants. The biennale itself, in its increased public functionality, became a vehicle for the transmission and celebration of these increasingly valuable new financial instruments. For many years, the main event at the biennale was a private summit convened by the architecturally-inclined elite of France’s financial and cultural elite. In 2012, the summit was moved to Chamonix, in present-day France, and now the biennale’s main exhibition venue, Chamonix, remains the same but its use remains the same. There is now an odd kind of perverse ‘metainterface’ – a kind of metainterface – in which the biennale is more or less a spectator sport.</text>

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing abundance of labour and surplus produced via the ever more pervasive capitalism of the century. The biennale’s eventual mission statement claims to be the ‘evolution of a cultural practice’, but this kind of ideological or institutional vacillation is what Gervais sees as the real ‘revolution’. Just as the biennale’s eventual mission statement is premised on the exchange of capital, so too is it premised on the circulation of culture, but in a very different way – capital is created when labour is exchanged on a global or transnational scale. There is no such thing as ‘transnational’ or ‘global’ or ‘local’ or ‘urban’ or ‘suburban’ or ‘ringing city’ in the language of art, just as there is no such thing as ‘suburban’ or ‘ringing suburban’.

The biennale’s raison d'être was to create a platform for the exchange of capital; that’s all well and good, but what it increasingly lacked was any kind of public or institutional power to reclaim or negate the increasing abundance of labour and surplus created by the financial sector. The biennale’s increasing specialization and global reach have brought with them a proliferation of disparate labour streams and varying levels of productivity. Yet the biennale’s raison d’être remains the exchange of capital as commodity, and its exchange between now and then means little less than the pre-eminence of the exchange of capital in the world economy. In this sense, the biennale was always at the cutting edge of the capitalist circulation, and today it remains so.9. Biennales have a new set of hosts: the artists and curators who take the place of the curators of the past. As an exhibition format, the biennial has found new life in venues that are more open to public display, and new audiences who seek out art or culture that has been made specifically for the occasion. It is this circulation of art and culture throughout the world that is accelerating, and the</text>
