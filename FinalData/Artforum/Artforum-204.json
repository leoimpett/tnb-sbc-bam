Foster\u2019s work is considered among the first photographic abstractionists, whose compositional and material interactions with reality and the elements are often strikingly paradoxical. His photos, which explore the human condition through a multiplicity of mediums\u2014sensuality, intimacy, and reality itself\u2014have also been linked to his own body, and the body of his wife, Julie Foster, who has been working on a portrait of the artist for more than ten years.\u201cHal\u2019s paintings"]
