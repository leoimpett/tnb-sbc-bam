In his work for MADE UP, Gremminger evolved a strategy to engage the public in a dialogue about art, history and the language of print. In so doing he questioned the limits of the art-historical and print-journalistic narratives, and in doing so questioned the limits of both familiar and unexpected space.  In his small studio in Manchester Gremminger created Multi-Stage \u2013 a multi-sensory, mixed-reality theatre constructed around a central character, played by Gremminger",

Since 1987 he has also worked on artworks for the US$100 million (\u00a363 million) Project CHARGE, creating artworks in 150 countries and 150 generations, and many of these works are not normally seen by the wider public. \n\tDuring the late 1980s he chronicled the legend of Santa Barbara in his critically acclaimed graphic novella The X-Files: Family PHOTO Galleries",

In so doing, he has shown that in many ways our present-day representations of cruelty are already inscribed in our cultural heritage, and that these representations will continue to inspire and take on new forms in the future. In his recent piece for MADE UP entitled Watchtower (2008), Mcclure recorded a scene of apolitical violence from a rural location.

Her ongoing project involves creating transformative artworks that shift our ability to directly experience the material world around us, towards an awareness of the parts of our bodies that remain unseen or intangible. She is particularly interested in the neglected or silenced bodies of the Navajo, an identity that many struggle with daily, and on whose body she sculpturalque interventions often depend for their reality.

        "  \"The Next Liverpool Biennial should consider where multi-disciplinary arts practices intersect and why, leading into a discussion with similar practices in other G\u201310 countries, Elliott says.  This G\u201310 Biennial is seeking to build on Liverpool\u2019s reputation as a centre for Contemporary Art and to demonstrate how inter-disciplinary art can be applied to tackle serious and pressing social and cultural issues. Liverpool has a fascinating past and present, both within and outside of the UK, and the Biennial aims to explore and reflect on this. Liverpool\u2019s European history dates to the Norman Conquest in 1066 but, historically speaking, is said to have started in Yorkshire. The area around Wokingsthe town of Wokingsthe is said to have been particularly influential in the Norman Poetry Collection, which includes such classic pieces as \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d and the somewhat less classic \u201cTowards a better world\u201d. These collections are said to have given birth to Liverpool, with its focus on the countryside. Wokingsthe is thought to have been a particularly fertile ground for contemporary artists, with a long history of artistic activity in both the UK and abroad. Liverpool\u2019s location on the LN means that it is an especially strong market for contemporary art, with a vibrant local arts scene and excellent public transport links.  The Biennial is supported by a 5yr term of Bristol based Art Adviser, Ruth Davidson. She has extensive experience in promoting contemporary art in Britain and abroad, with major exhibitions on display across the city. She has also led art advisory tours for major Tate exhibitions, Tate Britain and Tate France. Source: www.bpb.org.uk  <ENDOFTEXT>",
        "  \"We are delighted that Liverpool has begun as a place where it is possible to have a go at it your own way \u2013 it is an open city, and so is where creative practices can be tested and introduced as alternatives to the mainstream. So, artists, art enthusiasts, and the public can get involved and engage with the work of art, and explore alternatives to the mainstream.  So, what if people could engage with the work of art without having to engage with the work itself? That is the idea behind the Next Liverpool Biennial \u2013 engage with the work and events in a way that is meaningful, provocative, and engaged. The concept is to take the work of art to a new audience, engage with them where they are, and use their feedback to develop Liverpool as a destination.  Next Liverpool Biennial is the antidote to the mainstream. It is not a biennial that celebrates the art of the present, but rather looks ahead to the future with fresh eyes and new ideas. The biennial celebrates those who are still working at the cutting edge of contemporary art. It seeks to be engaged, challenging, and engaging.  The Next Liverpool Biennial is committed to the future of our city and its communities. We believe that engaging with the work of art will play a key role in shaping Liverpool as a vibrant creative city.
