        " It should be an event of constant dialogue, a point of constant monitoring in the terrain of discourse.  The Liverpool Biennial is not just an event; it is a discourse that persists beyond the formal framework of the event. The programme itself has a gestalt, a gestalt defined by its incorporation of themes and processes previously unconnected to the event itself. The Liverpool Biennial projects a discontinuity from week to week, month to month, year to year, in response to the anticipated queries of our time.  In its attempt to project contemporary art in Liverpool, the Liverpool Biennial has set itself a challenging challenge. We have set about creating a discontinuity through the exhibition that is legible to the history of Liverpool as a place where roots go down and culture rises. We have set about creating a discontinuity through the programme that is vibrant, challenging and original. We have set about engaging with the local and international contemporary art scene in a meaningful way that is responsive to the programme itself. We have set about engaging with the region through the Liverpool Biennial. Inherent in the spirit of the programme is the desire to return to the drawing board in case of future exhibitions, to reflect on the past, to reflect on the future, to plan ahead, to identify areas of improvement and to act upon them. These activities will take the form of ongoing reflection and action plans, carried out in collaboration with the artistic director, curators and members of the public.

        " It should be an event of enduring, lasting over decades in the city it references and in the city itself, where it fits in well with Liverpool\u2019s history and contemporary art.  The Press Release aspect of the Biennial is to be recognised as revolutionary in its time; in fact, it is so new that it bears repeating. Yet, it is quite clear that the concept of reworking the event every three years in order to make Liverpool unique is novel and radical.  It is here that the Liverpool Biennial fits in well with the City of Liverpool\u2019s ambitious plans for the City of Liverpool Biennial that have been drawn up in good faith but remain to be seen. These plans call for a biennial to occur every two years, a reflection of the City\u2019s vision for the future.  The first Liverpool Biennial, which was initially titled as \u201cWatershed\u201d featured artists who have gone on to have important careers in music, film, sculpture and visual art. The second Biennial, \u201cWatershed\u201d featured artists who had influence in the making of films such as The Day the Earth Stood Still (1997), All is by the Sea (1999) and The Snowman (2001). The third Biennial, \u201cStill Life\u201d featured artists such as Richard Wilson, Maaretta Jaukkuri, AK Dolven, Shilpa Gupta, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Pradeep Suri, and Vytautas Johannes Lekker.

        " It should be a working knowledge project in itself, a matter of constant experimentation and critical revision. It should invite public participation on an ongoing basis and in unpredictable ways.  The Next Liverpool Biennial: Manifesta 5, by contrast, refers to this process as a \u2018biennale\u2019. Themes developed over the years include: \u2018Authentic\u2019 \u2013 an exploration of contemporary art in its original language; \u2018Relaxed and Relaxed Now\u2019, addressing the newness of the contemporary artist; \u2018Get Back!\u2019, an uplifting song for young artists; and \u2018All My Children\u2019, addressing the concerns and aspirations of older artists.  Manifesta 5 was produced by Liverpool Biennial Trust, a private, not-for-profit organisation. Its mission is to promote contemporary art creation and exhibition through the production of manifesta5, a flexible and approachable program of exhibitions and visual arts education programs. Its output is anchored in the commission of new artworks and in the organization of annual manifesta exhibitions.  Manifesta 5: Automaton offers a different form of engagement. It is not a celebration of art per se, but rather an examination of the individual and the social creation and the self. Manifesta5 explores the self and its relation to the world outside, and the self and the world in which it is constructed. Manifesta5 also looks at the potential of the self and its relation to the world in which it is situated. Manifesta5 organizes cultural and social events in the city where the art is produced and plays a role in the city\u2019s role as it were.

        " Instead of limitation to art, it should be limitless in its pursuit of ideas, its quest for the perfect occasion to be in dialogue with the public. It should be the occasion for art-space, knowledge and debate.  The event should be the occasion for symposiums, presentations and debates across disciplines and sexualityities to be had across the city and its communities. It should be the occasion for specialistised exploration of issues and expressions across cultures and generations.  It should be the occasion for a new and different way of looking at the world and finding its commonalities, its commonalities with Liverpool and the wider world, and its own unique voice.  It should be the occasion for a change in perspective and a new outlook in the direction of inquiry and discovery. It should be the occasion for a change in perception and a new appreciation of the world and its commonalities.  It should be the occasion for a change in consciousness and a new desire to contribute to the world view and the appreciation of the world as a whole.
