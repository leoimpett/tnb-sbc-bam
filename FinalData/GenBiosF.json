From cut papers left by former migrants in the city to promote trade, from local customs officials who wanted to appear professional and progressive to administrators who wanted to appear progressive themselves, the change was thorough and gradual. Yet the changes weren\u2019t made overnight and some of these early portraits still contain traces of the man who invented the badge of trade, proudly displaying a set of new arrivals in a city where \u2018they disappeared\u2019. The first portraits were developed", "Jyana Tandy (b. 1962, Nazilli, Turkey) has an inventive and always highly provocative use of technology. With an inventive and often radical feminist and anti-racist slant, Tandy often pieces together tinned orroids (musicians) with varying personalities and histories, and gives them names. The dolls \u2013 sometimes real and sophisticated machines, like those of Sephardi Jews in the 1950s or the heads of Coca-Cola executives in the current controversy \u2013 often act as metaphors for inner states that are trapped in a lethal logic of adoration and submission. By naming and shaming these dolls, Tandy at once criticises the mechanical silence of the body as well as the routines of the body, which she terms \u2018the manual labor of the brain\u2019. In life, the daily", "Elieen Salgero (b. 1928, La Orotava, Spain) has consistently worked with pen and paper at her mother's insistence since the age of six. As a child Salgero found it awkward locating the paper in the hand, since the other hand often forcibly rejected it. In second grade she began working with the new millennium technologies of the interwebs, developing a set of computer program to locate her mother wherever she went. Salgero later won a scholarship to study painting at the age of 19, moving to New York to pursue her artistic education. ", "Corujo Quaye (b. 1976, Serilingampalle, India) has made a career of painting the city of Perth, Australia into a popular tourist destination. His paintings focus on the natural beauty of the landscape, the people and their everyday lives. Often incorporating elements of reality, his scenes are poetic reconstructions of real events, making us question the way we see the world. As a result of his use of natural materials, his work often contains traces of manipulation, such as earth, sand, leaves, fish and other marine organisms. For International 04, Quaye experimented with fire.  To create the scene for his painting In The Name Of The Child He constructed a replica of a dilapidated dilapendant waterfall in the city centre. This mirrored the existing architecture of the city, and as the story unfolded", "Domitilo Israr (b. 1973, Hy\u00e8res, France) has since his early teens been a member of the Frantz Fanelli/Fanelli-Cottinin/Fanelli/Varej\u00e3o%C3%A99 (Family) dOCUMENTA (2003), composed of three overlapping artists\u2019 families: the Picassos, Hugues and Sternvers. They trace their history back to the Romantic movement in France in the late eighteenth century, when artists such as Honor\u00e9 Daumont and d'Alembert joined forces to create the first art academies in France.

", "Rund Yamazaki (b. 1958, Matosinhos, Portugal) is a photographer whose practice combines storytelling and multimedia creation. His images are always fictional \u2013 usually set in imaginary spaces \u2013 and almost always of unconventional origin: they emerge from the pages of art history or popular culture and spontaneously appear from nowhere else in the canon of documented history. From Nancy Davenport's The Crystal Quilt (1995) to Sarah Bolin\u2019s photoshoots in Focus (2000) and the still lifes of the maquettes in Contemporain (2003), Davenport\u2019s works have real-life analogue in popular culture. But Davenport's works are much darker, more sinister, more conspiratorial \u2013 and more fascinating to watch. His works have a long history of involvement with the art world", "Dnia Marsha (b. 1980, Raymore, United States) lives and works in New York, USA.

Having studied Photography in Cairo and Egypt since 1979, Waineriem\u2019s work reflects his belief that there is a \u2018city without a city\u2019, a void between reality and fiction, reality and fantasy, and a city without a city \u2018hero or villain\u2019. He has shot and documented extensively in this neglected metropolis, documenting life and death struggles between rival warring political factions as they battled for control of the city. His photographs record conflict, but also reveal the brilliance of television, whose depiction of war, repression and horror has been dominant since the 1970s.  Galilee Gr", "Prianti Saavedra (b. 1926, San Salvador Tizatlalli, Mexico) fled persecution and political oppression in her native Central American country of Costa Rica for England in 1971.

He was a Consciousness Builder, a spiritual leader who introduced core beliefs and practices to the public through his blog. ", "Joevanny Meighan (b. 1960, Narbonne, France) is concerned with defining taste via the appropriation of neighbouring cultures while simultaneously challenging accepted culinary paradigms. To that end both his restaurants occupy vacant urban plots and are located in buildings with French Cultural or Neo-Classical influence. The influence of these buildings is evident in the wide variety of materials, techniques and approaches that Meijer employs to achieve his designs. From classic artefacts to contemporary improv shows, from design to performance, from local food traditions to global trends in sustainability, creativity and utopian ideas, Raw Materials showcases a recurring theme in Kaprow\u2019s work.

By linking everyday phenomena such as scarfing, coughing and sneezing with broader themes of marital discord and female subservience, Muldrow unearths the cultural defences provided by her immediate environment. In her film Der K\u00fchne (1999), Muldrow played a role model for battered wives by posing within easy reach an imposing physical category \u2013 a category that simultaneously defended and enslaved the battered woman\u2019s domestic life. In Muldrow\u2019s family, battered wives were not only symbols of female oppression but also symbols of domestic evil.

For Touched, he teamed up with \"\" to create a script which would allow the artist to document the creation of his paintings in situ, rather than restricted to memory.

In his work, the material changes constantly as it deals with the space and time of everyday life. The artist uses this fascination for the sake of spectacle, but also has a cautious cautionary effect, as he carefully evaluates the psychological effects of such an obsession.  In his piece for MADE UP entitled Camera Work (1995), Donovatchckx experimentally tracked the migration of human beings from one place to another: from one body of water to another. The divergent paths represented a perfectly smooth journey, interrupted only by sudden changes in altitude or shortfalls in water level. Altitude, however, was a contentious issue. For some viewers this change of pace might have seemed sudden and unexpected,"]
